Chao Hick Tin J This was an appeal against a decision of the High Court reversing a decision of the district court granting judgment to the plaintiff-appellants against the defendant-respondents in the sum of $15,580, on account of damages suffered by the appellants due to a leak from a chilled water pipe of the airconditioning system of the premises occupied by the appellants. Having heard arguments of the parties we allowed the appeal and restored the decision of the district court. We now give our reasons.
The appellants were the subsidiary proprietors and occupiers of the premises at #04-01 Cold Storage Centrepoint, 176 Orchard Road. The appellants used the premises as a showroom for the sale of pianos. The respondents were the management corporation for the building constituted by the appellants and other subsidiary proprietors under s 33 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1988 Ed) (hereinafter called `the Act`).
On 2 October 1987 there was a leakage of water from the chilled water pipe (the pipe) running just above the false ceiling of the premises. The leak was due to a pin hole that had developed in the pipe. The leak caused damage to the false ceiling and the wall mirrors in the premises. It also damaged a Steinway upright piano model `Z-114`.
The pipe was covered with insulation material which consisted of two inches of rock wool and finished with double-sided aluminium foil. The pipe carried chilled water from the sixth level of the building to the two fan coil units located in the void between the false ceiling and the structural ceiling of the premises. The damaged section of the pipe was replaced soon after the leak occurred.
By this action the appellants claimed damages from the respondents on the grounds of negligence and or breach of statutory duty under s 48 of the Land Titles (Strata) Act. The respondents denied that it was their duty to maintain the pipe and in any case, there was no breach of duty. In the further alternative, the respondents averred that the task of maintaining the chilled-water pipe was delegated to ACBS & Electrical Services Pte Ltd (ACBS), the third party against whom the respondents claimed contribution or indemnity. ACBS were, at the material time, pursuant to a service and maintenance agreement, the maintenance engineers of the airconditioning system of the building.
The district judge found that the maintenance of the pipe did not come within the scope of duties of ACBS and dismissed the respondents` claim against the third party. No appeal to the High Court was made by the respondents against this finding. Therefore, in this appeal, as in the High Court, the claim in the third party notice was no longer in issue.
 District court decision
The district judge held that the respondents owed a duty to the appellants to take reasonable care to ensure that no reasonably foreseen injury/damage would be caused to the appellants. He held that the respondents had the sole management and control of the pipe. As there was no evidence as to the cause of the pin hole, he could not hold that the appellants had proved that the respondents had failed in their common law duty of care. However, he felt that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applied to the case. Furthermore, as the damaged section of the pipe was not retained by the respondents after it was replaced and as no reasonable explanation was given for its non-production, the district judge drew an adverse inference against the respondents under s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). He concluded that as the respondents had not provided any plausible explanation for the leak the respondents had not disproved negligence on their part. As regards the alternative claim under s 48 of the Act, the district judge held that a breach of that provision did not give rise to civil liability.
 High Court decision
In the High Court, the learned judicial commissioner held that the district judge was correct in holding that the appellants had not proved the following particulars of negligence as set out in the statement of claim: 
 
(a) failing to take all reasonable and effective measures whether by inspection, examination or otherwise, to ensure that there was or would be no risk of water ingress to the [appellants`] premises through the burst water pipe or otherwise.
(b) failing reasonably to have foreseen the danger and risk from the water pipe bursting and that extensive damage could or likely to result therefrom. 
(c) failing to take reasonable and proper precautions to prevent the water pipe from bursting and thereby preventing the water ingress in the [appellants`] premises.
 
 
 
However, the learned judicial commissioner held, contrary to that of the district judge, that the respondents did not have the sole management and control of the faulty section of the pipe as the evidence showed that access to that section of the pipe could be obtained through the appellants` premises. No one could get to it without entering the appellants` premises. Having said that, he nevertheless thought that res ipsa loquitur could still apply. He felt it was a question of determining what inference might reasonably be drawn upon an examination of all the evidence.
He went on to hold that as the evidence of the witness for the third party, Teng, showed that there were two possible causes for the pin hole in the pipe, corrosion or manufacturer`s defect, there was no reasonable ground for drawing an inference of negligence against the respondents. He reasoned [See 
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 78
  at p 90]: 
 
If it was corrosion there was no evidence that the pipe had been subjected to some unusual treatment. There was no evidence such as that the test results of the water carried in the pipe were in some respects unsatisfactory. The corrosion was not such as could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care. If it was manufacturer`s defect there was no evidence that the [respondents] ought to have known of it or that there was anything it could reasonably do or ought reasonably to have done ... . It is not for the [respondents] to disprove negligence. It is also not for the [respondents] to furnish a reasonable explanation. The question is whether on the evidence at the end of the case, whether adduced by the [respondents] or the [appellants] or the third party does not matter, the court finds that negligence has been proved by the [appellants].
 
 
 
 
 Appeal
 
While a number of points were raised in the appellants` case to contend that the decision of the learned judicial commissioner was wrong, there were basically two related issues: (i) was the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur applicable in this case?; and (ii) if so, had the respondents rebutted the prima facie case?
In at p 775, this court explained the meaning of that doctrine in these terms: 
 
It seems to us settled law that the principle of res ipsa loquitur is no more than a rule of evidence of which the essence is, as Lord Radcliffe pointed out in that an event, which in the ordinary course of things is more likely than not to have been caused by negligence is by itself evidence of negligence. It would then be for the defendant to rebut the prima facie case.
 
 
 
In the earlier case , Megaw LJ stated the principle thus (at p 1246): 
 
I think it is no more than an exotic, though convenient, phrase to describe what is in essence no more than a common sense approach, not limited by technical rules, to the assessment of the effect of evidence in certain circumstances. It means that a plaintiff prima facie establishes negligence where: (i) it is not possible for him to prove precisely what was the relevant act or omission which set in train the events leading to the accident; but (ii) on the evidence as it stands at the relevant time it is more likely than not that the effective cause of the accident was some act or omission of the defendant or of someone for whom the defendant is responsible, which act or omission constitutes a failure to take proper care for the plaintiff`s safety.
 
 
 
The pertinent facts of the present case were these. The appellants were the owner-occupiers of the premises. There was a leak from the pipe above the false ceiling which caused water to get into the premises and which in turn caused damage. The leak was due to a pin hole in that section of the pipe. The respondents had the sole management and control of the pipe, including that section which leaked. The respondents had the duty to maintain the pipe. While access to the pipe could only be obtained from the premises of the appellants, it was never suggested, nor was it the respondents` case, that the appellants had in any way tampered with that section of the pipe or had allowed anyone else into their premises to tamper with the pipe. It was also not the respondents` case that the pipe could not be maintained at all. In these circumstances we did not see what else could the appellants show. It seemed to us eminently reasonable for the doctrine to apply to shift the burden to the respondents to show how the leak could have occurred without any want of due care on their part.
We turn next to the second issue. Here there was really no relevant evidence at all from the respondents although there was the evidence of Teng, the third party, who said that the pin hole could have been caused by either corrosion or manufacturer`s defect. Teng said that corrosion would be a slow process (due to water acidic content) taking four to five years to cause such a hole. The pipe in question was installed in 1983. By the time of the leak four years had elapsed. He said the normal lifespan of the pipe was between eight to ten years. A pertinent portion of the evidence of Teng was as follows: 
 
Q: Eight to ten years from 1983 would carry you to 1991. Given the fact, is it likely to be due to manufacturer`s fault?
A: I can`t say. 
Q: But given fact it can`t be due to corrosion? 
A: It is possible. 
Q: Assuming that it is caused by corrosion, how long would it take to corrode such a pipe to produce a pin hole? 
A: I would say four to five years. 
Q: So, in other words, the water content of chiller pipe would have to be acidic for four to five years before it would cause such a pin hole? 
A: Yes. 
Q: Are there any ways in your trade to determine the acidity of water? 
A: That will have to be water treatment people.
 
 
 
From Teng`s evidence it was clear that preventive measures could be taken. The chilled water should have been tested periodically and it could also be treated. It was also clear that he could not say whether the pin hole was due to manufacturer`s defect or to corrosion.
But in so far as he was concerned, it was not part of his contractual duties to inspect or check the pipe or to test the chilled water in the pipe.
The respondents only called one witness, Chuah Lam Siang, who told the trial court that the respondents engaged two sub-contractors, ACBS and Nalco, to maintain the airconditioning system. The duties of ACBS have been mentioned above and nothing in this case turned on that. Nalco was a term contractor engaged to carry out chemical test on the chilled water in the pipe. Chuah agreed that Nalco was involved in the maintenance of the airconditioning system of the premises. Chuah also told the court that in addition there were in-house maintenance people who would check the pH level in the water.
Notwithstanding that Nalco was engaged to undertake the testing and treatment of the chilled water in the pipe, no evidence was given by Nalco as to what they did or what could have been the cause of the pin hole in the pipe. Neither was there any evidence to show what were the results of the tests done by the in-house maintenance people. In passing we should mention here that the appellants had wanted to call an expert, Dr Chow Siew Kiang, whose report would have thrown some light on how the pin hole could have been caused. But it was objected to by the respondents.
In the circumstances, it was our opinion that the respondents had failed to rebut the prima facie case. There was no evidence from Nalco to show what were the results of their tests (if any) to determine the acidity of the chilled water in the pipe and what steps, if any, they had taken to prevent corrosion of the pipe. There was also no evidence to show that the cause of the pin hole was more likely to be due to manufacturer`s defect than to corrosion.

The appellant in this case was tried in the subordinate courts on three charges under s 101(2) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276). Each charge alleged that she had caused a vehicle registered for private use to be used as a public service vehicle without there being in force a public service licence in respect of the vehicle. Three other charges under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) were also preferred against her, each alleging that she had caused a motor vehicle to be used when there was not in force in relation to the user of the vehicle a policy of insurance in respect of third party risks. At the conclusion of the trial, the magistrate found the appellant guilty of all six charges. She was fined $1,500 in respect of each of the three charges under the Road Traffic Act; whilst, in respect of the motor insurance charges, she was fined $300 on each charge and disqualified from driving for a year. In addition, the three vehicles which had been the subject of the Road Traffic Act charges were ordered to be forfeited upon the written application of the prosecution, pursuant to s 101(6) of the Act.
The present appeal was brought by the appellant against her three convictions under s 101(2) of the Road Traffic Act. Having heard the submissions of both her counsel and the deputy public prosecutor, I allowed the appeal. My reasons therefor are set out below.
 The facts
The material facts of the case were not disputed by the appellant on appeal. In brief they were as follows. The appellant was arrested as a result of an undercover operation conducted by officers from the Registry of Vehicles (ROV). This was an operation mounted on the basis of information received about the illegal rental of vehicles registered for private use only at the premises of Hiap Hoe Motor Trading at 43 Cuff Road. On 25 June 1993, PW6, an ROV officer, visited the appellant at these premises and asked to rent a motor car. The appellant replied that none of her `SZ` cars was available but that she could rent her private car to him. This offer was accepted by PW6 who proceeded to rent motor car SBD4977K for $370 (inclusive of a $100 deposit), for a rental period of three days. Before leaving, he was warned by the appellant to tell the police that he had borrowed the car from a friend, should the police happen to stop him. PW6 then drove the car away and the appellant was arrested shortly afterwards by the other ROV officers.
Further investigations revealed that the appellant had rented out two other cars registered for private use only. These were SBK9494S and SBE3365C, rented out to PW8 on 10 December 1992 and PW10 on 24 May 1993 respectively. At trial, evidence was led by the prosecution to show that no public service vehicle licence had been issued in respect of any of the three vehicles; and that consequently, having regard to the limitations contained in the insurance policies then in force for the three cars, no insurance policy in respect of third party risks had at the relevant time been present for any of the cars.
At the close of the trial below, defence counsel argued that the prosecution had failed to prove an essential element of the offence under s 101(2) of the Road Traffic Act, namely, that the cars rented out by the appellant had been used as `public service vehicles`. In counsel`s submission, on a literal construction of s 2 of the Road Traffic Act, the following ingredients had to be present before a vehicle could be said to be a `public service vehicle`: firstly, the vehicle must be used or intended to be used for the carriage of passengers; and secondly, such carriage must be for hire or reward. Following from this definition, the three cars hired out by the appellant could not constitute `public service vehicles` since there was no evidence that any of them had been used to carry passengers for hire or reward.
The prosecution, for its part, claimed that the interpretation given to the term `public service vehicle` in s 2 was `
 not definitive 
` and that the cars rented out by the appellant were in fact caught by the definition in s 100(1)e) of `private hire cars`, these being `
 public service vehicles which do not ply for hire on an 
y
 road but are hired under a contract, express or implied, for the use of each such vehicle as a whole. 
` The three cars rented out by the appellant, so the prosecution asserted, had been rented out `
 under a contract, express or implied, for the use of each such vehicle as a whole 
.`
This argument was resisted by defence counsel, who contended that the definition of `private hire cars` in s 100(1)(e) remained subject to the strictures of s 2: in other words, any attempt to show that a vehicle had been rented out as a private hire car would not be complete without proof that the vehicle had been rented out for the use or intended use of carriage of passengers for hire or reward. According to counsel`s submission, the only sort of vehicles which fell within the category of private hire cars would be chauffeur-driven rental vehicles. Where the vehicle hired was driven by the hirer himself and where the hirer/driver did not carry passengers for monetary gain, (the `self-drive car` situation), s 100(1)(e) had no scope of operation because the definition provided of `public service vehicle` in s 2 was not satisfied.
The magistrate below, however, preferred the prosecution`s stance. Although she agreed with defence counsel that, `
 the plain and literal interpretation of [s 2] is that a vehicle must first be used for the carriage of passengers and secondly, the carriage of passengers must be for hire or reward to fall within the meaning of ""public service vehicle"" 
.` She was of the view that if s 100(1)(e) were not to be rendered completely meaningless, `
 it must be taken to have amplified or expanded the meaning of a public service vehicle to include cars rented out as a whole, whether or not chauffeurs are provided 
.` She opined, moreover, that such an amplified construction of the term `public service vehicle` accorded with the intention of Parliament, which was to protect the public interest by `
 ensuring that vehicles offered for hire to the public at large or offered as a means of public transport meet the minimum standards of roadworthiness. 
`
 The present appeal
On appeal the only dispute between the parties concerned the question of whether the cars rented out by the appellant had amounted to `public service vehicles`; in other words, the issue at stake was the construction of ss 2 and 100(1)(e) of the Road Traffic Act.
Section 2 states: 
 
In this Act -
 
 
 
`public service vehicle` means a vehicle used or kept for use for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward, other than a vehicle constructed for use on fixed rails or specially prepared ways ... .
 
 
 
Section 100(1), which appears within that part of the Act headed `Public Service Vehicles` (Part V), then divides `public service vehicles` into eight different classes, one of which is the category listed in sub-s (1)(e) as `private hire cars`. This is the category into which the appellant`s case was said by the prosecution to fall: 
 
private hire cars; that is to say, public service vehicles which do not ply for hire on any road but are hired under a contract, express or implied, for the use of each such vehicle as a whole
 
 
 
 
 A literal construction of ss 2 and 100(1)(e)
 
Before this court, counsel for the appellant reprised the construction of the above provisions which he had put forward as defence counsel in the magistrate`s court. Essentially, he argued that the court should give effect to the literal meaning of the words contained in the two sections, it being a primary rule of statutory construction that `
 the intention of Parliament must be deduced from the language used 
`: at p 61. Adopting a literal construction of s 2, therefore, it seemed clear that in order to qualify as a `public service vehicle`, a vehicle had to be used or intended to be used for the carriage of persons other than the driver of the vehicle himself, remuneration of some sort being payable for such carriage.
This definition of `public service vehicle` was, moreover, plainly meant to be exhaustive, as indicated by the use of the restrictive expression `
 means 
` (`""public service vehicle"" 
 means 
 ...`) rather than the extensive `
 includes 
`: see in this respect Contrary to the magistrate`s view, therefore, no amplification or expansion of the definition in s 2 could be achieved by s 100(1), since this provision really did no more than set out different classes of public service vehicles. Indeed, on appeal the deputy public prosecutor stated (rightly so, in my view) that he wished, with respect, to differ from the magistrate.
From the above, it followed that in order for a vehicle to fall within the description of `private hire car`, it still had to possess the features of a public service vehicle as defined in s 2: that is, it had to be used or kept for use for the carriage of passengers in return for some form of remuneration. The deputy public prosecutor endeavoured valiantly at this point to persuade me that the phrase `
 used or kept for use 
` in s 2 meant merely that the vehicle should be 
 capable 
 of being used for the carriage of passengers for hire or reward. Unfortunately, the argument seemed to me to strain to an unacceptable degree the natural meaning of the phrase. Most if not all motor cars are surely 
 capable 
 of carrying passengers, but whether their owners in fact keep them for such use must be another question altogether.
Having regard to the foregoing, I concurred with the construction put by counsel for the appellant on ss 2 and 100(1)(e) but not without some reluctance; for as counsel himself acknowledged, the resulting scope of s 100(1)(e) became in effect a rather narrow one. Although, contrary to the view of the magistrate below, the description of `private hire cars` therein was not rendered otiose, the only vehicles which came within its ambit would be (as counsel submitted) chauffeur-driven rental vehicles. Where the vehicle in question had been driven by the hirer himself and where no passengers had been carried for hire or reward, that vehicle immediately fell out of the scope of s 100(1)(e). In short, therefore, a literal construction of ss 2 and 100(1)(e) led to the conclusion that `self-drive` rental vehicles of the sort supplied by the appellant could not amount to `public service vehicles`.
 Factors militating against a literal construction
In response to counsel`s arguments, the deputy public prosecutor contended that a scrutiny of the Rules made under the Road Traffic Act revealed the inclusion of `self-drive` rental cars within the class of private hire cars and, accordingly, within the category of public service vehicles. Thus, for example, r 2(1) of the Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Rules contains a definition of the `self-drive` car as `
 a private hire car without a driver provided by the person who holds a licence in respect of such car. 
`
However, as counsel for the appellant noted, r 2(1) of the said Rules expressly begins with the words `
 In these Rules 
 ...`. No provision is made that the definitions contained in r 2(1) should be considered for the purposes of construing the parent Act itself; and in my view it seemed doubtful whether statutory instruments such as the Rules should be used as an aid in the construction of the parent Act. As Maxwell pointed out in his 
 Interpretation of Statutes 
 (12th Ed) p 74, such an approach 
 `if carried to its logical conclusion would result in the judges` abdicating their function of construing statutes to the executive. 
`
Even assuming as a matter of principle that recourse may be had to statutory instruments in cases where the parent Act is ambiguous, in the present case the definition of `public service vehicle` in s 2 of the Road Traffic Act appeared to me to be quite clear. The deputy public prosecutor did not attempt to suggest that there might be some underlying ambiguity to s 2; and wisely so, for any suggestion that ambiguity existed would only have led to the alleged ambiguity being resolved in favour of the person otherwise liable under s 101(2) - in this case, the appellant. Indeed, in view of the draconian penalty prescribed in s 101(6) of forfeiture of an accused`s vehicles, I would have had no hesitation in resolving any obscurity in favour of the appellant, unmeritorious though her conduct might have been. See in this respect , where Lord Esher MR observed at p 638: 
 
If there is a reasonable interpretation which will avoid the penalty in any particular case, we must adopt that construction. If there are two reasonable constructions we must give the more lenient one. That is the settled rule for the construction of penal sections.
 
 
 
It seemed to me, then, that the prosecution in the present case faced an unhappy dilemma. Even if it could have pointed to some ambiguity in the definition of `public service vehicle` in s 2, the penal nature of s 101(2) required that the ambiguity be resolved in favour of the appellant. On the other hand, any reliance on a literal construction of ss 2 and 100(1)(e) led to the conclusion that `self-drive` rental cars of the sort the appellant had rented out did not come within the purview of the Act. No doubt the deputy public prosecutor recognized the quandary, for he urged that, whilst there might be `
 some merits 
` in a literal construction of the relevant provisions, this court would nevertheless `
 do well to adopt a purposive approach 
`; or as Denning LJ put it in , to `` In the present case, the deputy public prosecutor asserted, the intention of Parliament in enacting s 101 and other related provisions in Part V of the Road Traffic Act was clearly to ensure a whole range of regulatory controls over vehicles available for use by the public. A narrow interpretation of s 100(1)(e), which excluded from its scope the large number of `self-drive` rental vehicles currently available to the public, could serve only to defeat Parliament`s intention.
Unfortunately, whilst I agreed with the deputy public prosecutor and with the magistrate below in their perception of the legislative aim behind Part V of the Road Traffic Act, in the present case it would have been possible to give the perceived legislative aim full effect only if one could read s 100(1)(e) to include `self-drive` rental cars; and such an interpretation, as pointed out earlier, was simply not permitted by the definition of `public service vehicle` in s 2. Some degree of gap-filling may indeed exist in the process of statutory interpretation but such gap-filling can hardly be carried out when it does violence to the language of the statutory provision concerned.
 Conclusion
In the final analysis, the prosecution in this case seemed to me to have been the victims of an Act that had failed to keep up with the times. The Road Traffic Act originated as Ordinance 26 of 1961, in an era when `self-drive` rental cars were uncommon in Singapore. The Road Traffic (Public Service Vehicles) Rules, which contain explicit references to `self-drive` cars, were made some 15 years later, in 1976. It would seem that by the time the Rules were made, the executive had come to recognize the existence of a new and potentially large class of rental vehicles over which regulatory control was necessary. Regrettably, however, the legislature had not had occasion to consider the necessity of amending the parent Act so as to encompass `self-drive` rental vehicles in unambiguous terms; and, in the absence of such amending legislation, it did not lie within the jurisdiction of this court to extend the scope of the Act in deliberate disregard of the language used.
I should make one final observation. In this case, the appellant had also been convicted under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act. At the close of the hearing before me, the deputy public prosecutor pointed out that, if the appellant`s convictions under s 101(2) of the Road Traffic Act were to be reversed on the basis that the cars rented out by her had not been used as `public service vehicles`, then her convictions under the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act would by the same token become unsustainable. This was because the convictions under the latter Act were premised on the appellant having caused the cars to be used as public service vehicles whilst they were insured for private use only. In short, the natural construction of ss 2 and 100(1)(e) of the Road Traffic Act had significant consequences for an accused`s corresponding convictions under the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act. Since counsel for the appellant intimated that she did not wish to challenge her convictions under the latter Act, it was not necessary for me to make any ruling thereon. I agreed with the deputy public prosecutor, nevertheless, that this was a most pertinent issue; and certainly another pressing reason for the definition of `public service vehicle` in the Road Traffic Act to be amended with all possible speed.
For the reasons given above, I allowed the appeal.

The plaintiffs claimed against the defendants the sum of $144,136.80 under a letter of credit issued by the defendants` Johari Bazar, Jaipuri Branch, India on the ground that the defendants by reason of their delays were `precluded from claiming that the documents (were) not in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit` within the meaning of art 16(e) of the Uniform Customs and Practice on Documentary Credits (1983 Revision) (ICC Publication No 400), all of which were incorporated by reference to the letter of credit with which this action was related.
Secondly, the plaintiffs claimed the same sum as damages for the defendants` negligence on the basis that in the circumstances of this case the defendants owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs not to issue a bank guarantee, which the defendants did and by reason of which it enabled the buyers of the goods and the applicant of the letter of credit, to take delivery of the goods without the original bills of lading duly endorsed by the plaintiffs.
Thirdly the plaintiffs claimed, under an amendment allowed by this court during the trial, the same sum against the defendants for having wrongfully assisted the carriers in the tort of conversion committed against the plaintiffs. Counsel for the plaintiffs applied for the amendment after a discussion during which this court was satisfied that this cause of action was obviously contained within and was sufficiently self-evident to the defendants; at the end of it all, the merits of the plaintiffs` case must prevail.
At the conclusion of the trial, I gave judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum claimed, interest thereon at 8% pa from 3 January 1986 and one third of the costs of the proceedings on the basis that the plaintiffs failed on their first two causes of action but succeeded, in my judgment, on their claim against the defendants for having wrongfully assisted in the conversion of the plaintiffs` goods. The material facts, nearly all of which (unless otherwise indicated) were set out in a statement of agreed facts, and the reasons for my decision are set out below.
At all times material, the plaintiffs were importers and exporters. The defendants were and are a bank incorporated in India with branches in Singapore and, inter alia, branches in Jaipur and Bilwara, both of which are in India. By an agreement of sale and purchase dated 14 March 1985, the plaintiffs agreed to sell and Jagetia Paper Mills (P) Ltd (Jagetia) also of Jaipur, India agreed to buy 1095 metric tonnes of waste paper `C & F any Indian port (ie Bombay, Bhavangan, Kandla)` at what was agreed between the parties to these proceedings to be the price of $144,136.80. Jagetia undertook to pay by an irrevocable letter of credit to be received by the plaintiffs on or before 30 March 1985.
The plaintiffs eventually received the irrevocable letter of credit dated 4 June 1985 issued by the defendants` Jaipur branch upon the application of Jagetia. The credit of $197,100 was available by negotiation of the plaintiffs` drafts 180 days from the date of the bills of lading `drawn on Jagetia`.
So far as they are material in these proceedings, the documents required by the letter of credit were (1) copy of the cable confirmation to Jagetia evidencing shipment and despatch particulars of the goods to enable Jagetia to arrange their own insurance; and, as required by the special conditions, (2) evidence that shipment had been made through a Conference line. A Conference line is understood to be a carrier by sea which runs a regular liner service and which is a member of an association of carriers plying between ports within a defined geographical region.
In early July, 1985 the plaintiffs shipped the consignment of waste paper by motor vessel `Neptune` under two sets of original bills of lading. At or about the same time, the plaintiffs submitted their application form to their own bankers with instructions to negotiate the letter of credit. On 12 July 1985 the plaintiffs` bankers presented the bills of lading and other shipping documents to the defendants` branch in Singapore. The defendants` branch in Singapore noted that the plaintiffs had not submitted a copy of the plaintiffs` cable confirmation to Jagetia evidencing the shipment and despatch particulars of the goods. They also noted in their bills scrutiny sheets that there was no documentary evidence that motor vessel `Neptune` was a Conference line vessel. The managing director of the plaintiffs, Ramdas s/o Nair (PW1), was informed of these discrepancies. He misunderstood the second discrepancy as requiring shipment by a container vessel, mistaking `Conference` vessel for `Container` vessel. In my view, nothing turned on this. The reason was this. By his written instructions given on behalf of the plaintiffs to the defendants` Singapore branch on or after 13 July 1985 and before 17 July 1985 the plaintiffs had instructed the defendants` Singapore branch to `DHL (the shipping) documents on acceptance basis`. In other words, he was relying on Jagetia`s acceptance of the two sets of documents and Jagetia`s instructions to the defendants` Jaipur branch, as the issuing bank, to accept the documents, even if they were short of the two documents I had mentioned earlier. I further found that the defendants` Singapore branch had neither accepted nor negotiated the plaintiffs` two sets of documents; and that at the highest they had negotiated the documents `on reserve`. What they did was despatching the two sets of documents to their Jaipur branch for `acceptance` by Jagetia. They asked their Jaipur counterpart to advise them of the due date for payment; this was something they would not have done if they had unconditionally accepted the documents. Further, they posted the nett proceeds in a margin account, which was a temporary or suspense account, and had not paid them to the plaintiffs, which they would have done if they had unconditionally accepted the documents for negotiation under the letter of credit.
The plaintiffs had not presented conforming documents. It was transparently clear as a matter of law that the defendants were not liable on their contactual engagement arising out of or under the letter of credit.
Nor was negligence a cause of action known to law. I was convinced that the law of negligence could not be extended to give cover to what was essentially a matter of contract or, in tort, a matter of conversion.
It was beyond dispute that the defendants` Bilwara branch in India had issued a bank guarantee dated 27 July 1985 at the request and in favour of Jagetia which presented the same to the carriers. The carriers delivered the goods to Jagetia on the strength of the guarantee, without requiring Jagetia to produce a set of the original bills of lading. Concurrently, the defendants` Jaipur branch was holding, and purported to hold, the documents as indicia of title for the plaintiffs. By AB31 dated 29 July 1985 UCO Jaipur telexed UCO Singapore to say that they were holding the plaintiffs` shipping documents for the latter`s disposal. At the same time, that branch stated that `consignee (ie Jagetia) requests for delivery of B/L etc.` These two approaches were inconsistent: Jagetia, and the defendants ought to have known it, could not have had the cake and eaten it. There was no answer from the key witness of the defendants (DW2) as to why UCO Jaipur assisted Jagetia in getting at the goods without the bills of lading. In that transaction, I came to the conclusion that the defendants had knowingly assisted Jagetia in depriving the plaintiffs of their goods.
Jagetia`s conduct was quite unwarranted and was wanting in good faith. By their letter D1 Jagetia asked the defendants` branch to stop delivery knowing full well that the carriers` agents had, at their request and against the said guarantee of the defendants, issued to them the delivery order. With the delivery order in hand, Jagetia could collect the goods at any time. By another letter D2 Jagetia claimed there were two discrepancies in the documents tendered under the letter of credit. Both D1 and D2 were dated 30 July 1985. On the evidence, I found that Jagetia took advantage of the situation and refused to pay the plaintiffs for the goods, relying on the discrepancies of the documents. They had use of the goods; they did not pay for them. They had not done so up to the trial of this action. Jagetia could not have done so without the assistance and bank guarantee of the defendants. In issuing the guarantee to the carriers the defendants acknowledged that they were converting the goods of the owners or a party entitled to possession thereof. I found that the defendants had intentionally dealt with the goods which was seriously inconsistent with the possession or right to immediate possession of the plaintiffs. To protect themselves they took an indemnity, in the usual way, from Jagetia. The plaintiffs were irreversibly deprived of their goods. I accordingly gave judgment and applied the general rule that the damages were the value of the goods on the date of conversion. There was hardly any dispute about the value of the goods.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellants, King Fish, are a firm, the proprietor of which is Chan Kim Suan (Chan). In 1981, Chan who has an interest in marine biology got a licence from the Primary Production Department, Singapore, to establish an aquaculture fish farm, designated FC1E, and was given a location in the East Johor Strait (Serangoon Straits) between the island of Pulau Ubin and Singapore Island. The geographical location of FC1E is Latitude 1[deg ] 14.1`N and Longitude 103[deg ] 58.58`E and is better described as being off the coast of Pulau Ubin opposite and to the east of Pulau Ubin village. To the geographical west of FC1E and at a distance of about 1,000 feet is the Pulau Ubin public jetty. Almost opposite FC1E on Singapore Island is the Changi Swimming Club and the Changi Sailing Club and further east along the coast is Changi Point. A regular ferry service runs to and from Changi Point and the public jetty at Pulau Ubin. The route of this ferry service is a straight line between these two points and passes south west of FC1E at a distance of between 700 to 800 feet. To the north side of FC1E is a kelong called Kelong Bobo and to the south side of FC1E is another aquaculture fish farm designated FC3E. The proprietor of FC3E is one Eric Tan Eng Hwee; he gave evidence on behalf of the respondents at the trial. We have made reference to these landmarks as they will feature in our judgment.
FC1E to which we will refer hereafter as `King Fish` has three sectors, each about 200 sq ft, set abreast each other and together aligned south westerly to north easterly, with sector one facing south westerly and sector three facing north easterly. According to Chan`s evidence, sector two, the middle sector, was built first in 1981-1982, sector three was built in 1983 and sector one, the one which we are concerned with, was built in 1983-1984. It is unnecessary to go into the details of construction and how an aquaculture fish farm operates save to say that King Fish is a floating rafted structure built of chenghai wood, known for its strength and durability, whose beams and rafters are joined with bolts and nuts and having a number of cages or cells for holding fish nets where a variety of fish are bred and reared for sale. At the geographical north east corner of sector one there is a superstructure, called the hut, which serves as accommodation for Chan and his helpers when they are on King Fish. Chan himself often sleeps there when he spends the nights on King Fish. The whole of King Fish is kept afloat by floats, some of aluminium, some of plastic and some of fibreglass. Sector one alone has 180-200 such floats. King Fish itself is kept on location by a system of anchors and sinkers of the specifications given by the Fisheries Department.
On the night of 12 October 1985 and the early hours of 13 October 1985 Chan was sleeping in the hut on King Fish when at about 2.35am he was awakened by a storm. In his own words, there was rain, strong wind and a little thunder and lightning. He heard a strong crash and felt a heavy jerk. He looked outside. It was very dark. In the lightning he saw three tug boats tied together ramming the geographical northwest corner of sector one causing it to bob, rising above the water and sinking beneath it. Because of the intensity of the storm he was frightened to go outside the hut. When the storm abated a little in about half an hour he did step outside and saw the three tug boats still tied together hitting the geographical northwest corner of sector one but not as strongly as before. The action of the wind and the waves was pushing the three tug boats against the northwest corner of sector one and moving them round the corner to the north side of sector one, that is the side facing Pulau Ubin. He could see all this in the intermittent flashes of lightning. He would not hazard going out of the hut because it was still very dark and uncertain of his footing not knowing the extent of the damage. He waited for the light to come, by which time the storm had completely abated.
At about 6am, when it was light, Kow Chiang, the nightwatchman, who had spent the night on sector three, joined Chan and together they surveyed the situation. Kow Chiang did not give evidence at the trial but Chan described in his evidence how he and Kow Chiang had secured the three tug boats to the north side of sector one near the hut. He said: 
 
There was one rope from the centre vessel. We used this rope to tie up the boats. Took us about 20 minutes. Rope was already broken. Rope was all twisted - it was thin at the end and thick further down; the ends were open, unlike when rope has been cut, so it had been broken. I used the rest of this rope, about 10 feet, to tie it to my farm. The rope extended from the front keelholding of the centre boat. After this I went to examine the boats and found that they were tied together. Left boat had a small nylon rope about 1/2"" in diameter, with a small anchor at its end. I pulled the rope up (about 25-30 feet) - I think the anchor was attached to the sea bed.
 
 
 
Where the boats were tied to my farm is 21 feet deep. I tied the front of the boat to my farm so the bow was pointing to the right side of sector one.
From all accounts the damage to sector one was concentrated at the geographical north west corner. The planks were loosened and the floats had lost their buoyancy with the result that that part of sector one was submerged. The nets of sector one had been displaced or dislodged resulting in the loss of fish held within the nets.
At about 7am the second respondent, who is the owner of one of three tug boats, in fact of ST 129B which was the middle of the three tug boats tied together, came to King Fish. Chan confronted him and told him what had happened during the storm. The second respondent wanted to take the three tug boats away. Chan objected and said that he could not as he wanted to make a police report and consult his lawyers. The second respondent then left. Chan also left King Fish for Pulau Ubin to make a police report. When he returned to King Fish at about 9am he saw the three tug boats moving away from King Fish under their own steam.
It would be appropriate to mention here that the second and third respondents were partners in the first respondents. The other two tug boats, namely, ST 590 and ST 547 were owned at the material time by the third and first respondents respectively.
The storm referred to by Chan in his evidence was a Sumatra. This was confirmed by Tan Suan Foon, the deputy director (services) of the Meteorological Office, Singapore, who gave evidence for the appellants. He also confirmed that between the hours of 0215 and 0255 on 13 October 1985 there was a Sumatra in the East Johor Strait (Serangoon Straits) with winds between 25-35 kph which could gust up to 50kph coming from the south west of Singapore. In our judgment this would mean that the Sumatra would bear directly on the southwest side of King Fish which we have already observed was aligned southwesterly to northeasterly. As a matter of interest FC3E which we have previously mentioned was similarly aligned. Unfortunately, Mr Tan Suan Foon could not be more specific in his evidence as there is no meteorological station near the Serangoon Straits and Sumatras are so localized, to use his own words, that conditions 10km away could be different, but not very much different. It is useful therefore to refer to an extract from `Climatological Summaries Singapore` which was produced in evidence to get some idea of a Sumatra. It says: 
 
The most significant weather phenomena during the two inter-monsoon periods and the southwest monsoon season is the occurrence of early morning squalls known locally as Sumatras. These storms occur on an average of three to four times per month from April to November. During the inter-monsoon months, they are frequently accompanied by thunder. The storms which generally come anywhere from the northwest to south bring gusty winds frequently in excess of 75km/h, heavy rain, sharp fall in temperature of as much as 8[deg ]C, and a sudden rise in barometric pressure. Visibility reduced to tens of metres in torrential rain with cloud base of less than 60m or 90m is often associated with these storms. On occasions, these storms may form a squall line extending two hundred miles or more in length. However, although the onset of these Sumatras are sudden, adverse weather conditions associated with them seldom persist for more than one or two hours. Sumatras occur most frequently between midnight and about 0900 hours local time.
 
 
 
In our judgment, relying on the unchallenged evidence of Chan, there is no doubt that on 13 October 1985 there was a Sumatra of considerable intensity at about 2.35am coming from the southwest up the East Johor Strait (Serangoon Straits) which affected the surrounds of King Fish.
Accordingly, the appellants commenced this action against the respondents, the owners of the three tug boats in question, for the damage done to King Fish and for the loss of fishes which they alleged was caused by the negligence of the three respondents jointly and severally or of their servants or agents. Extensive particulars of negligence were pleaded. The two most pertinent in the light of the evidence as it unfolded at the trial are the ones that read: 
 
Failing to secure adequately the said tug boats to prevent the breaking loose of the said boats from their moorings so as to avoid the said collision.
 
 
 
and 
 
Failing to man the said tug boats and/or failed to keep any look-out.
 
 
 
The appellants also pleaded particulars of damage to King Fish and by way of special damages claimed $95,365 for the loss of fishes from the 23 cages which they alleged had been emptied when the cages or the fish nets were displaced or dislodged by the alleged collision and $158,687.92 being the cost of repairs of the raft structures of sections one, two and three of King Fish.
The respondents by their defence admitted that the rope of the mooring buoy to which their three tug boats were moored at sea had `parted` at about 2.35am on 13 October 1985 as alleged by the appellants but denied that their tug boats or any one of them had collided with King Fish as alleged by the appellants but contended; 
 
... that the damage to the fish farm (ie to King Fish) ... was caused by support buoys of the floating fish [sic] breaking loose and floating out of the position and/or missing as a result of the parting of the heavily wasted bolts holding the wooden raft platform planking to the brackets on the said buoys. Further the said damage was exacerbated by adverse weather conditions prevailing at the material time.
 
 
 
In the alternative the respondents pleaded that in the event they are found liable for causing the damage to King Fish they would seek to limit their liability to the sum of $10,010.17 under s 295(1)(d)(ii) of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 172, 1970 Ed) (now s 272(1)(d)(ii) of Cap 179). However, at the end of the trial counsel for the respondents informed the court that he will not be seeking to limit liability under the Merchant Shipping Act. This defence therefore is no longer in issue.
It would be convenient to get out of the way, at the very outset, the respondents` contention that the damage to King Fish was due to the parting of the heavily wasted bolts holding the wooden raft platform planking to the brackets of the buoys keeping afloat the wooden raft platform planking during the Sumatra, although this contention was not pursued before us. The respondents were content to resist the appeal on the ground that the appellants had failed to discharge the burden of proof which rested on them to prove on a balance of probabilities that the damage to King Fish was caused by their three tug boats actually coming into contact with King Fish and this was due to the joint and several negligence of the respondents or their servants or agents.
At best the contention of `the heavily wasted bolts` parting from the buoys keeping afloat the wooden raft platform planking of sector one of King Fish during the Sumatra was a theory put forward by the respondents` expert witnesses without any evidence in support of the theory. A careful reading of the evidence of the respondents` expert witness, Richard Hoa Teng Neng, who by training is a chief engineer and naval architect and a licensed marine appraiser shows that he took possession of some steel bolts at the time of his survey of section one of King Fish in October 1985 but was unable to give any evidence at the trial of any tests he may have carried out on these steel bolts of their tensile strength. Furthermore it was in evidence that sector one of King Fish was built in 1983-1984 and that such steel bolts do not require replacement earlier than 10-15 years. The collapse of sector one of King Fish occurred on 13 October 1985 and there was no evidence of a similar collapse of the other sectors of King Fish which were built earlier. The learned trial judge concluded that the `wasted bolts` theory advanced by the respondents was `at best speculative` and quite rightly, in our judgment, the respondents have not sought to pursue this contention further before us.
The meteorological evidence given at the trial, in our judgment, leaves no room for doubt that between the hours of 0215 and 0255 on 13 October 1985 there was a Sumatra of considerable intensity coming from the southwest up the East Johor Strait (Serangoon Straits) which affected the surrounds of King Fish. In our judgment, there can also be no room for doubt that Chan was awoken at about 2.35am by the Sumatra and the heavy jolt he felt and the sound of a `strong crash` he heard and looking out in the direction of the jolt and the sound he saw the three tug boats bouncing off (Chan used the word `ramming`) the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish in the intermittent flashes of lightning. Chan who was cross-examined for seven days was the only eye-witness and in the words of the learned trial judge he withstood his cross-examination `without major self-contradictions, inconsistencies or inherent incredibility`. There is therefore no reason why Chan`s account as stated above should not be accepted as being a true account.
It seems to us that the only blemish in Chan`s evidence was that he was not able to state with any certainty where he saw the three tug boats moored when he arrived at King Fish on 12 October 1985 at about 6pm. All he could say was that they were moored about 500 feet away from King Fish and that was where they were always moored. He had come to King Fish from Loyang Jetty which is further west from Changi Swimming Club on the Singapore side but almost opposite the public jetty at Pulau Ubin. If he went on a straight line course from Loyang Jetty to sector one of King Fish as he said he did in evidence, the public jetty at Pulau Ubin would be on his left. When pressed in cross-examination to mark the location on a plan where the three tug boats were moored he made a mark bearing south southwest from King Fish and to the right of the straight line course he had taken from Loyang Jetty to the sector one of King Fish. The respondents, however, contended that the mooring position of the three tug boats was much nearer to the public jetty at Pulau Ubin and in any event on the left of the straight line course Chan said he took from Loyang Jetty to King Fish. As it turned out the learned trial judge did not accept the location marked by Chan as the mooring position of the three tug boats on 12 October 1985.
In fact neither the respondents nor any one of them or their respective boatmen who actually moored the three tug boats on 12 October 1985 were able to state with any certainty the mooring position of the three tug boats even though they had anchored a mooring buoy at which they would moor their tug boats when not in use. This was because when the three tug boats broke their mooring during the Sumatra on 13 October 1985 they drifted away with the mooring buoy attached to them. All they could do was to point roughly in the expanse of water, a safe distance east of the end of the public jetty at Pulau Ubin as being somewhere near where they had anchored their mooring buoy. We find this surprising as we should have thought that since the respondents had anchored a mooring buoy for regular use to which their tug boats would come to be moored when not in use would have chosen the position to anchor their mooring buoy with some precision by fixing it by taking bearings on two or three landmarks on land in a more seamanlike manner and by reference to such bearing to be able to fix the mooring position of the three tug boats on 12 October 1985 with some degree of certainty. Such was not the case however. Consequently three different positions in the general area of a safe distance east of the end of the public jetty at Pulau Ubin were contended by the respondents are being the mooring position of the three tug boats on the evening of 12 October 1985.
In these circumstances it became a matter of importance at the trial, or so it was thought, to determine with some degree of accuracy the mooring position of the three tug boats on the evening of 12 October 1985 as on that, so the respondents contended, would depend whether or not, given the direction from which the Sumatra was coming, the three tug boats, to use a neutral word, could have drifted to make contact with the geographical north west corner of sector one of King Fish as alleged by Chan. This in turn led to much theorizing by the experts called by the appellants and the respondents and became a contest between them which unnecessarily raged for 44 days in court. It was also contended by the respondents and accepted by the learned trial judge that the evidential burden of fixing, with accuracy, the mooring position of the three tug boats on the evening of 12 October 1985 rested on the appellants.
In our judgment, and with all due respect to the learned trial judge, this was entirely the wrong approach. The appellants` case, both as pleaded and by their evidence in court, was that the three tug boats had drifted in the Sumatra and had collided with the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish thereby causing damage mainly to that part of sector one and the loss of fish. They alleged that the causa causans of the collision was the negligence of the respondents in failing to secure adequately the three tug boats to prevent the breaking loose from their mooring and failing to man the tug boats when moored and failing to keep any look out. It was not the appellants` case, either as pleaded or by their evidence in court, that the three tug boats were moored at the location indicated by Chan in cross-examination and that they broke their mooring in the Sumatra and from there drifted and collided with the geographical north west corner of sector one of King Fish. In fact notwithstanding the welter of expert opinion advanced at the trial it was never explored whether the three tugs would have drifted to the geographical northwest corner of King Fish in the Sumatra had they in fact been moored at the location indicated by Chan in cross-examination. It would be idle for us to speculate on this question but commonsense tell us that as the Sumatra was blowing from the southwest the three tug boats could not have drifted to the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish but probably to the south face of sectors one, two and three of King Fish since King Fish was aligned southwesterly to northeasterly as we have already observed. In our judgment the evidential burden was squarely on the respondents to establish the mooring position of the three tug boats on the evening of 12 October 1985 as it was their pleaded defence and also their defence by their evidence in court that given the direction from which the Sumatra was blowing, southwesterly, the three tug boats after breaking their mooring could not have drifted to the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish from where they were moored but would have drifted past the geographical northwest corner of sector one and collided with Kelong Bobo or would have grounded on the beaches of Pulau Ubin.
The one indisputable fact there was in this case was that Chan was awoken at about 2.35am on 13 October 1985 by the sound of the Sumatra and the jolt and the sound of a crash he felt and heard coming from the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish and looking out saw in the intermittent flashes of lightning the three tug boats `ramming` the geographical northwest corner of sector one. This was Chan`s evidence and this cannot be denied. The learned trial judge accepted Chan as being a credible witness, notwithstanding the lapse in his evidence we have referred to earlier. Chan`s further evidence was that at about 6am when the Sumatra had completely abated and the morning had dawned he had with the help of his nightwatchman, Kow Chiang, pulled the three tug boats, which were still tied together, by the broken rope dangling from the bow of one of the tug boats, round the geographical northwest corner of sector one and had fastened them near the hut at the geographical northeast corner of sector one. This is where the second respondent found the three tug boats when he went to King Fish at about 7am. Despite the robust cross-examination of respondents` counsel that Chan and Kow Chiang could not have achieved this because of the obstructions of the stays and anchor lines of the floats which kept sector one afloat we do not find this evidence of Chan so incredible that it should not have been accepted by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge expressed no opinion on this aspect of Chan`s evidence. It seems to us from a reading of his judgment that he did not doubt Chan`s evidence of having carried out this manoeuvre. The brunt of respondents` counsel`s cross-examination of Chan on this aspect of the matter was to suggest that the three tug boats having drifted past the geographical northwest corner of sector one, as was the respondent`s case, had settled with the tide on to the geographical northeast corner of sector one near the hut and Chan finding them there in the morning had fastened them there, but try as he would, he could not get this admission or concession out of Chan.
We have already observed that the evidence of Chan and that of the second respondent could not be relied on to arrive at a reasonably accurate mooring position of the three tug boats on the evening of 12 October 1985. There was no data available from which the mooring position could be plotted on a map. It was left to the two expert witnesses called by the appellants and the respondents, respectively, to theorize as to where the mooring position of the three tug boats was on the evening of 12 October 1985.
Capt David John Hamnett, the respondents` expert witness was instructed by them on 28 August 1986. In his report which was tendered in evidence he plotted a position referred to as `C` which he said was the position shown to him by the respondents on his visit to the locality on 1 September 1986. It is not clear either from his report or from his evidence which of the respondents showed him this position. We make this observation because the second respondent and one of the respondent`s boatmen who gave evidence, Loh Ah Meng, indicated positions different from `C` in their evidence. The second respondent`s position referred to as `D` was south east of `C` and Loh Ah Meng`s position referred to as `G` was east of `C` and all three positions were in a cluster a safe distance east of the end of the public jetty at Pulau Ubin. On the other hand the third respondent, Iyor Jui Kiang, in his evidence indicated a position far to the south of the cluster `C/D/G` positions. This position is almost at the position calculated by the appellants` expert witness Capt Lau Chye Gin. It is plainly evident to us that had the three tug boats been moored at positions `C`, `D` or `G` and based on the meteorological evidence that the Sumatra was blowing from the south west, the track of the three tug boats would have been north of the geographical north west corner of King Fish by several metres, but if their mooring position was as indicated by the third respondent and Capt Lau Chye Gin, then their track would lead directly to the geographical north west corner and the south west side of sector one.
In dealing with the mooring position of the three tug boats on the evening of 12 October 1985, the learned trial judge said this in his judgment: 
 
All the other witnesses disagreed with Mr Chan as to the mooring position of the tugs. If any of the mooring positions suggested by the defence were to be accepted as the true position, it would mean that the collision would not have occurred at all (at least on the northwest corner as alleged) in view of the evidence as to the wind and tide at the relevant time. The positions suggested by the defence (`C`, `D` and `G`), place the mooring position somewhere along a line to the right of the northeast corner of FC1E (In the terminology used in this judgment, - to the west of the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish). However, given that some defence witnesses identified the position in PB-43 (top) and 2DB-49 (top and bottom) as the mooring position, regard has to be paid to where Captain Lau indicated this position was. Captain Lau`s indication puts the mooring position somewhere to the geographical south of positions `C`, `D` and `G`. Since the tugs were, according to Captain Hamnett, moored in about 27 feet of water, this would again place them slightly south of positions `C`, `D` and `G` (which appear to be in shallower water). The evidence of Mr Eric Tan Eng Hwee (the owner of FC3E) and Mr Loh Ah Meng [obviously the learned trial judge was referring to Iyor Jui Kiang, the third respondent, and not to Loh Ah Meng] on how the boats were moored would also support this more southerly position.
 
 
 
In our judgment the learned trial judge had obviously made a finding on the evidence that he was rejecting the mooring position of the three tug boats on the evening of 12 October 1985 as contended for by Capt Hamnett and was accepting the mooring position as contended for by Capt Lau, although he did not expressly say so in his judgment. Based on this finding the probabilities are that the three tug boats did collide with the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish as Chan had given in evidence.
It seems to us that the learned trial judge was greatly troubled by the lack of evidence of the actual mooring position of the three tug boats on the evening of 12 October 1985 but having read the voluminous record we have no doubt that the passage we have set out above from his judgment correctly analyses the evidence on this question and that the opinion he expressed therein is correct. But as we have already observed it was no part of the appellants` case to fix the mooring position of the three tug boats. The appellants` burden was to prove that a collision did take place as testified by Chan and as we have said the appellants have proved that on the balance of probabilities that a collision did take place as testified by Chan.
The burden of the respondents` defence, once the collapse of the geographical northwest corner of King Fish in the Sumatra due to the `wasted bolts` theory was ruled out, as it was by the learned trial judge, was to prove on a balance of probabilities that the three tug boats drifting in the Sumatra from where they were moored could not have collided with the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish and indeed with any part of King Fish. Thus the evidential burden of establishing with any degree of accuracy the mooring position of the three tug boats was on the respondents. They contended for positions `C`, `D`, `G`. It is clear beyond doubt, and the learned trial judge correctly observed this as seen from the passage of his judgment we have quoted above, that having regard to the meteorological evidence that the Sumatra was blowing from a south westerly direction that the drift of the three tug boats would have been on a north easterly track, in which case they would never have drifted anywhere near King Fish had they been moored at either `C`, `D` or `G`. However, the factual evidence is that the three tug boats did drift on to the geographical north west corner of sector one of King Fish and this could have been possible only if the actual mooring position was further south of positions `C`, `D`, `G` in the location as indicated by the evidence of the third respondent, Iyor Jui Kiang and Tan Eng Hwee, the owner of FC3E who gave evidence for the respondents and as postulated by the appellants` expert witness Capt Lau. It must follow then that the respondents have not proved that positions `C`, `D`, `G` was the mooring position of the three tug boats on 12 October 1985 and accordingly the respondents have failed to make good their defence.
The learned trial judge also seems to have been disturbed by the opinions expressed by the respondents` expert witness, Capt Hamnett, that had the three tug boats in fact collided with the geographical north west corner of sector one of King Fish the damage would have been far greater than shown in the photographs admitted in evidence. This led him, erroneously in our view, to the conclusion that the probabilities were that a collision did not take place as testified by Chan. This is seen from that part of his judgment where he said: 
 
I find the conflicting evidence as to damage inconclusive one way or the other. I am unable to decide, with the necessary degree of certainty, that the damage which has been shown in the photographs was caused by a collision with the tugs. If I believed that it was possible for the tugs to have collided into FC1E on its north west corner, I might have been prepared to recognize that the photographs show some evidence of damage consistent with the collision. However, the difficulty here is that, if there had been a collision, the weight of expert evidence leans towards the view that more severe damage would have resulted than what is shown on the photographs. Captain Lau made a valiant attempt to reconcile the apparently minor damage to FC1E with Mr Chan`s account of the violent collisions which he said he witnessed. While Captain Lau`s view could not be demonstrated to be wrong, my preference would be for the evidence given by the defence experts on this point. On the other hand, I was also not completely persuaded by the defence expert`s suggestions of how the damage shown on the photographs had actually occurred.
 
 
 
In our judgment, these concerns of the learned trial judge were not justified. Firstly, it will be noted that the learned trial judge was prepared to recognize that the photographs showed some evidence of damage consistent with the collision had he believed that it was possible for the three tug boats to have collided with King Fish. We have demonstrated above that on the learned trial judge`s own evaluation of the evidence the probabilities were that a collision did take place as testified by Chan. In our judgment there was no legitimate basis for the learned trial judge to have doubted whether the collision did take place as testified by Chan. Secondly, the learned trial judge seems to have been influenced by the weight of opinion of the respondents` expert witnesses that from the description of the collision given by Chan in his evidence that had there been a collision the damage to sector one of King Fish would be more severe than that shown in the photographs. The fact, if it be a fact, that the damage to King Fish was not as severe as the respondents` expert witnesses would have expected cannot by itself be a valid reason for doubting that the collision did occur when the totality of all the other evidence clearly points to a collision as described by Chan in his evidence. Thirdly, the learned trial judge says that whilst Capt Lau`s view could not be demonstrated to be wrong he preferred the evidence of the respondents` experts although not completely persuaded by their suggestions as to how the damage shown in the photographs had actually occurred. All the theories apart, the simple and straight forward question of fact that fell to be determined in this case was whether the three tug boats did or did not collide with the geographical northwest corner of sector one of King Fish and if they did, whether it was occasioned by the negligence of the respondents. In our judgment the extent of the damage to sector one was an irrelevant consideration to determine the fact of collision. For the re asons we have given the appellants have on the totality of all the relevant evidence we have discussed in this judgment so far clearly proved the fact of collision.
We must now turn to the question of the respondents` negligence. In the conclusion that the learned trial judge had reached that the appellants had not proved their case on a balance of probabilities he did not make any findings on the respondents` negligence as alleged by the appellants. Notwithstanding this and since the question of negligence turns on the adequacy of the mooring arrangements for the three tug boats in the prevailing weather and sea conditions which were reasonably foreseeable and are dealt with in the respective expert`s reports admitted in evidence we feel able to decide this question although we did not see or hear them.
The evidence of the respondents, which was not disputed by the appellants, as to the mooring arrangement of the three tug boats taken from the report of Capt Hamnett was this. The three tug boats were moored together alongside and tied to each other at the bow and stern, all facing the mooring buoy. Tug boat ST 129B was at the centre with tug boat ST 590E on her portside and tug boat ST 547E on her starboard side. Tug boats ST 590E and ST 129B each had a polypropylene rope of 11/2"" diameter and about 20 feet in length leading to a floating mooring buoy. The buoy was anchored at a place where the depth of water was about 27 feet by two 11/2"" diameter polypropylene ropes, one of about 80 feet in length leading to a concrete block sinker weighing one tonne and the other of about 70 feet in length leading to an Admiralty pattern anchor of 300kg in weight. What parted in the Sumatra was the line leading to the concrete block. The respondents admitted to this and also to the fact that the three tug boats were thus moored on the evening of 12 October 1985 and that all three tug boats were left at their mooring unmanned.
Capt Hamnett opined that this mooring arrangement was quite adequate for the time of year in question when squalls or Sumatras may be expected. He was expressly referring to the thickness of the rope rather than the length of the ropes especially from the mooring buoy to the concrete sinker and the anchor on which he did not express any firm opinion. Since it was the rope from the buoy to the concrete sinker that parted, the question arises whether 70 feet (about 21m) for the anchor and 80 feet (about 241/2m) for the concrete block were of sufficient length having regard to the depth of water, namely, 27 feet (about 81/2m).
Capt Lau`s evidence on the thickness of the rope and the length of rope is particularly instructive. He said: 
 
For tug of this size line should be at least 2"" in diameter from tug to buoy. From buoy to sinker or anchor line should be 21/2"" to 3"" in diameter with length of chain at lower end. Length of line is also important. Rule of thumb for anchoring depth of 8m, tugs should have at least 40m of line to sinker. Short line means that force exerted on anchor or line would be vertical. Larger (sic) [we think he meant longer] line give horizontal component, which is important:
 
 
 
(a) it acts as shock absorber;
(b) anchor does not hold vessel in position by weight but by fluke which digs into sea bed at an angle different from force of upward pull of vessel. Horizontal component would mean horizontal pull on fluke which makes it more difficult to dislodge anchor (cf changkol).
 
 
 
Q: Refer DB-17 (`The mooring buoy ...`) For vicinity in question is 20m adequate length for rope?
A: Grossly inadequate. It is only half of what should be used. 
Court: What would upthrust be caused by? 
A: Waves arising from the Sumatra. Because of short length of rope line did not have benefit of length to act as absorber.
 
 
 
On the question of manning the tug boats and keeping a look out, Capt Lau`s evidence was this: 
 
Q: What would you have done in these weather conditions when mooring the three tugs?
A: Weather for that week was getting progressively bad especially on PB 249 (9 October, 10 October, and 11 October) and PB 250 (12 October). Weather was deteriorating. From my training as seaman, I have been told to cast a weather eye - always keep eye on prevailing weather. In this kind of weather prudent seaman would exercise greater care if he were to moor his boats. Additional anchors or mooring lines would be in order and boats must be manned (most important). 
Q: Given weather conditions on morning of 13 October 1985 if one of tugs were manned could effective remedial measures have been taken to avoid accident? 
A: Definitely. When wind freshened they could have started engine of one boat and steered into wind, it would relieve stress on ropes. Even if ropes parted before engine started, with one engine on any tug boat it should be able to steer boats away from fish farms, bearing in mind engines of boats were of sufficient power to tow dumb barges of over 300-500 m/tonnes. So towing other two boats would not be a problem.
 
 
 
We find that Capt Lau`s evidence makes good sense and we accept it. In our judgment the respondents failed to use the proper length of ropes to anchor the concrete block and the anchor. In this, notwithstanding the effect of the Sumatra, they failed to exercise due care and caution in the mooring arrangements and were accordingly negligent. Further the failing to take notice of the prevailing weather conditions which as the meteorological evidence clearly showed was getting progressively worse and by leaving the tug boats unattended overnight or at least by not having a seaman at hand at Pulau Ubin village or even at Changi Point or Loyang so that action may be taken to combat the Sumatra or other adverse weather conditions in a seamanlike manner the respondents also acted without due care and regard for the safety of their own tug boats and others in their near vicinity and in our judgment were also negligent on that score.
In the result, and for the reasons we have given, we will allow this appeal and direct the registrar to assess the damages payable by the respondents to the appellants and to make such orders as to costs thereon as he may deem appropriate in all the circumstances.
The appellants are entitled to their costs both here and below and we so order. Consequentially the appeal deposit will be refunded to the appellants.

The appellants appealed against the sentences imposed on them by the learned judge on their `pleas of guilt` on the charges of gang robbery and armed robbery with which they were respectively charged. We varied the sentences in the manner as appears hereafter and now give our reasons.
Between the months of May and July 1993 there were a spate of robberies committed late at night at various billiard saloons. These appellants were arrested on 7 July 1993 in connection with these robberies. The first to fifth appellants were charged with six counts each of gang robbery, an offence punishable under s 395 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), with imprisonment for a term of not less than five years and not more than 20 years and also punishable with caning with not less than 12 strokes. In respect of four of these counts there was another person who was not apprehended. The sixth and seventh appellants were charged with six counts each of armed robbery, committed with two other persons, an offence punishable under s 392 of the Penal Code read with s 397, that is to say in the circumstances of the charges, the offences being committed after 7pm and before 7am, with imprisonment for a term of not less than three years and not more than 14 years and also punishable with caning with not less than 12 strokes. Section 397 of the Penal Code provides: 
 
If at the time of committing ... robbery, the offender is armed with or uses any deadly weapon ... such offender shall be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes, in addition to any other punishment to which he may be liable under any other section of this Code.
 
 
 
The two other persons who were associated with the sixth and seventh appellants in the six charges of armed robbery with which they were charged, as the statement of facts revealed, were in fact the first and second appellants. All the appellants, except for the first appellant who remained outside the several billiard saloons where the robberies were committed, were armed with parangs at the time of committing the robberies. The first appellant on all occasions was the driver of the `getaway` car.
The mode of operation of the robberies in each case was identical. The appellants engaged in the particular robbery would arrive at the particular billiard saloon in a rented car, driven by the first appellant, normally around midnight, and whilst the first appellant waited in the car the appellants engaged in that particular robbery would rush into the billiard saloon with their faces masked with some form of hood or covering, wielding the parangs with which they were armed and shouting `robbery` in the Hokkien dialect. They would then hustle the persons present in the billiard saloon into a corner, relieve them of any money and valuables they had with them, and make a quick exit. Except in one or two cases no one was hurt and then not seriously, but they were always threatened with the parangs. It was said that during these months the appellants had relieved their victims of money and valuables worth $123,718.70 of which valuables worth $3,878 only had been recovered.
For the purposes of sentencing numerous other charges were taken into consideration, with the consent of each appellant, as follows:
 
 
First appellant: 36 charges of gang robbery under s 395 of Penal Code. 
 
38 charges of robbery under s 392 of Penal Code. 
 
1 charge of fraudulent possession of property under s 35 of Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act (Cap 184, 1990 Ed). 
 
Total 75 charges. 
 
Second appellant: 30 charges of gang robbery under s 395 of Penal Code. 
 
3 charges of armed robbery under ss 392 and 397 of Penal Code. 
 
1 charge of fraudulent possession of property under s 35 of Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. 
 
Total 34 charges. 
 
Third appellant: 30 charges of gang robbery under s 395 of Penal Code. 
 
1 charge of armed robbery under ss 392 and 397 of Penal Code. 
 
Total 31 charges. 
 
Fourth appellant: 30 charges of gang robbery under s 395 of Penal Code. 
 
41 charges of armed robbery under ss 392 and 397 of Penal Code. 
 
1 charge of fraudulent possession of property under s 35 of Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. 
 
Total 72 charges. 
 
Fifth appellant: 29 charges of gang robbery under s 395 of Penal Code. 
 
3 charges of armed robbery under ss 392 and 397 of Penal Code. 
 
1 charge of fraudulent possession of property under s 35 of Miscellaneous Offences (Public Order and Nuisance) Act. 
 
Total 33 charges. 
 
Sixth appellant: 34 charges of armed robbery under ss 392 and 397 of Penal Code. 
 
Seventh appellant: 33 charges of armed robbery under ss 392 and 397 of Penal Code.
  
 
 
The learned judge sentenced the first and second appellants to eight years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on each of the six charges with effect from 7 July 1993 and directed that the sentences were to run consecutively except that the sentence on the third charge would run concurrently with the sentence on the second charge and the sentence on the sixth charge would run concurrently with the sentence on the fifth charge. Accordingly, the first and second appellants would serve a total of 32 years` imprisonment with effect from 7 July 1993 and be subject to 24 strokes of the cane vide s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). He sentenced the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh appellants to six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on each of the six charges with effect from 7 July 1993 and directed that the sentences were to run consecutively except that in the case of the third, fourth and fifth appellants the sentence on the third charge was to run concurrently with the sentence on the second charge and the sentence on the sixth charge was to run concurrently with the sentence on the fifth charge. In the case of the sixth and seventh appellants the sentence on the third charge was to run concurrently with the sentence on the second charge and the sentence on the fifth charge was to run concurrently with the sentence on the fourth charge. Thus the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh appellants would serve a total of 24 years` imprisonment with effect from 7 July 1993 and be subject to 24 strokes of the cane vide s 230 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
At the appeal all the appellants were represented by counsel except for the first appellant who appeared in person. After hearing the first appellant and the submissions of counsel we varied the sentences imposed by the learned judge as follows:
 
 
First and second appellants: We confirmed the sentence of eight years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on each of the six charges with effect from 7 July 1993 imposed by the learned judge but varied it to the extent that the sentence on the fifth charge would run concurrently with the sentences on the first, second and fourth charges while the sentences on the third and sixth charges would run consecutively and consecutively with the sentences on the first, second, fourth and fifth charges which would run concurrently. 
 
Thus the first and second appellants would serve a total of 24 years` imprisonment with effect from 7 July 1993 and be subject to 24 strokes of the cane. 
 
Third and fourth appellants: We reduced the sentence on each of the six charges to five years` imprisonment with effect from 7 July 1993 and confirmed the sentence of 12 strokes of the cane on each of the six charges imposed by the learned judge and further varied it to the extent that the sentence on the fifth charge would run concurrently with the sentences on the first, second and fourth charges while the sentences on the third and sixth charges would run consecutively and consecutively with the sentences on the first, second, fourth and fifth charges which would run concurrently. 
 
Thus the third and fourth appellants would serve a total of 15 years` imprisonment with effect from 7 July 1993 and be subject to 24 strokes of the cane. 
 
Fifth appellant: We confirmed the sentence of six years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on each of the six charges with effect from 7 July 1993 imposed by the learned judge but varied it to the extent that the sentence on the fifth charge would run concurrently with the sentences on first, second and fourth charges while the sentences on the third and sixth charges would run consecutively and consecutively with the sentences on the first, second, fourth and fifth charges which would run concurrently. 
 
Thus the fifth appellant would serve a total of 18 years` imprisonment with effect from 7 July 1993 and be subject to 24 strokes of the cane. 
 
Sixth and seventh appellants: We reduced the sentence on each of the six charges to five years` imprisonment with effect from 7 July 1993 and confirmed the sentence of 12 strokes of the cane on each of the sixth charges imposed by the learned judge and further varied it to the extent that the sentence on the sixth would run concurrently with the sentences on the first, second and fourth charges while the sentences on the third and fifth charges will run consecutively and consecutively with the sentences on the first, second, fourth and sixth charges which will run concurrently. 
 
Thus the sixth and seventh appellants would serve a total of 15 years` imprisonment with effect from 7 July 1993 and be subject to 24 strokes of the cane.
  
 
 
The learned judge addressed the question of sentencing as follows: 
 
Much of the mitigation plea on behalf of the first accused, and indeed in respect of the other accused by their counsel, laid stress on their background, the family background, broken marriages of parents, and of social and economic handicaps in life. Whilst I have listened to those submissions patiently, I cannot, in the context of society today, the prospects of employment and other opportunities, give undue weight to facts as had been highlighted by counsel. I will, of course, give weight to the fact that each of them pleaded guilty. Though pleading guilty must be given effect to in determining sentence, it would depend on the facts of each and every case.
 
 
 
I have also distinguished between the accused persons so far as age is concerned. I have taken note that the first accused, whom I have already said is now 33 years old, was 31 when he committed the offence; the second accused, Soong, now 26 years of age, was 25 when he committed the offence.
As for the others, they are much younger, approximately now 18 years of age, give and take the months that make the difference.
I also have taken note of what accused`s counsel have said, that they did not personally cause hurt to the victims. Counsel have said violence was minimal. However, the fact is they all went armed with parangs; they all threatened and put to fear those persons who were in the billiard saloons; and if one of them causes hurt, then under our law each and every one of them will be held equally responsible.
Some point has been made that the third and fourth accused are first offenders. But in the context of the facts to which they admitted, in the circumstances of the case, I am not prepared to make a distinction of these two accused persons in relation to sentence which I shall shortly come to.
... The way I have assessed sentence is to consider what is the appropriate sentence for the offences to which they have pleaded guilty and the other charges which they have asked me to take into consideration. Next, in relation to each of the charges I have separated the sentences in relation to the different places the accused persons had been to as stated in the six charges. As the DPP had said, there were 15 different locations and 16 gang robberies were committed.
The learned judge then said: 
 
Together, bearing in mind an appropriate aggregate, I make four of the charges consecutive.
 
 
 
And imposed the sentences referred to earlier in this judgment, the effect of which was that the first and second appellants would serve a total of 32 years` imprisonment and the third to the seventh appellants would serve a total of 24 years` imprisonment. The sentences of canning were not in issue.
Counsel submitted that the learned judge had misdirected himself on the sentencing principles that ought to have governed the sentencing of the appellants having regard to all the facts and circumstances relevant to all the appellants in general and to each individual appellant in particular. It was contended that he had not given sufficient consideration to what has been called the `totality principle` and that he had given undue importance to the large number of offences each appellant had asked to be taken into account and, although he had in mind `an appropriate aggregate`, the making of the sentences of four of the charges to run consecutively had resulted in imposing `crushing sentences` on the appellants; that he had erred in not discriminating between those of the appellants who had no previous criminal antecedents from those appellants who had; that although he had indicated that the appellants` pleas of guilt were mitigating factors had not in fact given any or due consideration thereto; and that he had given no consideration to the mitigation pleas that were made on the appellants` behalf. Lastly, that he failed to recognize and give effect to the difference in the legislative minimum and maximum sentences for gang robbery and armed robbery in sentencing the sixth and seventh appellants.
It is a generally recognized principle of sentencing that factors peculiar to the offender may either aggravate or mitigate the commission of an offence which will justify the imposition of a sentence above or below what might otherwise be considered an appropriate sentence for that particular offence. What are aggravating factors and what are mitigating factors in relation to a particular type of offence are matters for the sentencer. It was evident to us that the learned judge weighed the factors in mitigation espoused against the aggravating factors of the appellants being armed with parangs and threatening fear to their victims and came to the conclusion that the latter far outweighed the former. We did not find it surprising that the learned judge was not moved by the mitigation pleas of `social and economic hardships in life` in the context of our society of today `with the prospects of employment and other opportunities` it offers. In our judgment it was difficult to imagine what mitigation there can be for gang and armed robbery in our present day society.
The mitigation of a plea of guilty is another matter. However, there is a misconception that must be dispelled. It is not axiomatic that every plea of guilty `entitles`, as it was contended by counsel to a discount of between one-quarter to one-third of what might otherwise be considered an appropriate sentence after a trial. A plea of guilt can be of no mitigating value, for example, when the evidence overwhelmingly supports a conviction. As Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) said in (cited with approval by this court in ). 
 
... the voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilty by him in court are factors that can be taken into account in mitigation as they may be evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept punishment for his wrongdoing. However, I think that their relevance and the weight to be placed on them must depend on the circumstances of each case. I do not see any mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the police after he is surrounded and has no means of escape, or much mitigation value in a professional man turning himself in in the face of absolute knowledge that the game is up.
 
 
 
In our judgment the learned judge`s observation that `though pleading guilty must be given effect to in determining sentence, it must depend on the facts of each and every case` is perfectly proper and correct. For example, in a rape case, where the trauma of the victim having to recount in evidence the rape is saved, a plea of guilty might be considered as justifying an appropriate discount to the sentence that might have been passed after a trial. But there is always the public interest element to be considered. As Lord Lane observed in the case of at p 184: 
 
But there are certain exceptions, likewise well authenticated in the authorities, to that general rule that discount will be allowed for a plea of guilty. The first and most important exception is the protection of the public. Where it is necessary that a long sentence, if necessary the maximum sentence, should be passed in order to protect the public, in those circumstances a plea of guilty may not result in any discount.
 
 
 
The learned judge did not in fact give any discount for the appellants` pleas of guilt although he recognized the existence of the rule. In our judgment the appellants did not merit any such discount in the circumstances of this case and particularly so having regard to the public interest element.
In sentencing the appellants the learned judge, it seemed to us, made no distinction of the fact that the first to the fifth appellants who were charged with gang robbery were subject to a minimum custodial sentence of five years with the maximum of 20 years whereas the sixth and seventh appellants who were charged with armed robbery were subject to a minimum custodial sentence of three years with the maximum of 14 years. This was not right. Both groups were armed with parangs, both groups carried out the robberies in exactly the same manner and both groups were led by the same persons, namely the first and second appellants. But the first to the fifth appellants were charged with gang robbery as opposed to the sixth and seventh appellants who were charged with armed robbery. Despite that all seven appellants were charged together for the purposes of taking their pleas, there was no reason to have treated the sixth and seventh appellants in exactly the same manner as the third to the fifth appellants were. The proportional difference in the legislative minimum and maximum sentences for gang robbery and armed robbery should have been maintained in arriving at the appropriate sentence for the sixth and seventh appellants. Thus, the sentences imposed by the learned judge of eight years` imprisonment for each of the offences the first and second appellants were charged with and six years` imprisonment for each of the offences the third to the fifth appellants were charged with were in our view the appropriate sentences for them. The difference of two years in the sentences of the first and second appellants to that of the sentences imposed on the third to the fifth appellants was also, in our view, appropriate having regard to the fact that the first and second appellants were much older (approximately 31 and 25 years respectively at the time of the offences) than the other appellants (whose ages were around 18 years at the time of the offences) and were considered by the learned judge, and rightly in our view, as the leaders of the much younger appellants in these robberies. In our judgment the appropriate custodial sentence for the sixth and seventh appellants, having regard to the fact that they had previous criminal antecedents as juveniles, would have been five years and not the six years the learned judge imposed on them.
In two important aspects we disagreed with the learned judge.
In our judgment where two or more persons are charged or tried together for the same or similar offences and all other things being equal some have previous criminal antecedents and the others do not, sentencing policy and indeed justice requires that those who do not have previous criminal antecedents should carry a lesser sentence than those with previous criminal antecedents. It has been said that there is nothing to prevent the court from imposing a range of sentences on accused persons who are charged jointly or are tried together for the same or similar offences if there are important considerations for doing so. Surely the fact that the third and fourth appellants had no previous criminal antecedents as opposed to the fifth appellant who was convicted of two counts of theft of motor vehicles under s 379(a) of the Penal Code and sentenced to two years` probation in 1988 justified a disparity in the sentences imposed on these three appellants. The learned judge, with respect, was wrong to have refused to consider this aspect of the matter.
It was for this reason that we reduced the custodial sentences passed on the third and fourth appellants to five years and left undisturbed the term of imprisonment of six years imposed on the fifth appellant.
At first sight the number of charges taken into account in respect of each of the appellants appeared daunting. However, each charge was in respect of a single individual who was robbed at the same time as the robbery of the individual in one or the other of the six charges with which each of the appellants were charged with and to which each of the appellants pleaded guilty. We saw no reason why in these circumstances the `one transaction rule` should not be applied.
But the learned judge was obviously disturbed by the number of the charges to be taken into account and bearing in mind no doubt s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code which required him, in the circumstances of this case, to order that the sentences for at least two of the charges must run consecutively turned his mind `to an appropriate aggregate` and unhesitatingly ordered that the sentences on four of the charges should run consecutively. In doing so he offended the `totality principle`. The application of the `totality principle` in relation to s 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code was explained by Yong Pung How CJ in delivering this court`s judgment in at p 84 in these terms: 
 
The sentencing direction given to the courts by virtue of s 18 is governed by the use of the verb `shall` and, as there is nothing in the context of the section to suggest that the prima facie effect of the use of that verb can be departed from, we were of the view that the direction is a mandatory one. We were supported in our view by the consideration that it is only if it operates as a mandatory direction that effect can be given to the clear legislative intention, implicit in the wording of the section, that offenders convicted of multiple offences at one trial ought to be more severely punished than offenders convicted of less than three distinct offences.
 
 
 
It should be observed, however, that the direction contained in s 18 is limited. The direction only requires that, at least two of the sentences imposed must run consecutively. The legislature has chosen to remain silent as to which of the sentences should run consecutively, and the sentencing court has been left with a discretion on this question. In our view, the sentencing court, when exercising its discretion, ought to have regard to the common law principles of sentencing applicable to the imposition of consecutive sentences, namely, the one transaction rule and the totality principle.
It seems to us that the learned judge took a broad approach as, in the exercise of his discretion, he chose to make the sentences on four of the charges to run consecutively. In doing so he must have considered that 32 years and 24 years respectively were not too high. Yong Pung How CJ addressing the `broad approach` in continued: 
 
Useful as the broad approach may be, we were of the opinion that it should, in appropriate circumstances, be further analyzed. In this respect, we support the view of DA Thomas in (2nd Ed) that the principle has two limbs. The learned author stated (at pp 57-58):
 
 
 
`The many decisions of the court in which the totality principle has been applied to explain the reduction of a cumulative sentence made up of correctly calculated individual parts suggest that the principle has two limbs. A cumulative sentence may offend the totality principle if the aggregate sentence is substantially above the normal level of sentences for the most serious of the individual offences involved, or if its effect is to impose on the offender `a crushing sentence` not in keeping with his records and prospects.`
 
 
 
The above passage has received approval of the High Court of Singapore in . However, the first limb of the principle needs to be qualified in its application in Singapore where s 18 of the CPC is applicable. The following hypothetical example illustrates this: a public servant is convicted at one trial of four distinct charges of criminal breach of trust and is sentenced to six years` imprisonment on each charge. Section 18 requires the sentencing court to make at least two of the four terms run consecutively. This means that the offender will serve at least 12 years yet the statutory limit of 10 years imposed by s 409 of the Code means that the first limb of the totality principle is breached. To give full effect to the totality principle in such circumstances would be to frustrate the purpose of s 18 and, accordingly, the first limb of the principle has to be qualified. We note that the English courts have also departed from the full effect of the first limb of the principle in appropriate cases even though they are not bound by any equivalent of s 18 of our CPC: see (op cit, at p 59, and the cases cited at fn 1).
 
 
 
In this case the aggregate sentences imposed on the first and second appellants exceeded the maximum sentence permitted by s 395 of the Penal Code by more than half. By any standards this was a severely crushing sentence and could not be justified. The sentences had to be alleviated and yet kept in proportionate relationship with the sentences on the other appellants. This we achieved by varying the sentences in the manner already stated in this judgment.",1995-01-04 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

Need to protect public interest
 
The appellant pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to a charge under s 380 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). Having been sentenced to six months` imprisonment, he appealed to this court against the sentence. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons in writing.
 The facts
The charge against the appellant alleged that on 10 October 1993, he stole four packets of `Energizer` AA-sized dry cell batteries valued at $20.80 from Toa Payoh NTUC Supermarket. It appeared that whilst browsing at the supermarket, the appellant removed the batteries from a display rack and put them in his trouser pockets. A member of the supermarket staff observed him doing so and subsequently accosted him in the car park of the supermarket. After surrendering the batteries, the appellant was taken to the police station.
In the court below, the appellant pleaded guilty to the charge against him and was convicted accordingly. For sentencing purposes, the court was informed of the appellant`s antecedents, whereupon it was revealed that he had since 1985 been convicted of theft under s 380 of the Penal Code on no less than eight occasions. The odd feature, of course, was that on every occasion the items stolen were batteries. In respect of his first conviction, the appellant had been sentenced to one day`s imprisonment and a $500 fine. Since then the sentences had usually consisted of one day`s imprisonment together with a $2,000 fine, save for a conviction in 1987 in respect of which he was sentenced to two months` imprisonment.
A written plea in mitigation was presented on the appellant`s behalf by his counsel below. It informed the court that the appellant was married with three children and that he ran his own advertising agency. For the most part, however, it concentrated on the appellant`s history of depressive illness. Counsel attached to his mitigation plea three reports by consultant psychiatrist Dr Ang Peng Chye which stated that the appellant had been receiving treatment and counselling (although not continuously) from Dr Ang since January 1988. In Dr Ang`s opinion, the appellant suffered from depression which, when particularly acute during periods of personal stress, created in him an `
 urge to shoplift 
`. He stole only batteries because they represented to him a certain childhood deprivation, stemming from his mother`s refusal, when he was a child, to provide him with batteries with which to operate his toys. When caught in the act of shoplifting, he invariably expressed contrition, which sentiment, unfortunately, appeared to persist only until his next bout of depression.
The above factors were given due consideration by the district judge who agreed that the appellant was not a `
 criminal 
` in the ordinary sense of the word. On the other hand, so the district judge opined, the appellant could not be allowed to commit theft whenever he fell into a depressive state; and it was in the public interest that his freedom of movement be curtailed so long as he found himself unable to resist the urge to steal. Accordingly the district judge sentenced the appellant to six months` imprisonment.
 The present appeal
On appeal it was argued that the sentence imposed was `
 manifestly excessive 
`. In particular the appellant`s history of depression was canvassed once more and it was urged upon this court that a custodial sentence would serve no worthy purpose in his case because he had committed the present offence as well as the previous offences `
 out of impulse 
`. It was contended, therefore, that in the interests of rehabilitating the appellant and obviating the occurrence of further thefts, the court should order instead a conditional discharge, whilst attaching a requirement that the appellant receive medical treatment for a period of three years.
Having considered the circumstances of the appellant`s case, however, I could not agree with the above submissions. Certainly the rehabilitation of offenders constitutes one of the objectives by which a court is guided in passing sentence. It is as a corollary of this that the courts retain the discretion to decide the appropriateness of a rehabilitative sentence (such as probation) in any individual case. In virtually every case in which probation or a conditional discharge is asked for by an accused person, remorse is professed; reformation is promised. Yet, plainly, such assurances by themselves cannot form the sole basis on which a decision as to the suitability of a rehabilitative sentence is made. The court must take into account various other factors including evidence of the accused`s previous response to attempts at rehabilitating him. Thus, for example, all things being equal, a court will be far more disinclined to order probation in the case of an accused who has in the past flouted with impunity the conditions imposed by a probation order.
In the present case, the appellant suffered from bouts of depression which induced in him (so it would appear) a form of kleptomania. In respect of these symptoms he had been receiving medical attention since January 1988, after his fourth conviction for theft under s 380 of the Penal Code. Despite this, four similar convictions (not including the present) followed with a disturbing regularity. It appeared to me that no particular effort had been made by the appellant to exercise self-restraint over his recurring impulse to steal or, for that matter, to seek more extensive counselling and treatment. I could feel no great optimism, therefore, that a conditional discharge in the present case, even coupled with a requirement that the appellant receive medical attention, would achieve salutary results in his rehabilitation.
Moreover, as the district judge pointed out, the demands of public interest must also be weighed in the balance. If our criminal law is to have any protective ambit over the lives of ordinary citizens, persons such as the appellant cannot be allowed to deal with their personal problems by giving vent to their kleptomaniac tendencies with abandon; or indeed, by resorting to any other form of crime. I agreed, therefore, with the district judge`s view that: 
 
So long as [the appellant] is not able to stop himself from committing thefts he cannot be allowed to have freedom of movement to keep on committing thefts.
 
 
 
Having regard to the foregoing reasons and having also considered with care the appellant`s family circumstances, I was of the opinion that no merit lay in his appeal against sentence. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal.

s 33(1) Moneylenders Act (Cap 188)
 
The respondent in this case faced two charges under the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188) (the Act) in the subordinate courts. The first charge, brought under s 33(1) of the Act, alleged that he had, sometime in the month of December 1993 at Blk 185 Boon Lay Drive #11-144 Singapore, acted `as a moneylender to harass one Maimah bte Wahab [the complainant], to wit, by knocking the door of the said flat and making telephone calls asking for Mohamed Amin bin Buang, the husband of Maimah bte Wahab to pay his debt.` The second charge, brought under s 8 of the Act, alleged that the respondent had, sometime in the month of October 1993 at Keppel Golf Club, Bukit Chermin Drive, Singapore, carried on a moneylending business without holding a licence to carry on such a business.
The respondent initially claimed trial to both charges but subsequently elected to plead guilty after the close of the prosecution case. Having heard the plea of mitigation made by defence counsel and having also considered the prosecution`s submissions in favour of a deterrent sentence, the district judge imposed on the respondent a fine of $8,000 (in default four months` imprisonment) in respect of the charge under s 33(1) and another fine of $4,000 (in default two months` imprisonment) in respect of the charge under s 8. This appeal was brought by the prosecution against the sentence imposed in respect of the first charge.
The main thrust of the prosecution`s arguments on appeal centred on the need to safeguard the public interest, which aim, so the deputy public prosecutor submitted, had not been accorded adequate consideration in the court below. He pointed out that between 1991 and 1992, there had been a drastic increase of over 100% in the number of offences committed under the Moneylenders Act. In 1993, amendments were made to the Moneylenders Act which stipulated, inter alia, enhanced punishment for various offences under the Act. These included offences created by ss 8 and 33 of the Act, the provisions under which the respondent was charged in the present case. These amendments indicated, in the deputy public prosecutor`s submissions, the stern attitude of the legislature towards the rising number of illegal moneylenders whose rapacity garnered profits out of the unhappy needs of other citizens.
Counsel for the respondent countered by pointing out that the amended s 33(1) gave the courts a certain latitude in terms of the punishment it was open to them to mete out. In itself, however, this argument did not take the respondent`s case very far. The relatively broad parameters set for the punishment to which an accused is liable under this section do not in any way exempt the courts from their obligation to accord grave consideration to the demands of public interest when deciding on the appropriate sentence in any individual case.
Counsel then attempted to suggest that the definition of `harassment` itself posed a complicated question of law, especially in the respondent`s case which, in counsel`s submissions, constituted a borderline case, it being doubtful whether a single visit to the complainant`s home could constitute `harassment`, even if followed by a number of menacing telephone calls. In my view, however, the fallacy in counsel`s argument lay in his attempt to isolate the respondent`s visit to the complainant`s home from his subsequent telephone calls to the complainant. Both the visit and the telephone calls were part of a threatening course of conduct which had as its aim the demand for repayment of the debt due from the complainant`s husband and which caused alarm and distress to the complainant. In the circumstances I did not see how it could sensibly be said that there was doubt as to whether the respondent had `harassed` the complainant.
I agreed also with the deputy public prosecutor`s submission that the respondent`s case featured the very sort of antisocial conduct the amended Moneylenders Act was designed to eradicate; and that having regard to the demands of public interest, punishment more severe than an $8,000 fine should have been imposed. In view of the respondent`s status as a first-time offender, however, as well as his apparent efforts to establish a more regular way of life after his arrest, I refrained from imposing a custodial sentence on this occasion and ordered instead that he pay a far stiffer fine of $12,000 (in default six months` imprisonment).

On 11 May 1989, the appellant was convicted in the High Court with two others, Kumar a/l Nadison and Chandran a/l Gangatharan, on a joint charge of committing the murder of one Samynathan Pawathai @ Chelia Dorai on 28 April 1985, whilst being members of a common assembly, contrary to s 149 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code [CC 13/86]. They were sentenced to death. Their appeals against conviction (vide Crim App 9/89) were dismissed by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 25 April 1991.
On the eve of the scheduled date of execution on 11 November 1994, the appellant filed an ex parte originating summons seeking a stay of execution of the death sentence and a declaration that it would be unconstitutional and unlawful to execute the appellant, in view of the time period which had elapsed since his conviction.
The urgent application was heard on the same day by Kan Ting Chiu J. Having heard submissions from both counsel for the appellant and the Public Prosecutor, he dismissed the application. Following the dismissal of the application in the High Court, the appellant sought a respite of the execution from the President. A respite of the warrant of execution was allowed pending the filing of an appeal against the decision of the High Court. The notice of appeal to this court was filed on 2 December 1994. On 16 December 1994, the Public Prosecutor obtained leave to expedite the hearing of this appeal.
Having heard the appeal, we were of the unanimous view that it had no merit and we accordingly dismissed it. We now give our reasons.

 The application in the High Court
 
At the date of filing of the originating summons, the appellant had been on death-row for about five years and six months from the date he was convicted in the High Court and three years and six months since the dismissal of his appeal against conviction.
It was argued in the court below that the period of five years and six months from the date of conviction amounted to a prolonged delay, and that it would be cruel and inhuman punishment to carry out the execution now. It was contended that, if the death sentence was carried out, art 9(1) of the Constitution would be breached: 
 
No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law.
 
 
 
Counsel argued that the execution of the sentence of death must be `in accordance with the law` and this entailed a right not to be subjected to a prolonged period of imprisonment. He relied on the recent ruling of the Privy Council in , where a judicial committee of seven Law Lords allowed an appeal by two prisoners under sentence of death since 1979 for a declaration that it would be inhuman or degrading punishment and treatment to carry out the execution of the sentence. The Privy Council commuted the death sentences imposed on the appellants to that of life imprisonment.
The facts of were as follows. The two appellants were arrested for a murder committed in October 1977 and were convicted and sentenced to death in January 1979. The appellants applied for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal of Jamaica within three days of their conviction but the application was only heard and dismissed in December 1980. This delay was apparently due to a delay in obtaining legal aid. The appellants then sought to appeal to the Privy Council but the reasons for the dismissal of leave by the Court of Appeal were only given almost four years later in September 1984. This was apparently the result of the files of the case being misplaced and the case being inadvertently forgotten.
Under the Jamaican (Constitution) Order in Council 1962, when an appeal against conviction in a capital case is dismissed, the Governor General is obliged to refer the case to the Jamaican Privy Council (the JPC), so that the JPC can advise him whether or not the appellants ought to be executed or be granted a commutation of sentence. No such reference was made when leave to appeal was not given. Evidence was given that, in practice, a reference to the Governor General and the JPC was not made until an appeal to the Privy Council, if made, was decided.
In the meantime, in June 1981, Pratt, the first appellant, petitioned the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (the IACHR), on the basis that his trial was unfair. It was only in October 1984 that the IACHR dismissed his petition but recommended that the sentence be commuted on humanitarian grounds. Further representations were made by Pratt to the IACHR. Pratt also petitioned the United Nations Human Rights Committee (the UNHRC) under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in January 1986.
Although the reasons of the Court of Appeal were given in September 1984, it was not until March 1986 that the appellants lodged a notice of intention to petition for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council. This application was heard and refused by the Privy Council in July 1986. At about the same time, the UNHRC requested Jamaica not to execute the appellants until it had considered whether the petition of the appellants was admissible. As a result of this request, the case finally came before the JPC for the first time in November 1986. They refused to accede to the request of the UNHRC and issued a warrant for execution on 24 February 1987. On the eve of the scheduled execution, the Governor General issued a stay of execution pending the consideration of the case by the IACHR and the UNHRC in March 1987.
In July 1987, after further submissions, the IACHR ruled that the delay of the Court of Appeal in issuing its reasons amounted to `cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment,` in violation of the American Convention of Human Rights, and requested the commutation of sentence for humanitarian reasons. The JPC reconsidered the case but rejected the IACHR`s request and issued a second warrant for execution on 1 March 1988. On 29 February 1988, the Governor-General again issued a stay of execution, apparently due to another request by the UNHRC.
The UNHRC finally decided in March 1988 that the appellant`s case was admissible and requested Jamaica not to carry out execution until they had reviewed the merits of the case. In April 1989, the UNHRC delivered its decision on the merits and recommended the commutation of the sentences. It held that the failure of the Court of Appeal to deliver its reasons for 45 months amounted to a violation of art 14 para 3(c) and art 14 para 5 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights with Optional Protocol: 
 
3 In the determination of any criminal charge against him, everyone shall be entitled to the following minimum guarantees, in full equality ... 
(c) to be tried without undue delay
 
 
 
5 Everyone convicted of a crime shall have the right to his conviction and sentence being reviewed by a higher tribunal according to law.
 
 
 
However, as was subsequently pointed out by Lord Griffiths in his opinion, it appeared that the two Human Rights bodies misunderstood the procedure for applying for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Although the reasons of the Court of Appeal were necessary for the purpose of identifying the points of law in contention, it was not a condition precedent to the lodging of an application.
The UNHRC also held that the delay in notifying the appellants of the stay of execution on February 1987 until some 45 minutes before the scheduled time of execution was in violation of art 7 of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights with Optional Protocol: 
 
No one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. In particular, no one shall be subjected without his free consent to medical or scientific experimentation.
 
 
 
In any event, it was only in September 1990 that the JPC rejected the UNHRC findings. In February 1991, a third warrant for execution was issued for execution on 7 March 1991. Subsequently, the appellants applied under s 25 of the Constitution of Jamaica to the Supreme Court, which empowered the Supreme Court to provide redress for an alleged contravention of the Constitution, alleging that to hang them after so many years in prison would be inhuman and in breach of s 17 of the Constitution: 
 
(1) No person shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment.
(2) Nothing contained in or done under the authority of any law shall be held to be inconsistent with or in contravention of this section to the extent that the law in question authorises the infliction of any description of punishment which was lawful in Jamaica immediately before the appointed date.
 
 
 
The Supreme Court of Jamaica dismissed the application in June 1991. In June 1992, the appeal to the Court of Appeal was also dismissed. The matter finally came before the Privy Council in June 1993.
In determining the issues, the Privy Council was confronted with the majority opinion in . In 
 Riley 
, the appellants were convicted of murder and sentenced to death on various dates between March 1975 and March 1976. Their appeals were dismissed in the period between February 1976 and January 1977. Between April 1976 and January 1979, a political controversy arose with respect to the retention of the death penalty in Jamaica and, as a result, the execution of death sentences was suspended. The matter was resolved when the Jamaican House of Representatives voted to retain it and, in May and June 1979, warrants for execution of the appellants were issued. The appellants applied to the Jamaican Supreme Court for a declaration that prolonged delay of their execution infringed their rights under s 17(1) of the Jamaican Constitution.
The Jamaican Supreme Court dismissed the application and this was upheld by the Jamaican Court of Appeal. The Privy Council, by a majority, held that s 17(2) of the Constitution of Jamaica (supra) authorized execution by hanging irrespective of how long the delay was between the passing of sentence and its execution. The majority were of the view that the legality of a delayed execution cannot be questioned.
Lord Scarman and Lord Brightman dissented. They held that s 17(2) served only to legalize certain descriptions of punishment and not to legalize an `inhuman treatment.` In their dissenting judgment, they concluded at p 736: 
 
Prolonged delay when it arises from factors outside the control of the condemned man can render a decision to carry out the sentence of death an inhuman and degrading punishment. It is, of course, for the applicant for constitutional protection to show that the delay was inordinate, arose from no act of his, and was likely to cause such acute suffering that the infliction of the death penalty would be in the circumstances which had arisen inhuman or degrading.
 
 
 
This minority view of Lord Scarman and Brightman was preferred by the Privy Council in . Lord Griffiths, in delivering the unanimous opinion of the Board, held that s 17(2) was confined to authorizing descriptions of punishment of which the court may pass sentence and did not prevent the appellants from arguing that the circumstances in which their sentences of death were to be carried out were unconstitutional. It was accepted that a prolonged delay could constitute `inhuman and degrading treatment` contrary to s 17(1).
At p 783, it was stated by Lord Griffiths: 
 
There is an instinctive revulsion against the prospect of hanging a man after he has been held under sentence of death for many years. What gives rise to this instinctive revulsion? The answer can only be our humanity: we regard it as an inhuman act to keep a man facing the agony of execution over a long extended period of time. But before their Lordships condemn the act of execution as `inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment` within the meaning of s 17(1) there are a number of factors that have to be balanced in weighing the delay. If delay is due entirely to the fault of the accused such as an escape from custody or frivolous and time wasting resort to legal procedures which amount to an abuse of process the accused cannot be allowed to take advantage of that delay for to do so would be to permit the accused to use illegitimate means to escape the punishment inflicted upon him in the interest of protecting society against crime.
 
 
 
A much more difficult question is whether the delay occasioned by the legitimate resort of the accused to all available appellate procedures should be taken into account, or whether it is only delay that can be attributed to the shortcomings of the State that should be taken into account.
After considering various authorities from different jurisdictions, he concluded at p 786: 
 
In their Lordships` view a state that wishes to retain capital punishment must accept the responsibility of ensuring that execution follows as swiftly as practicable after sentence, allowing a reasonable time for appeal and consideration of reprieve. It is part of the human condition that a condemned man will take every opportunity to save his life through use of the appellate procedure. If the appellate procedure enables the prisoner to prolong the appellate hearings over a period of years, the fault is to be attributed to the appellate system that permits such delay and not to the prisoner who takes advantage of it. Appellate procedures that echo down the years are not compatible with capital punishment. The death row phenomenon must not become established as a part of our jurisprudence.
 
 
 
It was striking in that by the time the matter came before the Privy Council, the appellants had been in death row for some 14 years. At the conclusion of his opinion, Lord Griffiths said at p 788: 
 
These considerations lead their Lordships to the conclusion that in any case in which execution is to take place more than five years after sentence there will be strong grounds for believing that the delay is such as to constitute `inhuman or degrading punishment or other treatment.
 
 
 
The Privy Council interpreted s 25(2) of the Jamaican Constitution (infra) as enabling their Lordships to substitute for the death sentence such order as it considers appropriate. As a result, a commutation of the death sentence to a sentence of life imprisonment was ordered. Section 25(2) of the Constitution of Jamaica reads: 
 
The Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction to hear and determine any application made by any person in pursuance of subsection (1) of this section and may make such orders, issue such writs and give such directions as it may consider appropriate for the purpose of enforcing, or securing the enforcement of, any of the provisions of the said sections 14 to 24 (inclusive) to the protection of which the person concerned is entitled.
 
 
 
In reliance on the above decision, counsel for the appellant here submitted before the learned judge that the execution ought to be stayed and the sentence of death be commuted to life imprisonment.
 Findings of the High Court
In his grounds of judgment, the learned judge was of the view that the opinion of the Privy Council in and the minority view in were not applicable as there was no equivalent of s 17(1) of the Jamaican Constitution prohibiting `inhuman or degrading treatment` in the Constitution of Singapore. However, he noted that similar objections had arisen in India and he embarked on a consideration of the Indian Supreme Court decisions in and . The relevant provision in the Indian Constitution which was alleged to have been contravened as a result of a prolonged delay in execution was art 21, which the learned judge held was in pari materia with art 9(1) here: 
 
No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.
 
 
 
Having considered the Indian cases, the learned judge concluded that art 9(1) similarly required that all substantive and procedural laws be complied with throughout the whole process from the investigation, arrest, trial, appeal and up to the execution of the sentence. On this basis, he held that the enforcement of the punishment must also be rendered according to law. In principle, the learned judge accepted that a prolonged and unreasonable delay in complying with laws governing the punishment of convicted persons may be in breach of art 9(1). However, he held that any delay which was caused by the convicted person must be taken into account in determining whether there was any undue delay.
The learned judge reviewed the facts and noted that the appellant had contributed to the delay by the time he took to file his petition and his further petition for clemency. He noted that the appellant`s solicitors were notified on 17 June 1991 to file the petition and that it was only filed more than two years later, on 13 July 1993. He also pointed out that there was a second delay in filing the further petition. He noted that counsel for the appellant had only referred to the fact that five years had elapsed since his conviction and had not shown that there had been a delay of such magnitude and culpability on the part of the State as to amount to a non-compliance with the law. He declined to apply the five-year period used in 
 Pratt 
, or for that matter, any fixed period.
 The appeal
In the appeal, counsel for the appellant, Mr SK Kumar, put forward the following arguments. He pointed out that it was only on 9 June 1994 that the President gave his decision in rejecting the petition for clemency filed by the appellant`s sister on 29 July 1991. He contended that this delay of two years and ten months was unjustified, and that it amounted to a breach of the appellant`s constitutional rights under art 9(1). Mr Kumar submitted that the learned judge had erred in refusing a stay of execution and in not granting the declaration.
The issues raised in the appeal by counsel were wholly different from that pursued in the court below. It was clear from the notes of evidence that the basis of the application there was with respect to the delay of more than five years in carrying out the execution. All of these were not argued before us. Instead, the appellant sought to argue his case on the basis of an alleged delay on the part of the President in responding to the petition filed.
Mr Kumar relied on the decision of a five-judge Indian Supreme Court bench in , a case not previously cited in the court below. The Supreme Court in that case accepted that a long and undue delay in the execution of sentence of death could amount to a breach of the condemned person`s constitutional rights under art 21. It was, however, held there that the court would only examine the nature of the delay caused and circumstances which occurred after the confirmation by the judicial process of the sentence of death. Oza J, in delivering the majority opinion of four of the judges, held at p 528: 
 
... ordinarily, it is expected that even in this court the matters where the capital punishment is involved will be given top priority and shall be heard of and disposed of as expeditiously as possible but it could not be doubted that so long as the matter is pending in any court before final adjudication, even the person who has been condemned or who has been sentenced to death has a ray of hope. It, therefore, could not be contended that he suffers that mental torture which a person suffers when he knows that he is to be hanged but waits for the Doomsday. The delay, therefore, which could be considered while considering the question of commutation of sentence of death into one of life imprisonment could only be from the date the judgment by the apex court is pronounced, ie when the judicial process has come to an end.
 
 
 
In this respect, the court was unanimous in overruling 
 Vatheeswaran 
, a decision of a two-judge Supreme Court in an appeal against sentence by a prisoner already in custody for some ten years. In 
 Vatheeswaran 
, Chinnappa Reddy J considered the decision in 
 Riley 
 and the provisions of art 21 with respect to prolonged delay. He held at p 353: 
 
While we entirely agree with Lord Scarman and Lord Brightman about the dehumanizing effect of prolonged delay after the sentence of death, we enter a little caveat, but only that we may go further. We think that the cause of the delay is immaterial when the sentence is death. Be the cause for the delay, the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve or some other cause for which the accused himself may be responsible, it would not alter the dehumanizing character of the delay.
 
 
 
What are the constitutional implications of the dehumanizing factor of prolonged delay in the execution of a sentence of death? Let us turn at once to art 21 of the Constitution, for, it is to that article that we must first look for protection whenever life or liberty is threatened.
At p 359, the learned judge proceeded to hold: 
 
The fiat of art 21, as explained, is that any procedure which deprives a person of his life or liberty must be just, fair and reasonable. Just, fair and reasonable procedure implies a right to free legal services where he cannot avail them. It implies a right to a speedy trial. It implies humane conditions of detention, preventive or punitive. `Procedure established by law` does not end with the pronouncement of sentence; it includes the carrying out of sentence. That is as far as we have gone so far. It seems to us but a short step, but a step in the right direction, to hold that prolonged detention to await the execution of a sentence of death is an unjust, unfair and unreasonable procedure and the only way to undo the wrong is to quash the sentence of death.
 
 
 
Significantly, Reddy J concluded that: 
 
Making all reasonable allowance for the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve, we think that delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke art 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death.
 
 
 
Shortly after the delivery of judgment in 
 Vatheeswaran 
, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court reconsidered the issue in . Two condemned prisoners on death-row for more than two years, filed a writ petition seeking a commutation of the death sentence on the basis of . The Supreme Court there accepted in principle that prolonged delay would amount to a breach of art 21. Chandrachud CJ held at p 591: 
 
... we too consider that the view expressed in this behalf by Lord Scarman and Lord Brightman in the Privy Council decision of is, with respect, correct. The majority in that case did not pronounce upon this matter. The minority expressed the opinion that the jurisprudence of the civilized world has recognized and acknowledged that prolonged delay in executing a sentence of death can make the punishment when it comes inhuman and degrading: Sentence of death is one thing; sentence of death followed by lengthy imprisonment prior to execution is another. The prolonged anguish of alternating hope and despair, the agony of uncertainty, the consequences of such suffering on the mental emotional, and physical integrity and health of the individual can render the decision to execute the sentence of death an inhuman and degrading punishment in circumstances of a given case.
 
 
 
And at p 593, it was stated: 
 
A prisoner who has experienced living death for years on end is therefore entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of this court for examining the question whether, after all the agony and torment he has been subjected to, it is just and fair to allow the sentence of death to be executed. That is the true implication of art 21 of the Constitution and, to that extent, we express our broad and respectful agreement with our learned brethren in their visualisation of the meaning of that article. The horizons of art 21 are ever widening and the final word on its conspectus shall never have been said. So long as life lasts, so long shall it be the duty and endeavour of this court to give to the provisions of our Constitution a meaning which will prevent human suffering and degradation. Therefore, art 21 is as much relevant at the stage of execution of the death sentence as it is in the interregnum between the imposition of that sentence and its execution. The essence of the matter is that all procedure, no matter what the stage, must be fair, just and reasonable. It is well-established that a prisoner cannot be tortured or subjected to unfair or inhuman treatment. (See , and ). It is a logical extension of the selfsame principle that the death sentence, even if justifiably imposed, cannot be executed if supervening events make its execution harsh, unjust or unfair. Article 21 stands like a sentinel over human misery, degradation and oppression. Its voice is the voice of justice and fair play. That voice can never be silenced on the ground that the time to heed to its imperatives is long since past in the story of a trial. It reverberates through all stages - the trial, the sentence, the incarceration and finally, the execution of the sentence.
 
 
 
However, the Supreme Court there disagreed with the time period of two years fixed in 3: 
 
Prolonged delay in the execution of a death sentence is unquestionably an important consideration for determining whether the sentence should be allowed to be executed. But, according to us, no hard and fast rule can be laid down as our learned brethren have done that `delay exceeding two years in the execution of a sentence of death should be considered sufficient to entitle the person under sentence of death to invoke art 21 and demand the quashing of the sentence of death.` This period of two years purports to have been fixed in after making `all reasonable allowance for the time necessary for appeal and consideration of reprieve.` With great respect, we find it impossible to agree with this part of the judgment.
 
 
 
...
The substitution of the death sentence by a sentence of life imprisonment cannot follow by the application of the two years` formula as a matter of .
Chandrachud CJ considered that it was relevant to ascertain the cause of the delay and to consider whether the delay in the execution of the death sentence was due to the fact that the prisoner has resorted to
Coming back to 
 Smt Triveniben 
, in the other judgment delivered, Sheety J accepted that the time spent in judicial proceedings was intended to ensure a fair trial for the accused and could be used to impeach the execution of the death sentence. He held at p 549: 
 
If the delay in passing the sentence render the execution unconstitutional, the delay subsequent thereof cannot also render it unconstitutional. Much less any fixed period of delay could be held to make the sentence inexecutable. It would be arbitrary to fix any period of limitation for execution on the ground that it would be a denial of fairness in procedure under art 21. With respect, I am unable to agree with the view taken in 
 Vatheeswaran
 case on this aspect.
 
 
 
As a result, the Supreme Court there held that the only delay which would be material for consideration would be the delays in disposal of the mercy petition or delays occurring at the instance of the executive. On this, Shetty J remarked at p 549: 
 
The time taken by the executive for disposal of mercy petitions may depend upon the nature of the case and the scope of enquiry to be made. It may also depend upon the number of mercy petitions submitted by or on behalf of the accused. The court, therefore, cannot prescribe a time limit for disposal of even mercy petitions.
 
 
 
Shetty J concluded at p 550: 
 
The court may only consider whether there was undue long delay in disposing of mercy petition; whether the State was guilty of dilatory conduct and whether the delay was for no reason at all. The inordinate delay may be a significant factor, but that by itself cannot render the execution unconstitutional. Nor can it be divorced from the dastardly and diabolical circumstances of the crime itself.
 
 
 
The above proposition constituted the basis of the appellant`s claim in the appeal. In support, counsel also referred us to two recent Indian decisions where the death sentence was commuted on the basis of a delay of over two years on the part of the executive in disposing of the mercy petitions ( and ).
With respect, we do not consider these Indian authorities to be relevant here. We are mindful of one material difference between Indian criminal procedure and that in Singapore. In India, the death penalty is provided in some six offences in the Indian Penal Code but, in neither of these, is it mandatory. The discretion of passing the death sentence lies with the sentencing court. Under s 354(3) of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, the sentencing court is under a duty to give special reasons for awarding death sentences. The death sentence passed by the Sessions Court is not final unless confirmed by the High Court (s 366 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code). In consequence, the intention of the legislature was clearly to make life imprisonment the general rule and the death sentence an exception to be resorted to for such special reasons (see the judgment of Krishna Iyer J in at p 804 and the judgment of Oza J in 
 Smt Triveniben 
 at pp 524-5). This intention has been consistently applied by the courts. Influenced by these considerations, an appellate court would readily take notice of any delay in the judicial process and make an order of commutation of the sentence to life imprisonment (see again the judgment of Oza J in 
 Smt Triveniben 
 at p 527 and the judgment of Reddy J in 
 Vatheeswaran 
 at p 351). In Singapore, the position is, of course, markedly different. Capital cases carry a mandatory death penalty.
We accept that condemned prisoners on death-row should not be subjected to a prolonged period of imprisonment. We do not doubt that they suffer a certain level of anguish and mental agony whilst awaiting execution. However, such anguish is an inevitable consequence which, in our view, does not amount to a contravention of the constitutional rights of the prisoner.
The position in India is that the courts have a jurisdiction to consider whether subsequent events after the judicial process has ended amount to an infringement of his constitutional rights. However, a similar position does not exist here.
The respondent submitted that, contrary to the finding of the learned judge in the court below, the provisions of art 21 in the Indian Constitution differ from art 9(1). The learned DPP drew the distinction between the words `save in accordance with law` in art 9(1) and `except according to procedure established by law` in art 21. She pointed out that in 
 Vatheeswaran 
, Reddy J relied upon the construction given to these words in the Indian Supreme Court decision in , to establish the contention that a person may only be deprived of his life or personal liberty in accordance with `fair, just and reasonable` procedure established by valid law. It was affirmed in 
 Maneka Gandhi 
 that the rights as guaranteed under the Indian Constitution overlapped. As a result, `procedure` under art 21 was held to be subject to the principle of equality under art 14 there (our art 12(1)). It was therefore held that such `procedure` must be fair, just and reasonable and not fanciful, oppressive or arbitrary.
The learned DPP cited two decisions of the Malaysian Federal Court in support of her argument. In , the appellant had sought an order that a writ of habeus corpus be issued. At p 150, Suffian FJ said: 
 
Our law is quite different from that of India. First, as already stated, the power of detention is here given to the highest authority in the land, acting on the advice of minister responsible to and accountable in Parliament, not to mere officials. Secondly, as already stated, here detention, in order to be lawful, must be in accordance with the law, not as in India where it must be in accordance with 
 procedure
 established by law.
 
 
 
The above statement was subsequently followed in .
The learned DPP submitted that art 21 provided for both the legality of imposing the sentence of death and the legality of the procedure for carrying out the sentence of death, whereas art 9(1) only provided for the legality for imposing the sentence of death. On this basis, it was argued that the court did not have jurisdiction over the question whether a prolonged delay amounted to `cruel and inhuman treatment` and whether such `cruel and inhuman treatment` is `in accordance with law` under art 9(1).
We respectfully agree that art 9(1) is different from art 21 in India. Any law which provides for the deprivation of a person`s life or personal liberty, is valid and binding so long as it is validly passed by Parliament. The court is not concerned with whether it is also fair, just and reasonable as well. However, we do not see how this distinction gives rise to the contentions as submitted by the learned DPP above.
Instead, we prefer to consider the issue from the perspective of whether the court has the power to interfere under such circumstances. The appeal here is not concerned with the merits of the conviction or the dismissal of the appeal. No such challenge can be made as the court is functus officio in this respect. The learned judge in the court below held that the High Court was not possessed of power to order a stay of execution of the sentence of death. His reasons were based on three separate grounds.
The first was that the High Court is only empowered to grant stays of execution of its orders and judgments and those of subordinate courts and other tribunals where conferred by statute or by the rules of court. The learned judge held that the High Court was not vested with the power to stay an order of execution of the sentence of death made by the President as such power is only vested in the President.
Secondly, the learned judge took the point that the application as made seemed to imply that it was for an order of certiorari to quash proceedings but it was not specified which proceedings were sought to be quashed. He noted that if it was with respect to the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal dismissing the appeal against conviction, the High Court had no power to quash the order of the Court of Criminal Appeal and if it was against the President`s order to execute, `
 that order was not susceptible to be quashed by an order of certiorari. 
`
Finally, the learned judge considered the application as an attempt to restrain the government from proceeding with the execution and he held that proviso (a) to s 27(1) of the Government Proceedings Act (Cap 121) limited his power to order such a stay of execution: 
 
where in any proceedings against the Government any such relief is sought as might in proceedings between private persons be granted by way of injunction or specific performance, the court shall not grant an injunction or make an order for specific performance, but may in lieu thereof make an order declaratory of the rights of the parties.
 
 
 
On the last reason proffered by the learned judge, we feel that, in the absence of fuller submissions, we would not wish to express any opinion on the application of s 27 of the Government Proceedings Act here.
We are, however, of the view that once sentence is passed and the judicial process is concluded, the jurisdiction of the court ends. Once the Court of Appeal has disposed of the appeal against conviction and has confirmed the sentence of death, it is functus officio as far as the execution of the sentence is concerned. It is not possessed of power to order that the sentence of death be stayed or commuted to a sentence of life imprisonment, especially when the appellant was convicted of an offence which carried a mandatory sentence of death. The power of commutation or remittance of sentence lies only with the President, under s 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act: 
 
(1) The President, as occasion shall arise, may, on the advice of the Cabinet - 
(a) grant a pardon to any accomplice in any offence who gives information which leads to the conviction of the principal offender or any one of the principal offenders, if more than one; 
(b) grant to the offender convicted of any offence in any court in Singapore, a pardon, free or subject to lawful conditions, or any reprieve or respite, either indefinite or for such period as the President may think fit, of the execution of any sentence pronounced on such offender; or 
(c) remit the whole or any part of such sentence or of any penalty or forfeiture.
 
 
 
Likewise, the power to order a stay of execution or respite of the sentence lies exclusively with the President. It is solely the prerogative of the President, to decide whether a delay in execution amounts to sufficient ground to justify a commutation of sentence. It is clearly not part of the court`s functions. It was on this ground alone that we dismissed the appeal.
In the Indian cases, the purported exercise of the powers of commutation flowed from the fact that the death penalty was an alternative sentence. In , the Privy Council had adopted a broad interpretation of s 25(2) of the Jamaican Constitution in concluding that they had the power to order a commutation of sentence.
In conclusion, we feel that we should offer our views on the points raised in that a prolonged delay in the execution of sentence constitutes inhuman punishment and that the period of time taken in the judicial process must also be taken into account.
In this respect, we would prefer to accept the views of the United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit, in , which was referred to in . The appellant there was convicted of first-degree murder and contended, inter alia, that his 16 years on death row was an infringement of his rights under the Eight and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States, as being cruel and unusual punishment. O`Scannlain, Circuit Judge, in delivering the judgment of the court, held that the accumulation of time spent on death row did not constitute an independent infringement of the appellant`s constitutional rights. At pp 1491-2, it was held: 
 
A defendant must not be penalized for pursuing his constitutional rights, but he also should not be able to benefit from the ultimately unsuccessful pursuit of those rights. It would indeed be a mockery of justice if the delay incurred during the prosecution of claims that fail on the merits could itself accrue into a substantive claim to the very relief that had been sought and properly denied in the first place. If that were the law, death-row inmates would be able to avoid their sentences simply by delaying proceedings beyond some threshold amount of time, while other death-row inmates - less successful in their attempts to delay - would be forced to face their sentences. Such differential treatment would be far more `arbitrary and unfair` and `cruel and unusual` than the current system of fulfilling sentences when the last in the line of appeals fails on the merits.
 
 
 
The prisoner can always avail himself of the procedure of petitioning the President for clemency. This petition should be filed within a reasonable period of time. On the facts of the case here, there can be no dispute that the delay was attributable in a large measure to the appellant`s solicitors` failure to file the petition expeditiously and also in light of the second accused`s desire to appeal to the Privy Council. After they were informed to do so, notwithstanding the earlier petition filed by the appellant`s sister in July 1991, the appellant`s solicitors took almost two years before filing the petition on his behalf in July 1993. The petitions for clemency were only turned down in June 1994 when the second accused finally signified his intention not to file a petition. It cannot therefore be said that there had been an undue and unconscionable delay in the execution. There was no reason why the appellant`s solicitors should have taken that considerable period of time in filing their petition.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant, Goh Soon Huat, was convicted by the High Court on 25 October 1994 on a charge pursuant to s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act) of trafficking in 69.34g of diamorphine contained in 48 sachets of the substance by being found in possession of them at Thomson Plaza, Upper Thomson Road, Singapore, at about 1pm on 4 April 1994. The appellant was duly sentenced to death. The appellant has appealed against his conviction.
At about 1pm on 4 April 1994, the appellant was arrested by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) at Thomson Plaza. A black briefcase containing 48 sachets of diamorphine with a gross weight of not less than 380.6g and a diamorphine content of not less than 69.34g was seized from him together with a handphone, a pager and nearly $20,000 in cash. It was not disputed at the trial that these items belonged to him nor was it disputed that he was there to traffic in drugs.
The operation leading to the appellant`s arrest was set up following the detention of one Azman bin Ahmad (Azman) when Azman reported at the Ang Mo Kio Police Station pursuant to a police supervision order. Azman accompanied officers from the CNB to Yishun. There he paged for the appellant. After speaking to the appellant, he told the officers that his supplier, whom he had earlier told them was called `Ah Soon` and whom he had identified when shown the appellant`s photograph, was going down to Thomson Plaza at 1pm to meet him. The ensuing trap led to the appellant`s arrest.
Urine samples obtained from the appellant shortly after his arrest showed that there was 931
 m 
g of morphine in 5ml of his urine. At 4.15pm on the same day, he was sent for his pre-statement medical examination. A cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC) was recorded from him and he was then sent for his post-statement examination. The prosecution neither relied on this statement nor any inference that may be drawn under s 123 of the CPC.
At about 8.20pm, CNB Sgt Lio Keun Chai (Sgt Lio) and Cpl Tan Sok Hwee interrogated the appellant at CNB Headquarters. Sometime around 5.45am, the next day the appellant suffered drug withdrawal and was rushed to Changi Prison Hospital. He was treated by Dr Leow Kee Fong (Dr Leow) who prescribed him two days` supply of Lomotil for his diarrhoea and was discharged on 7 April 1994.
On 8 April 1994 the appellant was again interrogated by Sgt Lio and another narcotics officer. On 11 April 1994, the first of two long statements under s 121(1) of the CPC (the long statements) was recorded from the appellant by the investigating officer, W/Insp Chong Wee Kee (W/Insp Chong) through the interpretation of CNB interpreter Wu Nan Yong. The second of the long statements was taken from the appellant on 14 April 1994.
The appellant`s defence was that he was at Thomson Plaza only to traffic in ten sachets of heroin. It was not disputed that the ten sachets contained less than the threshhold 15g of diamorphine. He maintained that the remaining 38 sachets were for his own consumption. We will deal later with this part of the defence, which the learned trial judge called `the ten-sachet theme`. The appellant also said that the long statements were not obtained from him voluntarily, that he was suffering from the effects of drug withdrawal at the time the long statements were taken, that he was threatened by Sgt Lio and that he was offered inducement in the form of promises to send him to see the doctor. To crown it all, he claimed that, with the exception of parts of his personal particulars, the long statements were concocted by W/Insp Chong and Wu Nan Yong. These allegations naturally become the subject matter of a voir dire.
The learned trial judge held that the allegations made against W/Insp Chong, Wu Nan Yong and the interrogation teams led by Sgt Lio were an afterthought. The learned trial judge was satisfied that the long statements were given voluntarily by the appellant. We agree with his decision.
We accept Sgt Lio and W/Insp Chong`s evidence that the interrogations led by Sgt Lio were for the purpose of finding out the appellant`s supplier and that W/Insp Chong did not know what happened during the interrogations. While the interrogations conducted before the recording of the long statements are a cause for concern, we are satisfied that they were not conducted for the purpose of `softening up` the appellant for the recording of the long statements. We are satisfied that no threats were made by Sgt Lio or any of the officers with him and that the appellant was not ill-treated or assaulted. The inability of the appellant to recall with any amount of certainty or conviction what the threats were and the inability of the appellant to recall how he was ill-treated did absolutely no good in substantiating his allegations.
We also reject the appellant`s allegation that he cooperated by giving the long statements because Sgt Lio promised to send him to the hospital. This was never put to Sgt Lio and contradicts the appellant`s own evidence that Sgt Lio had told him that he would not send the appellant to the hospital. It is hard to believe that the appellant is so naive that despite his own evidence that Sgt Lio `cheated` him by going back on his promise to send the appellant to the hospital he was willing to give the long statements without in any way confirming with Sgt Lio or W/Insp Chong that they would send him for treatment.
The appellant testified that the statements were pre-prepared and that he was only at the sessions with W/Insp Chong to sign them. He was unable to explain why in that case the two sessions took two hours and forty minutes and one and a half hour respectively. The appellant`s explanation for his signing the long statements vacillated between having been threatened by Sgt Lio to having been in a daze due to drug withdrawal. He would have us believe that a seasoned drug user like him did not know that the charge carried a death sentence. He testified that he did not even understand the gist of the statements he was signing because Wu Nan Yong`s Hokkien was too `profound` for him. Yet, he understood perfectly well what the contents of the statements were when these were interpreted to him by the court interpreter. We do not accept that this is because Wu Nan Yong`s Hokkien was `more profound`. It was his own evidence that Wu only used a few profound words. The appellant`s inability to say whether the part he understood contained the incriminating evidence was also telling in that he conveniently shifted his position to not knowing the contents of the statements apart from his particulars at all. In our view, this characteristic meandering is fatal to the appellant`s testimony.
Counsel for the appellant made much of the language and contents of the statements in arguing that the statements originated from either W/Insp Chong or Wu Nan Yong. In our view, counsel`s reliance on this is misplaced. Wu Nan Yong had candidly admitted that he had to occasionally depart from a literal translation because such an interpretation of what the appellant had said would render the result incomprehensible. An example given by Wu Nan Yong in his testimony was the phrase `Criminal Law detention` for `
 ngor chap ngor 
` which in Hokkien means `55` and obviously refers to s 55 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. We are quite unable to accept that someone like the appellant who has been in the drugs scene since 1968 has never heard of the phrase `chasing the dragon` or its Hokkien equivalent `
 tui leng 
`, as the appellant would have us believe. We accept Wu Nan Yong`s evidence that the statements were merely his translation of what the appellant had told him and we agree with the learned trial judge that the allegations of concoction were fabricated by the appellant.
Counsel for the appellant also placed much weight on the argument that the appellant was suffering from drug withdrawal at the time when he gave the statements. In our view, the appellant`s evidence of his condition had been greatly exaggerated. Dr Leow`s evidence was that the appellant was only suffering from moderate heroin withdrawal symptoms. The appellant`s expert witness, Dr Lim Yun Chin (Dr Lim) was unwilling to dispute Dr Leow`s diagnosis. The appellant was not given fluid replacement, as was normal, had he suffered severe withdrawal symptoms nor was he prescribed Methadon, a drug normally prescribed to addicts suffering from severe drug withdrawal. The appellant was only given two days` supply of Lomotil for his diarrhoea.
It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the appellant should have been sent for medical examinations both before and after the taking of the long statements. Counsel had to concede that this was not the practice in Singapore and that he had no authority to support this. Counsel sought some support from Code C of the English Code of Practice. Code C so far as relevant states: 
 
12.3 A detained person may not be supplied with intoxicating liquor except on medical directions. No person who is unfit through drink or drugs to the extent that he is unable to appreciate the significance of questions put to him and his answers may be questioned about an alleged offence in that condition except in accordance with annexe C.
 
 
 
However, annexe C itself prescribes situations where it may be permissible to interview such a person. In any event, the appellant was not unfit through drink or drugs at the time he gave the long statements. His allegations only amount to his suffering from drug withdrawal, which is an altogether different thing, and which in any case we have found to be greatly exaggerated. In at p 247 this court observed: 
 
... in order for the effects of withdrawal from drugs to affect the drug user`s medical and psychological condition to render any statement he makes to be involuntary, he must be in a state of near delirium, that is to say, that his mind did not go with the statements he was making.
 
 
 
The evidence falls far short of showing this.
In the circumstances of this case, however, there was no need to send the appellant for a medical examination before and after the taking of the long statements. The evidence shows that he was nowhere near a state of delirium as envisaged in and that he had exaggerated his condition. There were no allegations by the appellant that he had been assaulted either before or during the recording of the long statements. We accept W/Insp Chong and Wu Nan Yong`s evidence that the appellant did not ask them to send him to a doctor.
We are also of the view that counsel`s submission that the appellant had been deprived of his medication is neither here nor there. The fact remains that the Lomotil prescribed for the diarrhoea would have been exhausted by the time the appellant gave the long statements and furthermore the appellant did not allege that he was still suffering from diarrhoea at the times the two long statements were given.
That being the case, the two long statements were correctly admitted by the learned trial judge.
In the first of the two long statements, the appellant said that Azman paged him at about 12 noon on 4 April 1994. When he returned the call, Azman told him that he wanted 30 sachets of heroin from him. The appellant would have charged Azman $87 per sachet.
In the second statement, the appellant said that Azman paged him at about 6pm on 3 April 1994 when the appellant was somewhere along Orchard Road. Azman told him to deliver 30 sachets of heroin the next day and that he would page the appellant again to confirm the time and place of delivery. The appellant stated that he was staying at a rented bunk bed in a lodging house on Bencoolen Street. On 4 April 1994 at about 11.45am, the appellant was paged by one `Ah Chuan`. Upon calling `Ah Chuan`, the appellant went to Woodlands where he purchased the 48 sachets of heroin from `Ah Chuan` for $3840. While waiting for the taxi to take him to Orchard Road, Azman paged the appellant again. The appellant called Azman and was told to bring the 30 sachets to Thomson Plaza at 1pm. The statement contained a narration of what took place in Woodlands. After buying the drugs, the appellant immediately took a taxi to Thomson Plaza and was arrested upon entering the building.
As we said earlier, the appellant`s defence was that he was at Thomson Plaza to deliver only ten sachets to Azman. The rest were for his own consumption. In support of this defence, the appellant called Azman and Dr Lim to testify. The thrust of the defence was that the appellant was at his home in Serangoon Gardens consuming drugs when he was paged by Azman. Azman told the appellant to deliver ten sachets of heroin to him at Thomson Plaza at 1pm. In his state of intoxication, the appellant had forgotten to remove the other 38 sachets from his briefcase as he was in a hurry to meet Azman.
The appellant`s explanation for the long statements was that he mentioned 30 sachets because he was angry with Azman for getting him arrested and wanted to seek revenge on him. He maintained that the whole thing was concocted by W/Insp Chong and Wu Nan Yong. This is also inconsistent with his testimony that he did not know until much later that being found in possession of 30 sachets was sufficient to attract the death penalty. It also shows that the appellant was not as naive or `dazed` as he would like us to believe.
The appellant repeated his allegations of threats, inducement and concoction against Sgt Lio, W/Insp Chong and Wu Nan Yong.
Dr Lim was called as expert witness to support the appellant`s testimony that he was a heavy user of drugs. It is sufficient to note that the learned trial judge was prepared to accept that the appellant was capable of consuming the 38 sachets within 90 or even 38 days. The question remains whether the appellant has rebutted the presumption of trafficking.
Section 5(2) of the Act provides that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a controlled drug if he is in possession of that drug for the purposes of trafficking and s 17 provides that a person who is proven to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine is presumed to have had the diamorphine for the purposes of trafficking unless it is proven that his possession of the diamorphine was not for that purpose. Counsel for the appellant submitted that, if he can show on a balance of probability that the 38 sachets were for the appellant`s own consumption, the presumption of trafficking would be rebutted. The amendments which effected ss 5 and 17 as they now are did not eliminate the dicta by Lord Diplock in . We readily accept this submission.
Counsel also relied on the appellant`s s 122(6) statement in which the appellant said that the drugs were not for trafficking. We agree with the learned trial judge that in the light of , it is not necessary for the appellant to minutely detail all his defences in his s 122(6) statement. However, accepting this proposition does not mean that the court must accept what the appellant said as true. This must still be weighed against the other evidence. It may not always be clear when an omission to state details becomes an omission to state material particulars. This is a matter for the trial judge on an evaluation of all the evidence at the trial.
Azman gave evidence that he was instructed by one of the CNB officers to ask the appellant to deliver ten sachets, but he could not remember which one. He also said that the CNB officers were very close to him and could hear what he told the appellant. The officers denied being able to hear him. This aspect of the evidence is somewhat disturbing. It is unlikely that the officers would not be interested in what Azman was saying to the appellant. As counsel submitted, for all they know Azman might have told the appellant to flee. On the other hand, it is unlikely that the officers would have instructed Azman to tell the appellant to deliver only ten sachets.
The appellant maintained throughout his evidence that he did not have the chance to speak to Azman before the trial. However, Azman revealed under the pressure of cross-examination that he did speak to the appellant on one occasion at Queenstown Remand Prison sometime in August. Counsel for the appellant submits that it was only a fleeting moment when Azman was on his way to a 
 karaoke 
 session. It is important to note that as Azman was detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act, he was kept in a separate part of the prison from the appellant. Prisoners and detainees from the two sections are not normally allowed to come into contact with each other. Furthermore, it was only in August that the defence was provided with the certificate from the Department of Scientific Services showing that the ten sachets would contain 15g or less of heroin. The trial before the High Court started on 12 September 1994. The learned trial judge nevertheless held that there was sufficient evidence to show that Azman and the appellant got together to concoct the `ten-sachet theme`. In our view, given the rather unsatisfactory state of evidence, the benefit of the doubt should be given to the appellant.
However, even if we are to accept that the appellant was only there to deliver ten sachets to Azman, it does not necessarily follow that the appellant was not also trafficking in the remaining 38 sachets. Similarly, it does not follow that just because the appellant was a hard-core drug addict he is not also a trafficker. The fact that the appellant is a hard-core addict capable of consuming 38 sachets in 38 to 90 days and was at Thomson Plaza to deliver ten sachets in no way means that he was not also trafficking in the 38 sachets. For the defence to succeed, we must not only accept that the appellant was a hard-core drug addict and that he was at Thomson Plaza to deliver only ten sachets, but we must also accept the evidence that he went to Thomson Plaza from his home in Serangoon Gardens and not from Woodlands and also that in his hurry he had forgotten to remove the 38 sachets. The burden is still on the appellant on a balance of probabilities.
The appellant`s evidence was that on 4 April 1994 he was at his rented home in Serangoon Gardens consuming drugs and in a state of euphoria when he was paged by Azman at 11am. He called Azman and was told to deliver ten sachets of heroin at Thomson Plaza. His intention was to sell the ten sachets to Azman at cost. The appellant had bought the 48 sachets from `someone` the previous day, that is 3 April 1994. After calling Azman, he resumed consuming his heroin. He left the house at 12.30pm and, as he was in a hurry, he forgot to remove the 38 sachets from his briefcase.
The appellant insisted that he was in a hurry because Azman had told him to be at Thomson Plaze at 1pm. As far as the appellant was concerned, the time was inflexible. He had to be punctual. Yet, he did not leave the house earlier. His explanation was that when a drug addict starts to consume drugs he just keeps on consuming. Of course, he could stop to call Azman, though he did not seem able to do that to meet him. The appellant had to be punctual even though it was Azman who wanted the drugs and the appellant was not making any profit. Furthermore, the appellant apparently knew that he could reach Thomson Plaza in half an hour even though it was his evidence that he did not know where Thomson Plaza was and had never been there.
The appellant could neither remember the person he bought the 48 sachets from nor the place of delivery. He later retracted the latter part and said that the place of delivery was in Serangoon Gardens and he had walked home after the delivery. He claimed that he spoke to the supplier on the night of 3 April 1994 because as he was an illegal bookie, he was not free at the weekends. However, 3 April 1994 was a Sunday.
He stated that he had only half a sachet of heroin left on 3 April 1994 apart from the 48 sachets. When asked why in that case he did not remove the 48 sachets from the briefcase he shifted his position in the manner he had been doing throughout the trial and said that he had five sachets left. He could not remember where his house in Serangoon Gardens was and it is impossible to verify this part of his evidence.
The appellant claimed that the amount of drugs he bought on 3 April 1994 was the largest he had ever purchased. He never bought more because he was afraid of being caught. This is rather illogical as he claimed that he did not know that trafficking in that amount attracted the death penalty.
The appellant went so far as to claim that he did not know how to count properly when cross-examined on the cost of the 48 sachets and the price at which he was selling the ten sachets to Azman. Nevertheless he was in the business of illegal bookmaking. His explanation was that the part he played required no calculation. He could not explain how he could tell whether his drug suppliers were ripping him off.
Furthermore, it was Azman`s evidence that when he asked for the ten sachets on 4 April 1994, the appellant had told him that he would try to get it. Why say that when according to the appellant he already had the drugs with him? Also, Azman had said that the appellant had told him that he was selling the drugs to him at $87 per sachet and that the appellant was not making much profit. Why say that when he claims that he was making no profit at all?
Counsel for the appellant urges us to place little or no weight on the long statements. For the same reasons that we have stated for admitting the long statements, we are unable to do that. We are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statements were given voluntarily by the appellant to W/Insp Chong. An attempt by counsel for the appellant to trap W/Insp Chong by asking her whether she checked with the boarding house where the appellant said in his statement that he was staying backfired when W/Insp Chong replied that she did. She was accompanied by the appellant and a team of officers. No record of the appellant having stayed in a lodging house on Bencoolen Street was found. Counsel sought to rely on this fact to show that the contents of the statements are untrue. We are more inclined, in the light of the rest of the evidence, to agree with the inspector that the appellant was leading her on a wild goose chase.
Counsel submits that the prosecution should have found out from Singapore Telecoms whether Azman had called the appellant on 3 April 1994 as was stated in the long statements. We are unable to accept this submission. The prosecution only needs to put in enough evidence to support a conviction. The prosecution is under no duty to tender more and is not entitled to succeed if it tenders less. It may well be different if the prosecution is aware of evidence which contradicts or is inconsistent with the evidence it has tendered or proposes to tender in court. Apart from that situation the prosecution need not seek out evidence to plug all the weaknesses it perceives in its case if it is of the view that the weakness is not such as to raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of the judge, much less when the burden of proving the defence is on the accused. Of course, by sitting back, the prosecution runs the risk of an acquittal, but it is a risk it is entitled to take.
In order for the appellant to establish his defence of self consumption, the onus is on him to show on a balance of probabilities that he went to Thomson Plaza from Serangoon Gardens and that he had forgotten to remove the 38 sachets. Apart from his bare allegation, all the evidence point away from this defence. The appellant has fallen far short of overcoming this burden. For these reasons, we dismiss this appeal and confirm the sentence of death passed by the learned trial judge.

The appellants were convicted in the district court for possession of prohibited publications under the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338) (the UPA). The prohibited publications were published by the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (WTBTS), the parent body of the sect known as the Jehovah`s Witnesses. By Gazette Notification No 123, dated 14 January 1972 (Order 123), made pursuant to s 3 of the UPA, these publications were banned in Singapore.
In the court below, the district judge imposed fines of $800, $500, $500 and $700 on the four appellants respectively. The appellants appealed to the High Court against their conviction and sentence. On 8 August 1994, I dismissed the appeals. [See 
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
 .] Subsequently, by this motion, the appellants applied to refer several questions of law for determination by the Court of Appeal pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (the SCJA). The Public Prosecutor objected. Having heard the submissions tendered by both counsel, I was not satisfied that this matter should proceed further and accordingly dismissed the application. I now set out my reasons.
It would be convenient to recite first the factual background of this case. On 14 January 1972, the Minister for Home Affairs, pursuant to his powers under s 24(1) of the Societies Act (Cap 311) and by Gazette Notification No 179 (Order 179), ordered the dissolution of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah`s Witnesses as a registered society. The basis for the de-registration was stated in a press statement from the Ministry of Home Affairs: 
 
... its [the Jehovah`s Witnesses] continued existence is prejudicial to public welfare and good order in Singapore. The doctrine of the sect and nature of its propaganda are based on its claim that Satan and its dispensation are responsible for all organized government and religion. The result of the impending `Armageddon` will be the destruction of everyone except Jehovah`s Witnesses, who will inherit the earth. By virtue of this doctrine, the sect claims a neutral position for its members in wartime. This has led to a number of Jehovah`s Witnesses in the National Service to refuse to do any military duty. Some of them even refuse to wear uniforms.
 
 
 
At the same time, Order 123 was made by the Minister for Culture (now the Minister for Information and the Arts).
All four appellants here were Jehovah`s Witnesses. On 2 July 1992, they were arrested for possession of several publications by WTBTS. In the appeal and in the trial in the court below, the appellants challenged the validity of both Orders 123 and 179 as being ultra vires the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, the UPA and the Societies Act (Cap 311). They raised the objection that the two orders unlawfully denied them and other Jehovah`s Witnesses the free exercise of their religious liberty as guaranteed under the Constitution. Further, they contended that the two orders were null and unenforceable as having been promulgated arbitrarily and by a denial of natural justice, without notice or hearing.
In light of these challenges to the validity of the orders, I had to determine as a preliminary issue whether this court possessed the jurisdiction to adjudicate on all the issues raised by the appellants, considering that it was, in fact, a criminal appeal from a subordinate court. I held the view that these matters ought to have been properly determined in judicial review proceedings in the High Court instead. However, the Public Prosecutor raised no objections to these issues being raised. He contended that they ought to be argued and finally determined, so that the matter can be put to rest. Under such exceptional circumstances, I ruled that this court was competent to consider all such issues raised.
At the hearing of the appeal, the appellants applied by Crim Motion 16/94 for leave to adduce additional evidence. These included orders for certain articles and publications with respect to the Jehovah`s Witnesses to be adduced, the production of files and documents of the respective ministries in making Orders 123 and 179, a full response from the respective ministries to interrogatories with respect to the making of Orders 123 and 179 and an order for adducing the evidence of an expert witness on the beliefs and practices of the Jehovah`s Witnesses. The motion was dismissed. However, I allowed the Public Prosecutor`s motion for leave to adduce additional evidence by way of affidavits from several government officials (Crim Motion No 19/94), which, in my view, amounted to a certain extent to what was sought by the appellants.
In the appeal proper, I considered the various contentions of the appellants and ruled that both Orders 179 and 123 were not in contravention of the articles of the Constitution cited nor the enabling statutory provisions. The appellants had failed to discharge their onus of proving that the respective ministers had exercised their discretion on irrelevant grounds. I held that it was not for this court to substitute its view for the ministers` as to whether the Jehovah`s Witnesses constituted a threat to national security. I also dismissed the appellants` objections of the lack of natural justice, on the basis that the orders were clearly for the preservation of national security. I was satisfied that, as the basis of the orders clearly could not be disputed, no purpose would be achieved if a hearing was held.
Turning now to this motion, the appellants applied for an order that the following questions be reserved for the decision of the Court of Appeal:
 
 
(1) whether the ministerial order contained in Government Gazette Notification No 123 dated 14 January 1972 (Order 123) is ultra vires the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338) and/or arts 12, 15 and 152 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore; 
 
(2) whether the ministerial order contained in Government Gazette Notification No 179 dated 14 January 1972 (Order 179) is ultra vires the Societies Act (Cap 311) and/or arts 12, 15 and 152 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore; 
 
(3) whether the Ministerial Orders 123 and 179 unlawfully took away important liberties provided by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore; 
 
(4) whether the Ministerial Orders 123 and 179 are void for denial of natural justice and unreasonableness; 
 
(5) whether the Ministerial Orders 123 and 179 are within the scope of reservation provided by art 15(4) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore; 
 
(6) whether the restrictions permitted by art 15(4) should be governed by the `least restrictive test`; and 
 
(7) if the answer to question (6) above is in the affirmative, whether the burden imposed by the Ministerial Orders 123 and 179 are out of proportion to the limited benefit to the interest of the State; 
 
(8) whether the High Court erred in refusing the appellant`s request to have the documents in possession of the government examined either by the appellants or the court to ascertain if the said records really justify the extreme Orders 123 and 179 (supra); 
 
(9) whether the High Court erred in allowing additional evidence to be adduced by the prosecutor while refusing the right to adduce constitutional evidence on the part of the defence; and 
 
(10) whether the constitutional questions of first impression in the Republic of Singapore should be finally decided by a single judge or should be considered by the Court of Appeal in the interests of protecting the constitutional liberties of all the people.
  
 
 
The appellants contended that the specific questions of law which they stated related to their fundamental rights of religious liberty under the Constitution, which they alleged had been infringed without a right of hearing. They maintained that the government had proceeded on wholly unfounded grounds in making the orders of de-registration and prohibition and that there was no evidence which showed that the Jehovah`s Witnesses were a threat to public order. Mr How, counsel for the appellants, submitted that these were questions of utmost importance and of interest to the public, which had not been canvassed previously before the Court of Appeal. He urged me to allow the application as these issues ought to be finally considered and determined by the highest court in our jurisdiction, so as to provide the public with a definition of what their rights of religious freedom and liberty were under the Constitution. He relied on the following dicta of Chan Sek Keong J in , at p 413: 
 
In general, I agree with the proposition that any question which raised constitutional rights would be one of public interest which ought to be decided, whenever appropriate, by the final appellate court in Singapore.
 
 
 
Mr Reddy, for the Public Prosecutor, contended that none of the questions of law stated were of public interest but only of personal interest to the parties. He argued that a question which purportedly involved constitutional issues was not necessarily also a question of law of public interest. The issues here, he argued, were determined by settled principles of law. There was therefore no necessity for a further review by the Court of Appeal. He submitted that the application here was merely an appeal in disguise and should be dismissed.
Mr Reddy also drew attention to the fact that the appellants had since filed OS No 747/94, for leave for a judicial review of Order No 405 of 1994, made pursuant to s 3 of the UPA, prohibiting publications by the International Bible Students Association, another Jehovah`s Witnesses body. He argued that there was no purpose in a further reference to the Court of Appeal now, as the issues here would also inevitably be raised in the judicial review hearing there, which was in fact the proper proceeding for such issues.
The relevant provisions of s 60 of the SCJA states: 
 
(1) When an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court, the judge may, on the application of any party and shall on the application of the Public Prosecutor, reserve for the decision of the Court of Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the event of the appeal.
... 
(5) For the purposes of this section but without prejudice to the generality of its provisions - 
(a) any question of law regarding which there is a conflict of judicial authority shall be deemed to be a question of public interest; and 
(b) the reservation of a question of law for the consideration of the High Court under the provisions of any written law relating to criminal procedure or the exercise by the High Court of any power of revision under any such written law shall be deemed to be an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter.
 
 
 
The principles governing a s 60 application were fully expounded in my judgment delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal in . An application for a reference to the Court of Appeal of any question of law under s 60 of the SCJA must satisfy two main elements. First, the question stated must be a question of law of public interest which has arisen in the course of the appeal. Secondly, the determination of this question by the appellate judge must have affected the event of the appeal. It is settled law that, even if both of these prescribed conditions are satisfied, the court retains a discretion whether or not to allow the reference to the Court of Appeal where the application is brought by any party, other than the Public Prosecutor.
In applications of this nature, the court must be mindful of the interest of maintaining finality in such proceedings. Parliament has clearly provided that the High Court shall be the final appellate court for criminal cases commenced in the subordinate courts. In such cases, there would generally be no need for the Court of Appeal to conduct a further review. It was, however, recognized that there were certain cases in which a further reference of questions of law to the Court of Appeal may be deemed necessary to settle any conflicting issues. As a result, s 60 was enacted to provide an avenue for aggrieved parties to proceed further to the Court of Appeal only where the questions raised were exceptional. In the Malaysian Federal Court decision in , s 66(1) of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 being in pari materia with s 60 of the SCJA here, Suffian Ag CJ said: 
 
It is to be observed that questions of law which may be referred to us under s 66 should not be questions of personal interest only to the accused or the Public Prosecutor, but should be questions that are of public interest, and it seems to us better if the High Court were to exercise their discretion under s 66 sparingly, so that the references are not used as an indirect way of appealing against matters that under the law have been finally determined by the High Court.
 
 
 
In , the principles as stated by Chan Sek Keong J in the court below [the High Court] were approved: 
 
In Singapore, the majority of criminal cases are tried in the subordinate courts. The normal recourse available to a convicted person who is dissatisfied with his conviction and/or the sentence is to appeal to the High Court. It is in the public interest that a person who has been wrongly convicted of any offence (and not only a grave offence), whether by the wrong application of the law or the application of the wrong law, should be able to have it corrected on appeal. Such a right is provided under existing law, but it does not go beyond the High Court. The public interest in giving a convicted person the right to have his conviction corrected on appeal has to be balanced against the public interest that there has to be finality in the proceedings, and Parliament has decided as a matter of policy that finality in criminal cases tried in the subordinate courts stops at the High Court. Parliament has set the balance by giving a limited right of appeal in such cases rather than to allow them to go all the way to the Privy Council. However, Parliament has also recognized that there are certain questions of law which should be settled by the Court of Criminal Appeal as it is in the public interest that they should be so settled. It is doubtful that s 60 was designed to refer for decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal questions which by their nature cannot affect the outcome of cases other than those from which they arose.
 
 
 
It is on these considerations that the courts in Malaysia and Singapore have recognized the limitations of s 60. It is not an ordinary appeal provision to argue points of law which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the application or extension of established principles of law or the application of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by higher courts. Hence, Suffian Ag CJ`s caution that the provision be used sparingly lest it be made use of as an appeal provision.
The question stated must quite obviously be a question of law. Questions of fact, although affecting the event of the appeal, are not questions within the purview of s 60 (see the judgment of Karthigesu J [as he then was] in ). Further, such questions of law must be of public interest and not merely of personal importance to the parties alone. As was stated by Raja Azlan Shah Ag LP in the Malaysian Federal Court decision in at p 140: 
 
The section cannot be invoked by raising a ground which in his grounds of appeal and in the course of his submission, counsel for the applicant described as a mere question of law. Besides being that, it must be of public interest which arose in the course of the appeal and which determined the appeal.
 
 
 
Later, at p 141, the Lord President said: 
 
But it is not sufficient that the question raised is a question of law. It must be a question of law of public interest. What is public interest must surely depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. We think that the proper test for determining whether a question of law raised in the course of the appeal is of public interest would be whether it directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this court or by the Privy Council or is not free from difficulty or calls for discussion of alternate views. If the question is settled by the highest court or the general principles in determining the question are well settled and it is a mere question of applying those principles to the facts of the case, the question would not be a question of law of public interest.
 
 
 
It was urged upon us that in at least two previous cases (see 
 
 
[1958] MLJ 102
  and 
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 144
 ) the applicants had successfully obtained a reference, and that we should follow those cases and determine the questions referred to us. It was further said that the questions are of a general importance upon which further argument and a decision of this court would be to the public advantage (see 
[1926] 2 KB 125
). A short answer is that the two cases referred above involved misdirections in law and this court had no hesitation to intervene because they called for discussion of alternative views. There are no views about the present case.
But basically, we must consistently decline to receive and answer questions which, though they may be questions of law, are, nevertheless, not questions of law of public interest, in the sense as we understand it, that a necessity arises for the determination of the questions having regard to the uncertain or conflicting state of the law on the subject.
The above proposition is made clear under s 60(5)(a) itself, where it is provided that I now turn to the specific questions stated. Questions (1) and (2) were issues which I had addressed and determined in disposing of the appeal. The principles of law which were applied were free from difficulty or uncertainty. There were, in fact, no real issues of law arising. Even if there were, in my view, they were not questions of law of sufficient public interest, but were simply matters which were of interest to the parties alone. I do not see how it is to the public advantage for these issues to be further considered by the Court of Appeal.
Although I respectfully agree with Chan Sek Keong J in that constitutional issues ought to be determined by the Court of Appeal when raised, I am not satisfied that this case was that as made out by the appellants. In , a s 60 application was made following the dismissal of an appeal against conviction brought by the applicant in the High Court for having provided public entertainment without a licence, contrary to s 18(1)(a) of the Public Entertainments Act (Cap 257). The questions sought to be referred included a question which was framed in the context of an alleged violation of art 14(1) of the Constitution on the right of free speech. Chan Sek Keong J did not find that the proposed questions in the application had raised any constitutional issues but were instead, issues of fact, and he accordingly dismissed the application.
I had already expressed in my grounds of judgment the view that the appeal was not primarily concerned with the right of the Jehovah`s Witnesses to exist as a religion. The contention that the Jehovah`s Witnesses in Singapore were a responsible, honest and law-abiding group, which kept strictly out of politics, was not in issue. The only real complaint was of their refusal to undertake National Service, which in Singapore is a fundamental aspect of national security. The basis of the de-registration and prohibition orders was undoubtedly clear. Any group, irrespective of whether it purports to be a religious sect or a society for the promotion of some secular objective, which advocates, as one of its rules or doctrine for its members, a refusal to serve National Service, is a threat to public order.
The principal issue in the appeal was therefore not one of deprivation of freedom of religious belief as the appellants have contended. It was simply a matter of whether the respective orders challenged had been properly made. I would reiterate the established principle of law that the court is precluded from substituting its own views as to the merits of the orders. I had, in the course of determining the appeal, found no evidence that the respective ministers had acted unfairly or arbitrarily or contrary to the enabling statutory provisions. I was also satisfied that the orders were not made contrary to any provision of the Constitution.
In this respect, questions (3) to (5) were similarly not questions of law of public interest. I had ruled that the respective orders were valid and not at all inconsistent with the saving provision of art 15(4) of the Constitution. I do not think that there were any substantial questions of law arising from my findings, which were in essence directed at specific issues of interest only to the parties at hand. There was a right to appeal against the convictions and this had already been exercised by the appellants. I do not see why the matter should proceed further. I have already held, and would continue to hold, the view that there should be finality in the proceedings.
I had also considered in my grounds of judgment the place of religious freedom in an orderly society and I had opined in the context of art 15(4) that the right of religious freedom was subject to inherent limitations and was not an absolute and unqualified right. That being said, I did not find questions (6) and (7), though framed in a general manner, to be questions which were of great relevance in the appeal or had affected the determination of the appeal. The propositions with respect to the saving provision of art 15(4) are clear and need not be further referred to the Court of Appeal.
Questions (8) and (9) are clearly not questions of law. In refusing the application for disclosure of government documents, I had held that I was bound by the prohibition on such disclosure under ss 125 and 126 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). In the circumstances, there could not have been a question of law arising. As for question (9), I had exercised my discretionary powers, based on settled principles of law, in determining whether the respective motions were of merit or not. The question stated here was not a question of law at all. As I have already said, a reference under s 60 cannot be a further attempt at filing an appeal against conviction.
As for question (10), I need only refer to what I have said with respect to questions (1) and (2).
In the result, in the exercise of my discretion, the application to reserve the above questions to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The facts giving rise to this appeal are as follows.
The respondent is a company incorporated in Singapore and carrying on business as importer and exporter.
The appellant is a bank incorporated in India and registered in Singapore under the provisions of s 368(1) of the Companies Act.
Jagetia Paper Mills (Pte) Ltd (`Jagetia`) is a company incorporated in and existing under the laws of India.
On 14 March 1985, the respondent entered into a contract with Jagetia for the sale to Jagetia of 1,095 metric tons of waste paper at the price of S$144,135.80 c Payment was to be by way of an irrevocable letter of credit.
On 4 June 1985, the appellant`s Jaipur branch in India issued the irrevocable letter of credit No JPFR44/85 (`LC`) for the sum of S$197,100 c Bombay. Credit was available by negotiation of the respondent`s drafts drawn on Jagetia 180 days from the date of the bills of lading. The documents required under the terms of the LC included the following:
 
 
(i) a copy of the cable confirmation to Jagetia evidencing shipment and despatch particulars. (This was to enable Jagetia to arrange insurance); 
 
(ii) evidence that shipment had been made through a conference line.
  
 
 
In early July 1985, the respondent shipped the consignment of waste paper (`the goods`) by the vessel `Neptune` under bills of lading No SPBM-B007 and SPBM-B015. It then submitted the documents to its own banker, DG Bank, with instructions to negotiate them on its behalf.
On 12 July 1985, DG Bank presented the documents to the appellant`s Singapore branch for negotiation. Some discrepancies were noted. There was no cable confirmation to Jagetia evidencing the shipment and despatch particulars of the goods and no documentary evidence that the `Neptune` is a conference line vessel. At the respondent`s request the documents were despatched to the appellant`s Jaipur branch by courier on 17 July 1985 on an acceptance basis. The documents arrived at the appellant`s Jaipur branch on 25 July 1985.
Meanwhile on 18 July 1985, the appellant`s Bhilwara branch in India at Jagetia`s request issued a guarantee and indemnity (`banker`s guarantee`) in favour of the carrier`s agents Samarth Shipping & Marine Co (Pte) Ltd (`carrier`s agents`) agreeing to hold the carrier indemnified against any claim against it for delivering the goods to Jagetia without production of the bills of lading.
On 22 July 1985, the carrier`s agent in India issued the delivery orders for the goods to Jagetia.
Further discrepancies were subsequently noted. On 27 July 1985 the documents tendered by DG Bank were not accepted. On 30 July 1985 the appellant`s Jaipur branch informed the carrier`s agent that the banker`s guarantee was to be treated as withdrawn.
On 5 August 1985, the goods were released to Jagetia against the delivery orders issued by the carrier`s agent. Jagetia, having taken delivery of the goods, refused to make payment to the respondent for the same.
The respondent then commenced proceedings against the appellant on 6 March 1986 for the sum of $144,136.80 being the invoice value of the goods on grounds of breach of contract and/or negligence.
On its claim based on contract, the respondent contended that the appellant was precluded from asserting that the documents were not in accordance with the terms and conditions of the credit and accordingly the appellant should have made payment under the LC. On its claim based on negligence the respondent contended that the appellant owed it a duty of care not to issue the banker`s guarantee which was utilised by Jagetia to take delivery of the goods without production of the original bills of lading.
In the course of the hearing in the court below the respondent was granted leave to amend its statement of claim to add a further cause of action against the appellant in conversion. On conversion the respondent alleged that the appellant was guilty of conversion by wrongfully assisting the carrier in the unlawful transfer of the goods to Jagetia.
On the claim based on contract, the learned trial judge found the documents to be non-conforming and that the appellants had neither negotiated nor accepted the documents. Therefore the appellant was not in breach of its contractual duties arising under the LC in refusing to make payment thereunder. The learned judge also held that the respondent could not succeed in negligence in what was essentially a matter of contract or conversion. He however allowed the respondent`s amended claim on conversion. [See 
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 389
 .] This was what the learned judge said (at p 392H): 
 
Jagetia could not have done so without the assistance and bank guarantee of the defendants. In issuing the guarantee to the carriers the defendants acknowledged that they were converting the goods of the owners or a party entitled to possession thereof. I found that the defendants had intentionally dealt with the goods which was seriously inconsistent with the possession or right to immediate possession of the plaintiffs. To protect themselves they took an indemnity, in the usual way, from Jagetia. The plaintiffs were irreversibly deprived of their goods. I accordingly gave judgment and applied the general rule that the damages were the value of the goods on the date of conversion. There was hardly any dispute about the value of the goods.
 
 
 
It is against this part of the judgment that the appeal was directed.
The popular definition of conversion is that found in 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 1422: 
 
 
 The essence of conversion.
 Conversion exists in three forms. To constitute the first form of conversion there must be a positive wrongful act of dealing with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner`s rights, and an intention in so doing to deny the owner`s rights or to assert a right inconsistent with them. This inconsistency is the gist of the action. There need not be any knowledge on the part of the person sued that the goods belong to someone else; nor need there be any positive intention to challenge the true owner`s rights. The action is not one in which fraud is a necessary ingredient. Goods may be the subject of successive and independent conversions by persons dealing with them in such a manner and with such an intention.
 
 
 
A second form of conversion is committed where goods are wrongfully detained by the defendant. A wrongful detention gave rise to an action for detinue before detinue was abolished and now gives rise to an action in conversion. The normal method of establishing a wrongful detention is to show that the plaintiff made a demand for the return of the goods and that the defendant refused after a reasonable time to comply with that demand. In many cases this form of conversion will coincide with the first.
The third form of conversion lies for loss or destruction of goods which a bailee has allowed to happen in breach of his duty to his bailor. This enables conversion to be brought in a case which would not have constituted conversion at common law, but which would have been detinue before detinue was abolished.
The only issue is whether the first form of conversion applies in this case. In order to constitute conversion, physical possession of the goods by the defendant is not a necessary element, nor is physical handling of the goods. What must be shown, however, is that the defendant`s act deprives the plaintiff of his right to possession or amounts to a substantial interference with that right.
In the plaintiffs sent to the defendant an invoice for barley, which stated that the barley was bought by the defendant from the plaintiffs through one Grimmett as broker, and also a delivery order, which made the barley deliverable to the order of the consignor or consignee. The defendant had not in fact ordered any barley from the plaintiffs. Grimmett called on the defendant, who showed him the documents, and told him it was a mistake. Grimmett said that it was so, and asked the defendant to indorse the order to him, for the purpose, as he said of saving the expense of obtaining a fresh delivery order. The defendant indorsed the order to Grimmett, who obtained delivery of the barley and disposed of it, and then absconded. On the trial of an action of trover for the barley, the jury found that the defendant had no intention of appropriating the barley to his own use, but indorsed the order for the purpose of correcting what he believed to be an error, and returning the barley to the plaintiffs. It was held that the defendant, having indorsed the order without any occasion to do so, and without authority, was liable. In giving his judgment Bramwell B said at p 89: 
 
I think the plaintiffs are entitled to recover; though, so far as concerns the defendant, whose act was well meant, I regret the result. Mr Bosanquet gave a good description of what constitutes a conversion when he said that it is where a man does an unauthorised act which deprives another of his property permanently or for an indefinite time. The expression used in the declaration is `
 converted to his own use
;` but that does not mean that the defendant consumed the goods himself; for, if a man gave a quantity of another person`s wine to a friend to drink, and the friend drank it, that would no doubt be as much a conversion of the wine as if he drank it himself. Now here the defendant did an act that was unauthorised. There was no occasion for him to do it; for the delivery order made the barley deliverable to the order of the consignor or consignee, and if the defendant had done nothing at all it would have been delivered to the plaintiffs. And there is no doubt that by what he did he deprived the plaintiffs of their property; because, by means of this order so indorsed, Grimmett got the barley and made away with it, leaving the plaintiffs without any remedy against the railway company, who had acted according to the instructions of the plaintiffs in delivering the barley to the order of the consignee. The case, therefore, stands thus: that by an unauthorised act on the part of the defendant, the plaintiffs have lost their barley, without any remedy except against Grimmett, and that is worthless. It seems to me therefore, that this was assuming a control over the disposition of these goods, and a causing them to be delivered to a person who deprived the plaintiffs of them. The conversion is therefore made out.
 
 
 
At p 92 Cleasby B agreed: 
 
The ground of the decision in the present case is that the defendant had no title whatever to the goods - that there was no necessity whatever for his interfering in any manner in the disposal of them, but that he improperly, though innocently - being prevailed upon to do so by Grimmett - having the indicia of title, by mistake, as he knew, transferred that title to the possession of Grimmett. I think a person who deals with the property in this way does so at his peril, and if by means of it a fraud upon the owner is accomplished, he is responsible.
 
 
 
In , without the indorsement by the defendant of the delivery order, the goods would not have been released by the railway authorities to Grimmett. In the present case, the appellant did not release the bills of lading to Jagetia to enable Jagetia to take delivery of the goods from the carrier. The carrier itself delivered the goods to Jagetia without the production of the bills of lading. In so doing the carrier was liable to the respondent for breach of contract as evidenced by the bills of lading or guilty of conversion. This liability to the respondent remained with or without the banker`s guarantee. See . Therefore the appellant, in issuing the banker`s guarantee, did not deal with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the respondent`s rights either as owner or party entitled to possession.
Assistance may also be obtained from the decision of . In that case the plaintiff and one Matsushita were two of four co-owners of a yacht which had docked in Darwin. Following a dispute on board the yacht the plaintiff and Matsushita independently applied for a certificate of clearance without which the yacht could not leave Darwin. In contravention of s 122 of the Customs Act (1906-1968) the Darwin Customs authorities issued the clearance certificate to Matsushita although the latter had not obtained an export licence. This enabled him to sail away and he did so. Mason J held that the certificate of clearance was a declaration that the law of the port had been complied with and that the yacht was entitled to leave. But the issue of the certificate to Matsushita was not a dealing with the yacht in a manner inconsistent with the right of the plaintiff as a co-owner, nor was it a denial of the plaintiff`s rights as a co-owner, neither did it deliver possession of the yacht to Matsushita. Mason J`s decision was affirmed by the High Court of Australia without adding `
 anything to his Honour`s reasons 
`. In delivering his judgment Mason J at p 173 said: 
 
The issue of the certificate enabled Matsushita to sail the yacht away without breaching s 118 but it did not give full possession of the yacht. Although the yacht was subject to the control of Customs it was not in the possession of Customs. The issue of the clearance did not operate as a delivery of possession of the yacht from the Customs to Matsushita. He and his companions already had possession. The plaintiff was subsequently excluded from possession but that was by act of Matsushita and his companions not by act of the Customs.
 
 
 
In our case, the delivery of the goods to Jagetia was effected by the carrier. However before delivery was effected, the carrier required the banker`s guarantee. But the issuing of the banker`s guarantee by itself did not operate as delivery of the goods to Jagetia. The banker`s guarantee only entitled the carrier to indemnity against any claim by the respondent. It in no way affected the liability of the carrier toward the respondent for damages arising out of the delivery of the goods without production of the bills of lading. It is also to be noted that the banker`s guarantee was issued by the appellant`s Bhilwara branch in good faith some seven days before the documents arrived at the appellant`s Jaipur branch on an acceptance basis and some nine days before it was advised by Jagetia that the documents were not accepted. Accordingly we are of the view that the appellant had not dealt with the goods in a manner which was inconsistent with the respondent`s rights either as owner or party entitled to possession and no action thus lies against the appellant for conversion. Neither could the appellant be said to have been guilty of wrongfully assisting the carrier in the unlawful transfer of the goods to Jagetia. We therefore allow the appeal with costs here and below. The deposit by way of security for costs is to be released to the appellant.

The appellant was convicted in the High Court of the charge that he on 25 October 1993 at about 2.45am at Hayo 24-hour Coffee-shop, 55 Chander Road, Singapore, together with two other unknown persons, in furtherance of the common intention of them all committed murder by causing the death of one Thampusamy Murugian Gunasekaran (the deceased), an offence punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. Against his conviction, the appellant appealed. We dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
 The prosecution case
The prosecution case was as follows. On 25 October 1993 at about 2.30am the deceased and one Murugear were having supper at the Hayo Coffee-shop at 55 Chander Road. Suddenly a male Indian armed with an axe and a male Chinese armed with an iron pipe rushed into the coffee-shop and attacked the deceased and Murugear from behind. The deceased who had slumped in his chair after the first blow, was slashed on the back of his head about three times. Murugear was also hit again and when he tried to escape, he was pursued by the assailants.
At the time of the attack on the deceased and Murugear, a third person, a male Indian, armed either with a wooden pole or an iron pipe, stood at the entrance of the coffee-shop but did not participate in the attack. Thereafter, the three assailants ran away from the coffee-shop. As the male Indian who was armed with an axe was running out of the coffee-shop, he shouted at the people in the shop in Malay and in Hokkien.
Subsequently, the deceased was rushed to the Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Dr Charles Seah Kim Choon (Dr Seah), who examined the deceased in the hospital, found him almost brain dead. The deceased was bleeding actively from his scalp wounds on the back of his head. Dr Seah performed an emergency operation. During the operation Dr Seah found the deceased`s lateral sinus over his occipital region cut and his brain in the same region lacerated. Efforts made to arrest the active bleeding from the lateral sinus were not successful and the deceased died at about 7.20am.
In his autopsy report, Professor Chao Tzee Cheng (Prof Chao) certified the cause of death as a fractured skull. In his evidence, he said that there were four external wounds on the deceased`s head and there were three fractures beneath the three wounds. He explained that the upper end of the fracture under one of the wounds was triangular in shape measuring 3 x 0.8 cm which was characteristic of a fracture that would have been caused by an axe swung at the head with the tip of the axe probably coming into contact on this part of the skull when the deceased was attacked. The other two slash wounds, he said, were consistent with injuries having been caused with a sharp weapon like a parang or an axe. Prof Chao said that considerable force was required to cause such severe injuries and that two of the wounds individually, or three of them collectively, were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
On 2 March 1994, the appellant surrendered himself to the police for the killing of the deceased. According to Detective Station Inspector Somasamy (Somasamy), the appellant telephoned him at about 10.10am that morning and told him that he wanted to surrender himself with some weapons. At 11.30am that day, the appellant saw Somasamy in his office at the Clementi Police Station.
Somasamy testified that the appellant told him that he was the headman of the Gi Leng Kiat secret society and the appellant handed some weapons to him. The appellant then told Somasamy that he was involved in a case of murder at a coffee-shop at Desker Road. When Somasamy asked him when this took place, the appellant told him that this happened during the Deepavali festive season in 1993. The appellant further told him that he rushed into the coffee-shop where he saw two male Indians seated and having drinks. He stated that he slashed one of them with a parang and the parang that he used was amongst the weapons he had surrendered. Somasamy said that he then telephoned three different police stations to verify the confession of the appellant, after which the appellant was placed under arrest.
The evidence of Somasamy was challenged on the grounds that the appellant did not confess to a murder when he surrendered and in view of the absence of records, it was unlikely that the appellant had made the confession to him. It was put to Somasamy that when the appellant came to see him on 2 March 1994, it was the appellant`s intention to surrender himself to the police to be charged in court and be sent to jail for being in possession of weapons. It was further put to him that the appellant wanted to be jailed because he had personal problems.
These suggestions were denied by Somasamy who explained that the appellant confessed to him whereupon he had to check on the confession of the appellant with the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). He first called Tanglin Police Station and then the Central Police Station before calling the CID. In fact, he arrested the appellant only after he had spent over an hour checking on the confession of the appellant. Further, there were two written notations of the confessions being an entry in Somasamy`s pocket book that the appellant surrendered himself to the police for a murder and the arrest report which showed beyond any doubt that the appellant was arrested for the murder at No 55 Chander Road.
On 3 March 1994, Insp T Maniam (Insp Maniam), the investigating officer, recorded a s 122(6) statement from the appellant. The recording of the said statement commenced at 10.35am and ended at 11.50am. After a voir dire, this statement was admitted by the trial judge into evidence as a statement of the appellant made without any inducement, threat or promise. In the statement the appellant admitted that at about 1.30am he went in a motor van to the coffee-shop at No 55 Chander Road with his gang to look for rival gang members. At the coffee-shop, he saw the deceased and another person drinking beer. He left the coffee-shop and returned to the motor van to arm himself with a weapon. He returned to the coffee-shop with the weapon and swung the weapon from behind the deceased. The members of his gang joined in the attack and afterwards, they ran out of the coffee-shop. He ran in the direction of Serangoon Road and left the scene in the motor van.
At the request of the defence, the long statement of the appellant was admitted into evidence. The long statement consisting of 12 paragraphs was recorded by Insp Maniam on 15 March 1994 from 10.05am to 1pm and from 2.35pm to 2.45pm. In it, the appellant expanded on the account he had given in the s 122(6) statement.
On 23 March 1994, the appellant accompanied by Insp Maniam and two other officers went to the coffee-shop at No 55 Chander Road. In the police car, the appellant directed the driver how to get to the coffee-shop. When they arrived, the appellant showed Insp Maniam the table at the left side of the coffee-shop as the place where he had attacked the deceased on 25 October 1993.
 The defence case
The defence of the appellant was that he did not commit the murder. He claimed that he had never been to the coffee-shop at No 55 Chander Road. Neither did he surrender to the police for the murder of the deceased. As regards the two statements he gave to Insp Maniam, he said that they were merely stories he had fabricated in order to cooperate with the police. He also denied the visit to the scene on 23 March 1994.
The appellant explained that on 2 March 1994, he told Somasamy that he wished to surrender himself and the weapons because he had money problems and was being hounded by loan sharks. Moreover, he faced an outstanding warrant of arrest for non-attendance in court for carpark summonses. To add to his problems, his friends from the secret society he belonged to were putting pressure on him to participate in settlement talks. In order to solve these problems, he told Somasamy to charge him for unlawful possession of the weapons and to put him under police supervision so that he would have to remain indoors from 7pm to 7am everyday. In his cross-examination, he agreed that being placed on police supervision would not help him solve his money problems and that instead it would aggravate them. The appellant then changed his evidence and said that he wanted Somasamy to charge him so that he would be sent to prison for two to three years, and thereafter to be placed under police supervision for another two to three years. However, he admitted that this would also not help him to resolve his problems.
It was the appellant`s evidence that both the statements had been fabricated by him because he had on 3 March 1994 been threatened by the police to cooperate. He was able to state certain facts significant to this case in both his statements because he made up his story based on the facts which were given to him by one Sergeant Goh Eng Huat (Sgt Goh) and Insp Maniam.
 The trial judge`s findings
The only issue at trial was whether it was the appellant who had committed the murder. On this, the trial judge found that the appellant had voluntarily surrendered himself to the police and had confessed to the commission of the offence to Somasamy. Later, he had admitted to the killing of the deceased in his s 122(6) statement to Insp Maniam and explained in detail the killing in his long statement. Accordingly, the trial judge convicted the appellant of murder and sentenced him to death.
 The appeal
On appeal, counsel for the appellant raised the following main grounds. To begin, counsel submitted that the trial judge erred in admitting the s 122(6) statement after the voir dire. The second contention was that the contradictions within the appellant`s confessions compared with the main of the prosecution case undermined the entire prosecution case. As such, the reliance placed by the trial judge on the confessions to convict the appellant was wrong. Thirdly, apart from the confessions, there was no other evidence to identify the appellant as the assailant or to link him to the offence. Finally, in all the circumstances, it was submitted that the defence of the appellant should have been accepted.
To address the first ground of appeal, it is necessary for us to set out the evidence on the voir dire. According to the prosecution, the appellant was taken out of the CID lock-up at 9.30am and returned at about 1.05pm on 3 March 1994. This was confirmed by the entries in the lock-up diary. According to Insp Maniam, he saw the appellant for about five minutes at about 9.30am and found the appellant to be cooperative. Then, Insp Maniam sent the appellant for a pre-statement medical examination at Alexandra Hospital. When the appellant returned at 10.35am, the statement was recorded from him in the presence of an interpreter. After the statement was taken, the appellant was sent for the post-statement medical examination. It was Dr Loh Ngai Kun (Dr Loh) of Alexandra Hospital who examined the appellant at 10.05am and 12.40pm that day, as confirmed by the medical records. Dr Loh did not note that there was any visible wounds or injuries. In conclusion, the prosecution stated that the statement was made without inducement, threat or promise.
According to the appellant, on the morning of 3 March 1994, he was taken out of the lock-up three times. Shortly after breakfast at about 8am, he was taken out of the lock-up by Sgt Goh and brought to Insp Maniam`s office where he remained for approximately 45 minutes before being returned to the lock-up. Ten minutes later, he was taken to a room on the third floor of the CID building where he was assaulted and threatened by Sgt Goh and another officer for about 15 minutes. The appellant described the assault in some detail. He alleged that after the assault, he suffered blue-black bruises on his palms, a red line depression on his wrist and swelling of his ankles, all of which lasted for two days. On the third occasion, he was brought out of the lock-up and taken to Insp Maniam`s office again where the s 122(6) statement was recorded. Prior to the recording of the statement, no medical examination was conducted.
At the conclusion of the voir dire, the trial judge considered the allegations of the appellant to be blatant lies and accepted the evidence of the police officers. Having carefully reviewed the evidence on the voir dire and the submissions of counsel for the appellant, we were entirely in agreement with the trial judge that the statement was made without any threats or assault. The entries in the lock-up diary which were not disputed clearly supported the prosecution`s version of the morning`s events. If the appellant was to be believed, it would mean more than one entry was missing in the lock-up diary. Moreover, it was pertinent to note that Dr Loh did not find that there were any such injuries as alleged by the appellant. The medical examination conducted at 10.05am also showed that the appellant could not have been assaulted by the police at the time he alleged in his narration of the morning`s events. For the above reasons, we upheld the trial judge`s decision to admit the s 122(6) statement.
We turn our attention next to counsel`s contention that in view of the various inconsistencies in the confessions compared with the prosecution version of the events, the confessions did not support the prosecution case. In the event, the weight accorded to them by the trial judge to convict the appellant was undue. Counsel for the appellant drew our attention specifically to the following inconsistencies: (1) in the oral confession to Somasamy, the appellant had confessed to a murder at Desker Road and not at Chander Road; (2) in his statements, he had confessed that he used a parang, contrary to the prosecution evidence that an axe was used; and (3) the other circumstances surrounding the attack as contained in the confessions were different from the main of the prosecution case.
We observed that Desker Road is also in the Serangoon Road area and is very near to Chander Road where the murder took place. In our opinion, the inconsistency was immaterial because the oral admission must be considered in its totality. The significance of the oral confession to Somasamy was that the appellant admitted to the commission of a murder which was uncannily similar to the murder of the deceased. In the premises, the oral confession supported the prosecution case and deserved to be accorded some weight.
The next contradiction involved the weapon allegedly used by the appellant. In his long statement, the appellant confessed to using a parang to attack the deceased. The relevant parts of the appellant`s long statement were as follows: 
 
I left the coffee-shop alone and headed for the van. I armed myself with a parang from the van and walked towards the coffee-shop ... I proceeded into the coffee-shop and straight away attacked the deceased with the parang I was armed, whom I presumed to be a member of the rival gang. I went behind the deceased and used the sharp side of the parang and slashed the back of the deceased`s head ... I then fled from the coffee-shop followed by the other members of my gang. I was still armed with the parang ...
 
 
 
However, the prosecution case was that the appellant had used an axe to injure the deceased. The eye witnesses said that an axe was used. Prof Chao`s opinion was that one injury of the deceased was consistent with an axe being used while the other two slash wounds could have been inflicted by a sharp object like an axe or a parang.
At trial, the appellant was not asked to explain that part of the statement because his defence was that he was not at the coffee-shop. It was not his defence that he had only used a parang and could not have fatally injured the deceased. However, the appellant explained generally that the statement was concocted based on facts supplied by the police officers. Like the trial judge, we were unable to accept the explanation. If indeed the entire statement was concocted by the appellant based on facts supplied by the police, there would be no reason why the recording officer would state the weapon used as a parang and not an axe. Therefore, we were of the opinion that the statement was made by the appellant based on the facts which he knew. In the event, regardless of the reason why he described in the statement that the weapon used was a parang, the other parts of the statement which showed that the appellant knew the location of the coffee-shop, how the deceased was attacked from behind and that someone else was with the deceased, could still be considered by the court. Thus, the inconsistency in the statement was not crucial.
Briefly, the other inconsistencies as pointed out by counsel for the appellant include the fact that in his s 122(6) statement, the appellant stated that bottles and chairs were thrown at his gang members by others present at the coffee-shop during the attack. The appellant also said that eight other members of his gang joined him in the attack and that six other members of the rival gang were involved. The prosecution evidence however was that this in fact had not happened. We considered that the obvious reason for the appellant to add such details in his statement was to justify his actions and deny the full responsibility for the attack. Thus, the apparent inconsistencies in the prosecution case caused by some of the embellishments in the appellant`s statements were, in our judgment, not fatal to the prosecution case.
By the above, we concluded that the importance with which the trial judge treated the confessions was justified. The ground of appeal was dismissed.
The next submission was that none of the eye witnesses of the attack were able to identify the appellant in an identification parade held after the arrest of the appellant nor at the trial proper. Counsel for the appellant thus contended that, in substance, the only direct evidence against the appellant was his own statements to the police and the evidence was insufficient to convict the appellant of the charge. We found little merit in these submissions. First, there was not one but four separate occasions when the appellant admitted his crime. Besides the s 122(6) statement, the long statement and the oral confession to Somasamy, there was also the appellant`s visit to the scene with the police. The trial judge found that the visit took place and we saw no reason to upset the finding. As such, we observed that the appellant was able to point out where the deceased was seated and to accurately describe the attack at the coffee-shop. As regards the statements and the oral confession to Somasamy, we reiterate what has already been said in the preceding paragraphs that they described in detail the unfortunate killing of the deceased. To our minds, the four separate confessions provided sufficient evidence to prove beyond reasonable doubt the guilt of the appellant.
Moreover, there was other evidence, although circumstantial in nature, that linked the appellant to the attack. The assailant who was armed with an axe had said words to the effect: `If you have any trouble, look for the Ang Soon Tong` as he was running out of the coffee-shop. The assailant had also shouted at the people in the coffee-shop in a mixture of Malay and Hokkien. In court, the appellant testified that he was conversant in Malay and Hokkien. In his statements, he admitted that he was the headman of Gi Leng Kiat and described the rivalry between Ang Soon Tong and his own gang. From his statements, it was clear that the attack at the coffee-shop was linked to the hostility between the two rival gangs that started two to three months prior to the attack. Thus the ground of appeal was rejected.
Finally, it was counsel`s submission that the defence of the appellant that he was not the assailant should have been believed. After reviewing the evidence, we were unable to find any reason to reverse the finding of the trial judge that the appellant`s defence was not to be believed. One observation to be made was that the appellant had not attempted to provide any information as to his whereabouts at the material time. Having regard to all that we have said above, we were in agreement with the trial judge that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the assailant who attacked the deceased and fled from the scene. Accordingly we dismissed the appeal.

This was a criminal motion of the appellant for an order that the taxation of the costs in this criminal case be reviewed and that the appellant`s objections, which constituted nine items of objections, to the getting-up item fixed by the deputy registrar of the High Court at $16,000 be allowed. At the conclusion of the hearing of the criminal motion, I ruled that the appellant had no right to apply to me sitting as a High Court judge to review the taxation on the ground that there is no statutory provision, unlike those applicable to a civil case, which permitted such a review. In any event, I also ruled that if I had the jurisdiction to do so, I would affirm the sum of $16,000 which was allowed by the deputy registrar as the getting-up item. I further ordered the appellant to pay to the respondent the full costs taxed by the deputy registrar. In exercise of my discretion, I did not make any order as to the costs of and in connection with the criminal motion.
 The background
The appellant was tried and convicted of three charges under s 96 of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134). The three-day trial in the district court took place towards the end of 1985. The appellant was represented by Mr Gerald Godfrey QC assisted by Mr Mak Kok Weng and Mr Suppiah. In the event, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to pay a total fine of $12,000 in addition to a penalty of $26,642.28. He appealed to the High Court.
On 28 May 1990, the appeal came up before me for hearing. But the appellant withdrew his appeal. Counsel for the respondent invited me to exercise my powers under s 262(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)(`the CPC`) and order such costs against the appellant as the High Court shall think fit. Section 262(1) of the CPC provides: `The High Court shall have full power in all proceedings under Part VII to award such costs to be paid by or to the parties thereto as the Court thinks fit.`
There are two subsections to the section. They are irrelevant for present purposes. It was also common ground that that appeal was a proceeding within and governed by Pt VII of the CPC. When considering the application of counsel for the respondent, I did not have, as was patently obvious, any material before me in relation to the work done by counsel for the respondent nor of the disbursements (including leading counsel`s costs) which had been incurred by the respondent. As I had the power `to award such costs ... as the Court thinks fit`, I decided that the appellant shall pay such costs as shall be taxed by the registrar.
On 15 November 1990, the bill of costs drawn up by the respondent was taxed by the deputy registrar. The only item of dispute was the getting-up item which the respondent claimed was $20,000 and which the appellant put at only $2,500. The deputy registrar assessed and allowed it at $18,000 which on a subsequent review at the request of the respondent was reduced to $16,000. The appellant, being dissatisfied with this decision, wanted a review of the matter by a judge-in- chambers purportedly under O 59 r 36(3) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (`the RSC`). That request was clearly misconceived as O 1 r 2(2) of the RSC expressly provides that the RSC shall not apply to criminal proceedings.
However, the deputy registrar was good enough to set out the grounds of his assessment. He referred to the complex issues of law involved and the need to retain counsel of special skill and experience. He also referred to the voluminous record which he had reviewed. He even stated that if the appeal had not been withdrawn, he would have awarded a higher figure.
 The law
Realizing that he could not seek a review under the RSC, the appellant filed the criminal motion. Counsel for the appellant before me pointed to s 5 of the CPC and submitted that as costs went to procedure, the English Costs in Criminal Cases (General) Regulations 1986 SI 198 No 1335 should be made applicable in Singapore with such modifications as may be necessary. Counsel for the respondent then referred me to the opening words of s 5 of the CPC, which state: `As regards matters of criminal procedure for which no special provision has been made by this Code ...`. It was submitted that the matter was clearly governed by s 262(1) of the CPC and that therefore English law has no application so far as the question of costs is concerned. I accepted the submission as plainly right.
As s 262(1) of the CPC has in very wide terms and finally left the question of costs and the manner such costs shall be assessed to the High Court, I made the orders I did.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The first plaintiffs are a company incorporated in Singapore and they carry on the business of the manufacture and repair of computer and data processing equipment and accessories, except computer peripheral equipment.
The first defendant, Heng Eng Li, also known as Jocelyn Heng, was a planner employed by the first plaintiffs, and her job entailed collating information on the usage requirements of materials, raising purchase requisitions and scheduling the delivery of these materials to the first plaintiffs` production plants in Singapore and Thailand according to their needs.
The second defendant is the sole proprietor of Gold Circle Enterprise (`GCE`), one of the vendors that supplied the first plaintiffs with materials required by the first plaintiffs to carry on their business. Since 1983, the second defendant had been supplying the first plaintiffs with static control products (anti-static polythene bags, bubble packs and rolls) and clean room products (cotton swabs).
On 21 November 1988, the first plaintiffs commenced this action against the first and second defendants claiming the sum of $1,984,740 which they alleged was the loss and damage suffered by them as a result of the fraudulent acts of the first and second defendants. Alternatively, the first plaintiffs claimed the said sum as money had and received by the second defendant for the use of the first plaintiffs.
On 27 January 1989, the first plaintiffs obtained judgment in default against the first defendant for their claim of $1,984,740 but the judgment was partially satisfied as only $942,940.93 was recovered by the police and paid over to the first plaintiffs.
This action was heard from 23 to 25 August 1993 and on 7 October 1993. At the conclusion of the trial, the parties were given time to file written submissions. The second defendant filed his submissions on 15 November 1993 and the first plaintiffs filed their submissions on 13 December 1993. Before the court could deliver judgment, the first plaintiffs applied for and obtained an order of court on 30 December 1993 to add the second plaintiffs as a party to this action.
Paragraph 1 of the re-amended statement of claim states that the second plaintiffs are a corporation incorporated in the Cayman Islands and they have a branch office registered in Singapore, and that, by an agreement and plan of reconstruction dated 25 September 1989, the first plaintiffs sold, and the second plaintiffs purchased and took over as a going concern, the entire business of the first plaintiffs, comprising all the assets, rights and liabilities of the first plaintiffs. In his re-amended defence, the second defendant pleaded that - 
 
 
(a) he does not have any knowledge of the matters pleaded in para 1 of the re-amended statement of claim by the plaintiffs save that the first plaintiffs was wound up and liquidated on 27 September 1989 pursuant to a members` voluntary winding-up and the sum of $708,212,000 representing surplus assets was returned to the contributories, Seagate Technology Inc, on the same day; 
 
(b) after being wound up, the first plaintiffs could have continued the present action only on the instructions of the liquidators, but no such instructions had been given as the plaintiffs` solicitors knew of the winding-up only on 23 December 1993; 
 
(c) further and in the alternative, the first plaintiffs have been dissolved and have duly ceased to exist, and their purported causes of action, if any, against the second defendant have accordingly ceased; 
 
(d) even if there had been a valid assignment of all the first plaintiffs` assets, rights and liabilities to the second plaintiffs, which is not admitted, the assignment did not include the first plaintiffs` purported causes of action, if any, against the second defendants; and 
 
(e) further and in the alternative, no express notice in writing of the purported assignment had been given to the second defendant.
  
 
 
 
 The background
 
On 3 December 1988, the first defendant was convicted by a district court on five counts of cheating the first plaintiffs into believing that they had purchased lint-free swabs and Alpha texwipes from GCE and, thereby, dishonestly induced the first plaintiffs into paying GCE various sums of money. She pleaded guilty to the five charges. Twenty-eight other similar charges were taken into consideration by the district court for the purpose of passing sentence. On 5 December 1988, the first defendant was sentenced to a total of three years` imprisonment. In the statement of facts which was read out to the court and was admitted by the first defendant, para 15 thereof states that, between February 1987 and November 1988, the first defendant had cheated the first plaintiffs a total amount of $1,984,740 on 28 invoices and attempted to cheat the first plaintiffs of $347,300 on five other invoices.
On 8 August 1991, the second plaintiffs returned to the first defendant the sums of $5,704.66 and $400 representing her arrears of salary.
The holding company of the first plaintiffs, Seagate Technology Inc (`Seagate`), had a policy of insurance issued by the Insurance Company of North America (`the insurers`) in the United States, protecting them against losses suffered by Seagate as a result of the dishonesty of any employee. Seagate made a claim under the policy in respect of the loss caused by the first defendant. On 30 July 1992, the insurers made a partial payment of US$259,876.82 to Seagate in return for a partial release executed by Seagate in favour of the insurers to the extent of its payment. However, by an agreement dated 13 January 1993, the insurers and Seagate agreed that `the payment made previously by [the insurers] to Seagate in the sum of US$259,876.82 shall represent a final, full and complete satisfaction of Seagate`s claim against [the insurers]`. Under the terms of the said agreement, both the insurers and Seagate also released each other, inter alia, of `all rights to subrogation and/or indemnity that either party now has or may in future claim to have against each other, which arise out of, or relate to, the losses forming the basis of Seagate`s claim against [the insurers]`.
 The plaintiffs` case
The plaintiffs` case, as pleaded in their re-amended statement of claim, is as follows: 
 
 
(4) The first and second defendants entered into certain arrangements by which fictitious additional items were included into the invoices tendered by the second defendant to the first plaintiffs, thereby inducing the first plaintiffs to pay higher sums on the second defendant`s invoices.
  
 
 
Particulars
The plaintiffs will rely on the particulars pleaded in para 8 herein. 
(5) Further or in the alternative, in respect of invoices set out hereunder, the first and second defendants arranged for goods to be removed from the first plaintiffs` store and redelivered to the first plaintiffs under invoices made out by the second defendant`s firm [GCE]. 
(6) The payments to the second defendant made in respect of the fictitious items were then divided between the first and second defendants. 
(7) As a consequence of the acts of the first and second defendants, the first plaintiffs have suffered loss and damage. 
(8) Further and in the alternative, the first plaintiffs claim the sum of $1,984,740 being money payable by the first and second defendants to the first plaintiffs for money had and received by the first and second defendants for the use of the first plaintiffs. 
...
 
 
 
 
 The defence
 
In his re-amended defence the second defendant, inter alia, denied that: 
 
 
(a) he had conspired or arranged with the first defendant to defraud or injure the first plaintiffs as alleged in paras 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the re-amended statement of claim or at all; 
 
(b) he did any of the overt acts alleged in paras 4, 5, and 6 of the re-amended statement of claim in pursuance of any conspiracy or at all; and 
 
(c) he had entered into arrangements with the first defendant or with anyone at all for goods to be removed or caused to be removed from the first plaintiffs` store and redelivered to the first plaintiffs under invoices made out by GCE.
  
 
 
The second defendant also pleaded that if the first plaintiffs had suffered any loss and damage, they were the result of the first defendant`s fraud, if any, on the first plaintiffs who were the first defendant`s employer and, alternatively, that the loss and damage were caused by the default and sole negligence of the first plaintiffs, the particulars of which are: 
 
 
(a) failing to keep a proper account of the items ordered by and supplied to them; 
 
(b) failing, as employers of the first defendant, to monitor the manner in which the first defendant as their employee exercised her authority whilst acting in the course of her employment; and 
 
(c) failing, as her employers, to discover the breach of duty by the first defendant.
  
 
 
The second defendant further pleaded that, by reason of Seagate`s settlement with the insurers, the first plaintiffs are not entitled to recover the sum of $1,984,740 or, alternatively, the plaintiffs` entitlement to damages should be reduced by the sum received by Seagate from the insurers and the sums paid by the second plaintiffs to the first defendant as her arrears of salary.
 The second defendant`s counterclaim
The second defendant has a counterclaim against the first plaintiffs for $366,864.71 being the value of goods supplied by him to the first plaintiffs between the month of August 1988 and 26 November 1988 for which the second defendant has not been paid. The first plaintiffs` defence to the counterclaim is that they are entitled to a set-off for the amount due to the second defendant.
 The issues
On the basis of the pleadings, the issues before the court are: 
 
 
(a) Did the first and second defendants enter into an arrangement to induce the first plaintiffs to pay higher sums on the second defendant`s invoices? 
 
(b) Did the first and second defendants arrange for goods to be removed from the first plaintiffs` store and to be redelivered to the first plaintiffs under invoices made out by the second defendant`s firm GCE? 
 
(c) Are the first plaintiffs entitled to recover the sum of $1,984,740 from the second defendant as money had and received by the second defendant for the use of the first plaintiffs? 
 
(d) Are the first plaintiffs estopped from recovering any money from the second defendant by virtue of the terms of settlement of their insurance claim? 
 
(e) Have the liquidators of the first plaintiffs given any instructions for the continuation of this action and, if not, can the action be continued against the second defendant? 
 
(f) Have the first plaintiffs ceased to exist by reason of being dissolved and, if so, have their causes of action against the second defendant ceased absolutely?
  
 
 
 
 The facts
 
It is not disputed by the second defendant that, between February 1987 and November 1988, a total amount of $1,984,740 was paid by the first plaintiffs to GCE for Alpha texwipe and lint-free swabs (`LFS`) as listed on 28 invoices issued by GCE.
In the statement of facts tendered in the district court by the prosecution, and admitted by the first defendant, the first defendant`s scheme to cheat the first plaintiffs is described as follows (see agreed bundle of documents, vol 1, atpp 185-189): 
 
The scheme
 
 
 
 
(8) Investigations further revealed that in late 1986, the [first defendant] decided to proceed with her scheme. She contacted [the second defendant], the proprietor of [GCE] who is a vendor of [the first plaintiffs]. She arranged for [the second defendant] to meet her in the office. [GCE] regularly [supplied] `antistatic PE bags` to [the first plaintiffs]. When they met, the [first defendant] related a preplanned story to [the second defendant]. She claimed that she had an uncle in the United States and her uncle had stocks of Alpha texwipe and lint-free swabs (LFS). Her uncle was in financial difficulties and she wanted to help him by assisting him to clear his stocks. She told [the second defendant] that [the first plaintiffs were] using this kind of product and that [the second defendant] could buy the stocks from her uncle through her. She would arrange for the said material to be shipped from United States to Singapore. [The second defendant] would then sell the Alpha texwipe and LFS to [the first plaintiffs]. On receiving payment from [the first plaintiffs], [the second defendant] would pay her the price of the goods less the agreed commission. She told [the second defendant] that this arrangement was necessary as her uncle did not have any company in Singapore. She promised to give [the second defendant] at least $3 commission per packet sold to [the first plaintiffs] and asked him whether he was interested in the venture. After some consideration, [the second defendant] agreed to take part in this business venture which he thought was genuine. The [first defendant] directed [the second defendant] to approach the [the first plaintiffs`] staff in charge of buying Alpha texwipe and LFS, to negotiate for [the second defendant`s firm GCE] to sell the said items to [the first plaintiffs]. [The second defendant] did as he was told and his firm was given approval to supply the said materials to [the first plaintiffs]. 
 
(9) After [the second defendant`s] firm was approved to supply Alpha texwipe and LFS to [the first plaintiffs], the [first defendant] would raise a purchasing requisition which would include GCE as a supplier of the said items. Purchasing requisition is a form used to identify three months` ... requirements for materials that would be running out of stock. The [first defendant] also knew that Utopia Aire Pte Ltd was supplying Alpha texwipe and LFS to [the first plaintiffs]. The [first defendant] would increase the requirements of LFS by a certain percentage. That is, if the actual LFS requirement was for example 1,000 packets, she would raise a purchasing requisition for 2,000 packets. Utopia Aire Pte Ltd would then supply 1,000 packets of LFS, which was the actual requirement for the company`s production needs, and [the second defendant`s] firm [GCE] would supply the other 1,000 packets which was falsely generated by the [first defendant] to cheat the [first plaintiffs]. 
 
(10) When the [first defendant] first conceived the scheme to cheat the [first plaintiffs], she could not add the items that she wanted to cheat into the delivery orders of [GCE] because during then (sic) the audit team present in the store was very strict. As she was unable to add in the LFS that she wanted to cheat in the delivery order, she conceived another plan. She knew that Utopia Aire Pte Ltd would supply LFS to [the first plaintiffs]. When this was received, she would raise a request form to the storekeeper to get the store to transfer the LFS to the shipping department. The [first defendant] would tell the storekeeper that the LFS is for the use of [the first plaintiffs`] plant in Bangkok. After the storekeeper had transferred the LFS (and, on one occasion, Alpha texwipe TX 1009) to [the first plaintiffs`] shipping department, which was also within the same premises, the [first defendant] would call and instruct the shipping department not to ship the LFS to Bangkok. She would, further, give instruction for the LFS to be returned to the vendor. The shipping department would not know who the vendor was and she would then contact [GCE`s] delivery contractor to go to [the first plaintiffs`] shipping department to collect the LFS. The LFS would then be brought back to [GCE`s] store at Jurong to be repacked and subsequently delivered to [the first plaintiffs`] store again with [GCE`s] delivery order. 
 
(11) This method to cheat [the first plaintiffs] was long-winded and after about ten occasions, the [first defendant] noted that the audit team in the [first plaintiffs`] store had become relaxed in their checks. This time she put her initial scheme, of adding LFS into [GCE`s] delivery order, into action. 
 
(12) When [GCE`s] delivery contractor delivered other materials to [the first plaintiffs`] store, and after all receiving procedures were complied with as described earlier, the [first defendant] would be given a copy of the delivery order. Instead of forwarding it to the finance department immediately, the [first defendant] would keep the copy of the delivery order. When [GCE`s] delivery contractor next sent materials to [the first plaintiffs] again, the [first defendant] would place the copy of [GCE`s] delivery order in an envelope with a note attached indicating the quantity of LFS to be added in that delivery order. The delivery contractor would bring back the envelope to [GCE`s] store in Jurong where [GCE`s] warehouse and transport contractor, one Lim Choon Huat, who was in charge of issuing stocks and typing of delivery order, would open up the envelope containing the delivery order. The warehouse contractor would match the copy returned by the [first defendant] with those copies returned to them earlier on after [the first plaintiffs`] store had received the materials. Lim Choon Huat would type the amount of LFS on the earlier copies of the delivery order and the one returned by the [first defendant] (all of the same serial numbers). 
 
(13) After Lim Choon Huat had typed in the LFS on the delivery order as an additional item, he would hand the copy of the delivery order returned by the [first defendant] in an envelope to the delivery contractor, when he next sent [GCE`s] materials to [the first plaintiffs] again. The delivery contractor, usually one Tan Cheng Oon, would then hand over the envelope containing the altered delivery order to the [first defendant]. The [first defendant] would then forward it to [the first plaintiffs`] finance department. Later, when [GCE] invoiced [the first plaintiffs], it would include the LFS for payment as indicated in the altered delivery order. As the copy of the delivery order supplied for invoicing matched the altered copy handed to the finance department by the [first defendant], the finance department would pay accordingly. 
 
(14) To further evade detection by the [first plaintiffs], the [first defendant] would sometimes key into the store`s computer system, registering the amount of LFS `received` from [GCE] and she would, at the same time, `release` the amount of LFS keyed in using the Bangkok code, to indicate that those LFS had been shipped to Bangkok.
  
 
 
 
 The evidence
 
The evidence of Mr Goh Yong Chew (`Mr Goh`), the first plaintiffs` director of materials control, was as follows. In 1988, he was the first plaintiffs` store manager. His duties included the management of receipt, storage and issue or re-issue of materials. In the course of his duties, he would perform random audit checks. In 1987, the first defendant was a planner reporting directly to him. She was the planner in charge of indirect materials, which are materials not made into a disk drive. Packaging materials and LFS would be considered as indirect materials. As a planner, the first defendant had to check material requirements and plan for replenishment. She was responsible for making sure that materials did not run out. When materials were running low, she would make a requisition for the materials.
Mr Goh gave the following description of the first plaintiffs` procedure for the requisition of materials. In 1987, when a planner raised a purchase requisition, she would attach, with the purchase requisition, a system-generated usage report and an inventory status form. The purchase requisition would be approved by him and the vice-president of materials. When the approval was given, it would be submitted to the purchasing department for the issue of a purchase order. The planner would also make a recommendation as to where the supplies could be obtained from. When a purchase order was issued, a copy of that purchase order would be given to the planner and she would pass it to the vendor and liaise with him on delivery dates. The vendor would deliver the materials directly to the first plaintiffs` premises. The storekeeper would receive the materials and would sign four copies of the documents. The storekeeper would retain one copy and the rest would be returned to the vendor. The copy that is retained would be copied for the data clerk who would then key the information into the computer system. The delivery order that was retained would be given to the finance department.
Mr Goh further testified that he discovered the fraud committed by the first defendant when he carried out an audit check on LFS on 7 November 1988. He concluded from his findings that there was a systematic scheme to defraud the first plaintiffs by tampering with - 
 
 
(a) the delivery orders of GCE, to give the impression that the LFS was delivered to the first plaintiffs, when, in fact, no LFS were ever delivered; and 
 
(b) the first plaintiffs` computer system, to show a larger quantity of goods shipped to the first plaintiffs` plant in Bangkok, when, in fact, a lesser quantity, or, in some cases, none, was actually shipped to Bangkok.
  
 
 
The scheme created an illusion of LFS being shipped to Bangkok when, in fact, no LFS were received by the first plaintiffs or shipped to Bangkok. When Mr Goh uncovered the fraud, he brought it to the attention of the first plaintiffs` senior management on 17 November 1988, who, in turn, briefed the first plaintiffs` director of security, Mr L Thambiah. At that time, Mr Goh was only able to locate four of GCE`s delivery orders and he gave them to his senior management.
Mr Goh denied that the fraud was caused by the negligence of the first plaintiffs in failing to keep proper control of materials or otherwise, or that the first plaintiffs failed to monitor the manner in which the first defendant exercised her authority. He said that all the vendors dealing with the first plaintiffs knew that the first plaintiffs issued meticulous purchase orders, and would not accept goods from any vendor without proper documentation. He said that the first plaintiffs were able to discover the fraud because of the safeguards adopted by them.
The following evidence was adduced during the cross-examination of Mr Goh: 
 
 
(a) Audit checks of indirect materials were carried out by the first plaintiffs monthly, and, by 7 November 1988, the first plaintiffs had carried out 11 audit checks on indirect materials for the year 1988. 
 
(b) A vendor or supplier of the first plaintiffs would not know about the system of issuing materials from the first plaintiffs` store and the input of data into the computer system. The computer system was a security system and only the store personnel would have access to the system. 
 
(c) After 17 November 1988, when the fraud committed by the first defendant was discovered, the first plaintiffs continued to require GCE to make deliveries to the first plaintiffs under various purchase orders that had been issued to GCE previously. 
 
(d) The first plaintiffs` plant in Bangkok does not purchase LFS directly from the United States.
  
 
 
The testimony of Mr L Thambiah, the first plaintiffs` director of security, was as follows. He was an assistant commissioner of police before he joined the first plaintiffs. He was informed of the fraud on 17 November 1988. On the same day, he interviewed the first defendant and recorded a statement from her between 12.50pm and 2.10pm and a statement from the second defendant from 2.20pm and 3.30pm. He interviewed the second defendant in English, and Alan Leong and Stanley Aloysius were with him during the interview. Stanley Aloysius assisted him in the preparation of the second defendant`s statement. Mr Thambiah said the second defendant gave the statement voluntarily and no threat or inducement was made to the second defendant before, during or after the recording of the statement by him, Stanley Aloysius or Alan Leong.
The following evidence was adduced during the cross-examination of Mr Thambiah: 
 
 
(a) He became the director of security of the first plaintiffs in July 1988. 
 
(b) By 2.10pm, when he finished recording a statement from the first defendant, he was sure that she had cheated her employers. 
 
(c) When he was asked whether he told the second defendant, `you are not involved, never mind, you make a statement for me`, he said he did not recall making such a statement. 
 
(d) The second defendant seemed to understand what he said to him and the second defendant`s English was average. 
 
(e) When he spoke to the second defendant, he was quite satisfied, from the first defendant`s statement, that the LFS and texwipe stated in the four delivery orders of GCE were fictitious deliveries. He agreed that the word `fictitious` was used in the statement recorded from the first defendant a number of times. 
 
(f) When it was put to Mr Thambiah that the word `fictitious` was his and it did not originate from the second defendant, Mr Thambiah said that when he mentioned the delivery orders, the second defendant came up with the word `fictitious`. 
 
(g) When he recorded the second defendant`s statement, the second defendant gave a statement as a witness and not as an accused person. 
 
(h) After the second defendant signed the statement, he was allowed to go home.
  
 
 
Alan Leong, who was a security supervisor of the first plaintiffs at the material time, testified that Mr Thambiah interviewed the second defendant in English and the second defendant spoke English fluently. He also said that `after the second defendant gave his statement, he was allowed to leave`. He and Stanley Aloysius did not threaten the second defendant before or during the recording of the statement.
In cross-examination, Alan Leong denied that he said to the second defendant, `you better tell the truth or you will not be so comfortable sitting here as we will be putting you to the CID and there will be long investigations`. He further denied that when the second defendant told him that he did not do anything wrong or know anything about the fraud committed by the first defendant he again threatened the second defendant by saying, `I give you five minutes to think it over and give me a true statement`. He agreed with the counsel for the second defendant that, as soon as the second defendant signed the statement, he was allowed to leave the first plaintiffs` premises.
Mr Stanley Aloysius testified that Mr Thambiah interviewed the second defendant in English and the second defendant did not appear to have any difficulty answering the questions that were put to him. During the interview, he recorded the statement and it was typed by the typist. The interview started at 2.20pm and ended at 3.30pm and the typing took at least another hour. The defendant was allowed to leave after he signed the statement.
The following evidence was adduced during the cross-examination of Mr Aloysius: 
 
 
(a) When he was asked whether the second defendant had repeatedly said that he was not involved, Mr Aloysius said that he did not recall. 
 
(b) When he was asked whether Alan Leong had shouted at the second defendant and threatened him into making a statement, Mr Aloysius said he did not remember any such words being said.
  
 
 
Under cross-examination, Lye Hang Kee, the first plaintiffs` financial controller, explained how the sum of US$259,876.82 was arrived at by the insurers, and on being questioned as to why the first plaintiffs had restricted their right to claim under the policy to only US$600,000, he said (NE, at p 50): 
 
We had the choice of letting the insurers pay in full and go after [the second defendant] or we pursue our claim against [the second defendant] and settle the difference. We opted for the second choice.
 
 
 
As for the reason for making that choice, Lye Hang Kee admitted that there was an agreement between Seagate`s corporate office and the insurers that if they were to settle for US$259,876.82, the insurers wanted them to go ahead and claim the balance against the second defendant.
Lye Hang Kee also gave the following evidence when he was cross-examined by counsel for the second defendant (NE, at pp 51-52): 
 
 
Q: This is amazing! Seagate pays a premium for its employees` fraud and Seagate is foregoing its right to claim in full under the policy in exchange for an agreement for the convenience of the insurers? 
 
A: I won`t say it`s for the convenience of the insurers. It was decided at the management level that this was the best way to go about it. 
 
Q: Even though the management were fully aware that they were entitled to the full claim under the policy? 
 
A: If it is proven. 
 
Q: On what date was US$259,876.82 paid? 
 
A: 29 or 30 June 1990. 
 
Q: What was the US$/S$ conversion rate? 
 
A: It was about US$1 to S$1.625. Rate of US$1 to S$1.9 was used when the fraud was committed. 
 
Q: This amount was received by your company in full and final settlement of all claims against your insurance company? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
The evidence of the second defendant was briefly as follows. Sometime in or about early 1987, the first defendant informed him that she had an uncle by the name of Mr Aw in the United States who was in the business of supplying clean room products and that the uncle was in financial difficulties. The first defendant asked him to help her uncle to dispose of the balance of his stocks of goods which included texwipe and LFS. At that time, GCE did not supply these products to the first plaintiffs. The first defendant proposed to him that GCE purchase, through her, LFS and texwipe from the United States for sale to the first plaintiffs for use in their Singapore and Thailand plants. By this proposal, the first defendant was to arrange for the shipment of those goods to GCE, which would repack them for delivery to the first plaintiffs. Upon GCE receiving payment from the first plaintiffs for the goods so supplied, GCE would pay the first defendant the cost of the goods, less the profits agreed to be made by GCE.
The second defendant testified that after a few shipments had been made and delivered to the first plaintiffs in accordance with the aforesaid arrangement, the first defendant further proposed that these shipments be made direct from the United States to the first plaintiffs` plant in Thailand instead, in order to save costs on freight and repacking. As this proposal was made by the first defendant acting in her capacity as the first plaintiffs` employee, he agreed to it. Under this arrangement, upon confirmation by the first defendant that the first plaintiffs` plant in Thailand had received the goods, the first defendant would inform GCE`s warehouseman, Lim Choon Huat, an independent contractor, of the same so as to enable the necessary invoice to be raised on the first plaintiffs. On receipt of payment by the first plaintiffs, GCE retained the sum of $80,850, being their agreed profits/commission under the arrangement with the first defendant, and paid her the total sum of $1,858,770, being the cost of the goods. This arrangement between GCE and the first defendant on the first plaintiffs` behalf for direct shipment from the United States to the first plaintiffs` plant in Thailand, was carried out and shipments were made pursuant thereto until 17 November 1988, when the first plaintiffs, for the first time, notified him that there had been no direct shipments from the United States to Thailand as had been notified by the first defendant to GCE. The second defendant said he had no knowledge whether there was such shipments or not as he relied entirely on the first defendant as the first plaintiffs` employee on the system of purchase and delivery. The total amount retained by him out of the sums paid by the first plaintiffs was $80,850, which was given over by him to the police during their investigations and the said amount had been refunded to the first plaintiffs. He has not retained any money out of the total sum of $1,984,740 paid by the first plaintiffs to GCE as set out in para 8 of the amended statement of claim. He denied that he had entered into any arrangement with the first defendant or with anyone at all, by which fictitious additional items were added into the invoices tendered by him to the first plaintiffs. The second defendant also denied that he and the first defendant had arranged for the LFS and Alpha texwipe to be removed from the first plaintiffs` store and redelivered to the first plaintiffs under invoices made out by GCE. If the first defendant did any such acts, they were not done with his knowledge or consent, nor did he in any way authorize or connive at the same.
The second defendant testified that Lim Choon Huat (`Mr Lim`) was the sole proprietor of Weng Moh Warehousing & Transportation Services and Mr Lim had a warehouse in Jurong. GCE`s office at that time was in Ubi Road. He used Mr Lim`s warehousing and transportation services for storing all his goods such as polyethylene bags, cotton swabs and zip lock bags. He knew Mr Lim in 1980. Insofar as deliveries were concerned, initially he prepared his delivery orders and handed them to Mr Lim. A few years later, when he had trust in Mr Lim, he handed his delivery orders to him and Mr Lim would type in all the particulars in the delivery orders. His office was far from Mr Lim`s warehouse and it was inconvenient for Mr Lim to go to his office every day to obtain the necessary delivery orders. He handed a book of delivery orders to Mr Lim. Mr Lim would type in the particulars in the delivery orders and then send the delivery orders with the goods to the customers. He informed Mr Lim that the delivery order must have a purchase order from the customer, otherwise the customer would not accept delivery against the delivery order. This arrangement he had with Mr Lim applied to all his customers which included the first plaintiffs, Texas Instrument, Digital Equipment, Motorola and AT & T.
As regards his statement recorded by Alan Leong, the second defendant said that Alan Leong threatened him into giving the first plaintiffs a statement by saying the following words or words to the following effect: 
 
You better tell the truth or you will not be so comfortable sitting here as we will put you to the CID and there will be long investigations.
 
 
 
When he kept on saying that he did not do it or know anything about the fraud by the first defendant, Alan Leong threatened him again by saying: 
 
I give you five minutes to think it over and give me the true statement.
 
 
 
By this, Alan Leong implied that he could not leave until he gave a statement admitting that he was involved with the first defendant or that Alan Leong would refer him to the CID. While he was speaking to Alan Leong, Mr Thambiah came into the room and said: 
 
You are not involved. Never mind you make a statement for me.
 
 
 
Mr Thambiah then sat down, spoke to him in English and started to prepare a statement which was recorded by a Eurasian man, after which he sent it for typing. When it came back, he was asked to read it, but because he was not sure as to what the word `fictitious` meant in relation to the invoices, he did not pay attention to it. At that time, he was only concerned that he should make a statement and, therefore, his attention was drawn more to the figures referred to in the invoices that he was shown. He then signed the statement in the presence of Mr Thambiah without realizing until much later that it was inaccurate. He was only allowed to leave the premises of the first plaintiffs after he signed the statement. He was educated in Nanyang University and his understanding of the English language is limited. His statement recorded by Mr Thambiah is incomplete and did not afford him an opportunity to explain the nature of the arrangement he had with the first defendant for the sale of LFS to the first plaintiffs` plant in Bangkok which he obtained from the first defendant`s uncle in the United States, and he was not aware that the first defendant had made use of him to cheat her employers; it has always been his belief that his transactions with the first plaintiffs, through the first defendant, were genuine.
The second defendant said that the following portion in the statement of the first defendant recorded by Mr Thambiah is not true: 
 
 
(4) About a year ago, I rang up the second defendant and asked whether he was interested in entering into a business venture. I explained to him that I would add an additional item to the invoice which he had to present to Seagate for payment. I told him for every payment received by him for the fictitious items, he could keep $3 for each packet. I also told him that the remainder sum should be to me by cheque. He agreed to my terms. Since then, I have been including additional fictitious items to the delivery order of [GCE]. For each the fictitious items I included in the delivery order, I received payments ranging from $10,000 and $20,000, after deductions made by [GCE] as part of the bargain. So far, I can recall receiving payments for fictitious items for more than four delivery orders.
  
 
 
The second defendant said that he only earned a commission of $3 per packet of LFS and the price of each packet was $46. Had he known that the first defendant was cheating her employer and agreed to participate in her scheme, he would not have settled for a small sum of $3 as commission. Seagate was his biggest customer and he had plenty to lose.
In cross-examination, the second defendant gave the following evidence in relation to the purported purchase of LFS from the first defendant`s uncle, Mr Aw (NE, at pp 98-99): 
 
 
Q: She asked you to help out her uncle? 
 
A: On one occasion, I saw her wiping her tears. I felt embarrassed. I asked her what was the problem. She asked me to help her uncle. 
 
Q: Did you ask her anything about her uncle to establish his business credibility? 
 
A: No, it doesn`t concern me. 
 
Q: Surely it concerns you if you are to buy something from him? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You didn`t even have the business name of the uncle? 
 
A: She told me the company had closed down. It is pointless for me to know. 
 
Q: Did you ask to go and see the stock yourself? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: You knew these were expensive items? 
 
A: At first, I did not know. I was not dealing with this product. 
 
Q: By the time you received the first purchase order for texwipe and LFS, you knew you were dealing with expensive items? 
 
A: Yes, subsequently. 
 
Q: Even with this knowledge you did not take any steps to verify that the stocks exist? 
 
A: I did. When the goods were sent to the warehouse, I went to the warehouse to inspect the goods to check whether the goods existed.
  
 
 
When the second defendant was cross-examined by counsel for the plaintiffs as to whether he knew that the goods came from the first plaintiffs` premises, he gave the following evidence (NE, at pp 104-105): 
 
 
Q: You knew that these goods came from [the first plaintiffs`] premises through Tan Cheng Oon? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did that arouse any suspicion in your mind? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Although you were suspicious, you did not ask [the first defendant] to give you proof that goods came from USA? 
 
A: Yes, I asked [the first defendant]. She said the goods were from USA. 
 
Q: You did not ask for shipping documents for the goods? 
 
A: I did ask her but she did not show me. 
 
Q: Didn`t that arouse suspicion even more? 
 
A: I was only a buyer. It is not possible for a seller to show me the documents and the costs. I did ask her. 
 
Q: Did not her refusal to show you the documents even arouse your suspicion further? 
 
A: It did. 
 
Q: You did not receive any proof and yet you let the matter drop? 
 
A: In my mind, I did ask myself if the goods belonged to [the first plaintiffs], the goods would not be easily taken out of Seagate. They have very good controls. They are an American company. 
 
Q: So it crossed your mind that these goods could belong to [the first plaintiffs]? 
 
A: It did cross my mind but I thought that it was not possible for someone to take out their goods. 
 
Q: The fact remains that Tan Cheng Oon collected the goods from [the first plaintiffs`] premises and you knew about it from Mr Lim? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You knew that [the first plaintiffs`] security was strict? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Shouldn`t the fact that Mr Tan could collect the goods from [the first plaintiffs] without supporting documents further arouse your suspicion? 
 
A: That depends on whom the goods belonged to. Since the goods belonged to [the first defendant`s] uncle, I can understand why there is no delivery order. 
 
Q: Did you make enquiries with any other officers of [the first plaintiffs] pertaining to these goods that were coming out of [the first plaintiffs` premises]? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
In cross-examination, the second defendant also gave the following evidence on his delivery orders that were issued by his warehouse contractor on his behalf (see NE at p 113): 
 
 
Q: Would you agree that a delivery order amounts to a certification that the goods therein were delivered? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: You would also agree that your invoices are based on your delivery orders as well? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: [The first plaintiffs] would pay you based on what you state on your invoices and delivery orders? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: [The first plaintiffs] was mistaken in respect of all these payments because they believed all the goods were delivered when they were not? 
 
A: I also believed that the goods were delivered. Both [the first plaintiffs] and I were mistaken.
  
 
 
The second defendant also gave the following evidence (NE, at p 112): 
 
 
Q: You thought you were buying goods from [the first defendant`s] uncle? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: When [the first defendant] proposed to you that you buy the goods from her uncle, she was not acting as an employee of Seagate? 
 
A: I can`t comment. 
 
Q: [The first defendant`s] request to you was a personal one? 
 
A: You can put it that way. 
 
Q: So, in effect, [the first defendant] was acting as an agent of her uncle when she was negotiating on the sale of goods? 
 
A: I think so. 
 
Q: You knew at that point in time that [the first defendant`s] duties as a planner does not involve introducing people to buy from her uncle? 
 
A: Yes.
  
 
 
The second defendant called both Lim Choon Huat, the warehouseman, and Tan Cheng Oon, the transport contractor, to give evidence on his behalf.
Mr Lim`s evidence was that, sometime in 1987, the first defendant arranged her own transport and sent some LFS to his warehouse for repacking and to be delivered subsequently to the first plaintiffs. Later, the first defendant called him and requested transportation and he sent Tan Cheng Oon to the first plaintiffs` premises to see her. Tan Cheng Oon then returned with LFS which the first defendant told him to repack, after which he delivered them to the first plaintiffs. Each time there were goods to be repacked, he would get a call from the first defendant requesting him to take delivery of some goods from the first plaintiffs` premises to his warehouse for repacking and then redeliver them on the first defendant`s instructions after repacking them. He did not know the reason for the repacking. As she was a senior officer of the first plaintiffs, he carried out her instructions without question. For the transportation of the goods which were carried out at the first defendant`s request, he instructed Tan Cheng Oon to obtain payment from the first defendant.
Mr Lim further testified that after deliveries were made to Seagate, the first defendant would instruct Tan Cheng Oon several days later to take back a delivery order from GCE with a note attached thereto containing particulars of goods for him to insert as additional items in the delivery order. He did so after obtaining the approval from the second defendant to do so. He had no reason to suspect that what was done by the first defendant was wrong or that no goods had in fact been delivered to the first plaintiffs.
Mr Tan Cheng Oon`s evidence was that he picked up some goods from the first plaintiffs` premises and sent them to Mr Lim`s warehouse on the first defendant`s instructions. He remembered that initially he asked the first defendant for a delivery order for the goods but the first defendant told him that there was no need for a delivery order. Mr Tan further testified that he brought envelopes containing documents given to him by the first defendant to Mr Lim on the first defendant`s instruction.
 Conspiracy and fraud
The plaintiffs` cause of action against the second defendant is that there was a conspiracy between the first and second defendants to cheat the first plaintiffs. Conspiracy is an agreement, between two or more persons, to carry out an unlawful act or acts, or to carry out a lawful act by unlawful means. The learned editors of 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) at para 1527 state: 
 
In order to make out a case of conspiracy, the plaintiff must establish (1) an agreement between two or more persons, (2) an agreement for the purpose of injuring the plaintiff and (3) that acts done in execution of that agreement resulted in damage to the plaintiff.
 
 
 
It would appear from the above that all the three essential ingredients of a conspiracy must be established if the first plaintiffs are to succeed in their claim which is founded on conspiracy.
Mr Low submitted, on behalf of the plaintiffs, that there was an agreement between the two defendants to induce or deceive the first plaintiffs to make payment on fraudulent invoices and that it was unnecessary for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendants` predominant purpose was to injure the first plaintiffs. He relied on 
 Lonrho plc v Fayed & Ors 
 .1 In that case, the House of Lords reviewed in detail the earlier cases of 
 Lonrho Ltd & Ors v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd & Ors 
 ,2 
 Metall und Rohstoff AG v Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Inc & Anor 
 ,3 and the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 Lonrho v Fayed 
 .1 The central issue in all those cases was whether there was a need to prove that the defendants` sole and predominant purpose was to injure the first plaintiffs. The House of Lords decided that question in the negative and held that so long as unlawful means were used, that would suffice. That, Mr Low submitted and I agree with him, is the current position today.
However, to my mind, the starting point in a claim in conspiracy is an agreement or understanding between two or more persons to carry out an act or acts. The existence of an agreement must be proved before I need to consider the predominant purpose for which the act or acts are carried out and the means by which such acts are carried out. In this respect, I find little or no assistance in the authorities cited above by Mr Low. The burden of proving the existence of an agreement between the two defendants is on the first plaintiffs and it was held by Lai Kew Chai J in 
 Interschiff Schiffahrtsagentur GmbH v Southern Star Shipping & Trading Pte Ltd 
 4 that a high degree of proof is required. Furthermore, the question of whether a particular defendant was sufficiently a party to an agreement involves a question of fact. Mr Low submitted that the second defendant`s knowledge, actions and conduct showed that he was a party to the fraud or deceit perpetrated on the first plaintiffs.
The question which then arises is: was there an agreement or arrangement between the two defendants to cheat the first plaintiffs? What has emerged from the evidence is this. The first defendant was the first plaintiffs` planner and the second defendant was the sole proprietor of GCE, who supplied the first plaintiffs with materials required by the first plaintiffs to carry on their business. The first defendant reported directly to Mr Goh, the first plaintiffs` director of materials control. The first defendant`s job was to check material requirements and plan for replenishment. Random audit checks were carried out monthly by Mr Goh and purchase requisitions put up by the planners would have to be approved by Mr Goh and the vice-president of materials. When approval was given, a purchase order was issued, a copy of which would be given to the planner who would liaise with the vendor on the delivery date of the materials, which were delivered directly to the first plaintiffs` premises. The materials were received by the storekeeper and the documents pertaining to the receipt would be forwarded to the data clerk to be entered into the computer system. It was also the evidence of Mr Goh that a vendor or supplier of the first plaintiffs would not know about the system of issuing materials from the first plaintiffs` store and the input of data into the computer system and that the computer system was a security system and only the store personnel would have access to the system.
After a careful review of the evidence, I find that the first defendant thought out a scheme to cheat her employers, the first plaintiffs, and she made use of the second defendant to achieve her objective. There is no evidence before me of any agreement between the first and second defendants to cheat the first plaintiffs. When the first defendant pleaded guilty in the district court to five charges of cheating the first plaintiffs, the facts which were admitted by her do not support the first plaintiffs` allegations that - 
 
 
(a) the second defendant was acting in concert with the first defendant to include additional fictitious items in the second defendant`s invoices to induce the first plaintiffs to pay higher sums on the second defendant`s invoices; and 
 
(b) the second defendant was acting in concert with the first defendant to arrange for goods to be removed from the first plaintiffs` store and redelivered to the first plaintiffs under invoices made out by the second defendant`s firm, GCE.
  
 
 
In that statement, the first defendant clearly stated that it was her plan to cheat the first plaintiffs and that the second defendant agreed to the venture thinking that it was a genuine venture and that the second defendant did what she told him to do.
Mr Low submitted that the second defendant admitted to Mr L Thambiah that no goods were actually delivered and that the representations contained in GCE`s invoices and delivery orders were false. Section 31 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) states that admissions are not conclusive proof of the matters admitted, but they may operate as estoppels under the provisions of the Evidence Act. The second defendant has disputed the validity of the matters stated in the statement recorded by Mr Thambiah. Having regard to the explanation given by the second defendant as to the circumstances under which the statement was recorded from him, his level of proficiency in the English language and the fact that the word `fictitious` found in his statement also appears in the statement recorded by the first plaintiffs from the first defendant, I think no weight should be given to the second defendant`s statement.
To my mind, the first defendant made use of the second defendant in her scheme to cheat the first plaintiffs and there is no evidence before me that the second defendant knew of the first defendant`s intention to cheat the first plaintiffs or that no goods were in fact delivered to the first plaintiffs. Mr Low submitted that the second defendant knew that the goods that were purportedly sold by GCE to the first plaintiffs had been taken out of the first plaintiffs` premises. Having heard Mr Goh`s evidence on the tight security controls and system, I was satisfied with the second defendant`s explanation that he did not think it was possible for someone to take goods belonging to the first plaintiffs from the first plaintiffs` premises. I also believed his explanation that he did not insist on documentation for the goods as he was under the impression that the goods belonged to the first defendant`s uncle. I was not convinced, on a balance of probabilities, that there was an agreement or arrangement between the first and second defendants to cheat the first plaintiffs. Accordingly, in the absence of an agreement, the first plaintiffs` action founded on a conspiracy to defraud the first plaintiffs, involving the first and second defendants, must fail.
 The claim for money had and received
It is not disputed that the second defendant was paid the sum of $1,984,740. On the evidence before me, I found that he only retained the sum of $80,850 and the balance was paid to the first defendant. The second defendant handed the sum of $80,850 over to the police during their investigations and the money has since been returned to the first plaintiffs. Mr Khoo submitted on behalf of the second defendant that the plaintiffs` claim must fail as there is no longer any money of the first plaintiffs which is recoverable from the second defendant. Mr Low submitted that the plaintiffs have a valid claim under this head and it is no defence that the second defendant has parted with the money and he referred to 
 Carman v Edwards and Wormald 
 and 
 Agip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson & Ors 
, and the Court of Appeal`s decision. In the 
 Carman 
 case,5 the court held that, even where a defendant received moneys as a result of a fraud to which he had no part to play and of which he had no knowledge, the fact that he no longer held the moneys received but had paid them out was no defence to an action for moneys had and received. In the 
 Agip 
 case,6 Millet J at p 396 said: 
 
... Unlike a tracing claim in equity, the common law claim for money had and received is a personal, and not a proprietary, claim and the cause of action is complete when the money is received. 
 With only limited exceptions
, it is no defence that the defendant has parted with the money. The claim does not depend on any impropriety or want of probity on the part of the defendants ... [Emphasis supplied by me.]
 
 
 
Millet J, in his article 
 Tracing the proceeds of fraud 
 (1991) 107 LQR 70 identified three distinct situations in which there was a need for a restitutionary remedy: 
 
 
(a) where the plaintiffs` money has been received by the defendant and he still has it; 
 
(b) where the plaintiffs` money has been received by the defendant and he spent it or parted with it; and 
 
(c) where the defendant has not received the plaintiffs` money but has assisted in its misdirection.
  
 
 
The facts of the present case fall squarely within the second situation identified by Millet J. The learned judge, in his article, further states that: 
 
The second situation is essentially the same, save that a proprietary remedy is obviously no longer available. It calls for the same strict liability, 
 but this should now be subject to a defence based on change of position
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The House of Lords, in 
 Lipkin Gorman (a firm) v Karpnale Ltd 
 held that a bona fide change of position was a good defence to a claim for money had and received. In 
 Lipkin Gorman 
, Lord Goff`s formulation of the defence of a bona fide change of position is as follows (at p 580F): 
 
At present, I do not wish to state the principle any less broadly than this: that the defence is available to a person whose position has so changed that it would be inequitable in all the circumstances to require him to make restitution, or alternatively to make restitution in full.
 
 
 
Having regard to the decision of the House of Lords in 
 Lipkin Gorman 
, I do not think that the principle laid down in 
 Carman v Edward and Wormald 
 is still good law.
Bearing in mind the defence formulated by Lord Goff, the questions which I ask are these: Is it unjust to allow the plaintiffs to recover the sum of $1,984,740 from the second defendant? Has the second defendant`s position so changed that, if called upon to repay or to repay in full, he will suffer an injustice which outweighs the injustice of denying the plaintiffs restitution? In the present case, the first defendant, an employee of the first plaintiffs, devised a scheme to cheat her employers. She enlisted the help of the second defendant who believed her story about an uncle in the United States who had stocks of LFS and texwipes to clear. The first defendant, who was employed as a planner by the first plaintiffs, had, at the material time, been put in charge of `indirect materials`, which included packaging materials and LFS. According to her then store manager Mr Goh, she had to check on material requirements and make replenishment. She was responsible for making material requisitions when stocks were running low. She was authorized to make a recommendation on the suppliers for the materials. Mr Goh`s evidence was that audit checks were carried out every month and that he discovered the first defendant`s fraud 11 months after her scheme to cheat her employers was put into operation. The second defendant was innocently drawn into the first defendant`s fraudulent scheme. The first plaintiffs were negligent in failing to detect her fraud earlier. Had the fraud been discovered earlier, the first plaintiffs` losses would have been much smaller. Having regard to all the circumstances of this case, it would be inequitable to order the second defendant to make restitution to the plaintiffs of the balance of the $1,984,740 which they have failed to recover from the first defendant.
Having decided the first three issues against the plaintiffs, I do not think there is any necessity for me to deal with these remaining issues: 
 
 
(a) whether the first plaintiffs are estopped from recovering any money from the second defendant by virtue of the terms of settlement of their insurance claim; 
 
(b) whether any instructions have been given by the liquidators of the first plaintiffs to continue this action and, if not, whether the plaintiffs can continue this action against the second defendant; and 
 
(c) whether the first plaintiffs have ceased to exist and, if so, whether the plaintiffs` causes of action against the second defendant have ceased absolutely.
  
 
 
Accordingly, for the reasons given above, the plaintiffs` claim is dismissed with costs. As the first plaintiffs do not dispute that the sum of S$366,864.71 is due and owing to the second defendant under the counterclaim, the second defendant`s counterclaim against both plaintiffs is allowed, with interest at the rate of 6% pa from the date of the writ until the date of judgment. The second defendant will be entitled to the costs of his counterclaim.
The first plaintiffs obtained an interim injunction order against the second defendant on 21 November 1988 and the said order was varied by an order made by Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) on 5 December 1988. The said injunction order is to be discharged. I shall hear the parties on any consequential reliefs pertaining to the discharge of the said injunction order.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The defendant was, at all material times, a director and shareholder of 50% of the issued shares of Broadview Commodities Pte Ltd (`BVC`). BVC was incorporated in Singapore and held itself out as brokers for the purchase and sale of commodities or future interest therein, including gold at various exchanges, including the New York Commodity Exchange (`Comex`). The other shareholder and director was one Lee Kwong Fai (`Lee`), a Hongkong national, who was the managing director of a Hongkong gold futures trading company called Broadview Finance Pte Ltd (`BVF`).
On 22 February 1982, the plaintiff, whilst dining at the German Chicken Restaurant at International Plaza with one Sim Teng Peng (`Sim`), was introduced to one Lee Tow Kiat (`Tow Kiat`) and June Chng (`June`). June was attached to BVC as a broker. No doubt it was her duty to solicit business for BVC. At her suggestion, they proceeded to the office of BVC at Hong Leong Building, Collyer Quay, Singapore.
On arrival, they were shown into the defendant`s office where the defendant made a presentation on the activities and bona fides of BVC as a legitimate commodity trading house and (falsely) represented that BVC was financially sound having $1m on fixed deposit with the United Overseas Bank Ltd. Following this presentation, the plaintiff (and Sim), in the presence of the defendant, signed and entered into, with BVC, an agreement in accordance with BVC`s standard form of contract called `general agreement for customer accounts` (`the agreement`). By cl 4 of the agreement, the plaintiff agreed with BVC as follows: 
 
It is agreed between me ... and you that each contract between us ... contemplates actual delivery and receipt of the physical subject matter of the contract and payment therefor.
 
 
 
By cl 5 of the agreement, the plaintiff agreed with BVC as follows: 
 
I ... will, at all times, maintain with you, in such form as you may require, deposits and or margins in excess of my ... indebtedness or obligations to you and the amount of which may be greater than that required by the rules of the appropriate exchange and/or relevant clearing house, if any, upon which the contract concerned was executed on my ... behalf. Original deposits and margins or other payments called for are due on demand and in the currency of your choice, subject only to any restrictions which may be imposed by the appropriate exchange and/or relevant clearing house, if any, upon which the contract concerned was executed on my ... behalf.
 
 
 
The agreement thus required actual execution of buying and selling orders through the relevant exchange. Bucketing by BVC would be a breach of the agreement. The relevant exchange was Comex in which the plaintiff purportedly traded. By cl 3 of the agreement, it was provided as follows: 
 
Each contract between me ... and you, and all orders and transactions hereunder will be executed in accordance with, and subject to, the constitution, bye-law, rules, regulations, statutes, customs, usages or conditions ... necessarily applicable to ... the appropriate exchange ... and/or relevant clearing house.
 
 
 
It is not in dispute that bucketing is prohibited by the relevant law governing trading in Comex and the rules of Comex.
After the agreement was signed, the plaintiff proceeded to trade on the defendant`s suggestion. For this first transaction, on 22 February 1982, the plaintiff had no margin with BVC. He only paid in $20,000 on 24 February 1982. On this, his first foray into gold futures trading, he bought and sold ten lots and was credited with a net profit of US$600. Thereafter, except for another transaction on 1 March 1982 in which he was credited with the net profit of US$100, his trading, through BVC, on 11 trading days, ending on 7 April 1982, purportedly resulted in a total loss of $369,390. The plaintiff, throughout, was not allowed to maintain overnight positions and he was told that all open positions had to be squared on the same trading day. He ceased all trading on 8 April 1982.
From time to time, from 24 February 1982 to 1 July 1983, the plaintiff paid various sums to BVC in settlement of his `losses` amounting to $272,300. He did so in the belief that they were genuine losses suffered by him as a result of his trading through BVC on Comex. He stopped further payment from July 1983 on the advice of Inspector Henry Soh of the commercial crimes division of the Criminal Investigation Department. When he stopped further payment, the unpaid balance was $97,090.
Following investigations by the relevant authorities into the affairs of BVC, BVC was wound up on the petition of the Minister of Law on 21 October 1983 on the ground that BVC was indulging in `churning`, that is buying and selling on behalf of clients excessively to generate commission for itself.
Following further investigation, the defendant was charged with six counts of abetment of cheating (DAC 3874/84 to DAC 3879/84, both inclusive), under ss 420 and 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), by conspiring with Lee and others to cheat clients of BVC of various sums of money totalling $1,928,988.88 between December 1981 and August 1982, by deceiving them into believing that their gold trading orders would be placed with authorized international gold exchanges and, thereby, inducing them into paying moneys into BVC. Short particulars of the six charges were: 
 
 
Name of client Amount 
 
(1) Madam Chew Swee Poh - $1,062,862.47 (DAC 3874/84) 
 
(2) Madam Chew Swee Poh - $ 80,000.00 (DAC 3875/84) 
 
(3) William Tsai Chao Shaun - $ 312,128.26 (DAC 3876/84) 
 
(4) Lee Tow Kiat - $ 221,034.95 (DAC 3877/84) 
 
(5) Lee Tow Kiat - $ 15,263.20 (DAC 3878/84) 
 
(6) Michael Choo Kok Lim - $ 237,700.00 (DAC 3879/84)
  
 
 
The charge relating to this claim is DAC 3879/84.
In addition, the defendant was also charged with 14 counts of criminal breach of trust, as an agent in DAC 2536/84 to DAC 2549/84 (both inclusive), under s 409 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), of moneys totalling $1.7m, over which he had dominion as a director of BVC. On the cheating charges arising from bucketing clients` orders, it was the prosecution`s case that, sometime in June 1981, the defendant and Lee decided to `bucket` clients` orders, which meant that BVC would retain the margin deposits paid by these clients without placing their orders on the market at the various international exchanges and meeting the clients` orders itself. BVC would keep the commission paid to it on each lot of orders and absorb all the clients` losses on gold trading as its own profits. To execute this bucketing operation, BVC produced telex messages from BVF purportedly confirming that clients` orders had been placed as requested on the international exchanges. Dealers in BVC wore head phones to give the impression that they were receiving the prices of gold from the international exchanges. To reduce the financial risk of this `bucketing` operation, the staff of BVC, acting as dealers, were taught to manipulate clients` orders to ensure that clients would suffer losses or emerge with reduced profits.
The defendant`s defence against these cheating charges was that he was never in charge of trading operations at BVC and it was Lee and his team from BVF who managed the operations. He had no reason to suspect that the orders at BVC were not being sent to BVF for execution and denied deceiving any client of BVC. He stated that some of the clients, including the plaintiff, had previous experience in gold trading and could not be easily deceived. The defendant`s defence was rejected by the learned district judge who stated in his grounds of decision dated 4 September 1985: 
 
What the evidence recorded during the eight-week trial established is a massive fraud perpetrated on clients of BVC who had intended to invest in the gold market. They were deceived into believing that their gold trading orders were being dealt with honestly and that these orders were being placed on various international gold exchanges. However, the directors of BVC, including the accused persons, were clearly engaged in a criminal conspiracy to bucket those orders, and, in so doing, employed various devious means. The immense secret profits that they obtained from such operations were subsequently shared by the directors and principally by Loh Shak Mow and Lee Kwong Fai. Thereafter, to prevent the discovery of their deceit, they destroyed accounting books and documents and manufactured others.
 
 
 
The offences were discovered quite by chance because the principal conspirators fell out with each other in early 1983 and an employee of Broadview Finance was arrested on another charge.
On being convicted of all the charges preferred against him, the defendant was sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling six years. He appealed to the High Court against the convictions and sentences. The appeal was dismissed by FA Chua J on 19 August 1986. In delivering his judgment in 
 Loh Shak Mow v PP 
 at p 379, FA Chua J stated: 
 
The evidence adduced by the prosecution clearly showed that the appellant had full knowledge of BVC`s operations.
 
 
 
... There was ample evidence on the records to show that the appellant had knowledge of bucketing and that the orders of clients were not put on the exchange.
At p 380, FA Chua J stated: 
 
... the appellant and Lee Kwong Fai were engaged in a conspiracy to cheat and ... subsequently they secreted out the proceeds of the cheating by disguising the receipt of the moneys by them by creating false margin receipts and stating in the payment voucher that these were payments to BVF as margins, trading losses, remittances to Hong Kong and returns to directors` loan account. Most of the cheques drawn was cash cheques and encashed in Singapore. The evidence showed that half the amounts stated on the cheques were given to the appellant which he immediately credited into his bank account within minutes of its withdrawal.
 
 
 
On 24 January 1989, the plaintiff commenced these proceedings against the defendant for damages for deceit arising out of the bucketing operations of BVC. Interlocutory judgment in default of appearance was then entered against the defendant on 21 April 1989.
On 28 June 1989, the defendant filed an application in summons-in-chambers entered No 3753/89 to set aside the interlocutory judgment, supported by an affidavit with a draft defence annexed. The draft defence raised similar issues as those adjudicated on in the criminal proceedings for which the defendant had been convicted. To oppose the defendant`s application, the plaintiff filed an affidavit exhibiting, inter alia, the relevant charge in DAC 3879/84 and the grounds of decision of the learned district judge and that of FA Chua J.
The defendant thereupon filed an application in summons-in-chambers entered No 5863/89 to have the plaintiff`s said affidavit expunged from the court records on the ground that the convictions were inadmissible. An order in terms of the defendant`s application was granted by the learned assistant registrar on 26 October 1989. The plaintiff`s said affidavit was accordingly expunged from the court`s records. The defendant`s application to set aside the interlocutory judgment in default of appearance was however dismissed.
The plaintiff and defendant both appealed against the learned assistant registrar`s orders. Both appeals were heard and allowed by LP Thean J (as he then was) on 7 January 1991. Accordingly, the interlocutory judgment was set aside and the affidavit of the plaintiff reinstated as part of the court`s records.
At the trial before me, counsel for the defendant raised the same objection on the admissibility of the said affidavit and the record of the criminal proceedings. I overruled the objection on the ground that the affidavit and the annexures had been reinstated as part of the court`s records by LP Thean J`s order. However, I would hear arguments in the course of the hearing on whether the plaintiff could rely on the findings of fact on the relevant charge arrived at in the criminal proceedings culminating in the defendant`s conviction in DAC 3879/84.
The defendant relies principally on 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd & Anor 
.2 This was an action arising out of a collision between two motor cars on the highway, in which the plaintiff alleged negligence on the part of the defendant driver and sought to give evidence of the conviction of the defendant driver of careless driving under the Road Traffic Act 1930. The Court of Appeal held that evidence of the conviction was inadmissible. Goddard LJ in delivering the unanimous judgment of the court stated at pp 594-595: 
 
... In truth, the conviction is only proof that another court considered that the defendant was guilty of careless driving. Even were it proved that it was the accident that led to the prosecution, the conviction proves no more than what has just been stated. The court which has to try the claim for damages knows nothing of the evidence that was before the criminal court. It cannot know what arguments were addressed to it, or what influenced the court in arriving at its decision. Moreover, the issue in the criminal proceedings is not identical with that raised in the claim for damages. Assume that evidence is called to prove that the defendant did collide with the plaintiff, that has only an evidential value on the issue whether the defendant, by driving carelessly, caused damage to the plaintiff. To link up or identify the careless driving with the accident, it would be necessary in most cases, probably in all, to call substantially the same evidence before the court trying the claim for personal injuries, and so proof of the conviction by itself would amount to no more than proof that the criminal court came to the conclusion that the defendant was guilty. It is admitted that the conviction is in no sense an estoppel, but only evidence to which the court or a jury can attach such weight as they think proper, but it is obvious that once the defendant challenges the propriety of the conviction, the court on the subsequent trial would have to retry the criminal case to find out what weight ought to be attached to the result. It frequently happens that a bystander has a complete and full view of an accident. It is beyond question that, while he may inform the court of everything that he saw, he may not express any opinion on whether either or both of the parties were negligent. The reason commonly assigned is that this is the precise question the court has to decide, but in truth, it is because his opinion is not relevant. 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
 
 
 
2 was reluctantly followed by the Court of Appeal in 
 Goody v Odhams Press Ltd 
 .3 In following 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 ,2 Lord Denning MR said at pp 371-372: 
 
On 8 August 1963, there was the Great Train Robbery. Over Â£2,500,000 was stolen. On 26 March 1964, Douglas Gordon Goody, the plaintiff, was convicted of conspiring to stop the mail and, being armed with an offensive weapon, robbing Frank Dewhurst of 120 mailbags. He was sentenced to 30 years` imprisonment. The judge told Goody that he `had become a dangerous menace to society`. Four months later, on 26 July 1964, 
 The People
 newspaper published a story headed: `A suburban housewife reveals how she was caught up in the great mailbag plot`, followed by an account, said to have been given by Mrs Karin Field, of how she was `forced to help the gang to get away with their haul`. The article contained many references to the plaintiff and described the leading part played by him.
 
 
 
Two months later, on 17 September 1964, the plaintiff brought a libel action against 
 The People 
, complaining that the article was defamatory of him. 
 The People 
 at first pleaded a full justification. They said that all the words were true in substance and in fact. In order to make good that plea, they would have to prove that the plaintiff was, in fact, one of the train robbers and was, in fact, guilty. It would not be sufficient to prove that he was convicted of the train robbery. The reason is because there is a strange rule of law which says that a conviction is no evidence of guilt, not even, prima facie evidence. That was decided in 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd 
. I argued that case myself and did my best to persuade the court that a conviction was evidence of guilt. But they would not have it. I thought that the decision was wrong at the time. I still think that it was wrong. But, in this court, we are bound by it. It means that when anyone publishes a story about a crime, he is in peril of being sued for libel. In the action, he cannot rely on the conviction as proof of guilt. He has to prove it all over again, if he can.
At p 373, Danckwerts LJ said: 
 
I agree completely with the judgment of Lord Denning MR, and I wish to say only that I think the law on the subject which we have been discussing has got into some queer twists and tangles.
 
 
 
Echoing the same criticism, Salmon LJ, also at p 373, referred to: 
 
the strange rule of law enshrined in 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd
, that, in a civil court, proof of a conviction is not even prima facie evidence that the convicted man was guilty. I wholeheartedly agree with Lord Denning MR`s criticism of that decision. It is to be hoped, now that law reform is in the air, it may perhaps be reconsidered.
 
 
 
On the heels of 
 Goody 
`s case3 came 
 Barclays Bank Ltd v Cole 
, in which the defendant, Cole, had been found guilty of robbing a branch of the plaintiff`s bank and sentenced to 15 years` imprisonment. His appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal was rejected. The plaintiff then sued the defendant, seeking to recover the money it had lost by the robbery amounting to Â£52,250. In giving his judgment on an interlocutory appeal on whether the action should be tried by a jury, Lord Denning MR said at pp 949-950: 
 
So the defendant denied the robbery and is determined to have it tried again. He wishes to canvass again his guilt or innocence, but this time before a jury in a civil case. There is too much of this sort of thing going on: 
 Hinds
, 
 Goody
, 
 Rondel
 and now the defendant. It is made possible by the unfortunate decision of this court in 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd
, where it was held that a conviction in a criminal court cannot be used as evidence, not even prima facie evidence, in a civil case. I hope that it will soon be altered. See what it means here. In order to be able to bring this civil action, the plaintiff bank had first to make sure that the defendant was prosecuted in the criminal court: see 
 Smith v Selwyn
. Now, after seeing him duly prosecuted and convicted, they are asked to prove his guilt all over again in this civil suit.
 
 
 
In the United States of America, in similar circumstances, it has recently been held that the conviction is not only receivable but is conclusive evidence: see 
 Hurtt Trustee v Stirone 
. Here in England, however, at present, it is not even admissible evidence. So we must accept that the defendant is entitled to canvass his guilt or innocence once again.
Diplock LJ also added his criticism at p 951: 
 
The facts alleged as constituting the cause of action against the defendant constitute also the crime of robbery, on which he has already been tried by a jury and has been convicted. Such tatters of his reputation as remained after he pleaded guilty to receiving stolen goods have already been confided to a jury twice: the first time with inconclusive, the second with disastrous, results. Only the technical rule of evidence in 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd
 prevents his conviction from being evidence in a civil action that he was guilty of the acts of which he was convicted. Nevertheless, the existence of that technical rule, which I agree with Lord Denning MR is ripe for re-examination, provides no reason in justice why he should be given another jury to try the same issues again (though with a lesser onus of proof against him) if the action can be dealt with as justly, but more speedily and cheaply, by a judge alone. Clearly it can. The civil action will almost certainly involve, in cross-examination of the witnesses, voluminous references to the transcript of the shorthand notes of evidence in the criminal trials which took a total of some 14 days. Why should the plaintiffs be put to all the additional trouble, time and expense which trial by jury would entail?
 
 
 
Following these criticisms, the Law Reform Committee recommended legislation to be enacted to make the conviction of a criminal offence admissible in subsequent civil proceedings whether or not between the same parties. This recommendation was accepted and incorporated in the English Civil Evidence Act 1968. 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
2 was also criticized and not followed by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in 
 Jorgensen v News Media (Auckland) Ltd 
 .5 In that case, the bodies of one Kevin James Speight and George Frederick Walker were found. Both men had been killed by bullets fired from a machine gun. One Gillies and the plaintiff, Jorgensen, were charged and convicted of the murder of Speight. Their appeal was dismissed. No charge was brought by the Crown in respect of the death of Walker. The defendant which was the publisher of a newspaper published an article which contained these words: 
 
Jorgensen and John Frederick Gillies - also in the same block - machine-gunned Kevin Speight, 26, seaman, whose body was found in a home in Bassett Road, Remuera, in December 1963, along with the bullet-riddled body of salesman George Frederick Walker.
 
 
 
Jorgensen brought libel action against the defendant, alleging that the words meant and were understood to mean that he was responsible either as a principal or as a party to the murder of Speight and Walker. It was held that a certificate of Jorgensen`s conviction was not merely conclusive evidence of the fact that Jorgensen had been found guilty of the murder of Speight but was also admissible evidence, while not conclusive, of the fact of guilt of the crime charged against Jorgensen at the time and place mentioned in the indictment. Whether such evidence discharged the evidentiary burden of proof at any stage was for the trial court to decide on the whole of the evidence tendered at that stage. In delivering his judgment, North P reviewed the relevant English cases before and after 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 as well as cases from other jurisdictions. Referring to the criticism levelled against 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 in the 
 Goody 
 and 
 Barclays Bank 
 cases, he said at pp 968-970: 
 
No doubt the outspoken views expressed by the four Lord Justices persuaded Lord Gardiner, the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, to refer to the Law Reform Committee appointed to consider the law of evidence in civil cases the implications of the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
. The committee was certainly an influential one consisting of Lord Pearson, Lord Justice Diplock, Lord Justice Winn, Mr Justice Buckley, Mr Justice Orr, four Queen`s Counsel and several other persons of high standing. The primary purpose of the committee, to be sure, was to consider whether legislation should be enacted abrogating the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
; nevertheless, some of the opinions and comments of the committee, who presented a unanimous report, are worthy of mention. In the introduction to the report, the committee said:
 
 
 
`In some recent judgments of the Court of Appeal upon whom the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
 is still binding, it has been suggested that it requires our consideration. We think so too.`
 
 
 
Then, after referring to the facts in that case, the report continued:
 
 
 
`Rationalize it how one will, the decision in this case offends one`s sense of justice. The defendant driver had been found guilty of careless driving by a court of competent jurisdiction. The onus of proof of culpability in criminal cases is higher than in civil; the degree of carelessness required to sustain a conviction for careless driving is, if anything, greater than that required to sustain a civil cause of action in negligence. Yet, the fact that the defendant driver had been convicted of careless driving at the time and place of the accident was held not to amount even to prima facie evidence of his negligent driving at that time and place. It is not easy to escape the implication in the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
 that, in the estimation of lawyers, a conviction by a criminal court is as likely to be wrong as right. It is not, of course, spelt out in those terms in the judgment of the Court of Appeal, although, insofar as their decision was based mainly upon the ground that the opinion of the criminal court as to the defendant driver`s guilt was as irrelevant as that of a bystander who witnessed the accident, the gap between the implicit and the explicit was a narrow one. It is, in a sense, true that a finding by any court that a person was culpable or not culpable of a particular criminal offence or civil wrong is an expression of opinion by the court. But, it is of a different character from an expression of opinion by a private individual. In the first place, it is made by persons, whether judges, magistrates or juries, acting under a legal duty to form and express an opinion on that issue. In the second place, in forming their opinion, they are aided by a procedure, of which the law of evidence forms part, which has been evolved with a view to ensuring that the material needed to enable them to form a correct opinion is available to them. In the third place, their opinion, expressed in the form of a finding or verdict of guilty or not guilty in criminal proceedings or a judgment in civil proceedings, has consequences which are enforced by the executive power of the State. We approach the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
 from the premise stated in our 
 Report on Hearsay Evidence
 (13th Report of the Law Reform Committee: Cmnd. 2964), that any material which has probative value upon any question in issue in a civil action should be admissible in evidence unless there are good reasons for excluding it. Our further premise is that any decision of an English court upon an issue which it has a duty to determine is more likely than not to have been reached according to law and to be right rather than wrong. It may, therefore, constitute material of some probative value if the self-same issue arises in subsequent legal proceedings. A conviction upon a contested trial is consistent only with the opinion of the criminal court`s being that it has been established, not merely on the balance of probabilities, but beyond reasonable doubt, that the conduct of the accused did constitute the criminal offence with which he was charged, and that it has been so established upon all the material known to the prosecution or the defence and considered by either to be relevant to the issue of guilt. Any layman would, we think, regard the fact of such conviction as a firm foundation for the belief that the accused had conducted himself in such a manner as to constitute the criminal offence of which he was convicted and, if such criminal offence would also constitute a civil wrong, that the accused had committed a civil wrong also. We, too, share this commonsense view. We consider that such a conviction has high probative value in establishing the cause of action in a subsequent civil action founded upon the same conduct in which the onus of proof is lower. We have no doubt, in principle, that evidence of the conviction should be admissible.`
 
 
 
Then, at pp 974-975, he said: 
 
... But, in view of the reference made by Lord Denning in 
 Barclays Bank Ltd v Cole
 to a decision in the United States of America, 
 Hurtt Trustee v Stirone
 206A (2d) 521, I thought that it might be worth while to examine other American cases as well, but I have not found the research very rewarding. So far as I can see, there are judgments both ways as Justice Dove pointed out in 
 Gould v Country Mutual Casualty Company
 185 NE (2d) 603. The line of American authority, I observe, is discussed in 5 
 Wigmore on Evidence
 687, where that learned legal writer comments that, in view of the copious use of various official inquisitions and findings at common law, it may seem strange that, in general, the doctrine is accepted that a judgment in another cause, finding a fact now in issue, is ordinarily not receivable. Mr Wigmore then goes on to examine the various reasons that have been advanced in favour of rejecting a judgment in other causes and expresses the opinion that the reasons, on the whole, are not convincing. Very much the same view is expressed by Prof McCormick in his valuable treatise on evidence. He suggested that the courts which have upheld the doctrine of exclusion have been guided by a different principle, namely that of res judicata. He suggested that `probably the trend of evolution will be toward the admission generally, against a present party, of any judgment or finding in a former civil or criminal case if the party had an opportunity to defend. The principles on which is founded the hearsay exception for official written statements would justify this extension.`
 
 
 
I should record, too, that I have not examined Canadian cases but have accepted the statement of Mr Wright in the Canadian Bar Review ... that the decision in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
, in effect, overruled at least three cases which had been previously followed in Canada.
Turning nearer home, so far as I have been able to ascertain, there is no case in the High Court of Australia where this rule of rejection has been examined. The situation in New Zealand is in very much the same position. It is true there are three judgments in the Supreme Court where the principle enunciated in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 has been followed: these are 
 Clouston v Bragg 
 [1949] NZLR 1073; 
 Vuleta v Commissioner of Inland Revenue 
 [1962] NZLR 325 and 
 McAteer v Lester 
 [1962] NZLR 485. Apart from these three cases, so far as I am aware, there are only two cases in this court where 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 has been referred to. The first is 
 Connor v Public Trustee 
 [1948] NZLR 919, where the court was concerned with a very different question, namely, whether one of the jurymen empanelled on the trial of an action for damages had been guilty of `misconduct` within the meaning of r 276 of the Code of Civil Procedure in failing to inform the judge that he had been a member of the jury which had previously acquitted the defendant on a charge of negligently driving a motorcar. Again, in 
 Brierly v Want 
 [1960] NZLR 1088, Cleary J in delivering the judgment of the court, drew attention to 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 when criticizing a passage in the summing up in the court below. This then being the state of the authorities in New Zealand, there is no reason at all that I can see which in any way prevents this court now considering how far, if at all, the rule laid down in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 should be applied in an action like the present one.
In my opinion, the line of authority to which I have referred, in itself, would justify this court declining in this case to follow the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
. ...
Then, referring to 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 again in p 976, North P said: 
 
As a preliminary comment, I think it is rather unfortunate that this important question should have been determined adversely to the plaintiff in a running-down case. In this class of case, there are many practical reasons in favour of the view that, generally speaking, evidence of a conviction of a driving offence has little or no probative value but it is plain that Goddard LJ, in determining that the evidence was inadmissible, clearly recognized that the effect of the court`s judgment was to exclude evidence of a conviction of murder in a case where that question was in issue. Nevertheless, the reference made by Goddard LJ to the effect that it was the invariable practice of judges for many years to reject this class of evidence seems to have had particular reference to accident cases. If, however, it was intended as I suppose it was, to indicate that there was a rule of practice which extended to all classes of cases, then, in my respectful view, the authorities to which I have referred to do not support his statement.
 
 
 
The principal ground which the court relied on, in rejecting the conviction of the driver of the defendant`s vehicle for the purpose for which it was sought to be used, was that the opinion of the criminal court was irrelevant and no better than the opinion of a bystander to the accident. ... In my opinion, then, the principal ground upon which 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 was decided should not be accepted. 
 Jorgensen 
 `s case5 was followed by the Supreme Court of Western Australia (full court) in 
 Raymond John Mickelberg & Peter Mickelberg v Director of the Perth Mint 
 .6 In that case, the director of the Perth Mint commenced a civil action against the applicants, who had been convicted of defrauding the director of a quantity of gold bullion. The gold had never been recovered. The director`s claim was for the return of the gold bullion or damages. In his statement of claim, the director alleged the theft of the gold. The applicants, in their joint defence, denied the claim and further asserted that they did not have, and never had, the bullion in their possession.
In an interlocutory application relating to the pleadings, Burt CJ said at p 371: 
 
But it is, I think, necessary to decide whether 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn
 should be followed in this state so as to enable a decision to be reached upon the other ground upon which the paragraphs in the appellants` defence were struck out, it being that `they constitute an abuse of the process of the court or the pleas therein are frivolous or vexatious`. That ground is based upon the convictions and unless the convictions can be proved in the civil action it would appear to me that the ground, without more, would have nothing to sustain it.
 
 
 
As has been said, the decision in 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn 
 was not followed by the Court of Appeal in New Zealand in 
 Jorgensen 
 in which, as Denning MR observed in 
 McIlkenny 
`s case, the `case has been examined with great skill and much learning`. It would serve no useful purpose unduly to inflate these reasons by my reproducing the reasons given by the Court of Appeal in 
 Jorgensen 
 merely to enable me to say that I entirely agree with them, as I do. In my opinion, this is an exceptional case and, although I recognize that decisions of the Court of Appeal `should, generally speaking, be followed [by this court] if they are applicable and are not themselves in conflict with a decision of [the High Court] or of the Privy Council`. <6>
 Jorgensen 
`s case5 was followed by the Ontario High Court in 
 Demeter v British Pacific Life Insurance Co 
. There, the plaintiff sued three insurance companies on policies by which the defendants agreed to pay the survivor of the plaintiff, and the plaintiff`s wife, certain sums of money upon the death of the other. Prior to the civil action, the plaintiff had been convicted of murdering his wife and the defendant pleaded the conviction by way of defence. The plaintiff denied the allegations of criminal wrongdoing on his part and alleged that there was evidence to suggest that his wife was killed by someone unconnected with the plaintiff. On the defendant`s application, the action was dismissed on the ground that it was an abuse of the process of the court. At p 264, Osler J said: 
 
In my view, the decision of the New Zealand Court of Appeal in 
 Jorgensen v News Media (Auckland) Ltd
, supra, a decision made after the most careful examination of 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
, and the prior decisions upon which it was said to rest, conforms more closely to common sense and to the objectives of the law as the courts must apply it than does any other decision to which I have been referred.
 
 
 
Osler J`s decision was upheld by the Ontario Court of Appeal in 
 Demeter v British Pacific Life Insurance Co. 
 At p 320, MacKinnon ACJO, in delivering the decision of the court, said: 
 
We agree with Mr Justice Osler`s careful and thoughtful analysis of the authorities and his conclusion that 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd et al
 
[1943] 1 KB 587
, which held that the fact that the defendant driver in that case had been convicted of careless driving at the time and place of the accident did not amount to even prima facie evidence of his negligent driving at that time and place, is not the law of Ontario. We are equally of the view that the use of a civil action to initiate a collateral attack on a final decision of a criminal court of competent jurisdiction in an attempt to relitigate an issue already tried, is an abuse of the process of the court. ...
 
 
 
On the facts of this case, it would be, as the learned motions court judge pointed out, an affront to one`s sense of justice to let these actions go forward and, for the reasons given by him, the appeals are dismissed with costs as of one appeal.
In 
 Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police & Ors 
, a decision of the House of Lords, 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 was said to be generally considered to have been wrongly decided. In 
 Hunter 
`s case,9 after bomb explosions in two Birmingham public houses on 21 November 1974 had killed 21 people and injured 161 others, the appellant and four others, Irish Republican supporters, were arrested by the Lancashire police and taken to Morecambe Police Station. On 22 November, members of the Birmingham police interviewed the five men, and one of them made a signed statement. They were then taken to a Birmingham police station, where a sixth man was also taken after his arrest at 10.30pm that night. On 23 November, at the Birmingham police station, three more of the men made signed statements and the two others made oral confessions regarding their parts in planting the bombs that had caused the explosions. On 24 November, all six men were photographed, and the photograph of one man showed a mark that might have been a bruise under the right eye. On Monday, 25 November, the six men appeared before a magistrates` court, and, although three of them complained to the solicitors assigned to them of assaults by the police, no marks were noticed on their faces, save in the case of the man with the black eye, which he said had been caused by a fall. After formal evidence, the six men were remanded in custody and taken to Winson Green Prison. When, three days later, on 28 November, they again appeared at the magistrates` court, their faces showed injuries that indicated they had been seriously assaulted. They were again remanded in custody, and first the prison governor, and then the Home Office, held an inquiry as to how their injuries had been sustained. At the trial of the six men on 21 charges of murder, their counsel objected to the admission in evidence of their statements, which were an essential part of the prosecution case, on the ground that they had been induced by violence and threats by the police. After an eight-day `trial within a trial` (voir dire) in the absence of the jury, during which the police officers and the six men gave evidence, Bridge J held that the prosecution had discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the men had not been assaulted by the police and that the statements had been voluntary and should be admitted in evidence. The trial then continued before the jury, and the six men again alleged that their statements had been induced by violence by the police. Bridge J warned the jury that, if their allegations were, or might reasonably be, true, the statements were worthless. The jury convicted all six, and Bridge J sentenced them to imprisonment for life. Leave to appeal was refused by the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) on 30 March 1976. The six men issued writs against the chief constables of the West Midlands and the Lancashire police and also against the Home Office claiming damages against the police for injuries caused by assaults, which were the same allegations as had been made before Bridge J at the voir dire and trial, and also against the Home Office in respect of assaults by prison officers and prisoners while they had been in Winson Green Prison. They relied, inter alia, on new medico-forensic evidence as to the photographs taken on 24 November, which were said to reveal that some injuries had been sustained prior to that date, and statements from the three prison officers that the six men had been bruised and injured on their arrival at the prison. The chief constables applied for the statements of claim against them to be struck out under RSC O 18 r 19, and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court. Cantley J dismissed the applications, but the Court of Appeal allowed an appeal by the chief constables and ordered that the statements of claim be struck out. The appeal to the House of Lords was dismissed. In dismissing the appeal, the House of Lords held that, where a final decision had been made by a criminal court of competent jurisdiction, it was a general rule of public policy that the use of a civil action to initiate a collateral attack on that decision was an abuse of the process of the court.
In delivering the unanimous decisions of the House, Lord Diplock said at pp 542-544: 
 
My Lords, this is the first case to be reported in which the final decision against which it is sought to initiate a collateral attack by means of a civil action has been a final decision reached by a court of criminal jurisdiction. This raises a possible complication that the onus of proof of facts that lies upon the prosecution in criminal proceedings is higher than that required of parties to civil proceedings who seek in those proceedings to prove facts on which they rely. Thus, a decision in a criminal case upon a particular question in favour of a defendant, whether by way of acquittal or a ruling on a voir dire, is not inconsistent with the fact that the decision would have been against him if all that were required were the civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities. This is why acquittals were not made admissible in evidence in civil actions by the Civil Evidence Act 1968. In contrast to this, a decision on a particular question against a defendant in a criminal case, such as Bridge J`s ruling on the voir dire in the murder trial, is reached upon the higher criminal standard of proof beyond all reasonable doubt and is wholly inconsistent with any possibility that the decision would not have been against him if the same question had fallen to be decided in civil proceedings instead of criminal. That is why convictions were made admissible in evidence in civil proceedings by the Act of 1968.
 
 
 
That Act and 
 Hollington v F Hewthorn & Co Ltd 
 [1943] KB 587 which ss 11 and 13 of the Act were passed to overrule, call for some examination at this point. Despite the eminence of those who constituted the members of the Court of Appeal that decided it (Lord Greene MR, Goddard and du Parcq LJJ), that case is generally considered to have been wrongly decided, even in the context of running-down cases brought before the Law Reform (Contributory Negligence) Act 1945 was passed and contributory negligence ceased to be a complete defence; for that is what 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 was about. The judgment of the court delivered by Goddard LJ concentrates on the great variety of additional issues that would arise in a civil action for damages for negligent driving but which it would not have been necessary to decide in a prosecution for a traffic offence based on the same incident, and on the consequence that it would still be necessary to call in the civil action, all the witnesses whose evidence had previously been given in a successful prosecution of the defendant, or a driver for whose tortious acts he was vicariously liable, for careless or dangerous driving, even if evidence of that conviction were admitted. So no question arose in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 of raising in a civil action the identical question that had already been decided in a criminal court of competent jurisdiction, and the case does not purport to be an authority on that matter.
The occasion for the reference of the decision in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 that evidence of criminal convictions was not admissible in civil actions to the Lord Chancellor`s Law Reform Committee was a notorious libel case in which, despite a defence of justification, a criminal who had been convicted of serious offences was awarded damages by a jury in a civil action against a newspaper for stating that he had committed the identical offences of which he had been found guilty upon his trial. So here, unlike the case of 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
, the civil action did raise the identical question that had already been decided against the plaintiff by a competent court; yet under the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn, 
 even the fact of his conviction was inadmissible in evidence on the plea of justification in the civil action. This is the mischief, in the initiation of civil proceedings in a court of justice for the purpose of mounting a collateral attack upon a final decision against the intending plaintiff which has been reached by a competent court of criminal jurisdiction, that s 13 of the Act of 1968 was designed to cure. It is to be observed that it makes the conviction not merely prima facie evidence of the plaintiff`s guilt but conclusive evidence. The provisions of s 13 are thus consistent with, and give statutory recognition to, the public policy of prohibiting the use of civil actions to initiate a collateral attack on a final decision against the intending plaintiff which has been made by a criminal court of competent jurisdiction.
Lord Roskil in concurring with the judgment of Lord Diplock said at p 545: 
 
My Lords, I have had the advantage of reading in draft the speech of my noble and learned friend, Lord Diplock. For the reasons therein contained, I am clearly of the opinion that to allow this action to proceed would indeed be an abuse of the process of the court. ...
 
 
 
Nearer to our jurisdiction, the High Court of Negara Brunei Darussalam has declined to follow 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 on the ground that it was wrongly decided. In the unreported decision in Suit Nos 143/87 and 214/88, 
 Jennifer McAlpin Lynn & Ors v AK Ludin bin Pg Salimin & Anor 
, the plaintiffs were passengers in a water taxi navigated by the second defendant`s driver. The water taxi collided with a boat navigated by the first defendant. The first defendant was then charged and convicted for navigating his boat in a negligent manner. In the course of giving his judgment on apportionment liability between the two defendants, Dato Sir Denys Roberts, the Chief Justice said: 
 
If the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
 (1943) KB 587 is applied, this would mean that evidence of this conviction is not admissible in Brunei. This was a decision of the English Court of Appeal but, as I have indicated in other cases, I do not consider that it should be applied in Brunei, nor that it was correctly decided.
 
 
 
Its effect was reversed by the UK Civil Evidence Act 1968, though this does not apply in Brunei. The effect of this Act was that a relevant conviction is admissible as proof that the defendant did commit the offence in question. It shifts the legal burden of proof to the defendant, who must establish on a balance of probabilities, that he was innocent.
In my opinion, there is a presumption, which the first defendant has failed to rebut, that he was guilty of some degree of negligence in the navigation of his boat in relation to this accident by reason of his conviction.
Hong Kong has also abolished by statute in 1984 the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
, see 
 Criminal Evidence in Hong Kong 
 by Andrew Bruce and Gerard McCoy, at p 251: 
 
... In civil proceedings, the last vestige of the rule in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
 
[1943] 1 KB 587
 has been repealed by s 62 of the Evidence Ordinance so that in Hong Kong relevant, subsisting criminal convictions are admissible in subsequent civil proceedings whether or not the convicted person is a party to the civil proceedings.
 
 
 
Section 62 of the Hong Kong Evidence Ordinance reads: 
 
 
(1) In any civil proceedings the fact that a person has been convicted of an offence by or before any court in Hong Kong shall, subject to subsection (3), be admissible in evidence for the purpose of proving, where to do so is relevant to any issue in those proceedings, that he committed that offence, whether he was so convicted upon a plea of guilty or otherwise and whether or not he is a party to the civil proceedings; but no conviction other than a subsisting one shall be admissible in evidence by virtue of this section. (
 Amended 37 of 1984, s 11 
) 
 
(2) In any civil proceedings in which by virtue of this section a person is proved to have been convicted of an offence by or before any court in Hong Kong - (
 Amended 37 of 1984 s 11 
) 
 
(a) he shall be taken to have committed that offence, unless the contrary is proved, and 
 
(b) without prejudice to the reception of any other admissible evidence for the purpose of identifying the facts on which the conviction was based, the contents of any document which is admissible as evidence of the conviction, and the contents of the information, complaint, indictment or charge on which the person in question was convicted, shall be admissible in evidence for that purpose. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section shall prejudice the operation of section 64 or any other enactment whereby a conviction or a finding of fact in any criminal proceedings is for the purposes of any other proceedings made conclusive evidence of any fact. 
 
(4) Where in any civil proceedings the contents of any document are admissible in evidence by virtue of subsection (2), a copy of that document, or of the material part thereof, purporting to be certified or otherwise authenticated by or on behalf of the court or authority having custody of that document shall be admissible in evidence and shall be taken to be a true copy of that document or part unless the contrary is shown.
  
 
 
In Malaysia, 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 has been applied. In 
 She Eng Gek v DA De Silva

`The learned county court judge appeared to take the view that, in order to bring that matter home in civil proceedings, it would be necessary to do it by means of a conviction. So far from that being the case, it appears to me to be settled law that a conviction would be no evidence of his guilt in civil proceedings. That was decided in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn & Co Ltd

In the latter case, however, Goddard LJ at p 42 stated:
 
 
 
`In the present case, had the defendant before the magistrates pleaded guilty, or made some admission in giving evidence that would have supported the plaintiff`s case, this could have been proved but not the result of the trial.`
 
 
 
In the case of the present appeal, the conviction in the criminal proceedings is no evidence in civil proceedings but the plea of guilty to the charge, being an admission which may support the plaintiff`s case, is admissible.
 
 
 
In India, this rule has been applied. See 
 Sarkar on 
 Evidence 
 (13th Ed) at p 502: 
 
In a suit for damage for assault, the previous conviction of the defendant in a criminal court is no evidence of the assault. The

Before our courts in 
 Re Hardjo Soekatmo (deceased) 
, the plaintiff brought an action for damages suffered by the dependants of the deceased who was killed in a road accident. Arising out of the said accident, the defendant was charged and he pleaded guilty to a charge for causing the death of the deceased by a rash or negligent act under s 304A of the Penal Code. The plaintiff then applied for interlocutory judgment based on the criminal prosecution. Notwithstanding the plea of guilty, the application was refused because of the issue of contributory negligence on the part of the deceased. In his judgment, the learned assistant registrar said at p lxxviii: 
 
It is settled law that a conviction obtained against a defendant in criminal proceedings is inadmissible in evidence in civil proceedings but a plea of guilty being an admission which may support the plaintiff`s case is admissible (see 
 Hollington v Hewthorn
) ...
 
 
 
As that case involved a plea of guilty, the statement on 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 was an obiter dictum.
In 
 Re Singh Kalpanath 
 ,13 the applicant, an advocate and solicitor, was found guilty of misconduct by the disciplinary committee and ordered to show cause before a court of three judges. The applicant applied for an order of certiorari to quash the findings and determination of the disciplinary committee on the ground that the chairman was biased. In quashing the findings of the disciplinary committee, the learned judge said at p 658: 
 
... we have a rule of law that findings of fact made by a criminal court are not binding on and not admissible as evidence in a civil court and vice versa ...
 
 
 
A perusal of the report will confirm that this point was not in issue before the learned judge and, therefore, this statement was also made obiter dicta with obvious reference to 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
.
In the light of the views expressed by Lord Diplock in 
 Hunter 
 `s case9 that 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 2 was generally considered to have been wrongly decided, it is quite clear that 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 2 would have been expressly overruled by the House of Lords if it had not been abolished earlier by statute. For that reason, and for the reasons given by the Law Reform Committee recommending its abolition in England by statute, I do not propose to follow 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 .2 To do so would be tantamount to allowing a collateral attack by means of a civil action against a final decision of a court of competent criminal jurisdiction, thus permitting an abuse of the process of the court. I therefore hold that the defendant`s conviction is admissible evidence, while not conclusive, of the fact of his guilt in respect of the offence with which he was charged. Based on the conviction, I find that the defendant had procured or directed the commission of the tort of deceit as a director of BVC as evidenced by the acts for which he was convicted in the criminal proceedings. It is to be noted that the plaintiff`s claim is for $272,300, whereas the amount stated in the charge in DAC 3879/84 is $237,700. The difference is due to the fact that the charge did not take into account payments made by the plaintiff to BVC after August 1982.
In case I am wrong in refusing to follow 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 ,2 on the oral evidence of witnesses given before me and the documents (not including the records of the criminal proceedings) tendered, I find, on a balance of probabilities, the following facts have been proved by the plaintiff: 
 
 
(i) On 22 February 1982, the plaintiff, with Sim and Tow Kiat, were taken by June to the office of BVC, where the defendant personally attended to them and gave a representation on the bona fides of BVC and that BVC would trade in gold futures on behalf of the plaintiff or execute his orders in Comex. 
 
(ii) Relying on the defendant`s representation, the plaintiff began the purported trading on Comex from 22 February 1982 to 7 April 1982. 
 
(iii) The defendant was actively involved in the running of BVC. 
 
(iv) There was no bona fide trading by BVC on behalf of the plaintiff in Comex but the orders were bucketed. I made this finding because the plaintiff was allowed to trade without margin and even when his account was in debit. A bona fide commodity trading house would not normally allow a client to trade without margin as it exposes the trading house to financial risks. In this case, as the orders were bucketed, there was no risk to BVC. 
 
(v) If there was genuine trading on Comex through BVF of Hong Kong, there would have been telex confirmation from BVF for each order placed and back to back contract notes relating to the same transaction. None of these were produced by the defendant. 
 
(vi) The period February to April 1982 during which the plaintiff purportedly traded was winter in New York and Comex would have closed at 3am, Singapore time. But some of the plaintiff`s orders were purportedly received well past 3am, one was at 3.37am, although the position of a client without margin was to be squared on the same day before close of business. This shows there was no genuine trading by BVC on Comex. By requiring the customer`s position to be squared on the same day, BVC was thus able to square the customer`s position at the time of its choice when the market moved against the customer. 
 
(vii) The staff of BVF of Hong Kong were stationed in BVC. This shows that bucketing was being carried out by BVC on the instructions, and for the benefit, of the defendant and Lee. If the orders were in fact telexed to BVF in Hong Kong, each order would have been properly recorded by the telexes and contract notes. There would have been no need for BVF staff to be stationed in BVC unless the orders were bucketed and they were here to monitor the same on behalf of Lee. 
 
(viii) The trading balance sheet for 2 March 1982 has serial number 02264 but the trading balance sheet for 8 March 1982 (six days later) bore an earlier serial number 02186. The latter, showing a sale of ten lots, is also not backed up by a report of selling order as there ought to be in a bona fide commodity trading transaction. 
 
(ix) After the winding-up of BVC, no steps were taken to recover the balance purportedly due from the plaintiff to BVC on the accounts. 
 
(x) The defendant knew of, or directed, the bucketing operations. I, therefore, find that the plaintiff was induced by the defendant to trade on Comex through BVC, that his orders were bucketed by BVC on the defendant`s direction as a director, and that no genuine trading on Comex was carried out on the plaintiff`s behalf.
  
 
 
On the liability of a director for the tort of a company committed on his direction, see 
 Wah Tat Bank Ltd & Ors v Chan Cheng Kum 
 ,14 in which Lord Salmond, in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said at p 514: 
 
No doubt the fact that the respondent is chairman and managing director of [the company] does not of itself make him personally liable in respect of the company`s tortious acts. A tort may be committed through an officer or servant of the company without the chairman or managing director being in any way implicated. There are many such cases reported in the books. If, however, the chairman or managing director procures or directs the commission of the tort, he may be personally liable for the tort and the damage flowing from it. ...
 
 
 
The defendant also raised the issue of limitation. It is not disputed that more than six years had elapsed from the dates of these purported transactions before these proceedings were commenced. But this action is based on fraud. By virtue of s 29 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163), time did not begin to run until the plaintiff had discovered the fraud. The plaintiff began to suspect that something was amiss only when he was advised by the police in July 1983 not to make further payments. These proceedings were commenced on 24 January 1989. Therefore, the claim is not statute barred.
Accordingly, I enter judgment in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant for the sum of $272,300 being the total amount of the 21 payments made by the plaintiff in part satisfaction of what he was led to believe were his genuine trading losses on Comex. The amount is to carry interest at 6% pa calculated from the date of each payment set out in the schedule hereunder. The plaintiff is also awarded costs of this action.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an action for passing-off and the question is whether the defendants` orange drink `Purdy`s` will be purchased by members of the public as being or associated with the plaintiffs` orange drink `Orangina` because of the bulb-shaped bottle, textured surface sleever, etc.
The plaintiffs claim: 
 
 
(1) an injunction restraining the defendants from passing off any product which is not the plaintiffs` Orangina product as and for the plaintiffs` product and, in particular, from manufacturing, or causing to be manufactured, importing, distributing, advertising for sale, offering for sale or selling the Purdy`s product in bottles, containers or packaging bearing the get-up substantially identical with or misleadingly or deceptively similar to the Orangina; 
 
(2) an order for delivery up, or destruction under supervision of the plaintiffs, of products the manufacture, importation, distribution, advertisement for sale, offer for sale or sale of which by the defendant would be a breach of the injunction; 
 
(3) full discovery; 
 
(4) damages or, at the plaintiffs` option, an account of profits; and 
 
(5) interest and costs.
  
 
 
The first plaintiff is a company incorporated under the laws of France. The second plaintiff is a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America and is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the first plaintiff.
The defendants are a company incorporated in Singapore. It has a paid-up capital of $2. The two directors are married to each other.
 Orangina
In 1936, a concentrated orange juice product was manufactured, distributed and sold in bulb-shaped bottles by one Leon Beton under the mark `Orangina` (`Orangina product`). Leon Beton incorporated the company Campagnie Francaise des Produits Orangina (`CFPO`) in 1952 which manufactured and sold the Orangina product.
In 1984, the first plaintiff acquired the company selling CFPO, thereby gaining ownership of the reputation and goodwill of the Orangina product, and created a division within the company called Orangina International Company to co-ordinate the manufacture and marketing of the Orangina product. After 1985, Orangina International Company and the second plaintiff developed an international market for the Orangina product by advertising, promoting, offering for sale and selling the Orangina product outside France.
The Orangina product sold in Singapore has the following features: 
 
 
(a) The Orangina bottle is bulb-shaped. 
 
(b) The entire exposed area of the Orangina bottle has a textured surface. 
 
(c) The Orangina bottle has a plastic neck sleever which cuts off just below the screw cap.
  
 
 
The Orangina product with the above get-up has been extensively advertised, promoted, offered for sale and sold in Singapore by the plaintiffs since 1986. The plaintiffs say they have acquired, and enjoy, a substantial reputation and goodwill in Singapore and internationally of the Orangina product in the above get-up and Orangina has become known in the trade and to the public in Singapore and internationally as signifying the product of the plaintiffs. Orangina is now available in cans and PET bottles which are not bulb-shaped.
 Purdy`s in the market
In early August 1990, the defendants offered for sale an orange-based drink in bulb-shaped bottles. Legal action was threatened on the ground that the get-up was substantially identical with the plaintiffs` product or misleadingly or deceptively similar to the get-up of the Orangina product. The defendants withdrew the product, but have now introduced `Purdy`s` after making a few changes.
The plaintiffs claim that the defendants had wrongfully sold, passed off, or participated in the sale and passing-off, or caused, enabled or assisted others to pass off their product as and for the Orangina product and is still offering for sale and/or causing to be offered for sale the Purdy`s product.
The plaintiffs are unable to give particulars of all the specific acts of passing-off committed by the defendants and seek to recover damages and an account of profits in respect of each and every act of passing-off where the defendants had deceived and misled the trade and public into believing that the Purdy`s product is, or is associated with, the Orangina product.
The plaintiffs` sales and marketing manager`s evidence is that the Orangina product has been sold in the bulb-shaped bottle since 1936 and that Orangina product has been sold in its present shape since 1936. The Orangina product has been sold in Singapore in its present get-up since its first introduction in Singapore, and was sold in Singapore for five years before the defendants introduced the Purdy`s product.
The sale of the Orangina product in the bulb-shaped bottle has been substantial. About 2,833,284 Orangina products had been sold in the subject get-up in Singapore by December 1990. In 1990, a total of 237,300 Orangina products in the subject get-up was sold. The plaintiffs produced the range of get-up for orange beverages, to which the Orangina product belongs. The defendants added four products making a total of 27 such items.
Fifteen of the 27 items were packaged in cans, six in plastic containers and six in glass bottles. Of the six items packaged in glass bottles, Green Spot bottles are now not available in glass bottles in Singapore. The Sunkist Orange product is not regarded as being within the same class of goods as it is a concentrated syrup and not a beverage.
 Orange beverages in bottles
The only orange beverage products in the market packaged in bottles apart from the plaintiffs` and defendants` products are Lucozade, Spring Valley, Sunraysia and Granini orange products. The bottles are not bulb-shaped and do not have a plastic neck sleever. They all bear a paper label on the main body of the product. The defendants` get-up of the Purdy`s product has the closest resemblance to the plaintiffs` Orangina product, which, the plaintiffs say, is distinct and the defendants are cashing in on the distinctive get-up and the reputation and goodwill in the get-up of the plaintiffs` bottle.
 The five attributes of Orangina
The plaintiffs say that their distributors and bottlers all over the world are educated by way of a video presentation on the five attributes of the Orangina product. One of the five attributes is the bottle. The video presentation shows that the bottle is the brand symbol notwithstanding the availability of the beverage in cans. Mr Wolfgang Haf, the accounts director of Dentsu Young & Rubicam, the advertising company in charge of the plaintiffs` advertising efforts in Singapore, testified that his company had been involved in the promotion of the plaintiffs` product since its launch in November 1985, and that, although he was personally involved from 1989, the marketing strategy has remained consistent since 1985 in using the shape of the bottle as the key focus of the plaintiffs` marketing efforts.
Mr Wolfgang Haf said that the bottle is unique in its form and shape and is clearly recognizable at the point of sale or when advertising. Mr Haf`s advertising efforts were channelled towards the creation of the strongest possible association in the minds of the public between what he called `the highly distinctive packaging` and the product content.
A variety of promotion items and promotional material were tendered as exhibits in court, and there is evidence of contests organized in newspapers to create awareness of the product and to create further awareness of the get-up. Between 1985 to November 1992, over $3m was spent on promoting and, the plaintiffs say, the focus of advertisements was on the distinctive get-up. Publication in newspapers, television and cinemas for the length of time the Orangina product has been in the market has effectively achieved the plaintiffs` purpose of creating an association in the minds of the public of the get-up and the plaintiffs` product and its contents.
Mr Leroy McCully, a consumer, gave evidence that he mistook the defendants` product to be the plaintiffs` product, and that Purdy`s was bought in the mistaken belief that he was purchasing Orangina. He left me with the impression that he was not all that enthusiastic over the shape of the bottle or Orangina and just wanted an orange drink. He was aware that it was not Orangina before him but, nevertheless, consumed it.
Linda Chu, the plaintiffs` sales and marketing manager, admitted that although the shape of the bottle is constant, the sleeve might not be present. In France, the Orangina product has no sleeve and has only a bottle cap.
 Defence
The defendants` case is that the Orangina product does not have the distinctive get-up claimed by the plaintiffs. Orangina is not the only bulb-shaped bottle for orange or orange-based drinks in the Singapore market that has a textured surface on the entire exposed area of the bottle, nor is it the only bottle with a plastic neck sleever which cuts off just below the screw cap. The plaintiffs market and sell the Orangina drink in bulb-shaped bottles, cans and one-litre PET bottles, and the get-up of the `Purdy`s` product is substantially different from the get-up of `Orangina`.
The liquid of the Purdy`s product is a rich orange colour and different from the Orangina product which is a pale yellow colour. The colour and design of the label and trade mark logo of the Purdy`s product is completely different and distinct from that of the Orangina product. The label on the Purdy`s product is green but the label on the Orangina product is blue. Purdy`s product has the word `Purdy`s` on it distinguishing it from the Orangina product. The Purdy`s bottle has a shorter neck and a squat base with a fuller round bulb, whereas the bottle of the Orangina product is a slimmer bottle with a longer neck and a more slender bulb shape. A photograph was produced showing the two products on sale to make the point that the bulb-shaped bottles look, and are, different so that there cannot be deception and the public misled.
The Purdy`s product is sold in 235ml bottles and the Orangina product is sold in 200ml bottles. The orange juice of the Purdy`s product contains 30% juice and is a still drink. The orange drink of the Orangina product contains 12% juice and is tangy and carbonated. The products are different from each other and the get-up of the Purdy`s product was adopted and used by the defendants in good faith without reference to the get-up of the Orangina. The Purdy`s product is not calculated to mislead nor can it lead to the defendants` product being passed off as an Orangina product. If the proof of the pudding is in the eating, then the puddings here will taste different.
The defendants deny having passed off or sold any goods as being or as for the plaintiffs` goods and no person could reasonably be expected to be deceived or led to believe that the Purdy`s product was the plaintiffs` Orangina product or in any way associated with the Orangina product because of the differences in the get-up.
 Differences in get-up
There are three differences in the get-up between the `Orangina bulb-shaped bottle with blue sleeve` (P2) sold in Singapore and `Orangina with bottle cap as sold in France` (P3): 
 
 
(1) one has a sleeve, the other does not have a sleeve; 
 
(2) one has a label, the other does not have a label; and 
 
(3) one has a screw cap, the other does not have a screw cap.
  
 
 
There are also differences in the get-up between P2, the Orangina bottle with a paper label and screw cap, and P4, which has a neck sleever and a label on the belly of the bottle. The plastic sleever on P2 is a legal requirement and sets out the ingredients in the product and is functional. Orangina is available in cans and in plastic PET bottles (1.25 litres). The bulb-shaped bottle and cans were introduced around the same time in November 1985/1986. In 1987, a one-litre glass bottle was introduced but was withdrawn at the end of 1987 or early 1988. In 1990, the Orangina PET bottle was introduced. The Orangina cans on sale today are in blue 325ml can which have a different logo.
The exhibits used to promote the reputation of the Orangina product have some minor differences: 
 
 
(1) There is no blue sleever on the Orangina-shaped plastic lamp (P31), the button pin of Orangina with an on/off flashing capacity (P32), the plastic toy top with spring mechanism (P34), the Orangina collar pins (P35), the Orangina racquet bag (P36), and the glass featuring the bulb-shape of Orangina is very French (P37); 
 
(2) There is no screw cap on the Orangina-shaped plastic lamp (P31); 
 
(3) The Orangina magnet (P33) and Orangina collar pins do not have a textured surface; 
 
(4) The Great Orangina Cash Flow Promotion required cans and PET bottles to be purchased in one transaction but there was no requirement to buy bulb-shaped bottles.
  
 
 
 
 Names and shapes
 
The defendants produced materials which they say promote the brand name Orangina rather than the Orangina product in the bulb-shaped bottles: 
 
 
(1) The Orangina Sweep has no bulb-shaped bottle in the Cold Storage retail chain promotion to encourage consumers to buy more Orangina. There are two logos of Orangina but no bulb-shaped bottle is shown. The product displayed is the Orangina can. 
 
(2) 
 The Straits Times 
 dated 26 March 1992 shows PET bottles of Orangina being advertised and no bulb-shaped bottles. 
 
(3) 
 The Straits Times 
 dated 6 November 1992 shows Orangina being advertised in two PET bottles. No bulb-shaped bottle was advertised. 
 
(4) 
 The Straits Times 
 dated 24 October 1992 advertises two PET bottles of Orangina. No bulb-shaped bottle was advertised.
  
 
 
 
 Video commercials
 
The three video commercials, the defendants say, promote the brand Orangina, rather than the Orangina product in the get-up of the bulb-shaped bottle, for the following reasons: 
 
 
(1) Both the `Waiter animation` commercial and the `Restaurant` commercial feature a bulb-shaped bottle with no blue sleever, and the PET bottle was also displayed. 
 
(2) The `Swing` commercial features a bulb-shaped bottle with no blue sleever. The Orangina can and Orangina PET bottle were displayed at the end of the commercial. 
 
(3) All three commercials show a bulb-shaped bottle with a blue label on the belly of the bottle. 
 
(4) The get-up of P2 does not appear in all the commercials and the get-up of the bulb-shaped bottle as in P4 also appears.
  
 
 
Mr Wolfgang Haf said that the key focus of the marketing efforts of the plaintiffs is the bulb-shaped bottle but the `Water skiing` commercial shows a bulb-shaped bottle and 1.0 litre glass bottle which is bulb-shaped at the top. This 1.0 litre glass bottle has been taken over by the plastic PET bottle with a different shape and the get-up for the PET bottle has taken over the 1.0 litre glass bottle.
The `Restaurant` commercial shows the bulb-shaped bottle with the blue label around the belly of the bottle. The bottle in this commercial has, in fact, the same get-up as in P4. Mr Wolfgang Haf has admitted that it is different from P2 in two ways: 
 
 
(1) there is an embossed glass inscription on P2; and 
 
(2) the neck labels are different.
  
 
 
In his evidence, Mr Wolfgang Haf also accepted that the `Redeem a gift` promotion involved the exchanging of six Orangina pull rings or six labels from the bulb-shaped bottle or three labels from the PET bottle for a prize. The bulb-shaped bottle is, therefore, not the main emphasis in this promotion.
Mr Wolfgang Haf accepted that three of the five prizes in the promotion featured the bulb-shaped bottle but the plastic toy with the spring mechanism is in the shape of the bulb-shaped bottle without the blue label or sleever. The Orangina racquet bag which is shaped like a bottle has no blue sleever/label. The button pin of Orangina with on/off flashing capacity has no blue label/sleever or screw cap as it is an artist`s version.
In re-examination, Mr Wolfgang Haf said that the public would be able to identify the button pin (P32), the plastic toy (P34) and the racquet bag (P36) as Orangina because the name Orangina was on each of the exhibits but no evidence was adduced to say that the public perception would be that P32, P34 and P36 would be so identified without the word `Orangina` on them.
The `The New Paper/Orangina Mind Games` made use of the bulb-shaped bottle, but the snappy slogan was `Shake the bottle, wake the taste`. The evidence of Mr Wolfgang Haf went some way to support the defendants` contention that the orange drink Orangina is better, if not equally well, known by its sing-song name `Orangina` which is available in bulb-shaped bottles, cans and PET bottles.
 Issues
The issues before me were: 
 
 
(1) Whether the plaintiffs have a reputation and goodwill in respect of the Orangina orange drink as marketed in the get-up comprising: 
 
(a) the bulb-shape of the bottle; 
 
(b) the orange textured surface on the bottle; and 
 
(c) the plastic neck sleever with Orangina and the logo. 
 
(2) Whether there has been misrepresentation by the defendants by their sale of the Purdy`s orange drink in its get-up: 
 
(a) the bulb-shaped bottle with a bigger belly; 
 
(b) the textured surface of dots; and 
 
(c) the green screw on cap and sleever with the name `Purdy`s`. 
 
(3) Whether loss and damage has been suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the misrepresentation.

 84 LJ Ch 449, and the later cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing-off: (1) a misrepresentation, (2) made by a trader in the course of trade, (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence) and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so. ...
 
 
 
The question whether the plaintiffs have a reputation and goodwill in the `Orangina` orange drink in the bulb-shaped bottle with the textured surface and the plastic neck sleever requires an examination of two main elements: 
 
 
(1) reputation; and 
 
(2) goodwill.
  
 
 
 
 Reputation
 
The plaintiffs must show that the orange drink in bulb-shaped bottles has become distinctive of the plaintiffs` goods and that the get-up is understood by the trade and the public in this country as meaning that the goods are the plaintiffs` goods because the plaintiffs, by using and making known the get-up in relation to their goods have caused the plaintiffs to be associated or identified with the orange drink in bulb-shaped bottles and have acquired a quasi-proprietary right to the exclusive use of the get-up, which right is invaded if any person uses the same or some deceptively similar get-up in relation to goods not of the plaintiffs` manufacture because it would induce customers to buy goods not of the plaintiffs` manufacture as goods of the plaintiffs` manufacture, thereby diverting to himself orders intended for and rightfully belonging to the plaintiffs. (See p 353 para 16-10 of 
 Kerly`s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names 
 for a definition of reputation, and para 2.02 of Wadlow`s 
 The Law of Passing-Off 
 (1990 Ed) for a definition of goodwill.)
The action for passing off at common law originally grew out of the action for deceit, and, like the action for deceit, required a false representation made fraudulently, but differed from it in that the persons deceived were the plaintiff`s customers rather than the plaintiff himself. The action at common law was extended to cases where the defendants` customers were not themselves deceived but the defendants sold fraudulently marked goods to retail dealers with the express purpose of the goods being resold to ultimate purchasers as the plaintiffs` goods. Equity`s protection was based on a right of property as against relief of law based on fraud.
In 
 Schweppes Ltd v Gibbens 
 ,2 at pp 606-607 (HL), Lord Halsbury LC expressed the view that, if persons are so careless that they do not treat the label fairly but take the goods without sufficient consideration and without reading what is written plainly on them, they cannot be said to be deceived because they do not care what they are getting. A competing trader may adopt a get-up similar to that of the plaintiff`s product not in order to pass-off his goods as the plaintiff`s but in order to impliedly represent to the public that his goods are similar to, or a substitute for, the plaintiff`s, thus competing in, and taking advantage of, a market created by the plaintiff`s efforts; this is legitimate so long as he does not thereby represent his product as the plaintiff`s.
In 
 John Haig & Co Ltd v Forth Blending Co and Paterson 
 ,3 the petitioner had sold a brand of whisky in distinctively shaped bottles known as `three-pinch decanters` but which had come to be known as `Dimple` bottles and this brand was commonly asked for as `Dimple` whisky. The respondent was restrained from selling whisky not blended by the petitioner in `Dimple` bottles for consumption in the UK even though the respondent`s labels were quite different to the petitioner`s labels.
In 
 Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden (No 3) 
 ,4 an injunction was granted restraining the use of plastic simulated lemon-shaped containers but in 
 John Haig & Co Ltd v Brooks & Bohm (Wine Shippers) Ltd 
 ,5 Roxburgh J refused an injunction as the defendant`s bottles had no actual depressions and the plaintiff had not shown there was any likelihood of the public buying by the shape of the defendant`s bottles. And in 
 Coca-Cola Co v AG Barr & Co Ltd 
 ,6 an injunction was refused as the respondent`s drink was of a different colour to the petitioner`s though the bottles were of the same shape. In this case, the orange drinks are of a different colour.
 Simulation protection
Leonard J, in the High Court of Hong Kong in 
 Kemtron Properties 
 Pty Ltd v Jimmy`s Co Ltd 
, dealt with the ambit of the protection given to a trader against simulation of his product by a rival trader.
The plaintiffs in that case marketed the Mistral fan in Hong Kong under a United Kingdom patent registered in Hong Kong. The defendant also marketed an almost identical fan known as the Koolaire. The court concluded that the fans were almost identical and that the defendant`s fan was a copy of the plaintiffs`. The only distinguishing feature was that the defendant`s fan bore the name Koolaire instead of the name Mistral which appeared on the plaintiff`s fan. The plaintiffs sought to restrain the defendant from selling the Koolaire fan. The substantial questions to be tried were the two issues of patent infringement and passing-off. The question of patent infringement posed no problem but the allegation of passing-off became the contentious issue.
The learned judge said that the courts have repeatedly said that copying alone is not passing-off. Any trader is free to copy and sell the product of another provided it does not result in infringement of copyright or patent, or of a registered trade mark or design, and provided that the copies do not directly or indirectly represent that the product is that of the plaintiffs, by copying a get-up distinctive of the plaintiffs`. The two requirements of distinctiveness and misrepresentation, not simple misappropriation, are regarded as basic requirements of the action. The customers must buy the product thinking that it is the plaintiffs` because the get-up has become identified in their minds with the plaintiffs` goods and, even where the defendant puts his name on the goods, it will not be enough, if a customer thinks that it is the product of the plaintiffs.
The manufacturers of Purdy`s and the plaintiffs are competing traders. The director of the defendants` company, Mr Jirasak, gave evidence. He is a shrewd businessman. He was not interested in expensive litigation but in legitimate business, even if it required cutting things fine, provided it was proper. The defendants may have taken advantage of a market created by the plaintiffs` efforts in creating a market for orange juice but there is a difference between a drink that emphasizes the natural and healthy drink and the fizzy fun drink of the plaintiffs.
 Court`s duty
The court`s duty is to have regard to the characteristics which are common to the trade. Bulb-shaped bottles are used to sell drinks of various kinds and by those in the trade selling the better orange drinks. Its use as such is unobjectionable. The defendants have not copied all the features of the get-up of the plaintiffs` bottle.
 Shape and passing-off
It is possible for passing-off to occur by reason of the similarity of the shape, as opposed to the features, but where what is sought to be restrained is the copying of the bulb-shape of the plaintiffs` bottle which has value in use, as opposed to capricious attributes of shape or colour, the courts are reluctant to allow a plaintiff to secure a monopoly in a new type or design of goods under the guise of a passing-off action. (See 
 William Edge & Sons Ltd v William Niccolls & Sons Ltd. 
)
The primary meaning of the shape of the bottle as bulb-shaped is descriptive. The plaintiffs face a heavy burden when they seek to prove that a shape which is prima facie functional has acquired a secondary meaning. There is no question of fraudulent intent because the product was withdrawn when challenged and changes made to the get-up, even when the defendants were of the opinion that bulb-shaped bottles have been in use from ancient times.
Confusion which arises as a result of a new competitor selling a type of goods which previously was sold by the plaintiffs is not regarded in law as arising from a representation made by the defendants. The trader who simply copies the attributes of the plaintiffs` goods which gives some benefit for use is not treated in law as thereby making a representation. It arises only when there is an adoption of a distinguishing combination of features, each of which is a utility which can amount to passing off. In this case, the screw caps are different in colour. Purdy`s stands out as a name. The texture on the bottle, its round belly and the different colour of the drink make the defendants` bulb-shaped bottle `Purdy`s` distinctive.
Bulb-shaped bottles have ancient origins. I accept the photograph that was produced to show that the products, when displayed for sale, can be distinguished. The term `get-up` has never been clearly defined and it is in the vagueness of the concept that the principal confusion in the area lies, but the courts are more ready to find passing off where there is clear evidence of deliberate copying as in the Mistral fan case7 because the issue becomes one of unfair competition and the defendant seeking to reap where he has not sown.
 Exhibits
When the plaintiffs` exhibits of its orange juice in bulb-shaped bottles are compared, P2 has a dark blue screw cap, blue sleever and is described as a `sparkling citrus juice drink`. The texture of the orange has been reproduced on the surface of the bottle and the name `Orangina` appears on the screw cap with the logo of an orange peel that is artistic and appealing.
The words `
 Orangina a la pulp du fruit gazeifiee 
 ` is embossed on the glass and the name Orangina in capital letters appear in white against the dark blue background of the sleever.
Four bottles of the plaintiffs` Orangina product were produced: 
 
 
P2: Orangina bulb-shaped bottle with dark blue sleever and screw-on cap, etc; 
 
P3: Orangina bulb-shaped bottle as sold in France with a bottle cap and without a sleever; 
 
P4: Orangina bulb-shaped bottle with a paper label and blue screw-on cap without a sleever; 
 
P51: Orangina in bulb-shaped bottle with a light blue cap.
  
 
 
The colour of the drink, the bulb-shaped bottle and texture are consistent features but the get-up cannot be said to consist only of the bulb shape of the bottles.
When the defendants` product, Purdy`s (P5), is placed alongside the range of the bottles, the blue and green sleevers and the different colours of the drinks stand out so that no man can say you passed `Purdy`s` for `Orangina`. The photograph of the plaintiffs` and defendants` products on the shelf (P30) is decisive.
The plaintiffs have run their case by seeking to establish goodwill and reputation in the name Orangina in the bulb-shaped bottle as the get-up in which they have reputation and goodwill in orange drinks. The name Orangina has been widely advertised locally and large sums have been spent in promoting it. Its sales are substantial since its introduction here in 1985 and its sales figures have increased. There is no dispute on that score but it is the plaintiffs` claim that the bulb-shaped bottle is distinctive in design and appearance and forms part of the get-up that is in issue.
In 
 Williams v Bronnley 
 ,9 Fletcher Moulton LJ as he then was, said: 
 
... The get-up of an article means a capricious addition to the article itself - the colour, or shape, it may be, of the wrapper, or anything of that kind; but I strongly object to look at anything that has a value in use as part of the get-up of the article. Anything which is in itself useful appears to me rightly to belong to the article itself. For instance, supposing the firm had been, say for 20 years, the only firm to sell wooden chairs in which the natural wood was simply varnished, and not painted at all, that would not give them the slightest right to complain of a person putting on the market chairs simply varnished, even though they have been the only persons who had sold them for so long that such chairs might at first be supposed to be their manufacture. The reason is that the newcomer has not in any way imitated the get-up; he has only produced an article. ...
 
 
 
An external examination shows differences: the contents are different in colour and in quantity. When placed side by side for sale, their differences stand out.
The question of recognition by `the relevant members of the trade` has not been stressed in this case and the question is one of recognition by the public. In 
 John Haig & Co Ltd v Forth Blending Co and Paterson 
 ,10 Lord Hill Watson set out a number of legal propositions. Proposition 5, at p 261, contains this sentence: 
 
... No trader, by adopting and using a particular style of get-up, thereby acquires a right to prevent a rival or second trader using the same or a similar get-up, unless the get-up of the first trader has become so associated in the minds of the public with the first trader`s goods as to be distinctive of the goods of the first trader and of no other. ...
 
 
 
Where the `get-up` consists of characteristics of the product itself, such as the shape and colour of the article itself, such proof is not easy because the common law leans against the recognition of a monopoly right. The plaintiffs` task to establish such a right is particularly difficult where, as here, the distinctiveness claimed for the product itself in some degree involves a copy of, or supposed resemblance to, some pre-existing artistic style in bottles.
A distinctive feature of an article which has utility may be a feature of get-up lawful to copy but, as 
 Kerly 
 (10th Ed, at p 420) has observed, `courts have shown themselves astute to reject attempts to prevent copying of goods under the guise of passing-off action`, whilst giving relief where the copying of a combination of features, each of them utilitarian, amounts to the appropriation of get-up.
In 
 Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc & Ors 
 ,11 at p 499, Lord Oliver of Aylmerton said: 
 
Although your Lordships were referred in the course of the argument to a large number of reported cases, this is not a branch of the law in which reference to other cases is of any real assistance except analogically. It has been observed more than once that the questions which arise are, in general, questions of fact. Neither the appellants nor the respondents contend that the principles of law are in any doubt. The law of passing-off can be summarized in one short general proposition - no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying `get-up` (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognized by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff`s goods or services. Secondly, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff. Whether the public is aware of the plaintiff`s identity as the manufacturer or supplier of the goods or services is immaterial, as long as they are identified with a particular source which is, in fact, the plaintiff. For example, if the public is accustomed to rely upon a particular brand name in purchasing goods of a particular description, it matters not at all that there is little or no public awareness of the identity of the proprietor of the brand name. Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers, or, in a quia timet action, that he is likely to suffer, damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant`s misrepresentation that the source of the defendant`s goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.
 
 
 
Thus, the three issues in the instant case, leaving aside the issue of fraud which is now no longer material, were and are as follows: 
 
 
(i) Have the respondents proved that the get-up under which their lemon juice has been sold since 1956 has become associated in the minds of substantial numbers of the purchasing public specifically and exclusively with the respondents` (or Jif) lemon juice? 
 
(ii) If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, does the get-up under which the appellants proposed to market their lemon juice in all or any of the Mark I, Mark II or Mark III versions amount to a representation by the appellants that the juice which they sell is `Jif` lemon juice? 
 
(iii) If the answer to that question is in the affirmative, is it, on a balance of probabilities, likely that, if the appellants are not restrained as they have been, a substantial number of members of the public will be misled into purchasing the defendants` lemon juice in the belief that it is the respondents` Jif juice?
  
 
 
The three questions that I must ask and answer are: 
 
 
(i) Have the plaintiffs proved that the get-up under which their orange drink has been sold in Singapore since 1985 has become associated in the minds of substantial numbers of the purchasing public specifically and exclusively with the plaintiffs` Orangina in bulb-shaped bottles? 
 
(ii) If the answer to that question is `yes`, does the `get-up` under which the defendants propose to market Purdy`s, in their version of bulb-shaped bottle, amount to a representation by the defendants that the orange drink which they sell is the fun drink which must be associated with the plaintiffs` product Orangina sold in bulb-shaped bottles? 
 
(iii) If the answer to the second question is `yes`, is it, on a balance of probabilities, likely that, if the defendants are not restrained, a substantial number of members of the public will be misled into purchasing the defendants` orange drink named `Purdy`s` in bulb-shaped bottles in the belief that it is the plaintiffs` orange drink `Orangina` in bulb-shaped bottles?
  
 
 
In my judgment, the plaintiffs have proved that their orange drink Orangina has been sold in Singapore since 1985. It is available in bulb shaped bottles, cans and PET bottles. `Orangina` has become associated in the minds of the public as a French soft drink and its singsong name has goodwill and reputation.
I am unable to find that there is a likelihood of the public buying the defendants` Purdy`s orange juice, in its bulb-shaped bottles, as Orangina or that it will become associated in the minds of substantial members of the public as being the plaintiffs` product for it does not have, inter alia, the French flair stressed in the video commercials.
The defendants` Purdy`s orange juice, in its bulb-shaped bottles, has a shape, colour and a get-up that is distinct. I find that there is no misrepresentation and `Purdy`s is not likely to be passed off as Orangina`, notwithstanding the evidence of Mr Le Roy.
It is not likely, on a balance of probabilities, for substantial members of the public in Singapore to be misled into purchasing the health drink `Purdy`s` when they want the fun drink `Orangina`.
I am unable to say that the defendants` orange juice, with pretensions to being a natural orange juice, in the Purdy`s bulb-shaped bottle get-up, will be associated with the plaintiffs `Orangina` in bulb-shaped bottles in the public mind.
The plaintiffs` claim is dismissed with costs.

The appellant, a female Hong Kong resident, was convicted on 19 October 1993 and sentenced to death on a charge of having imported into Singapore on 26 July 1992 a controlled drug without any authorization and having thereby committed an offence under s 7 punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`).
She was arrested at Terminal 1 of Changi Airport on her arrival from Bangkok after a routine customs search of her two bags revealed a total of 22 packets of substance containing not less than 4,103.7g of diamorphine within the linings of two winter jackets found inside the two bags. At the time of her arrest she was 28 years of age.
According to the appellant, in April 1990, she had met a man named Jim at her birthday party in a disco in Hong Kong. After several outings with Jim and another friend, she had made a loan to Jim of HK$30,000. When she needed the money about one and a half month`s later and asked for the return of the money, Jim told her that he had no money in Hong Kong but had money with friends in Bangkok. At Jim`s suggestion, the appellant subsequently travelled to Bangkok on 22 July 1992 to collect the money which Jim owed to her. Jim had told her that she would be met on arrival by two men, whom he described and one of whom was called Michael, who would take care of her.
At Bangkok airport, she was met by Michael and another man. The next day, which was 23 July 1992, they took her sightseeing. Nothing significant took place on 24 July 1992. But on 25 July 1992 Michael and his companion came to see her in the hotel in the morning. They paid her hotel bill and moved her to another hotel. While checking into the new hotel, they took her passport. Later, when the three of them went up to her room with the luggage, Michael told her that the purpose of her visit to Bangkok was not merely to collect her money but she had also to do something else, namely, to help Jim to bring two or three packets of hashish to Europe.
At this point, it will be helpful if we set out the at length the learned judicial commissioner`s account of what happened next. 
 
The accused protested instantly saying that she would not do such a thing and that her purpose of coming to Bangkok was to collect her money, after which she would be returning to Hong Kong. Michael tried to assuage her. He said that hashish was not illegal and that since Jim was her friend for many years he would not make use of her. The accused again told Michael that she would not do such a thing and was intent on returning to Hong Kong as soon as she had collected the money. At that time Michael`s expression changed, so too did the expression of his companion.
 
 
 
Michael presently took out the bills which he had just settled at the previous hotel, showed it to the accused and asked her menacingly as to why she had to make long distance calls from the hotel. The accused explained to him that she had only made calls to her friends. Michael admonished her and told her in no uncertain terms that she should not make any further long distance calls to Hong Kong or anywhere else. He was stern. He then startled her by saying that he knew many secret society members in the Chinatown of Bangkok and that one of his legs was injured in a gang fight. He claimed that he came from mainland China with a false passport and he had many other false passports from other countries. The accused was frightened. She immediately asked Michael for the return of her passport. Michael did not oblige and appeared angry. Yet, he left the room with a smile on his face. Her passport was not returned to her. Michael`s companion too departed with him.
Before they left the room, Michael gave the accused a piece of paper on which was written: Thailand to Singapore; Singapore to Sweden and Sweden to Amsterdam. Michael instructed the accused that, when she arrived in Singapore from Bangkok, she would have to stay in Singapore for a night and purchase a ticket from SAS Airline for Sweden. After arrival in Sweden, she should purchase a 24-hour ferry ticket to Amsterdam. He also gave her a telephone number belonging to Star Paging Station in Hong Kong with some specific instructions as to how she should use that number. She was also told that, when leaving messages at the number called, she should not disclose her actual place of stay. She was also advised that once she had contacted the said number, someone would meet her at Amsterdam and that person would give her a sum of HK$110,000. She would have to bring the whole sum to Hong Kong, where she would be paid HK$30,000 owed by Jim to her and another sum of HK$10,000 for her efforts.
Michael promised to come and see her again on 26 July 1992. On 26 July 1992, at about 6am, someone knocked at the door of her room. There was a man at the door who claimed to be Michael`s friend. He informed her that Michael was busy. He had with him two travel bags. An airline ticket and her passport were given to her. The airline ticket was for her flight to Singapore for the same day. Whilst he was in her room, he opened the two bags which he had brought along with him and removed from them some men`s clothing except for two jackets - one in each bag.
The accused was curious and wanted to touch the jackets but was stopped by the man. He prevented her from touching the jackets stating that there were two or three packets of hashish inside. The accused wanted to take out the jackets and inspect them but the man told her that the jackets were nicely folded and as they were large, once taken out, it would be difficult to fold the jackets back in the manner they were in. The accused enquired from him whether the jackets contained only hashish. She told him that if they were heroin, she would not take them with her. The man assured her that she need not fear. He said that Jim and the accused were friends for many years and, as such, Jim would not make use of her. He then hurried her to get ready. At one stage when she emerged from the bathroom, she saw him transferring her personal belongings from her own bag into the two bags. She also noticed the man spraying some perfume on the two bags which he had earlier brought along. He told her to hurry up.
The man also gave her US$3,000, stating that the moneys were for her travel expenses. Her old luggage bag was retained by the man. He told her that it would be returned to her when she arrived in Hong Kong after the trip. The two bags the man brought along were the same bags which were seized from her when she arrived in Singapore (exh P-56, the green floral bag and exh P-57, the dark brown bag).
In the event, both of them left for the Bangkok airport. The man helped her to carry the bags all the way to the airport and also assisted in placing the bags on the conveyor belt at the check-in counter of the airport.
When she was aboard the flight from Bangkok to Singapore, she started reflecting on what had happened in Bangkok. She recalled that in Bangkok the people whom she had met had turned from good to bad. She told herself that since she had now US$3,000 which was equivalent to HK$21,000 she would not proceed to Sweden as suggested by Michael but would instead return to Hong Kong. She had no intention of going to Sweden for after all, she had already received a substantial part of the loan which she had given to Jim.
The accused claimed that before her arrival in Singapore she had no knowledge that carrying drugs attracted the death penalty. As for hashish, though she was aware that it was an offence to be in possession of it, she claimed that most people would not get arrested for it in Hong Kong.
 Trial in the High Court
It will be noticed that her defence was that she agreed to carry the drugs partly because she was afraid of Michael`s secret society connections in Bangkok and partly because she thought that the drugs she was carrying were only hashish (cannabis). She would never have agreed to carry the drugs if she had known that they were heroin. She claimed to be ignorant of the possibility of the death penalty for drug offences in Singapore.
At the conclusion of the trial, the judicial commissioner found that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumptions under s 18 of the Act and was thus guilty as charged. The appellant was sentenced to death.
 Issues before the Court of Appeal
The two main grounds of her appeal before the Court of Appeal were that:
 
 
(1) the judicial commissioner had failed to consider the good character evidence of the appellant and that there was no contrary evidence adduced by the prosecution; and 
 
(2) that the judicial commissioner had erred in finding that the appellant had not, on a balance of probabilities, established lack of knowledge of the drugs seized from her.
  
 
 
 
 Good character
 
At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the appellant referred to the authority of 
 R v Berrada 
 and ss 55-56 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) to support the contention that the good character of the appellant was relevant to her credibility as a witness and that this had not been taken into consideration by the judicial commissioner during the trial. Even if we were to accept that the evidence of her good character and good family background was relevant to her credibility as a witness, we did not find it possible for us to believe that an alert and intelligent person, like the appellant, could have been manipulated into carrying the drugs into Singapore. In particular, we did not believe that she could have agreed to travel all the way to Bangkok on her own just to recover the loan which she had made to Jim.
In any event, because of the nature of the appellant`s defence and her own admission at trial that she thought she was carrying cannabis into Singapore, the evidence of her good character and good family background would not be of any material assistance to her defence or to rebutting the presumptions in s 18 of the Act.
 The presumptions under s 18 of the Act
Counsel for the appellant cited the case of 
 R v Taaffe 
 for the contention that when the state of an accused person`s mind and his knowledge were ingredients of the offence he was charged with, he had to be judged on the facts as he believed them to be. In our opinion, 
 R v Taaffe 
 was inapplicable for two reasons. First, Taaffe was caught importing a controlled drug. His defence was that he thought that he was smuggling currency and had mistakenly believed this to be an offence. Hence it was held by the House of Lords that even though he had committed the actus reus of importing a controlled drug, he did not have the mens rea of being `knowingly concerned` within s 170 of the English Customs and Excise Management Act 1979. The mere fact that he thought that smuggling currency was illegal (when it was actually legal) could not establish a guilty mind. In the present case, the appellant had admitted that she thought she was carrying cannabis. Unlike the smuggling of currency in 
 Taaffe 
, which was not a crime in England, cannabis is a controlled drug under the Act, and importation of cannabis is itself a crime in Singapore.
Secondly, unlike the English statute in 
 Taaffe 
, under s 18(2) of the Act in Singapore, there is a presumption that a defendant who is proved or presumed to be in possession of controlled drugs is deemed to know the nature of the drug. This, in effect, imposed a burden on the appellant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that she did not know the nature of the drugs that were in her possession.
The judicial commissioner`s reasons for rejecting the appellant`s defence and in finding that the presumptions had not been rebutted were as follows:
 
 
(1) she testified that she was instructed to fly to Singapore, purchase a ticket here to fly to Sweden, then travel to Amsterdam by ferry and subsequently return to Hong Kong, but her air ticket from Bangkok bore a return segment to Bangkok; 
 
(2) she had lied to the customs officers that she was going to Australia when first confronted; 
 
(3) her story that she was going to return to Hong Kong immediately was inconsistent with the return ticket and an entry in the disembarkation form suggesting that she was going to stay in Singapore for four days; and 
 
(4) her s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code (`CPC`) statement was silent on the details of her being tricked or coerced into carrying the drugs.
  
 
 
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the return ticket was not inconsistent with her story because she had not bought the ticket herself and she had no knowledge it was a return ticket. In view of her evidence of her background and her work experience, we had difficulty in accepting that she would not have at least looked at her air ticket.
As to her failure to mention the details of her defence in the s 122(6) CPC statement, the mere fact that the statement was taken late in the night was not relevant, since there was no suggestion of any inducement, threat or promise and there was no dispute as to the admissibility of the statement. The appellant was also not entitled to argue that since the statement was very brief, she could not have included all the details of her defence. Section 123 of the CPC is clear. If the appellant refused to include or mention in her s 122(6) statement any particulars of the defence which she wished to rely on at trial, the judicial commissioner was entitled to draw such inferences from that failure as might appear proper at the trial. Further, the consequences of not including the details of her defence had been read and explained to the appellant before she made the statement pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC and the appellant had chosen not to include the details of the defence which she raised later at the trial.
We were, therefore, of the view that the good character evidence of the appellant, even if accepted, would not affect her conviction as she had admitted that she knew she was carrying cannabis into Singapore. She had even suspected that the substance might have been heroin instead. We found therefore she had failed to rebut the presumptions stated in s 18 of the act.
Accordingly we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the verdict and the sentence passed by the judicial commissioner.

This is an appeal against the decision of TS Sinnathuray J convicting the appellant of trafficking in not less than 68.74g of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act(Cap 185) (`the Act`). After hearing counsel, we dismissed the appeal and indicated we would give our reasons later, which we now do.
The prosecution`s case rested on the appellant`s possession of 68.74g of diamorphine at the time of his arrest on 14 July 1992. Prior to this date, Inspector P Senthilnathan (`Insp Senthil`) received information that the appellant, a police supervisee, was suspected to be trafficking in three pounds of heroin a day. Acting on this, on 14 July, he briefed two groups of narcotic officers to arrest the appellant on sight. The first group, consisting of S/Sgt Shah Ni bin Hj Shah Rom, Cpl Quek Buck Tee, NO Chua Swee Keong and himself took up position at Blk 250 Jurong East St 24, where the appellant resided. The second group, consisting of NO Karlson Teh, Cpl Abdul Rahim bin Kromoh and NO Hansen Sebastian kept watch closeby at Blk 249.
At approximately 2.10pm, the appellant was sighted by the second group of officers seated in the front passenger seat of a lorry, licence plate number YD9482R in the carpark along with two others. In the carpark between Blks 246 and 248 the officers stopped the lorry and detained the three men. The appellant was arrested. The other two men were later ascertained to be Yeo Kok Chiong (`Yeo`) and Ong Gek Hua (`Ong`).
Insp Senthil was notified of the appellant`s arrest by Cpl Rahim. When he arrived at the scene of arrest, the appellant was squatting by the kerb next to the lorry. After a short exchange with Insp Senthil, the appellant admitted ownership of a green `
 Hour Glass 
` bag found on the floor of his seat in the lorry and also volunteered the information that the bag contained `peh hoon`. Both admissions were accepted by him at trial. The green bag contained three parcels of heroin: a red plastic bag containing five sachets of heroin, a pink-and-white striped plastic bag containing eight sachets of the same, and a newspaper bundle containing a large plastic packet of the same not divided into sachets. The appellant was then brought back to his flat. A search of the apartment revealed an electronic digital scale, some empty plastic bags, a disposable lighter, a pair of tweezers and a plastic spoon.
Thereafter, at approximately 3pm, the appellant was taken back to the CNB office. There, according to the appellant, he saw ASP Tan Hock Chuan weigh the heroin in his presence. The latter also told the appellant to look at the measurement shown on the scales. After his pre-statement medical check-up at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, between 7.05pm to 7.38pm, ASP Tan Hock Chuan, with the aid of interpreter Wu Nan Yong, recorded a cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The statement was admitted by the learned judge after a voire dire, and it stated: 
 
The heroin belongs to me. I wish that I will be dealt with leniently. That is all.
 
 
 
Upon analysis, it was found that the sachets in the red bag contained 4.31g of diamorphine, the sachets in the striped bag contained 3.55g of diamorphine, and the newspaper bundle contained 60.01g of diamorphine. The total amount of diamorphine came to 68.74g.
At first instance, the prosecution case rested squarely on the possession of not less than 68.74g of diamorphine and s 17 of the Act which presumed his act of possession to be an act of trafficking. No attempt was made by the appellant to rebut the presumption of trafficking. His defence focused merely on the amount of drugs he possessed. The appellant admitted possession of the red bag. He could not remember anything about the striped bag and his counsel conceded possession of this. The dispute centred on the newspaper bundle which contained 60.01g of diamorphine. The appellant contended that he had no knowledge of the presence of that bundle in the large green bag. Thus, he was only guilty of trafficking in not less than 7.86g of diamorphine.
To substantiate his defence, the appellant explained that three weeks after his previous release from remand, he began to trade in heroin. He admitted that the paraphernalia found in his flat was for the purpose of repacking heroin which he purchased into smaller packets for resale. However, he was merely a small-time distributor who had six to seven buyers, amongst whom were Ong, Yeo and one Tan Kwang Teck (`Tan`). His supplier was one Ah Chua and his partner in crime was nicknamed `Panjang`. Panjang was the appellant`s neighbour and old friend; the two men were often together and, amongst other things, they delivered drugs together.
On 14 July 1992, Panjang and the appellant arranged to meet and did meet at Pearl Centre. Panjang`s aim was to contact their supplier, Ah Chua, in order to buy more heroin. The appellant testified that he, however, still possessed enough heroin for his own purposes from a purchase made on 12 July 1992. He decided, nonetheless, to accompany Panjang to visit Ah Chua. The two men first went to Peninsular Centre where the appellant bought a watch for his father, which the shop put in the green `
 Hour Glass 
` paperbag. The appellant testified that they left for Pearl Bank, where Ah Chua lived. Whilst he was in Panjang`s car he received a message on his pager. He returned the call on his handphone and discovered that it was from Tan, who wished to purchase half a pound of heroin. He stated that, at this point, Panjang overheard him on the telephone and told him that he was able to get it for Tan. Tan was told to meet them at 1pm at Pearl Bank. When the three met, Tan handed the appellant $2,800 which the appellant handed over to Panjang. Panjang and the appellant then left Tan and waited beside the lift. Ah Chua came down and Panjang handed him $8,000 to $9,000 in return for one and a half pounds of heroin which were in a black plastic bag. According to the appellant, the extra one pound belonged to Panjang.
The three men then got into Panjang`s car. There Panjang emptied the contents of the black bag onto the floorboard. He put a half pound back into the black bag and handed the black bag to Tan. The appellant testified that he was not concentrating on events at this juncture. It was the defence case that, unbeknown to the appellant, the newspaper bundle was put by Panjang into the appellant`s green bag after Panjang had given the half pound to Tan. Tan was unable to see this, however, as he was sitting in the back seat on the left side of the car. Soon after, Tan was dropped off at Outram MRT station.
After Panjang sent the appellant home, the appellant went up to his apartment to collect some sachets of heroin he had hidden in a flowerpot outside the flat. He did so because he had made appointments with Ong and Yeo to sell heroin to them at 2pm that day. He testified that he put the heroin into his trouser pocket (and therefore had no cause to look into the green bag) and then went downstairs again where he met Ong and Yeo. They got into the lorry where he sold eight sachets to Yeo and gave or sold one packet to Ong. He stated that after these two transactions he threw the red plastic bag with the unsold heroin into the green bag (therefore again not concentrating on the contents of the green bag). Shortly after this, the appellant was arrested. Thus, when he admitted ownership of the green bag upon arrest, he had not known of the presence of the newspaper bundle.
The learned judge rejected the appellant`s defence. He held that the appellant did indeed have knowledge of the newspaper bundle. He was of the view that the appellant was a drug trafficker who dealt on a regular basis with Ah Chua. He found as a fact that it was the appellant who purchased the newspaper bundle of heroin from Ah Chua. He dismissed as incredible the appellant`s story that Panjang had leant across to his side of the car to put the newspaper bundle into the green bag without him noticing, and that later, when he threw the red bag into the green one, he again did not see the newspaper bundle. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant.
Before us, counsel for the appellant raised three grounds of appeal to persuade us that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in only not less than 7.86g of diamorphine. The first was with respect to the accuracy of the officers` account of the conversation between Insp Senthil and the appellant at the scene of arrest. Closely allied to this was the contention that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant had admitted ownership of the entire contents of the green bag during that particular conversation. The second ground was against the trial judge`s finding that it was the appellant and not Panjang who purchased the newspaper bundle of drugs. Lastly, counsel contended that the appellant`s cautioned statement set out above, in which the appellant admitted ownership of all the heroin, had been wrongly admitted.
On the first ground of appeal, it would be useful to detail the exchange conducted in English between Insp Senthil and the appellant shortly after Insp Senthil arrived at the scene of arrest. At the time, the door of the lorry was open and the green `Hour Glass` bag was lying on the floorboard of the front passenger seat. According to Insp Senthil, he asked the three men whose bag it was. In reply, the appellant gestured that it was his. Insp Senthil then asked the appellant what the contents of the bag were, to which the appellant replied `duck`. Puzzled, Insp Senthil asked him `what duck?`. The appellant then countered this with the answer `peh hoon duck`. Insp Senthil then clarified by asking `you mean drug`, to which the appellant replied in the positive. On being asked to whom the drugs belonged, the appellant`s rejoinder was `all mine`.
Appellant`s counsel highlighted inconsistencies in the officers` account of the conversation. He pointed out that although Karlson Teh had testified that he learnt at the scene of arrest itself that there was one pound of heroin in the green bag this was inconsistent with the testimony of the others and there was no way he could have obtained such knowledge at the scene of arrest. It was also controversial whether Insp Senthil had opened up a corner of the newspaper bundle and looked inside. Shah Ni bin Hj Shah Rom testified that Insp Senthil had done so, but Insp Senthil and the other officers thought he had not done so. He questioned the fact that Chua Swee Keong, Quek Buck Tee and Hansen Sebastian who were some distance away were able to hear the entire conversation.
We noted, however, that the appellant`s version of the conversation, as recounted in his own examination-in-chief, was substantially similar. The appellant stated that he had admitted ownership of the bag. He stated that when asked as to the contents of the bag he had stated `some duck`. He further testified that upon being asked `what duck` he answered `peh hoon`. Thus much of the conversation was in fact accepted by the appellant himself.
The prosecution and defence accounts did differ in one respect. The appellant testified that the conversation had ended with his reply `peh hoon`, whereas Insp Senthil and the officers stated that he had said that the drugs were `all mine`. On this point Insp Senthil testified that he especially remembered the last answer - `all mine` - because it has been unusual: most suspects used `mine one` or such like. Insp Senthil`s testimony of the answer `all mine` was corroborated by the other officers, Karlson Teh, Abdul Rahim bin Kromoh, Shah Ni bin Hj Shah Rom, Hansen Sebastian, Quek Buck Tee and Chua Swee Keong. Furthermore, we thought that even if the appellant did indeed say `all mine`, this statement was not really detrimental to his case owing to the fact that the appellant`s explanation was that he was unaware that the newspaper bundle was in the green bag at that point in time. Hence, even if he had stated `all mine` this would not have included the newspaper bundle if he was unaware of its existence. Indeed, this supposed admission was not mentioned by the learned judge as one of his reasons for his conclusion that the appellant knew that the bundle was in his possession.
Counsel sought to show that the learned judge had erred in admitting the cautioned statement. He submitted that the statement had been tainted by inducement offered by the police officer. On reviewing the record, however, we were of the view that counsel`s contentions were without merit. The inducement was said to be a promise by ASP Tan Hock Chuan to lower the charge from a capital charge to a lesser charge. The appellant testified, however, that ASP Tan did not state this specifically; apparently, he merely told the appellant that if the appellant co-operated he would assist the appellant. ASP Tan did not specify how he was going to assist him, and strangely, neither did the appellant ask. This, in itself, is insufficient to fulfil the conditions of the proviso to s 122(5), to `give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that, by making it, he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him`.
The final contention was that the learned judge`s finding that it was the appellant and not Panjang who had purchased the heroin from Ah Chua was erroneous. Counsel sought to show that, on 14 July 1992, the appellant`s sole purpose in following Panjang to Pearl Bank was to keep Panjang company. In support of his arguments, he reminded us that the appellant`s fingerprints were not found on the newspaper bundle. He contended that the appellant`s account was corroborated by Tan, who had testified that he had met Panjang on a prior occasion a week before 14 July 1992.
We found counsel`s objections unconvincing. The fact that the appellant`s fingerprints were not found on the bundle was inconclusive. Neither did we think that Tan`s evidence aided the appellant in any material particular. When Tan was asked whether it was Panjang or the appellant who had sold him the heroin, he stated simply that he was really unable to answer. Furthermore, at no time did he have sight of the newspaper bundle in dispute. His explanation was that Panjang was in a great hurry and, owing to Panjang`s hurry, he was in fact told to take his half pound (handed to him by Panjang in a black plastic bag) without the customary inspection of contents. He could not even remember whether the appellant or Panjang were carrying any bags at any point in time. For these reasons, we thought the learned judge`s finding sound.
From the facts of the case, we thought the learned judge`s conclusions were clearly ineluctable. We noted from the photographs that the bag was made of hard paper, with a hard cardboard base and was of the type that did not close naturally at the mouth once something was put into it. The bundle would therefore be obvious to any person who viewed the bag from above, especially the appellant, who had continuous custody of the bag throughout. We shared the trial judge`s view that it was incredible that whilst the appellant was seated in Panjang`s car, Panjang should be able to lean over to put the bundle into the green bag unnoticed by the appellant, or indeed, that Panjang should treat his own valuable property with such carelessness. In addition, by the appellant`s own admission, he threw the red bag into the green bag after his transactions with Ong and Yeo in the lorry. At this time the green bag was kept between his legs. Furthermore, the cautioned statement, which we have said was properly admitted, was recorded after the heroin had been weighed in the appellant`s presence. Most relevantly, he stated `the heroin belongs to me`. In our view, the appellant plainly knew that the newspaper bundle of drugs was in his possession.
Possession of not less than 68.74g of diamorphine having been established, the presumption of trafficking was raised by virtue of s 17 of the Act. As mentioned, no attempt was made to rebut this presumption, either in the court below or before us. Accordingly we dismissed the appeal and confirmed the sentence of death passed on the appellant by the learned judge.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The first respondent, Sugianto bin Pardi (`Sugianto`) was tried in the High Court on a charge of importing into Singapore on 7 March 1992 not less than 2,186.10g of cannabis (`the cannabis`) contrary to s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`). The second respondent, Abdullah bin Abdullah (`Abdullah`) was jointly tried for conspiring with Sugianto in the importation of the cannabis, also contrary to s 7 but read with s 12 of the Act. Pursuant to s 33 of the Act, both respondents would have been sentenced to death on conviction of the respective offences with which they were charged. The High Court, however, acquitted both respondents. The public prosecutor now appeals against their acquittals.
Sugianto had travelled to Singapore from Bangkok on Singapore International Airlines (`Singapore Airlines`) flight SQ33 on 7 March 1992 in company with three other persons, namely, Mohamed Najeeb bin Abdul Gani (`Najeeb`) , Edros bin Mohd Ali (`Edros`) and Darusarif bin Atahan (`Darus`). Flight SQ33 was cleared through terminal two of Changi Airport at about 7pm. Acting on information received, Sugianto, Najeeb, Edros and Darus were spotted by the customs officers on duty at terminal two. They were seen collecting luggage from conveyor belt No 36, which they placed on three trolleys, and proceeding towards the customs counter. At the customs counter, one of them offered to pay customs duty on the goods they were carrying. The customs officers, however, led them to the customs duty office where their luggage was searched. In a green checked carrier bag (which will be referred to as `P31` hereafter) concealed in a bed quilt, which was wrapped in a plastic bag, were found three plastic laundry bags bearing the name `Alpine Inn`.
When the laundry bags were slit open, they were found to contain several small plastic packets of greenish vegetable matter which on later analysis was certified by the government chemist to be cannabis. A similar green checked nylon carrier-bag but with a red and yellow loop which served as a sling, which will be referred to as `P29`, was among the luggage on the three trolleys. As will be seen later, a `third green checked carrier bag` was also on one of the three trolleys. Sugianto, Najeeb, Edros and Darus were detained.
A more detailed description of the three green checked carrier bags is necessary as so much turns on the identity of these bags and to whom each of them belonged. There is no contention but that the cannabis were found in P31. This bag, as we can see from the photographs produced at the trial, was green checked with red trimmings along the edges and with a red loop which served as a sling. P31 was identical with the `third green checked carrier bag` in size and it too had red trimmings along the edges and had a red loop which served as a sling. P29 from what we can see from the photographs produced at the trial appears a little bigger than P31 and `the third green checked carrier bag`. It was also green checked and had red trimmings along the edges but what made it different from P31 and the `third green checked carrier bag` was that it had a red and yellow loop which served as a sling.
At about the same time, that is to say about 6pm on 7 March 1992, Thai International flight TG409 had arrived from Bangkok and the passengers from that flight were being cleared through terminal one. Abdullah was a passenger on that flight. He was travelling light, having only hand luggage with him. Acting on information received, the customs officers at terminal one were on the look-out for Abdullah. He was stopped by the customs officers on duty there going through the customs green channel in the arrival hall. He was searched and nothing incriminating was found on him except for one Erimin-5 tablet which was found in his wallet. He was detained.
Initially, Sugianto who was alleged to have had the possession, custody or control of P31 was charged with importing the cannabis into Singapore and the other four men were charged with abetting the commission of the offence. Subsequently, the charges against Najeeb, Edros and Darus were dropped and they gave evidence for the public prosecutor against Sugianto and Abdullah of the charges they were respectively charged with.
Sugianto, Abdullah, Najeeb, Edros and Darus were all colleagues working for Singapore Airlines in Singapore. On 5 March 1992, which was a Thursday, Abdullah left Singapore for Bangkok on a Thai International Airlines flight. On arrival there, he checked into the Alpine Inn. Later that day, Najeeb and Edros travelled to Bangkok on a Singapore Airlines flight. On arrival, they intended to check into the Alpine Inn but, finding they could not get a room there, checked into the Stella Palace Hotel for a night before checking into the Alpine Inn the next morning. Sugianto and Darus travelled to Bangkok on Friday, 6 March 1992, also by a Singapore Airlines flight. They too intended to check into the Alpine Inn but, when they found that they could not get a room, did not check into another hotel but stayed in Abdullah`s room at the Alpine Inn. All of them said in their evidence that they preferred to stay at the Alpine Inn because Singapore Airlines personnel usually stayed there when in Bangkok. In Bangkok, the five men spent their time shopping. They then returned to Singapore on 7 March 1992, as already stated; Abdullah by TG409 and the other four by SQ33, and were all taken into custody.
It is now necessary to refer to the evidence in much greater detail and in logical sequence as the case against Sugianto was that he was in possession or had the custody and control of P31 and that, by reason of the presumptions in the Act, he had imported the cannabis into Singapore; the case against Abdullah was that he had assisted Sugianto by financing Sugianto`s trip to Bangkok. The learned judicial commissioner who tried this case found `that Sugianto had rebutted the operative presumption of possession under s 18(1) of the Act` and accordingly acquitted him. Having acquitted Sugianto of the offence of importing the cannabis into Singapore, the learned judicial commissioner felt impelled to acquit Abdullah as well and refused to imply a conspiracy between Sugianto and Abdullah, holding that `in the absence of an agreement to import cannabis, the charge against Abdullah of conspiring with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore (was) untenable.`
We would preface our narration and evaluation of the evidence with the observations the learned judicial commissioner made of the impressions he had formed of the three principal witnesses for the prosecution, namely, Najeeb, Edros and Darus, and also of Abdullah and Sugianto when they gave evidence on their behalf. He found that Najeeb, Edros and Darus were unreliable and untruthful witnesses. He found that they were not only inconsistent in the evidence they gave but they also contradicted each other. He also found their evidence to be `self-serving` in order to divert attention from them since they were present when the cannabis were discovered. He found Abdullah also to be an unreliable and untruthful witness. On the other hand, he found Sugianto to be a reliable and truthful witness whose evidence he believed. It is now well settled and beyond dispute, for which no authority need be stated, that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact when those findings are based on the veracity of the witnesses whom the trial judge had seen and observed when giving their evidence unless it can be shown that those findings of fact were clearly against the weight of the evidence and unsupportable. It would be different where inferences are to be drawn from truthful evidence. If authority be needed we would refer to Baggallay JA in 
 The Glannibanta 
, a case which we have cited with approval in other judgments of this court. He said: 
 
Great weight is due to the decision of the judge of first instance whenever, in a conflict of testimony, the demeanour and manner of witnesses who have been seen and heard by him are material elements in the consideration of the truthfulness of these statements.
 
 
 
To begin with, Najeeb, Edros, Darus and Abdullah gave evidence that their meeting up at the Alpine Inn in Bangkok on 6 March 1992 was a coincidence when it was clear from the evidence of Sugianto that the visit to Bangkok was pre-arranged by Abdullah who had provided the airfare for Najeeb, Darus and Sugianto, at least. The probabilities are that Sugianto was speaking the truth and the others were not, having regard to the fact that all five of them were colleagues and the visit to Bangkok was over the same period of 5 to 7 March 1992 and that all five of them sought accommodation at the Alpine Inn, where Abdullah had checked in on 5 March 1992 and where they all eventually stayed even to the extent of Najeeb and Edros changing their accommodation from the Stella Palace Hotel to the Alpine Inn after the night of 5 March 1992. It is to be noted that, later in his evidence, Darus admitted that he, Abdullah, Najeeb and Sugianto had discussed the visit to Bangkok on the morning of 5 March 1992 at the printing room of Singapore Airlines` premises. It is plainly evident that each of them was trying to distance himself from each of the others.
In our judgment there is also no reason to disbelieve Sugianto`s evidence that he agreed to go to Bangkok at Abdullah`s behest to enable Abdullah to use his luggage allowance, for the jeans and other items of clothing Abdullah said he intended to purchase in Bangkok, for the return flight, having regard to the fact that Sugianto travelled to Bangkok on 6 March to return on 7 March and that he travelled both ways with a single piece of hand luggage. The learned judicial commissioner accepted this evidence and we can find no evidence to say why he should not have accepted it since the prosecution was unable to point to any inconsistencies or untruths in Sugianto`s evidence. In fact, Sugianto admitted in his evidence that he had assisted Abdullah in this way on six previous occasions and that he knew that Abdullah was engaged `in some kind of textile business`.
However, in cross-examination, Sugianto admitted that on this visit to Bangkok he suspected that Abdullah might be bringing back `ganja`. He explained that this suspicion had arisen when Najeeb had asked him before leaving for Bangkok whether he would be willing to carry back `ganja` if Abdullah had bought it. He had told Najeeb that he would not dare to and since Abdullah had already left for Bangkok when this conversation took place and since Najeeb would be leaving for Bangkok before he did, he had urged upon Najeeb to persuade Abdullah not to do anything illegal. He went on to say that he was so much concerned about this that when he and Darus were on the flight to Bangkok on 6 March 1992 he had told Darus that he did not want to be involved in bringing `ganja` to Singapore and had urged Darus to persuade Abdullah not to engage in it. In his grounds of judgment the learned judicial commissioner said: 
 
I believed his (Sugianto`s) evidence that he told Darus during the flight from Singapore to Bangkok that he did not want to have anything to do with bringing cannabis from Bangkok to Singapore.
 
 
 
Sugianto also admitted in cross-examination that he himself had not spoken about this to Abdullah or had inquired of anyone before leaving Bangkok whether Abdullah had in fact bought `ganja` to bring back to Singapore. The prosecution relied on this evidence to impute Sugianto with knowledge that the bags or one of the bags belonging to Abdullah had the cannabis in it. We will return to this evidence later.
In Bangkok, on the morning of 6 March 1992, Najeeb and Edros, who had stayed at the Stella Palace Hotel the previous night after their arrival in Bangkok, checked out at about 10am and checked themselves into the Alpine Inn and were given a room next to Abdullah`s room. They met up with Abdullah and the three of them went out shopping together. Later that day, when they returned to the Alpine Inn, they met Darus and Sugianto who had arrived from Singapore at about 10pm. Since Darus and Sugianto were unable to get a room at the Alpine Inn, it was decided that they would not check into another hotel but would stay in Abdullah`s room and could also use the other room that Najeeb and Edros had. The five of them went out that evening to enjoy the night life of Bangkok returning to the Alpine Inn late at night or in the early hours of the next morning. The five shared the two rooms that night.
On the morning of 7 March 1992, more shopping was done. The evidence discloses that Najeeb, Edros and Darus went out together shopping. Darus said that he purchased about 30 T-shirts, about ten pairs of jeans, as well as towels and shirts. Abdullah apparently went shopping by himself and he, too, bought a quantity of jeans, about 35 pairs. As for Sugianto, it appears that he did not have any money for any large-scale shopping but borrowed some money from Abdullah to buy himself two pairs of jeans and some mangoes. It is not clear from the evidence whether Najeeb and Edros made any purchases.
That afternoon, that is to say the afternoon of 7 March 1992, after all the shopping was done, the five started to pack their bags and to get ready for departure. The evidence is somewhat confused as to which bags were in which room. It must be remembered that Abdullah`s room and the room booked by Najeeb and Edros were next to each other and that the five moved freely between the two rooms. Anyhow, this much is clear, that P29 was in Abdullah`s room and that Abdullah had packed the jeans he had purchased into P29. Sugianto was aware that P29 belonged to Abdullah since he had asked Abdullah whether he might pack the two jeans he had purchased with Abdullah`s jeans and Abdullah had agreed. Accordingly, Sugianto had packed the two jeans he had purchased in P29. There may well have been either P31 or the `third green checked carrier bag` also in Abdullah`s room. If it was, the crucial question is whether either of them belonged to Abdullah. Certainly Abdullah had a second bag but he strenuously denied that either P31 or the `third green checked carrier bag` belonged to him. It must be pointed out that the second bag that Abdullah acknowledged ownership to was a black hold-all type of bag with leather straps and trimmings.
Now, it is clear from the evidence that TG409, in which Abdullah was returning to Singapore, and SQ33, in which Darus, Najeeb, Edros and Sugianto were travelling to Singapore, were both leaving Bangkok at about the same time and that Darus had agreed with Abdullah to take charge of Abdullah`s luggage, carry them on SQ33 and, on arrival at Singapore, to clear his luggage through customs. The learned judicial commissioner found the latter as a fact from the evidence and we see no reason to disagree with him on this finding of fact. The collective baggage allowance of Darus, Najeeb, Edros and Sugianto would take care of Abdullah`s two pieces of luggage as well as Darus` two and the one each of Najeeb and Edros. Sugianto had no check-in luggage.
In pursuance of this arrangement, Darus told Sugianto at the Alpine Inn in Bangkok that Abdullah`s two pieces of luggage would have to be brought back to Singapore by them, meaning by those who were travelling in SQ33. Quite clearly, P29 was one of them. Which was the other? The evidence on this is far from satisfactory. Sugianto`s evidence was as follows:
 
 
Q: Would you look at these two bags here, the checked bags. You see the checked green with yellow strips? Red and yellow strips. Did they have any resemblance to these two bags? 
 
A: Yes, they bear the same resemblance. 
 
Q: They were like these two bags? Did you speak to anybody about the two bags in the room? 
 
A: Yes, I spoke to Darus about the two bags. 
 
Q: What is it that you spoke about? 
 
A: I asked Darus those two pieces of luggage belonged to who. 
 
Q: And what did he say? 
 
A: Darus told me that these two pieces of luggage must be brought back to Singapore by us. 
 
Q: Did he say who they belonged to? 
 
A: I asked these two pieces of luggage belonged to who and he said they belonged to the second accused, Abdullah.
  
 
 
It is evident to us that the two pieces of luggage referred to are P29 and either P31 or `the third green checked carrier bag`. So it seems to us that Darus was telling Sugianto that the two pieces of luggage belonging to Abdullah that `must be brought back to Singapore by us` were (i) P29 and (ii) either P31 or `the third green checked carrier bag`.
Sugianto, although at one stage in his evidence said that he inquired of Abdullah whether the two pieces of luggage indicated by Darus as belonging to Abdullah were Abdullah`s and that Abdullah had acquiesced, does not appear, from his other evidence, to have been aware which bags belonged to Abdullah or, indeed, how many bags he had, except that the bag containing the jeans (P29) belonged to Abdullah. Sugianto, whom the learned judicial commissioner accepted as a truthful witness, said:
 
 
Q: Were you asked, although there`s no evidence and it`s for submission - were you ever asked by Abdullah to carry his bags when you reached the airport or in the van? Were you asked by Abdullah to carry his bags? 
 
A: The second accused (Abdullah) told me that his luggage would be managed by Darus and he also told me that Najeeb would be doing the checking-in. 
 
Q: The question is: did he ask you to carry his bags or take his bags along - did he ask you? 
 
A: Yes, he also told me that arrival in Singapore, if Darus asked me to carry the bag containing the jeans, I should help him.
  
 
 
The evidence discloses that apart from packing the two pairs of jeans Sugianto had bought in P29, he had nothing to do with the packing of any of the luggage that were to be brought back to Singapore. In particular, there is no evidence whatever that Sugianto had anything to do with the packing of P31 or `the third green checked carrier bag`. The evidence also discloses that when it was time for them to leave for the airport, all the luggage belonging to the five men were placed in the lobby of the Alpine Inn and then loaded into the van Abdullah had hired for the journey from the Alpine Inn to the Bangkok airport. The evidence is unclear who carried the luggage from the rooms to the lobby and from the lobby to the van to be loaded in it. What happened at the Bangkok airport is equally unclear from the evidence. The only positive evidence there is is that Najeeb and Darus, by prior arrangement, took charge, got the luggage to the check-in counter and checked themselves and the luggage on SQ33, for which the luggage tags were annexed to Darus`s ticket. It seems pretty clear that Sugianto did not handle any of the luggage brought back to Singapore, (except for packing his two pairs of jeans in P29) from the time all the bags left the hotel rooms in Bangkok until, as we shall see later, he handled P29 and P31 in the arrival hall of terminal two at Changi Airport.
We must now turn to some crucial evidence which seems to have been overlooked by everyone including the learned judicial commissioner until Mr Choo Han Teck brought it to our attention at the further hearing soon after we had reserved our judgment. Firstly, the evidence of Francis Jeyaraje, a senior narcotics officer who was the investigating officer in this case. The questions and answers from his evidence are as follows:
 
 
Q: Mr Jeyaraje, you told the court that the luggage that were found in P9, in the trolley, belonged to Darusarif bin Atahan?
  
 
 
[P9 is a photograph of a trolley laden with luggage, one of which is a green checked carrier bag.]
 
 
A: That is correct, your Honour. 
 
Q: This photograph was taken in your presence? 
 
A: That`s correct, your Honour. 
 
Q: On your instructions? 
 
A: That`s correct, your Honour. 
 
Q: Did you find out how many bags Darusarif had that day? 
 
A: No, your Honour. 
 
Q: Did you check the contents of each of the luggage? 
 
A: No, your Honour. 
 
... 
 
Q: Now, in P9, the trolley, you see it? 
 
A: Yes, your Honour. 
 
Q: Do you see a bag similar to these two bags?
  
 
 
[The reference is to P29 and P31].
 
 
A: Yes, your Honour. 
 
Q: So there were three bags like these. These two and the one in P9? 
 
A: That`s correct, your Honour. 
 
Q: Mr Jeyaraje, did you ask, that is after you`d taken over, I know you didn`t want to do anything until the customs officers handed it over to you, did you ask, that evening when you had the five Malays in the room, who laid claim? I won`t use the words `possessions`, `belongings` or that sort of things, we will leave that for the time being, who laid claim to these two bags? 
 
His Honour: P29 and P31? 
 
Mr Jeyaretnam: P29 and P31. 
 
Q: Did you ask them, you know, `Ini siapa punya?` 
 
A: No, your Honour. 
 
Q: Why not? 
 
A: As I was already informed by Lee Boon Hua, I did not ask that question. 
 
Q: Because Lee Boon Hua told you they belonged to him [Sugianto]? 
 
A: That`s right, your Honour.
  
 
 
At this juncture we will note that Lee Boon Hua did not give evidence at the trial. His police statement is contained in the exhibit volume, from which it appears that he got this information from Ang Sin Ban, a senior customs officer attached to terminal two at Changi Airport, who did give evidence at the trial. But more of this later.
To return to the identity of the three green checked carrier bags, we continue with the evidence of Jeyaraje.
 
 
Q: I would like to draw attention to P9. The bags in the photograph, were they seized from Darusarif? You said they were seized from Darusarif? 
 
A: Yes, your Honour. 
 
Q: What happened to the bags? 
 
A: The bags were subsequently returned to him.
  
 
 
The foregoing evidence demonstrates that there were three green checked carrier bags, namely, P29, P31 and `the green checked carrier bag`, the last of which belonged to Darus and was returned to him.
We now turn to the evidence of Darus.
 
 
Q: Where did you get this bag, this striped green bag with, you know ... 
 
A: I bought it at the market place there. 
 
Q: I see. And do you agree, Darus, that they are identical to those two bags P29 and P31? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: How many bags did you buy, three? 
 
A: Two. 
 
Q: You bought two? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Good. You bought two of these bags? 
 
A: I bought two nylon bags; both are shown in the photograph.
  
 
 
This further evidence, in our judgment, clearly establishes that P31 and `the green checked carrier bag`, both of which we have described earlier, were identical in size, shape and colour down to the last detail and which, to the discerning eye are different from P29, were bought by Darus in Bangkok. There is no evidence whatever that anything belonging to Abdullah was packed in P31 or in `the green checked carrier bag`. It appears to us that Sugianto had been inveigled by Darus into thinking that both P29 and P31, if P31 was in Abdullah`s room at the Alpine Inn, as it well might have been, belonged to Abdullah.
We now cast our attention to the events that took place at belt No 36 in the arrival hall at terminal two, Changi Airport. We will first deal with the evidence of Sugianto, Darus, Najeeb and Edros and then with the evidence of the customs officers on duty there who were awaiting their arrival.
Sugianto`s evidence is that they waited at belt No 36 for the luggage. They had three trolleys between them. As the luggage came round on the conveyor belt, Darus, Najeeb and Edros looked out for their own luggage. Darus asked Sugianto to look out for Abdullah`s two pieces of luggage since Sugianto had only hand luggage with him. He says that he picked up the bag containing the jeans, which must be P29, and placed it on the trolley he was manning. He then placed his black sling bag, the hand luggage, on the trolley. The other two trolleys were manned by Darus and Edros. Sugianto then says that Darus asked him to take the remaining piece of luggage off the conveyor belt which was P31. When Sugianto protested because his trolley was already loaded to capacity, Darus picked up P31 off the conveyor belt and rearranged the luggage on the trolley manned by Sugianto to accommodate both P29 and P31 on it. It should be noted that the luggage loaded on the three trolleys comprised not only the six pieces of luggage that came off the conveyor belt but also several other pieces of luggage that Najeeb, Edros and Darus had hand-carried with them on the flight. Sugianto`s evidence as narrated above was put to Najeeb, Edros and Darus when each was cross-examined by Sugianto`s counsel. Najeeb and Edros had no recollection of this having taken place and Darus flatly denied it. We have re-read their evidence on this aspect of the matter and can only say that it was so evasive and so contradictory that we are not surprised that the learned judicial commissioner made the comments he made in rejecting their evidence and accepting Sugianto as a truthful witness. The customs officers who gave evidence at the trial had observed the luggage being taken off the conveyor belt and being loaded on to the three trolleys from a distance and could not throw any light on this important aspect of the evidence.
The customs officers` evidence more particularly related to the events which took place when Sugianto, Edros and Darus, each pushing a fully laden trolley, and Najeeb had approached the customs counter. We will now summarize the evidence of the three customs officers, namely Ang Sin Ban (`Ang`), Mohamed Rahim bin Hamid (`Rahim`) and Umarani d/o Kaniappen (`Umarani`).
Ang`s evidence was that when the four men approached the custom`s counter, one of them said that they wanted to pay custom`s duty. Rahim and Umarani collected their passports from them and led them to the duty office. In the duty office, Ang instructed the four men to collect their respective luggage from the three trolleys and to place them on the floor. This was spoken in English which Rahim translated into Malay to the four men. The four men complied. In our judgment, it is natural to assume that since Abdullah was not present then, what remained after each of the others had unloaded their respective luggage, the remainder, ie P29 and P31 and another bag were assumed by Ang, Rahim and Umarani to `belong` to Sugianto. The luggage was then examined by Rahim and Umarani. Rahim found the cannabis in P31 as previously stated. Rahim asked Sugianto in Malay, `siapa punya?`, which, translated, means `whose are these?`. Sugianto replied, `ganja ini, Dollah punya.` Ang understood the reply to mean that the cannabis belonged to Abdullah.
Rahim`s evidence was that he and Umarani searched the luggage of the four persons. He said his attention was arrested by the fact that one of the three quilt blankets he found in P31 seemed to him to be heavier than the other two. Accompanied by Ang and Umarani, he went over to a weighing machine and weighed the heavier quilt blanket and one of the lighter quilt blankets. He found that the heavier quilt blanket weighed approximately 2kg more than the lighter quilt blanket. When the heavier quilt blanket was opened up, he found inside it three plastic bags bearing the words `Alpine Inn Hotel`. When the plastic bags were slit open, several plastic packets containing green vegetable matter were found which he suspected to be cannabis. Both Ang and Umarani witnessed all this. When all the plastic packets containing the green vegetable matter were weighed, the weight was 2.398kg. Whilst he was weighing the cannabis, Sugianto asked him what the weight was. When he was told the weight, Sugianto retorted that it could not be that much and cursed them. When Rahim expressed surprise at Sugianto`s comment, Sugianto then said that the cannabis belonged to his friend Dollah, meaning Abdullah.
Umarani confirmed Rahim`s evidence of how the search was conducted on P31 and how the cannabis was found concealed in one of the quilt blankets found in P31. She also confirmed Rahim`s evidence of the weighing of the cannabis and that when the weight of the cannabis was made known, Sugianto had uttered in Malay `why so much and so heavy?` or words to that effect in Malay, although she admitted that she was not too conversant with the Malay language. She also said that when Rahim asked Sugianto to whom the cannabis belonged that Sugianto had replied that it belonged to his friend Dollah.
Both Rahim and Umarani said that when P31 was being searched by Rahim, Sugianto turned pale and looked nervous.
Admittedly, there were variations in the evidence of the three customs officers but there is no denying that the cannabis was found in P31 and that Sugianto had said that the cannabis belonged to Abdullah.
Abdullah, who was detained by customs officers in terminal one, was later brought to terminal two. It does not appear from the evidence whether he was questioned by the customs officers in terminal two or by Senior Narcotics Officer Francis Jeyaraje as to the ownership of P31 or its contents.
Senior Narcotics Officer Francis Jeyaraje subsequently recorded a Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) s 122(6) statement from Sugianto and Abdullah. Sugianto`s s 122(6) statement was admitted in evidence by the prosecution following a voir dire. It reads: 
 
This drug does not belong to me. It belongs to my friend Abdullah. Abdullah was my room-mate when we stayed in a hotel in Bangkok. I do not know the amount of drugs in the packets. I plead for leniency as I have a wife and four children to support. Edros, Najin (sic) and Darus Sharip (sic) did not know that the things I was carrying were drugs. That is all.
 
 
 
Following the recording of the statement Sugianto was asked in clarification; `Who is your friend Abdullah?` to which he replied; `He is my colleague and was also arrested yesterday at Changi Airport, terminal one.`
The prosecution did not rely on Abdullah`s s 122(6) statement. It was admitted in evidence at the request of Abdullah`s counsel. It read: 
 
I did not know at first that Sugianto was carry (sic) the drugs. Sugianto told me about the drugs when we were in a hotel room in Bangkok. I also told him that I do not want to get involved in the matter. I did not help him to bring the drugs into Singapore. That`s all.
 
 
 
The thrust of the public prosecutor`s appeal against the acquittal of Sugianto is that the learned judicial commissioner had erred in concluding that he had rebutted the presumption that he was in possession of the cannabis. The prosecution had relied on s 18(1) of the Act which provides that any person who is proved to have had in his possession, custody or control anything containing a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. In order to make good this presumption, the prosecution had first to prove that Sugianto had the possession, custody or control of P31 in which the cannabis was found.
Now, the whole of the prosecution`s case was predicated on the assumption that P31 belonged to Abdullah and that by the arrangements made in Bangkok either expressly or by implication that Abdullah`s luggage would be carried to Singapore by the four persons travelling on SQ33 and since the other three, namely Darus, Najeeb and Edros had check-in luggage of their own to take of, Sugianto who had no check-in luggage would take care of Abdullah`s check-in luggage. Abdullah resolutely denied throughout the whole of the proceedings that P31 belonged to him. He was not believed. Sugianto was told by Darus in Bangkok that the two pieces of luggage belonging to Abdullah were P29 and P31. Sugianto knew that P29 belonged to Abdullah as, with Abdullah`s permission, he had packed the two jeans he had purchased in Bangkok in P29. Sugianto may have assumed, believing what Darus told him, that P31 belonged to Abdullah. In fact, he did say that he had inquired of Abdullah and that Abdullah had indicated that it was. Be that as it may, this evidence is far from satisfactory to make a finding that P31 belonged to Abdullah. The learned judicial commissioner did not make a finding one way or the other, no doubt having regard to the paucity of the evidence. The evidence which we have already discussed above regarding P31 and `the third green checked carrier bag` was brought to our attention only on the application for further hearing after we had reserved judgment. Based on that evidence there is now more than a reasonable doubt that P31 belonged to Abdullah. The assumption on which the prosecution has founded its case against Sugianto is unsupportable.
At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution the learned judicial commissioner had before him the evidence of the customs officers that the cannabis was found in the luggage claimed by Sugianto as his luggage and the evidence of Edros, Najeeb and Darus that all five of them returned from Bangkok. The legal presumption under s 18 of the Act arose which Sugianto had to rebut. It was on this basis that the learned judicial commissioner called upon Sugianto to enter upon his defence.
Sugianto gave evidence. The learned judicial commissioner evaluated his evidence and found as follows: 
 
I accepted Sugianto`s evidence that he had no checked-in luggage, that the two large nylon bags (P29 and P31) were only handled by him at the conveyor belt in Singapore and that he had nothing to do with the two large nylon bags in Bangkok. It was also established from the evidence of the prosecution witnesses that Sugianto did not go out shopping with the others and did not make any purchases. I accepted Sugianto`s evidence that he purchased two pairs of jeans and placed them in the nylon bag containing jeans purchased by Abdullah. It is also material to note that Darus testified that, of the six bags that were checked in at the airport at Bangkok, two bags belonged to him (Darus), one bag belonged to Edros, one bag belonged to Najeeb and two bags belonged to Abdullah. However, it was established and not disputed that Sugianto was physically in possession of the two large nylon bags for that span of time between the conveyor belt and the customs office and he was therefore presumed to be in possession of the cannabis contained inside the quilt.
 
 
 
It was submitted by the prosecution and I agree with them that since exh P31 was in the physical possession of Sugianto, it follows from the judgment of Lord Pearce in 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
 (supra) that Sugianto must convince the court that he had no knowledge that exh P31 contained cannabis. But I should add that he only needs to do so on a balance of probabilities.
Whether P31 belonged to Abdullah or not, the physical possession of P31 by Sugianto, having regard to Sugianto`s evidence of how P31 came to be loaded on the trolley he was pushing, in our judgment, makes the question of physical possession of P31 by Sugianto even more tenuous. We have already narrated this evidence and it is unnecessary to repeat it. Clearly, the learned judicial commissioner believed Sugianto`s evidence whom he found to be a truthful witness. In his grounds of judgment the learned judicial commissioner makes this finding: 
 
It was only at the arrival hall at the airport in Singapore that the two large nylon bags (P29 and P31) were boarded onto his trolley by Darus. Darus told him to get a trolley for the luggage which was to be retrieved from the conveyor belt.
 
 
 
Having regard to the manner in which the evidence unfolded at the trial, there can be no doubt in our minds that Sugianto did, indeed, have the physical possession of P31 for the brief period between the conveyor belt and being stopped by the customs officers. The question before us is whether the learned judicial commissioner rightly concluded that on the evidence Sugianto had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(1) of the Act that P31 contained the cannabis.
In finding that Sugianto had rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18(1) of the Act, the learned judicial commissioner placed great emphasis on the credibility, truthfulness and reliability of Sugianto`s evidence. More than once in his grounds of judgment he referred to Sugianto being a truthful and reliable witness whose evidence he believed. More than once he commented on the untruthfulness and unreliability of Najeeb, Edros, Darus and Abdullah. Having re-read all the evidence we can but say that the learned judicial commissioner was justified in his assessments, and in any case we have already commented on the principles we will be guided by when a trial judge makes observations of this kind of the witnesses he has seen and heard at the trial. It is against this background that we must consider the learned deputy public prosecutor`s main complaint that many of the assertions made by Sugianto in his evidence were uncorroborated and should not, therefore, have been accepted as being truthful by the learned judicial commissioner. It is true that much of Sugianto`s evidence was not corroborated but we do not find that surprising in the circumstances of this case, having regard to the kind of prevaricating evidence given by Najeeb, Edros, Darus and Abdullah all of whom the learned judicial commissioner found to be unreliable and untruthful. The learned judicial commissioner was obviously impressed by Sugianto`s apparent candidness and, furthermore, the prosecution was unable to point to any inconsistencies or untruths in Sugianto`s evidence. None was drawn to our attention by the learned deputy public prosecutor.
A further complaint before us was that the learned judicial commissioner had not given due weight to the evidence of the customs officers, the conversation between Rahim and Sugianto, and to Sugianto`s s 122(6) statement implying that, had more weight been given to all this evidence, the learned judicial commissioner could not have concluded that Sugianto had rebutted the presumption of possession of the cannabis, even on a balance of probabilities.
The totality of the customs officers` evidence related to Sugianto`s physical possession of P31 and on his demeanour when P31 was examined. Both Rahim and Umarani testified that Sugianto appeared nervous and fidgety when Rahim started to examine the contents of P31 thus implying that this indicated that he knew that P31 contained the cannabis. The learned judicial commissioner, however, was not prepared to accept this evidence as `conclusive evidence of knowledge and, therefore, of guilt`. We are not inclined to fault the learned judicial commissioner as there was the truthful evidence of Sugianto, as found by him, that Sugianto has been told by Najeeb that Abdullah might be bringing back `ganja` from Bangkok and Sugianto had been made to believe that P31 belonged to Abdullah and hence his nervousness when Rahim was about to examine P31. This, to our mind, is a perfectly logical explanation of Sugianto`s nervousness.
Of greater significance is the evidence of Rahim and Umarani that Sugianto expressed surprise at the quantity of the cannabis found in P31 and not the fact that cannabis was found in P31. On this aspect of the evidence, the learned judicial commissioner addressed himself as follows: 
 
The prosecution also submitted that Sugianto was surprised at the quantity of cannabis found rather than the nature of the drug. This, they submitted, was supported by CO Rahim`s evidence of a conversation which took place between the first accused (Sugianto) and CO Rahim on the weight of the cannabis. It should be noted that the said conversation was denied by Sugianto and was also not supported by the evidence of WHCO Umarani and SCO Ang. I noted that WHCO Umarani had to be prompted to think back carefully and relate what had happened at the airport and she also mentioned in her examination-in-chief that she was not conversant in the Malay language. To my mind, little weight should be accorded to this conversation and the evidence of WHCO Umarani and SCO Ang cannot be taken as proof of the truth of what was said. Furthermore, no reference of this conversation was made in CO Rahim`s deposition statement. In these circumstances, I am unable to draw an inference of knowledge based merely on the alleged conversation that took place between Sugianto and CO Rahim.
 
 
 
We entirely agree.
The next complaint of the learned deputy public prosecutor was that Sugianto`s s 122(6) statement was in itself an admission that he was carrying the cannabis for Abdullah with the requisite knowledge and for that, by itself, a conviction of importing the cannabis into Singapore was warranted. In our judgment, the admission of a s 122(6) statement is not evidence per se of what is stated in it. The court must still evaluate the evidential value to be attributed to it in the light of all the evidence. This is what the learned judicial commissioner did and, having done so, came to the conclusion that Sugianto had sufficiently explained to him the circumstances under which he came to make the cautioned statement and why little or no evidential value should be attributed to it. Quite clearly, the learned judicial commissioner based his conclusion on the fact that he found Sugianto a truthful witness whose evidence he believed. The credibility of Sugianto was the fundamental factor of the learned judicial commissioner`s conclusion and since we have not been persuaded by the learned deputy public prosecutor to the contrary we see no reason to disturb his conclusions. In his grounds of decision he said: 
 
I was invited by the prosecution to draw a strong inference of knowledge as to the existence of the drug based on Sugianto`s cautioned statement which was admitted into evidence. It was submitted by the prosecution that Sugianto had clearly admitted he was carrying the cannabis. Counsel for Sugianto submitted that the cautioned statement could not lead to an inference of knowledge as it was an ex post facto statement and that it was not made as an admission that he imported the drugs. Counsel also submitted that Sugianto made his statement because he was in such a frame of mind that he thought he was guilty of the offence. I accepted Sugianto`s reasons for making the cautioned statement. To my mind, he had said all those things when he was panic-stricken as he had heard before his departure to Bangkok that Abdullah wanted to bring in cannabis. In his cautioned statement, Sugianto said the cannabis belonged to Abdullah. I found Sugianto to be a truthful and reliable witness. I believed his evidence that he told Darus during the flight from Singapore to Bangkok that he did not want to have anything to do with bringing cannabis from Bangkok into Singapore, that Darus should stop Abdullah from buying cannabis, that he did not know that there was cannabis in exh P31, that he went to Bangkok solely for the purpose of letting Abdullah use his checked-in baggage allowance for the jeans and that Darus was in charge of clearing Abdullah`s bags through customs on their arrival in Singapore. I was convinced that he was only an innocent handler within the exception propounded by Lord Pearce in the 
 Warner
 case. I also found it difficult to draw an inference of knowledge from the mere fact that Sugianto had failed to mention in his cautioned statement that he had no knowledge that he was carrying cannabis.
 
 
 
There is another reason why this appeal must fail. We have narrated in some detail the evidence relating to the handling of the luggage in Bangkok, and it is unnecessary to repeat it here. Suffice it here to say that there was no evidence that Sugianto handled any of the checked-in luggage from the hotel to the check-in counter at the airport in Bangkok. Najeeb and Darus were the ones who took charge of checking-in the luggage at the counter and Sugianto had no checked-in luggage; he had only one piece of hand luggage. The two bags, P29 and P31, were only handled by him at the conveyor belt in Singapore and his involvement then was at the behest of Darus - that was his evidence which was accepted by the learned judicial commissioner. On the basis of all this evidence, there was no actus reus of importation of the drugs into Singapore by Sugianto.
For the foregoing reasons we are of the view that the public prosecutor`s appeal against Sugianto`s acquittal on the charge of importing the cannabis into Singapore must fail.
Should the charge against Sugianto be amended to possession of the cannabis? We have expressed the view earlier that Sugianto`s possession of P31 was tenuous even though the learned judicial commissioner found, with which we agreed, that, for that brief period between the conveyor belt and being stopped by the customs officers, Sugianto was in physical possession of P31. However, since we have upheld the learned judicial commissioner`s finding that Sugianto has rebutted the presumption of knowledge, nothing will be achieved by amending the charge from one of importation to one of possession.
We now turn to the public prosecutor`s appeal against the acquittal of Abdullah of conspiring with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore.
The case against Abdullah is that he conspired with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore which was concealed in the bed quilt packed in P31. The essential ingredient of a conspiracy is agreement. (See the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
 Lai Kam Loy & 
 O
 rs v PP 
.) From the very nature of a conspiracy, direct evidence will hardly ever be available. It is evident, therefore, that the existence of a conspiracy will have to be inferred from the evidence and all the surrounding circumstances of the case. The learned judicial commissioner was invited by the deputy public prosecutor, as we were by the learned deputy prosecutor who appeared before us, to infer a conspiracy between Abdullah and Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore concealed in the bed quilt packed in P31. The learned judicial commissioner was unable to find such a conspiracy and we are also unable to do so. The single piece of evidence which militates against any such finding is the ownership of P31.
The whole of the prosecution`s case was premised on the fact that P31 belonged to Abdullah; that Sugianto took possession of P31 off the conveyor belt at the arrival hall at terminal two, Changi Airport and carried it on the trolley he was pushing; that in his s 122(6) statement Sugianto said that the cannabis belonged to Abdullah; that Abdullah paid Sugianto`s expenses for the visit to Bangkok; that Sugianto stayed in the same room with Abdullah at the Alpine Inn in Bangkok; that Sugianto was told that Abdullah might be bringing back `ganja`; to state some of the allegations presented by the prosecution and which they sought to prove. Except for Sugianto`s s 122(6) statement, all of the above emanated from the evidence of Najeeb, Edros and Darus. We have pointed out that the learned judicial commissioner took a poor view of the credibility of these three witnesses and, for that reason, not all of the above allegations can be said to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Most important of all, we have noted from the evidence that a very serious doubt has been cast on Abdullah`s ownership of P31. We concur with the learned judicial commissioner, therefore, that no great reliance can be placed on the above.
In our judgment, it logically follows from the acquittal of Sugianto of the charge of importing the cannabis into Singapore concealed in the bed quilt packed in P31 that the charge against Abdullah of having conspired with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore concealed in the bed quilt packed in P31 must also fail.
Accordingly, the public prosecutor`s appeal against the acquittal of Abdullah of conspiring with Sugianto to import the cannabis into Singapore is also dismissed. We can conceive of no alternative charge against Abdullah on the evidence before the High Court.
Before concluding our judgment, we wish to note the dilemma the public prosecutor was in in this case as, without any doubt, there was imported into Singapore, by one or more of these five persons, a quantity of cannabis of an amount which would have resulted in the death sentence being passed on those found guilty. The dilemma he was in was whether to charge all five of them with the importation of the cannabis, in which case he may have lacked the evidence to secure a conviction against any one or more of them. He chose to charge Sugianto and Abdullah against whom it appeared that he had the best evidence. After a careful scrutiny of the evidence as it unfolded at the trial, we have concurred with the learned judicial commissioner that the charges of importing and abetment were not proved against them respectively. The real culprit or culprits have gotten away with it. We can only hope that the public prosecutor will be untiring in his efforts to bring the real culprit or culprits, if there was more than one, to answer to the law.

The two appellants were charged in the High Court as follows: 
 
That you, 1 Jasbir Singh
 
 
 
2 Charanjit 
 S
ingh
 
 
 
on or about 24 May 1988 at about 1.55pm at the Plum`s Coffee House, Hyatt Regency Hotel, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, a plastic packet of drugs containing not less than 254.36g of diamorphine, without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
Following a trial of some 13 days in the High Court, they were convicted of the above charge. The present appeals were brought against their convictions. We dismissed the appeals on 14 February 1994 and now give our reasons.
 The facts
The two appellants were arrested at Plum`s Coffee House, Hyatt Regency Hotel (`the Hyatt`) at about 1.55pm on 24 May 1988. On that day, they had met with one Michael Fullett at the coffee house. Unbeknownst to both appellants, Fullett was a special agent from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (`DEA`), who had been requested by the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) in Singapore to assist them in the course of certain investigations. Also unbeknownst to both appellants, a team of narcotics officers had been stationed nearby to keep watch on the three men.
The second appellant had been observed to be carrying a red plastic bag when he entered the hotel. At about 1.50pm, he was seen following Fullett towards the toilet situated at the foyer of the hotel lobby, still carrying the red plastic bag. A little while later, he returned without Fullett and without the plastic bag. Two narcotics officers, Jamaluddin Bin Salleh (`Jamaluddin`) and Lee Kiong Lock, entered the toilet and found Fullett in there with the red plastic bag, which he told them had been handed over to him by the second appellant. Upon opening the red plastic bag, Jamaluddin discovered a white plastic bag which in turn contained brown powder stored in a brown wrapper. The two appellants were then arrested in Plum`s and brought to CNB. There, the powdery substance inside the bag was weighed in the presence of both appellants and found to weigh 827 grams. A cautioned statement was subsequently recorded from each appellant pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 224) (`CPC`).
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution`s case relied mainly on the evidence of Fullett and Jamaluddin. Jamaluddin testified that on 23 May 1988, after having received information about a Singaporean wishing to sell `Golden Crescent` heroin to a foreign buyer, he requested Fullett to work undercover for the CNB in their investigations of the matter. A meeting was arranged between Fullett and the would-be Singaporean seller at 9.30pm on the same day, at the Royal Holiday Inn (`Holiday Inn`), Scotts Road, with Jamaluddin positioned in the hotel lobby to provide cover for Fullett. The first appellant arrived at about 9.35pm and was observed engaged in conversation with Fullett. Fullett testified at trial that the first appellant discussed the sale of heroin with him during that meeting. The first appellant asked if Fullett would be interested in buying 1kg of heroin for US$10,000, to which Fullett made a counter-offer of US$7,500. Eventually, they reached agreement at the price of US$8,000 although the first appellant added the caveat that he would not be able to confirm the price until the following day.
According to Fullett, the two men also spoke about different grades of heroin during their meeting. The first appellant talked about the different types of heroin available and further described the brown heroin which he would be selling Fullett. In Fullett`s words: 
 
[The first appellant] basically described how this brown heroin would look, its texture, the texture of the heroin. He also told me that what he had to sell to me, that I would be able to mix it up or ... cut it four times in order to make my profit and that it was of a high enough purity that I could, if I bought one kilo, I could make four kilograms out of that based on the percentage of purity that the addict would use on the street, so I could cut it four times.
 
 
 
At the same meeting, Fullett, wishing to ascertain if the first appellant was close to any laboratory involved in drug manufacture, asked the first appellant whether he knew anything about a chemical called `acetic anhydride` and whether he knew anyone who had that chemical for sale. He did this by writing the words `acetic anhydride` on a piece of paper and handing it to the first appellant.
A second meeting was arranged for 24 May 1988 at sometime between 12.30pm and 1pm, again at the Holiday Inn. On the morning of 24 May 1988 Fullett attended a briefing at the CNB before proceeding to the Holiday Inn where he was to meet the first appellant in the Cafe Vienna. During the ensuing meeting, the first appellant informed Fullett that the price of US$8,000 which they had arrived at the previous day was now unacceptable. A new price of US$9,000 was demanded instead. When Fullett agreed to this, the first appellant asked him to proceed to Plum`s Coffee House in the Hyatt and to wait for him there for about 20 minutes to an hour. The first appellant further stated that he would be bringing another person along with him with the heroin.
After the first appellant left, Fullett proceeded to Plum`s and sat at a table, having duly informed Jamaluddin beforehand of the arrangements. At about 1.45pm, the first appellant appeared, with the second appellant following him. The second appellant was carrying a red plastic bag which the first appellant told Fullett contained the heroin in question. Fullett then asked to look at the heroin, whereupon the first appellant directed the second appellant to accompany Fullett to the toilet with the plastic bag. Both Fullett and the second appellant made their way to the toilet. It should be noted that Fullett testified that, on the way to the toilet, he asked the second appellant how the heroin was packaged and was told that it was brown powder. Before they actually entered the toilet, however, the second appellant handed Fullett the plastic bag and walked away from him. On peeking into the bag, Fullett saw brown powder loosely kept in a brown bag. This was placed in a white plastic bag which was in turn placed inside the red plastic bag. After Fullett entered the toilet, Jamaluddin came in too: the events which then followed have been briefly recounted above (see under `The facts`).
The prosecution further relied on the s 122(6) statements of both appellants. The first appellant`s s 122(6) statement, admitted without his having contested its admissibility, read as follows: 
 
I found the drug inside a cupboard in my friend`s place at Blk 16 Pacific Mansion 181. My friend`s name is Ali, a male Pakistani. I then informed one of my friend, `Bidin`, at Holiday Inn Hotel, on 23 May 1988 and he told me that it can be sold. On 23 May 1988, at about 9.30pm, `Bidin` introduced me to one `Mat Salleh` known as `Michael` who offered to buy the drug for $8, 000. We then agreed to meet again on 24 May 1988 at about 2pm at Hyatt Hotel. On 24 May 1988, I met `Michael` at about 1.40pm at Plum Coffee House, Hyatt Regency Hotel. I went there with my friend `Chari` who was carrying the drug wrapped in some paper inside a plastic bag. At the coffee house, `Chari` gave the package to `Michael` who then left to go to the toilet. At about ten to fifteen minutes, both `Chari` and myself were arrested.
 
 
 
The second appellant`s s 122(6) statement was also admitted after a voir dire to determine its voluntariness. It read as follows: 
 
On 24 May 1988 I was at Pacific Mansion and Jasbir came back about 1pm. He told me to follow him and carry the plastic bag. I asked him what was inside the plastic bag and he told (sic) it was drugs. I told him that I`ve never done this kind of things and I`m worried. But he told me that all I have to do is just give a white guy the plastic bag at Hyatt Hotel. Later I did as what Jasbir told me.
 
 
 
The prosecution called Dr Saw Chwee Guan, a scientific officer attached to the Institute of Scientific and Forensic Medicine. Dr Saw gave evidence that his analysis of the brown powdery substance found in the plastic bag showed its net weight to be 817.9 grams and the amount of diamorphine contained therein to be 254.36g.
At trial the prosecution stated specifically its reliance on s 18(1), (2) and (4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`), which establish the presumption of possession of the drug in question as well as the presumption of knowledge of the nature of that drug. At the close of the prosecution case the trial judge found that a prima facie case had been made out against both appellants with regard to the charge against them and called upon their defence.
 The first appellant`s defence
The first appellant denied the prosecution`s version of the facts. In particular, he denied that he had known that the brown powder was heroin or that he had arranged to sell it to Fullett as such. He claimed that he had found the brown powder in the Pacific Mansion flat of a friend, Ali, at which he had been staying. He had first set eyes on it when he met one Sayyid Seth (`Seth`) in the flat who was seated at the dining table with a number of bags laid out before him and a great deal of brown powder on the table top. When asked by the first appellant what the powder was, Seth answered only that Ali knew about it and then proceeded to place a brown bag in Ali`s cupboard in the master bedroom. Overcome by curiosity, the first appellant inspected the bag after Seth`s departure and discovered in it some fine brown powder. He became very inquisitive about the nature of the powder and so mentioned it to a couple of friends. One of these was Zainal, who subsequently told the first appellant that he had a friend whom the first appellant could ask about the brown powder. According to Zainal, this friend dealt in chemicals. He was coming to Singapore for a visit and Zainal would introduce him to the first appellant so that the first appellant could take him shopping and looking for electronic goods (this being a job the first appellant sometimes engaged in).
The promised meeting occurred on 23 May 1988, sometime between 9pm and 9.30pm at the Holiday Inn. The first appellant was introduced to Fullett as `Tony`. Asked about the brown powder, Fullett told the first appellant that it could be a drug called `acetic anhydride`, a name which he wrote on a piece of paper. Fullett further stated that acetic anhydride was costly in the market and expressed an interest in buying 500g of the powder if it really turned out to be this drug. Apart from the matter of the brown powder, however, they also spoke of other matters, such as nightclubs in Singapore. A second meeting the following day was set up as well.
On 24 May 1988, the first appellant again met Fullett at the Holiday Inn and was informed by Fullett that he (Fullett) strongly believed the brown powder to be acetic anhydride. Fullett then surprised the first appellant by offering to buy the powder from the first appellant for US$9,000 if the powder was indeed what he believed it to be. The first appellant insisted in his testimony, however, that he did not agree unconditionally to this offer; he was, so he claimed, more concerned to discover the true nature of the powder first. The two men agreed to meet an hour later at the Hyatt. The first appellant proceeded back to the Pacific Mansion flat where the brown powder was still stored within the cupboard in the master bedroom. The first appellant placed the powder in a brown paper bag which he put inside a white plastic bag. The entire package was in turn placed in a red plastic bag.
At this point, the second appellant, who was a friend of the first appellant and who was also staying in the Pacific Mansion flat, wandered into the room. Upon being told by the first appellant that he was going to show the package of brown powder to an American, the second appellant opened the package to inspect the powder. Some of the brown powder flew onto his face, moustache and nose. He wiped this off and, taking a pinch of the powder, sprinkled it on the tip of the cigarette he was then smoking. Seeing this, the first appellant, who was also smoking, did the same thing. After wrapping up the brown powder, the first appellant left for his meeting with Fullett, accompanied by the second appellant who was told that Fullett would be buying lunch and beer at the Hyatt. The two appellants entered the hotel with the second appellant carrying the red plastic bag. The first appellant introduced him to Fullett as a friend and told him to give the bag to Fullett, whereupon the American stood up and asked the second appellant to follow him to the toilet. The second appellant did so, returning after a short while. According to the first appellant, both of them were somewhat flabbergasted at Fullett`s actions. They were even more astonished when a group of men converged upon them and arrested them with handcuffs. The first appellant was then informed by one of these men that the brown powder he had brought along was actually heroin.
In giving his evidence the first appellant vehemently denied having known that the brown powder was heroin or having arranged to sell it as such to Fullett. He also denied having ever told the second appellant that the red plastic bag contained `drugs`, although he subsequently conceded that he had said, `Things like possible chemical or medicinal drug`. He maintained that he had only shown the powder to Fullett out of curiosity about what the powder really was. To boost the claim, he called as a witness another friend, one Ashok Kumar, whom he had allegedly planned to meet at 3pm on 24 May 1988 and whom he had hoped would assist him in finding out the true nature of the drugs.
It may be noted that the defence also called Zainal as a witness. His testimony was to the effect that the first appellant had asked him about the brown powder in an effort to find out what it really was and that he had introduced the first appellant to Fullett for that purpose. He admitted his presence at the first meeting between the first appellant and Fullett but denied that there had been any discussion of heroin during that meeting. As far as he was aware, Fullett worked in an oil company and he had inquired of Zainal whether the latter knew anyone who wished to sell chemicals and medicine.
 The second appellant`s defence
The second appellant, for his part, chose first of all to contest the admissibility of the s 122(6) statement recorded from him by the investigating officer, Senior Narcotics Officer Teo Chin Seng (`SNO Teo`). He claimed that he had made the statement only because SNO Teo had promised that he would be made a state witness and the second appellant had inferred from this that he would not be charged. He claimed also that SNO Teo failed to explain the charge to him or to elucidate the meaning of the word `traffic`. The above was denied by SNO Teo in the voir dire. SNO Teo testified that no threat, inducement or promise had been made to the second appellant by him or by anyone else during the recording of the statement and that he had explained the charge as well as the notice of warning to the second appellant before the latter commenced giving his statement. It may be noted, moreover, that the second appellant admitted in cross-examination that the signature appearing after the charge was his and that he did understand the meaning of the word `traffic`. In addition he admitted his awareness of the existence of the death penalty for drug offenses and agreed that 827g of a drug was a considerable quantity. At the end of the voir dire the trial judge ruled that the s 122(6) statement of the second appellant had been made voluntarily and admitted it as evidence in the trial.
In his defence, the second appellant asserted that he was an innocent party who had only had the singular misfortune of tagging along with the first appellant to the Hyatt on 24 May 1988 in the hope of getting a free lunch and drinks from an American man whom the first appellant had said he was meeting. When the second appellant first saw the brown powder in the Pacific Mansion flat on 24 May 1988, he sprinkled some of it onto the tip of his cigarette and puffed at it. It tasted bitter and he spat it out in the toilet. The first appellant apparently did the same thing. Throughout this, the second appellant was, so he claimed, completely ignorant of the true nature of the powder. He alleged that the first appellant said the powder was `medicinal drugs` which he would be showing the American. This, so the second appellant claimed, was why he used the term `drugs` in his own s 122(6) statement when referring to the contents of the red plastic bag: he meant no more than `medicinal drugs`. As to the statement `I`ve never done this kind of things and I`m worried`, the second appellant elaborated that what he actually meant was as follows: 
 
I take something and give it to someone when I`ve never met him before. You know just `ketuk` [Malay, meaning `knock`] him for drinks and lunch, this type of thing I have not done it before. It is not my nature.
 
 
 
The two men then left the flat in a taxi, with the red plastic bag in which the brown powder had been placed. When they alighted from the taxi, this bag was held by the second appellant. They went into Plum`s at the Hyatt where the second appellant was introduced to the American, Fullett. The American ordered drinks and then asked the first appellant, `Is this the bag?`. Replying in the affirmative, the first appellant told the second appellant to give the bag to the American but before the second appellant could do so, the American stood up and asked the second appellant to follow him to the toilet. Although somewhat puzzled, the second appellant did as asked. According to him, he walked behind the American without either of them exchanging a word. When they reached the toilet, he handed the bag to the American who took it into one of the cubicles. Feeling by now totally bemused, the second appellant returned to Plum`s and reported the American`s behaviour to the first appellant. The two men were arrested within minutes of the second appellant`s return.
 The findings in the trial court
Having heard the evidence in the case, the trial judge rejected the explanations proffered by both appellants. He accepted the prosecution`s version of the events which had transpired on 23 and 24 May 1988, including the testimony of Fullett to the effect that there was `a meeting of minds between him and [the first appellant] for the sale of the drugs` at US$9,000 and that delivery of the drugs `was scheduled for the afternoon of 24 May 1988 at the Hyatt`. The trial judge also relied on the s 122(6) statements of the appellants in rejecting the evidence they gave at trial. He disbelieved the first appellant`s claim that the word `drug` used in his statement had been suggested to him by the recording officer, and also the second appellant`s claim that he had meant only `medicinal drugs` by the use of the word `drugs` in his statement. As for the evidence of Zainal and Ashok Kumar, both of whom had been called by the first appellant, the trial judge found in relation to the former that, his credit having been impeached, no weight could be given to his testimony. With regard to Ashok Kumar, he held that his evidence had been `destabilized and for that matter nullified` by the first appellant`s own s 122(6) statement as well as by Fullett`s evidence.
At the conclusion of the trial, therefore, the trial judge held that the two appellants had failed to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge contained in s 18(1), (2) and (4) of the Act and relied on by the prosecution. He held further that the evidence adduced proved beyond reasonable doubt that the two appellants had shared a common intention to traffic in the heroin eventually seized and that they had acted in furtherance of this common intention. On the evidence before him, he was satisfied that the first appellant had negotiated the sale of the drugs to Fullett and that he had informed the second appellant that the red plastic bag he was carrying on 24 May 1988 contained the drugs in question. He was also satisfied that the second appellant, though worried, had nevertheless gone along with the first appellant to the Hyatt knowing full well that they were going there to deliver the drugs to Fullett. Accordingly the trial judge found both men guilty of the charge against them.
 The appeal
On appeal, counsel for the first appellant raised a great many grounds. We considered each submission in turn, bearing in mind that several of them overlapped, and found them to be without merit. We will now set out in some detail our views, before turning to the grounds raised by counsel for the second appellant.
 Submission by counsel for first appellant that no act of trafficking was proved
It was submitted at great length by counsel for the first appellant that the prosecution failed to prove an act of delivery of the drugs or for that matter any act of trafficking at all. Counsel contended that, on the facts available, it was clear that the intention was only to show the brown powder to Fullett and not to transfer to him possession of it. It was clear to us, however, that there had been some unfortunate confusion on counsel`s part as to what the facts as found by the trial judge actually were. As we have pointed out above, the trial judge accepted Fullett`s testimony that there had been a `meeting of minds` between the first appellant and himself as regards the sale of the drugs and that the meeting at the Hyatt on 24 May 1988 was to effect the delivery of these drugs. The trial judge disbelieved the first appellant`s claim that he had gone to the Hyatt to show Fullett the `brown powder` and to find out from Fullett what it actually was. On the facts as found by the trial judge, therefore, the first and second appellants committed an act of delivery when they met Fullett at the Hyatt with the drugs, which they proceeded to hand over to him. We saw no reason at all to disagree with the trial judge`s findings of fact on this, especially since he had the advantage of being able to observe all the relevant witnesses and to assess their credibility.
Counsel also attempted to persuade us that it was Fullett who had taken the plastic bag from the second appellant and not the second appellant who had given it to him; and that in such circumstances it could not be said that there was an act of `delivery`. Quite apart from the fact that in any case the trial judge preferred Fullett`s version of events to that proffered by either appellant (a finding which again we saw no reason to disturb), we found this intellectual hair-splitting futile. What was significant was that the drugs were brought from the Pacific Mansion flat to the Hyatt hotel by both appellants and that at the Hyatt Fullett obtained possession of the drugs. The transportation of the drugs to the Hyatt and the subsequent handing over of possession formed one complete transaction which in itself `constituted a continuous process of making delivery of the drugs thereby satisfying the charge of trafficking`: see 
 Lai Kam Loy & Ors v PP 
. We are really losing ourselves in a semantic quagmire if we squabble about whether it was necessary for Fullett to be 
 handed 
 the drugs as opposed to his 
 taking 
 them.
 Submission on common intention
It was submitted by counsel that in relying on s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), the prosecution failed to adduce any evidence to show that there existed as between the first and second appellants a common intention to deliver the plastic bag of drugs to Fullett. With respect, such a submission was completely without basis. The issue of common intention was considered meticulously by the trial judge at pp 72-73 of his grounds of decision and we could find no cause to dispute his findings: 
 
Dealing with the issue of common intention, Jasbir`s evidence was that Charanjit and he brought the brown powder to Fullett. Fullett`s evidence was that Jasbir was going to sell the brown powder to him and the delivery was to be effected at the Hyatt on the afternoon of 24 May 1988. Fullett testifies that Jasbir had mentioned to him that another person would be accompanying Jasbir during the delivery and the other person turned out to be Charanjit. Charanjit in his s 122(6) statement made it abundantly clear that he was told to follow Jasbir and carry the plastic bag which contained the brown powder. When Charanjit asked Jasbir as to the contents of the plastic bag, he was told that they were drugs. Charanjit though worried decided to accompany Jasbir. Though Charanjit`s s 122(6) statement was retracted, to my mind he knew that he was on that fateful day undertaking an assignment to deliver the drugs to Fullett in the company of Jasbir. Common intention to traffic in the drugs was manifest from the circumstances. In my view, the act committed by Jasbir and Charanjit was in concert pursuant to a pre-arranged plan.
 
 
 
On the issue of common intention, it was further submitted by counsel that the prosecution should have specified in the charge the criminal act allegedly committed in furtherance of the appellants` common intention, and that the omission to do so occasioned a miscarriage of justice, because it `prevented the first appellant from focusing his defence on the exact issues raised by s 34`. It was not shown to us, however, that our criminal law required such a specification. In any case we were satisfied that the first appellant had sufficient notice of the matter of which he stood accused. From the above passage in the trial judge`s grounds of decision, in particular the last few lines, it was clear that the act which the prosecution was concerned with proving was that of delivery undertaken by both appellants pursuant to an agreed sale on 24 May 1988. It would be disingenuous for the first appellant to claim that he was ignorant of this. The defence he raised at trial was that he had brought the brown powder to Fullett, only so that Fullett could inspect it and tell him what it really was; he strenuously denied that he had been delivering drugs pursuant to a sale arrived at earlier on. To substantiate his defence, the first appellant not only gave evidence himself but also called two other witnesses, Zainal and Ashok Kumar. It was plain to us, therefore, that the first appellant was in no danger of suffering injustice of any sort through the omission to specify the relevant criminal act in the charge.
 Submission that manner of trafficking should have been specified in the charge
In relation to the charge, counsel further argued that the prosecution should have specified therein the manner of trafficking concerned and it was said again that the omission to do so resulted in a miscarriage of justice. Counsel conceded that 
 Lee Ngin Kiat v PP 
 was not directly relevant because there the Court of Appeal was dealing with s 17 of the Act, whereas in the present case the prosecution did not refer to s 17 in the trial below. 
 Lim Hong Yap v PP 
 was canvassed instead in support of counsel`s argument. A careful perusal of the judgment in that case, however, satisfied us that it was of no real aid to counsel. In upholding the trial judge`s refusal to grant a request from the defence for additional particulars of the charge, the appellate court in that case made it clear that what is crucial is that the accused person is given sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged. In the present case it can hardly be said that the first appellant was in doubt as to which overt act of trafficking he was being accused of: that of delivering the drugs to Fullett, together with the second appellant, in pursuance of a sale arrived at earlier. As we have pointed out earlier (see under `Submission on issue of common intention`), in denying the allegation, the first appellant was able to present a full and detailed explanation for his bringing the drugs to the Hyatt hotel on 24 May 1988. We were of the opinion, therefore, that the omission to specifying the manner of trafficking in the charge did not produce a miscarriage of justice.
 Submission on Fullett`s evidence
Counsel also endeavoured to persuade us that Fullett was an agent provocateur and for that reason the trial judge should have accorded less weight to his evidence. Counsel`s basis for labelling Fullett an agent provocateur was that `without his involvement the alleged offence would not have been committed` and that had he not `led the first appellant on ... the alleged offence would not have been committed`. This seemed to us to be straining the facts of the case. The evidence of SNO Jamaluddin (which was accepted by the trial judge) showed that it was the first appellant who was seeking a buyer for `Golden Crescent` heroin. Fullett was requested by the CNB to assist in their investigations by posing as a would-be buyer, but it would be absurd to suggest that he thereby provoked the offence of trafficking by the first appellant. An agent provocateur is a person who `entices another to commit an express breach of the law which he would not otherwise have committed`: see 
 Mealey v R 
. In this case, the initiative to sell the drugs clearly emanated from the first appellant.
Counsel contended in addition that Fullett had `an obvious interest of his own to serve` and that his evidence should thus have been viewed cautiously. It was not really explained to us, however, what `obvious interest` of his own Fullett might have been serving. Fullett was a DEA agent with some 23 years` experience, who had been asked by the CNB to assist in the operation because they wanted a foreigner to pose as a buyer. Prior to the meeting with the first appellant on 23 May 1988, Fullett had never been involved in any dealings with him. We could not conceive of any `obvious interest` which Fullett might have had and which might have induced him to concoct or distort his evidence.
 Submission on inadmissibility of scientific literature
Counsel also contended on behalf of the first appellant that the trial judge erred in allowing Dr Saw Chwee Guan to refer to certain scientific literature for the purpose of proving the viability of his methods of analysis. Counsel submitted that s 62(2) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) rendered such literature inadmissible. That subsection reads: 
 
The opinions of experts expressed in any treatise commonly offered for sale and the grounds on which such opinions are held may be proved by the production of such treatise if the author is dead or cannot be found or has become incapable of giving evidence or cannot be called as a witness without an amount of delay or expense which the court regards as unreasonable.
 
 
 
As the prosecution pointed out, however, the article which Dr Saw referred to was in fact one which he had co-authored. Section 62(2) was therefore inapplicable and counsel`s submission in this respect was without merit.
 Submission on Zainal`s statement
Several arguments were put forward by counsel for the first appellant relating to a statement recorded from Zainal by Jamaluddin on 29 July 1988. It was contended first of all that the trial judge erred in refusing to grant an adjournment to enable the defence to adduce expert evidence as to the authorship of the statement. The defence had proposed to bring in from the United Kingdom one Reverend Andrew Morton, who had been reported in the British newspapers recently to have given expert evidence on the use of language in a criminal case in England. It may be noted that the expert, had he appeared, would have testified on the use of language in the statement rather than on the form of the statement (which in any case was typewritten). Counsel could not deny, however, that the decision to grant an adjournment lay at the discretion of the trial judge. Section 198(1) of the CPC provides that: 
 
If from the absence of a witness or any other reasonable cause it becomes necessary or advisable to do so the court may, by order, postpone the commencement of or adjourn any inquiry or trial on such terms as it thinks fit for such time as it considers reasonable. ...
 
 
 
In the present case, the trial judge`s decision not to grant an adjournment could not in our view be faulted since the defence`s grounds for applying for an adjournment were so regrettably flimsy. They had at no point been able to contact Reverend Andrew Morton personally, and there was no indication that they would be able to secure his services, even if they did manage to contact him or that his evidence would be favourable to the defence. Nor were they truly able to elaborate on the nature of the evidence sought to be adduced. In any case, the trial judge, in assessing the authorship of the statement, was afforded ample opportunity to observe the two key witnesses on that matter, Zainal and Jamaluddin. We were of the opinion that the trial judge was entirely justified in rejecting the defence`s request for an adjournment. We were further of the opinion that the trial judge was perfectly warranted, having heard the relevant witnesses, in finding that the statement was undoubtedly made by Zainal.
Yet another submission made by counsel in relation to Zainal`s statement was that s 23(1)(a) of the Act barred the trial judge from admitting it. Section 23(1)(a) reads: 
 
Except as provided in subsection (3) ... no information for an offence under this Act shall be admitted in evidence in any civil or criminal proceedings.
 
 
 
As it stands, s 23(1)(a) is loosely and rather vaguely drafted. We did not find it necessary, however, to adjudicate upon the meaning of s 23(1)(a) for the purposes of the present appeal. The subsection itself provides for an exception in the form of the subsequent subsection (3) which reads: 
 
If in any proceedings before a court for an offence under this Act the court, after full inquiry into the case, is satisfied that an informer wilfully made a material statement which he knew or believed to be false or did not believe to be true, or if in any other proceedings the court is of the opinion that justice cannot fully be done between the parties thereto without the disclosure of the name of an informer, the court may permit inquiry and require full disclosure concerning the informer.
 
 
 
In the present case, Zainal gave two wholly conflicting versions of the events which transpired on 23 May 1988. He insisted in his testimony that he was in court to tell the truth and denied that the statement which he gave had been made by him. This was obviously a situation calling for the application of the exception in subsection (3); full justice in the case could not have been achieved otherwise. In short, in our opinion, even assuming that s 23(1)(a) applied in the present case to Zainal`s statement, so too did s 23(1)(3); and for that reason no inequity was occasioned to the first appellant by the admission of the statement.
Finally, in relation to Zainal`s statement, it was argued that the trial judge placed improper reliance on it by treating it as substantive evidence in the case. It was plain to us, however, from the grounds of decision that there was no such reliance; the only use he made of the statement was for the purpose of impeaching Zainal`s credit as a witness, as seen in pp 66-67 of the grounds: 
 
The defence sought to introduce the evidence of Zainal and Ashok Kumar to give credence to the evidence of Jasbir. Zainal who had admitted giving a statement to Jamaluddin attempted to disown the whole statement. After hearing Jamaluddin and Zainal, I came to the conclusion that Zainal`s evidence in court was dubious. He was, in my view, trying to distance himself from the statement he voluntarily gave to Jamaluddin on account of his fear that he would be labelled an informer. He was found to be an untruthful witness and his evidence in court was unworthy of belief. His credit was clearly impeached.
 
 
 
 
 Submission on Ashok Kumar`s evidence
 
Counsel submitted that insufficient weight was given to the evidence of Ashok Kumar, the other witness called by the first appellant in the trial court. Kumar testified that on 24 May 1988 the first appellant had made an appointment to meet him in the afternoon for the purpose of showing him the brown powder he had found in the Pacific Mansion flat. The trial judge considered Kumar`s testimony but concluded that any effect it had was nullified by Fullett`s testimony and by the first appellant`s own s 122(6) statement. Again, we could see no cause to interfere with this finding of fact.
 Submission on the second appellant`s s 122(6) statement
Various arguments were also attempted in relation to the s 122(6) statement of the second appellant. It was submitted on behalf of the first appellant that his counsel in the court below should have been allowed to cross-examine the second appellant during the voir dire of the second appellant`s statement. We were in full agreement with the trial judge, however, that the first appellant had no such right. The only issue at the voir dire was to ascertain whether the statement had been made voluntarily by the second appellant and not to determine the truth or otherwise of that statement: see 
 Wong Kam-Ming v R 
.
Counsel argued that it was unjust not to allow one accused to cross-examine his co-accused during that co-accused`s voir dire because, following the recent decision in 
 Chin Seow Noi & Ors v PP 
, an accused person may be convicted solely on the basis of his co-accused`s confession; that accused, therefore, has an interest in proving the involuntariness of his co-accused`s confession. We could not agree, however, that in this case the first appellant suffered any real prejudice in being refused permission to cross-examine the second appellant during the voir dire of the admission in evidence of the second appellant`s s 122(6) statement. Any statement subjected to a voir dire is admitted in evidence only after the trial judge finds, on the basis of all the evidence adduced, that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt the voluntariness of the statement. It was on this basis that the second appellant`s s 122(6) statement was admitted in evidence.
Counsel then claimed that it was not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the second appellant`s s 122(6) statement had been made voluntarily. As stated earlier in these grounds of judgment, the second appellant alleged that he had made the statement only because SNO Teo had promised him that he would be made a state witness, the implication being that he would not therefore be charged. The trial judge considered the second appellant`s evidence in respect of that allegation and also the evidence of SNO Teo, eventually arriving at the conclusion that he believed SNO Teo`s testimony that no such promise (or indeed any other promise, inducement or threat) had been made to the second appellant. We saw no reason to disagree with the trial judge, especially since he had the advantage of having seen and heard both witnesses.
 Submission on the first appellant`s right of access to counsel
Another submission raised by counsel was that the first appellant was deprived of his constitutional right of access to counsel, such a deprivation being a grave injustice. Counsel relied on art 9(3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1992 Ed) which provides that: 
 
Where a person is arrested, he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice.
 
 
 
At the same time, however, counsel conceded that the article does not specify when the accused person is entitled to consult a legal practitioner, or even that the accused person must be informed of such a right. In the first appellant`s case, he was allowed access to his lawyer two weeks after his arrest. Counsel argued that the right of access to counsel was an 
 immediate 
 one, and further contended that, in particular, the first appellant should have been allowed to consult a lawyer before making his s 122(6) statement.
We could find no statutory basis for such a contention. Counsel cited to us several Malaysian cases, for example: 
 Ramli bin Salleh v Inspector Yahya bin Hashim 
, 
 Ooi 
 Ah Phua v Officer-in- 
 C
 harge, Criminal Investigations, Kedah/Perlis 
, and 
 Hashim bin Saud v Yahaya bin Hashim & Anor 
. An examination of the ratio of these authorities failed to reveal any real support for counsel`s argument that the first appellant should have been allowed access to a lawyer before making his s 122(6) statement. Essentially, the Malaysian cases, in construing the identical provision in their Constitution, lay down the principle that the right of an arrested person to consult his lawyer begins from the moment of his arrest, but (and it is important to note this) that the exercise of that right must be subject to a balance between the arrested person`s right to legal advice and the duty of the police to protect the public by carrying out effective investigations.
We had regard also to the only relevant Singapore authority on this issue, 
 Lee Mau Seng v Minister for Home Affairs, Singapore & Anor 
. All that was said of the constitutional right of access to counsel in that case was: 
 
If a person who is arrested wishes to consult a legal practitioner of his choice, he is, beyond a shadow of a doubt, entitled to have this constitutional right granted to him by the authority who has custody of him after his arrest and this right must be granted to him 
 within a reasonable time after his arrest
. The only exception ... is if there is provision in an enactment, which enactment is not ultra vires the Constitution, depriving him of this right. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Wee Chong Jin CJ, in giving the above judgment, did not elaborate on what he considered a `reasonable time` to be. However, since the only exception he allowed was that categorically enacted by statute, it may be surmised that he intended the element of allowance for police investigations and procedure to be already built into the `reasonable time` time-frame. In short, the 
 Lee Mau Seng 
 criterion really led to the same practical result as that set by the Malaysian courts in the above-mentioned cases. In fact, this court preferred the 
 Lee Mau Seng 
 criterion since, with all due respect, it seemed to us somewhat elliptical to say on the one hand that an arrested person had a right to see counsel 
 immediately 
 but to stipulate on the other hand that the police could deny him that right if they needed time to complete investigations.
In effect, therefore, neither 
 Lee Mau Seng 
 nor the Malaysian cases constituted support for counsel`s submission that the first appellant suffered an injustice in not being granted immediate access to a lawyer following his arrest. There is a world of difference between `within a reasonable time` and `immediately`; and, in our view, two weeks in the present case was a reasonable period of time. In any case, as pointed out by the deputy public prosecutor, the recording of a statement under s 122(6) of the CPC does not compel an accused person to make any statement which incriminates him. The notice given under s 122(6) states only that he has to state any fact which he intends to rely on in his defence in court, and informs him of the consequences of any omission to do so.
 Submission on rebuttal by first appellant of presumption of knowledge
Finally, it was submitted for the first appellant that the trial judge erred in holding that the first appellant had failed to rebut the presumption of knowledge raised against him by s 18(2). The first appellant used the word `drug` in his s 122(6) statement in referring to the substance he supposedly found in the Pacific Mansion flat. He admitted also in the same statement that he had arranged to sell the `drug` to Fullett. Fullett himself testified as to the sale of heroin which he and the first appellant arrived at, as well as the delivery scheduled for 24 May 1988 at the Hyatt. At trial, however, the first appellant claimed that he had used the word `drug` only because that word had been suggested to him at the CNB. He claimed that he was ignorant of the true nature of the `brown powder` throughout his dealings with Fullett and that he had met with Fullett precisely because he wished to find out what it actually was. We have already made reference to the evidence adduced by the first appellant (apart from his own testimony) in support of these claims, namely, the evidence of Zainal and Kumar. All the relevant evidence in the case was considered by the trial judge before he came to the conclusion that the first appellant had not rebutted the presumption of knowledge; and we could find no reason to disagree with his finding of fact.
 Final conclusions on the first appellant`s appeal
Having regard to all the foregoing, we were of the considered view that there was no merit whatsoever in the first appellant`s appeal and we therefore dismissed it.
We turn now to consider the submissions made by counsel for the second appellant.
 Submission by counsel for second appellant on common intention
Counsel`s first submission was that there was insufficient evidence in the case to show a common intention as between the first and second appellants to traffic in the drugs; and also that the trial judge `failed to apply the proper approach in deciding whether there existed a pre-arranged plan between the first and second appellants to sell the heroin to [Fullett]`. A perusal of the grounds of decision, however, showed both contentions to be inaccurate. The trial judge considered the issue of common intention exhaustively at pp 70-73 of his grounds of decision and we could see no basis, whether in fact or in law, to dissent from his determinations. Counsel argued that the second appellant was not involved in the alleged negotiations between Fullett and the first appellant for the sale of the heroin, but that was really beside the point. The crucial factor was the second appellant`s involvement in the delivery of the drugs to Fullett on 24 May 1988. The prosecution led a not insubstantial amount of evidence to show that, in accompanying the first appellant to the Hyatt on 24 May 1988 and in taking charge of the red plastic bag, the second appellant shared with the first appellant a common intention to traffic in the drugs by delivering them to Fullett in pursuance of a sale arranged earlier. In particular, the prosecution relied on the second appellant`s s 122(6) statement in which he stated that the first appellant had told him the bag contained `drugs`.
 Submission on second appellant`s s 122(6) statement
Not surprisingly, therefore, counsel`s next submission was that the trial judge erred in finding that the second appellant`s s 122(6) statement had been made voluntarily. We have in fact already dealt with this point in the context of the first appellant`s appeal and we would only reiterate our view that, the trial judge having made that finding only after assessing the conflicting testimonies of the second appellant and SNO Teo, we could see no cause to disagree with him.
 Submission on second appellant`s clarification
Finally, it was argued that the trial judge failed to consider the second appellant`s clarification of his subsequent statement on 7 June 1988. In that further statement, the second appellant `clarified` his s 122(6) statement by asserting that he used the word `drugs` in that statement only to mean `medicinal drugs`. He claimed that it was the first appellant who had told him that the red plastic bag contained medicinal drugs. On the contrary, however, the statement was fully taken into account by the trial judge at pp 51-52 of his grounds of decision. Having seen and heard the second appellant in the witness stand, he clearly had no faith in the veracity of the attempted clarification and found instead that the second appellant was well aware of the true nature of the drugs when he undertook to carry them to the meeting on 24 May 1988: see p 73 of the grounds of decision. This court examined at length the verbatim notes of proceedings and saw no reason to disturb the trial judge`s finding.
 Final conclusions on the second appellant`s appeal
For the reasons given above, we also dismissed the second appellant`s appeal.

The appellant, a Nigerian national, was tried before the High Court on a charge for importing into Singapore six packets of substance containing not less than 2,199g of diamorphine on 29 November 1990 at about 8am at Keppel Railway Station, contrary to s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). He was convicted and was sentenced to suffer death. Against his conviction this appeal was brought. We heard the appeal and, at the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
 The prosecution case
The evidence adduced by the prosecution, so far as material, was this. On 29 November 1990, the appellant was on board the train from West Malaysia which arrived at Keppel Railway Station (`the railway station`) at about 7am. A team of three customs officers from the Investigation Branch of the Customs and Excise Department were carrying out surveillance duties in plain clothes at the station. The team comprised Chief Customs Officers R Tanahgobar (`CCO Tanahgobar`), Higher Customs Officer Abdul Aziz bin Hashim (`HCO Aziz`) and Higher Customs Officer Pius Michael (`HCO Michael`).
As the train came to a halt, CCO Tanahgobar saw the appellant behaving suspiciously at the exit of coach No 4. He informed HCO Michael to keep the appellant under surveillance. HCO Michael boarded the train to observe the appellant. He noticed the appellant walking back to coach No 4 and sitting on a bed. The appellant waited for all the other passengers to alight before he got off. He carried a black briefcase, a grey coloured plastic bag and a colourful bag with vertical stripes. He walked towards the immigration counter and joined the queue for foreigners. He did not talk to anyone when he was standing in the queue. Upon clearance at immigration, he walked to the customs counter. HCO Michael stopped him and asked for his passport. Both CCO Tanahgobar and HCO Aziz were also in attendance.
The appellant`s passport revealed that he was a Nigerian civil servant. HCO Michael sought confirmation from the appellant in English as to his profession and he replied `civil servant` in English. The appellant was then brought into the customs office where his luggage was searched. HCO Michael asked him if he had anything to declare and the appellant answered in the negative. Upon further questioning, the appellant stated that he came from Bangkok and would be staying two to three days in Singapore after which he would return to Bangkok for a month. He explained that the reason why he carried so much luggage for a short trip was because he intended to send them by special delivery. He replied that he did not have any cigarettes, liquors or drugs. HCO Michael then opened the appellant`s luggage. The black briefcase revealed clothings, coins, a Bible and a Book of Psalms. The grey plastic bag was then searched but only stainless steel items were found. After that, HCO Michael turned his attention to the colourful bag with the verticle stripes. In it were the following: a Kando light weight iron, a National electric pot and frying pan, a Sharp rice cooker and a Zojirushi rice cooker. He then examined the base of the Zojirushi rice cooker and noticed that one of the screws had been tampered with. CCO Tanahgobar was informed of this discovery. HCO Michael took a screw driver from CCO Tanahgobar and was about to unscrew the base of the rice cooker when the appellant said that he felt like vomiting and tried to leave the room. He was stopped by CCO Tanahgobar from doing so. The appellant was given a plastic bag by CCO Tanahgobar to vomit into but the appellant only spat into it. HCO Michael asked the appellant if the rice cooker was new. The appellant answered in the affirmative and added that he had purchased it in Thailand. When the base of the rice cooker was removed, there was some asbestos lining, and when the lining was removed, there was a blue plastic bag containing a white powdery substance. HCO Michael pointed to the plastic bag and asked him twice what it was. The appellant remained silent. CCO Tanahgobar then checked the Sharp rice cooker and also noticed that the screws at the base had been tampered with. When the base was removed, a white plastic bag containing a white powdery substance was retrieved. When he was asked what it was, the appellant initially remained silent but then uttered `Hallelujah!` twice as well as words which nobody understood. He then said twice: `You can kill me!`.
A body search of the appellant revealed nothing incriminating. HCO Michael then asked him in English where the appellant would be staying in Singapore. The appellant mentioned his Canadian girlfriend`s place but he could not remember where that was and added that, even if he did, the Customs Officers would not let him go there.
HCO Michael, CCO Tanahgobar and HCO Aziz stated that after the conversation had taken place, they recorded the contents of it on a piece of paper which was later transcribed into their pocket diaries. They were, however, unable to produce the pocket diaries in court.
At about 9.20am the investigating officer of the case, Insp Lee Kiong Lock (`Insp Lee`) arrived and was briefed by CCO Tanahgobar. He recovered the two packets of powder from the customs officers as well as the rest of the items contained in the grey plastic bag and the colourful bag. Insp Lee also searched the appellant and seized from him the following:
 
 
(i) a KLM air ticket from Bangkok containing a ticket to Lagos via Amsterdam issued in the appellant`s name; 
 
(ii) US$985, and 
 
(iii) $289 of Thai Baht.
  
 
 
Dr Saw Chwee Guan, a scientific officer from the department of scientific services (`DSS`), analyzed the two packets of white powdery substance and certified that they contained not less than 2,199g of diamorphine.
 The defence
The appellant gave evidence in his defence and his evidence, so far as material, was this. He is a Nigerian and grew up in Onishta, Nigeria. His educational qualifications were minimal. He attended classes only up to nursery school after which he gave up his studies. He was illiterate and could speak only Igbo. At the age of 20, he left his village for Lagos and assisted in selling groceries for 31/2 years. After that he worked for another 31/2 years until 1990 in a company which cleaned government offices. At the time of the arrest, he was 34 years old.
Prior to his arrest, he was carrying on a business in Nigeria of dealing in cameras, photographic materials and accessories as a sole proprietor. He started this business whilst he was working in the civil service. As a civil servant he was employed by a company called GMO as a messenger.
He went to Bangkok in September 1990 to purchase photographic materials, cameras and chemicals. In Bangkok, he met two Nigerians, Okke and Uchenna, who were also in the photographic line of business in Nigeria. Okke and Uchenna helped him make all the purchases as he could not communicate with anyone else in Bangkok because of the language problem. He spent US$38,000 in Bangkok in making the purchases for his business. He could not get a Mamiya camera which many of his customers in Nigeria wanted. He wanted to purchase at least one Mamiya camera to show his customers and to establish contact so that he could order more in future. His attempts to procure this camera in Bangkok failed. He then met one Obiara, a fellow Nigerian, who dealt in electronics and Obiara promised to take him to Singapore as the latter knew where to buy Mamiya cameras. He flew to Singapore with Obiara and spent two days and one night. It was Obiara who filled up his disembarkation form for the Singapore immigration. They went to many places in Singapore but could not get a Mamiya camera. He then accompanied Obiara back to Bangkok.
Within a week of his return from Singapore, he met another Nigerian called Anthony Mbaekwa (`Anthony`). Anthony`s younger brother, Jude, was his close friend. Anthony traded in cooking utensils such as gas and rice cookers. He respected Anthony as the latter was older and a successful businessman. The appellant claimed that he respected Anthony so much to the extent that he would not even speak face to face with him. The appellant informed Anthony about his search for a Mamiya camera. Anthony offered to help as he knew where it could be purchased in Singapore. Anthony asked him to go to Singapore. The appellant informed Anthony that he would be going by train and would meet Anthony in Singapore. Anthony wrote a telephone number at the back of a card where he could be contacted. Anthony then informed him that he wanted the accused to carry samples of goods for him to Singapore: they were rice cookers and things he had bought in Singapore or Bangkok.
On 28 November 1990, Anthony met him at the Bangkok railway station. The appellant described his meeting with Anthony as `brief and snappy` in which Anthony passed him a grey plastic bag and a colourful bag with vertical stripes. The appellant opened both the bags and saw that they contained boxes and kitchen utensils. After that he did not examine the bags or question Anthony further as to the contents of the boxes.
Whilst on the train, the appellant met an African of Liberian nationality. The appellant asked him in a mixture of Igbo and broken English to assist him in filling up his disembarkation form which the latter did. Upon his arrival in Singapore, the Liberian got off the train and spoke to him while they were on the railway platform. The Liberian advised him that should he have any problem in Singapore he should show his passport to any person and they would help him. The appellant was instructed to follow behind him when he walked to the immigration counter. In the immigration queue, the Liberian was standing ahead of him with a white man separating them.
When the appellant was stopped by customs officers who questioned him, he could not understand them. He tried to speak broken English to them and denied saying that he told them that he was a civil servant. The appellant denied answering the questions posed by the customs officers as well as all the utterances attributed to him by the customs officers. He claimed that when the rice cookers were removed from the box it was the first time he had seen a rice cooker. He had never seen, nor had he handled, a rice cooker before as he used firewood and a metal pot back home. He then stated that when the rice cookers were searched and drugs were found, he said in broken English that those thing did not belong to him and shouted `hey, wo` (meaning `Oh, my God`) several times which the customs officers might have mistaken for `Hallelujah`. Although he denied saying the words `You can kill me!` he remembered saying in his own Igbo that Anthony had killed him.
Also significant was the discovery of a copy of the Bible and a copy of the Book of Psalms in English found in his black briefcase. The appellant admitted to the ownership of these books and said that he kept them under his pillow each night and they were his constant travelling companions. He claimed that he had the Igbo version of the B
ible but he stated that he did not read that version. The books were meant to strengthen his faith by having them around him.
Lastly, the appellant tendered a letter dated 27 February 1992 from his wife Veronica in Nigeria which was a reply to a letter he had written while he was in remand prison. The appellant had requested his wife to look for Anthony. Her reply was admitted as exhibit D-1 to show the fact that it was made and not for the truth of its contents. It was also admitted to show the fact that the appellant`s wife was unable to locate Anthony.
 Trial judge`s findings
The trial judge accepted the evidence of the three customs officers who gave evidence against the appellant and found that the evidence of the customs officers showed that the appellant knew that the rice cookers contained drugs. The trial judge rejected the appellant`s claim that he could not speak English. He found the appellant guilty of the charge.
 Appeal
Before us, counsel for the appellant raised three main arguments. First, as a preliminary point, he argued that the trial judge had already delivered an oral judgment on 20 September 1993 and erred in law in writing his grounds of decision on 20 December 1993. He submitted that the grounds of decision therefore ought to be disregarded and the court ought to have regard only to the reasons given in the oral judgment. Counsel relied on 
 Ankur Nath Ganguli v PP 
, 
 Lorraine Phyllis Cohen & Anor v PP 
 and s 46(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322). Similar argument as this has been canvassed before us very recently in 
 Goh Lai Wak v PP 
, and, in disposing of such argument, this court said: 
 
We agree with the propositions enunciated in 
 Ankur Nath
 and 
 Lorraine Phylis Cohen
. A judge cannot subsequently give his grounds of decision if he has already delivered a prior judgment at the conclusion of the trial which contains his reasons for convicting the accused. This principle does not affect the operation of s 218 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which provides that a judgment shall be explained to the accused. There cannot be any objection to a judge providing briefly at the conclusion of a trial an outline of the issues before him and the evidence on them, and to indicate briefly, without reasons, his findings on them. In such circumstances, there should be no objection if subsequent written grounds of decision are delivered in which the evidence is fully reviewed and the judge`s detailed reasons or grounds of his findings are comprehensively recorded.
 
 
 
That precisely was what had happened in the instant case. In the oral judgment the trial judge stated the charge, the prosecution case, the defence and his findings that the prosecution had proved the case beyond reasonable doubt, that he had no doubt that the appellant knew that diamorphine was concealed in the rice cookers, and that, accordingly, the appellant was guilty of the charge. Following what we have said in 
 Goh Lai Wak 
, we could see no objection to the trial judge in this case providing, subsequent to his oral judgment, his written grounds of decision. In our judgment, these grounds of decision could certainly form part of the record for consideration by this court.
The next argument advanced by counsel was that the appellant did not import the drugs into Singapore. His arguments ran along the following line. The appellant was arrested at the premises of the Malayan Railway Station at Keppel Road, and the premises there are owned and have been owned by the Government of Malaysia since 23 March 1949. Under s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) `Singapore` is defined as the Republic of Singapore and includes the Island of Singapore and all islands and places which on 2 June 1959 were administered as part of Singapore and all territorial waters adjacent thereto. Clause 9 of the Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965 was also referred to by counsel and that clause reads as follows: 
 
All property, movable and immovable, and rights, liabilities and obligations which before Malaysia Day belonged to or were the responsibility of the Government of Singapore and which on that day or after became the property or the responsibility of the Government of Malaysia shall on Singapore day revert to and vest in or devolve upon and become once again the property of or the responsibility of Singapore.
 
 
 
He also relied on two Singapore statutes, namely, the States of Malaya Customs Duties Collection Act (Cap 316) and the Service Lands Act (Cap 292). These Acts, he submitted, gave the Malaysian government territorial jurisdiction for the purposes stated in those Acts. Turning to the ownership of the Malayan Railway (which includes the Keppel Railway Station and the railway line from the causeway to the station) by the Malaysian government, he submitted that that ownership bestowed upon Malaysia criminal jurisdiction over offences committed therein. As the Keppel Railway Station and the Singapore railway line (from the causeway to the station) were owned by the Government of Malaysia, they were under the territorial jurisdiction of Malaysia. In consequence, the appellant could only be prosecuted in Malaysia for an offence of importation of drugs into Malaysia from Thailand or, alternatively, for export of drugs from Malaysia.
This argument was wholly untenable and we had no hesitation in rejecting it. We took judicial notice of the territorial boundaries of Singapore, and the official map of Singapore clearly shows the northern boundary between Singapore and Malaysia as situate along the Straits of Johor, and all that part of the railway line south of the boundary is part of Singapore territory. So are the premises of Keppel Railway Station at Keppel Road. The stretch of land on which the railway line runs and the station premises are owned by the Malaysian government for purely commercial purpose and such ownership per se does not establish Malaysian sovereignty over the property in Singapore. Both the States of Malaya Customs Duties Collection Act and the Service Lands Act are of very limited application: the States of Malaya Customs Duties Collection Act deals with the setting up of customs stations in Singapore to collect duties for Malaysia, while the Service Lands Act deals with the ejectment of trespassers from Malaysian military lands in Singapore. These Acts do not expressly or by implication confer upon the Malaysian government any extra-territorial jurisdiction or criminal jurisdiction over that part of the railway line situate in Singapore or the Keppel Station.
The third main argument of counsel for the appellant was directed to the findings of fact made by the trial judge. Counsel criticized the trial judge`s acceptance of the evidence of the three customs officers, CCO Tanahgobar, HCO Aziz and HCO Michael, and pointed out the various inconsistencies in their evidence which, he submitted, the trial judge had failed to consider. Whatever may be the inconsistencies in their evidence, the basic primary facts established by their evidence which could not be challenged and had not been challenged were these. The appellant came to Singapore by train on the morning of 29 November 1990. As the train pulled up at the station, he was seen by the customs officers and kept under surveillance. He alighted from the train after all the other passengers had got off. He was then carrying a black briefcase, a plastic bag and a colourful bag with verticle stripes. At the customs counter, he was stopped and later was brought to the customs office. There, his bags were searched and packets of powdery substance were found concealed in the false bottoms of the two rice cookers and the substance on analysis was found to contain not less than 2,199g of diamorphine. These facts were beyond dispute. On these facts, the presumptions (i) that the appellant was in possession of the drugs and (ii) that he knew the nature of the drugs arose under s 18 of the Act. It is for the appellant to rebut these presumptions.
The appellant gave evidence before the trial judge seeking to rebut the presumptions. The trial judge saw and heard him, and found that the appellant was not truthful and he disbelieved the appellant. On the evidence before him, the trial judge was amply justified in reaching this finding. On the basis of such finding, it was plain to us that the trial judge found that the appellant had not rebutted the presumptions. We too reached the same finding.
It is true that the trial judge had gone further in his findings. The trial judge accepted the evidence of the customs officers as to what took place at the customs office when the appellant`s bags were searched and the concealed drugs were discovered. He found them as witnesses of truth and that they did not concoct a story of what took place. On the basis of this and other evidence before him, he also found that the appellant knew that the two rice cookers contained the drugs. Here again, the trial judge was justified in reaching such a conclusion and there was no material error in his findings which would warrant our interference with such findings.
The appeal had no merit and was accordingly dismissed.

(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court):
1
          
 
This is an appeal against the decision of Kan Ting Chiu JC convicting the appellant on a charge of importing into Singapore not less than 464g of diamorphine on 20 November 1990, an offence under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (‘the Act’) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. After hearing arguments by counsel, we dismissed the appeal and indicated that we would give our reasons later, which we now do.
The facts
2
          
 
The appellant arrived at Changi International Airport on 20 November 1990 at about 2.50pm from Phuket on board flight TG405. At the time he was in transit enroute to Toronto. In the past, a practice had developed amongst drug carriers to take flight TG405. Hence Senior Customs Officer Said Abdul Rahman bin Said Awad (‘SCO Rahman’) and Higher Customs Officer Juraimi bin Safie (‘HCO Juraimi’) were assigned to keep the passengers from this flight under observation. To do so, they placed themselves in a position in the transit lounge from which they could see the passengers that came out of gate B23, the departure gate assigned to flight TG405.
3
          
 
The appellant was first sighted by the officers as he separated from a group of passengers coming from gate B23. After noticing an unnatural bulge at his waist, the officers approached him and carried out a routine check on him. They asked for, and obtained, his passport, air ticket and boarding pass, and he was brought by the officers to the customs bond office. In the customs bond office, he was asked by HCO Juraimi whether he had anything to declare. He replied in the negative. They asked to search him and he voluntarily lifted up both his arms for the officers to do so. When SCO Rahman frisked him, he felt hard objects at the front of the appellant’s body. When SCO Rahman lifted the appellant’s T-shirt, he discovered a vest beneath with sewn-in pouches. The appellant was then asked three questions by the officers. First, he was asked what he was carrying. The appellant stated that he had no idea. Secondly, he was asked where he intended to deliver the vest. The appellant replied that he intended to deliver it to Toronto. Lastly, he was asked how much he was paid. He answered that payment was in the sum of HK$80,000. In consequence, the appellant was arrested, handcuffed by HCO Juraimi and brought to the surveillance room. The Central Narcotics Bureau (‘CNB’) was then notified of his arrest.
4
          
 
Inspector Alan Moh from the CNB arrived at the airport at 4.45pm. When he instructed the appellant to take off the vest, he found that there were 16 pouches in the vest, each holding a slab of substance. Photographs were taken of the vest and slabs found therein. At 6.55pm, the appellant was brought back to the CNB. While Inspector Moh attended to the relevant paperwork, Sergeant Tan Lye Huat kept watch over the appellant. Later, at 9pm, Inspector Moh recorded a cautioned statement from the appellant with the aid of Cantonese interpreter Wu Nan Yong. The statement read as follows:
The drug was not meant for Singapore. I was in transit in Singapore to Toronto. I know it is a drug but I do not know whether it is heroin.
5
          
 
Upon analysis, the 16 slabs secreted within the vest were found to contain not less than 464g of diamorphine. When a sample of the appellant’s urine was analyzed, no trace of diamorphine was detected.
The appellant’s defence before the High Court
6
          
 
The appellant testified that he resided in Hong Kong where he was employed as a chief supervisor in a security company. He was married, and had a blind son who was five years old. He had been enticed to go on this trip by a colleague, one Law Yew Wah (‘Law’), who mysteriously promised that the trip would be beneficial to his son. He went to Hong Kong Airport on the appointed day and, there, he was given two tickets by Law, who failed to inform him of the purpose of his mission. He was told simply to follow the route prescribed by the tickets, which was to go from Hong Kong to Bangkok, on to Phuket, to transit in Singapore and then finally to arrive in Toronto. He was, however, instructed not to take the connecting flight between Bangkok and Phuket.
7
          
 
As briefed, the appellant flew to Bangkok where he spent a few days, ostensibly for the purpose of sightseeing. From Bangkok, he boarded a bus to Phuket. He spent a day in Phuket, again ostensibly for the purpose of sightseeing. From there he took flight TG405 bound for Singapore. He testified that at the point when he boarded the flight in Phuket, he was not wearing the vest which contained the diamorphine. However, just as the plane touched down onto the runway at Changi International Airport, an unknown male Chinese came up to him and queried if his name was Chan Chi Pun. When he answered the question in the positive, he was told to follow the man to the airplane toilet, which he did. Whilst he stood at the door of the toilet, the man went into the toilet, came out, and then told him to take ‘it’. Upon entering the toilet, he found the vest in a plastic bag. It was then that he put on the vest. He, therefore, had not been the party responsible for the importation of the drugs as he had received the vest only within the territorial limits of Singapore. He also testified that he was unaware of the contents of the vest, and his cautioned statement which indicated otherwise had been inaccurately translated and recorded.
8
          
 
The trial judge rejected the appellant’s defence. He was of the view that the appellant had himself imported the diamorphine into Singapore. In addition, he held that the prosecution had sufficiently established the mental element for the offence charged. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant. The parts of the trial judge’s grounds of decision material to the appeal will be detailed below.
The issues on appeal
9
          
 
Before us, counsel for the appellant concentrated on four main issues. The first ground of appeal was against the trial judge’s decision at the end of the prosecution case to call for the defence. The second ground of appeal focused on the three questions asked of the appellant and the answers which he gave to them in the customs bond office prior to his arrest. The third concerned the trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s account of events. The last ground of appeal was against the trial judge’s conclusion on the sufficiency of the mental element necessary for the offence of importation.
The trial judge’s decision to call for the defence
10
      
 
Counsel for the appellant sought to show us that the trial judge had erred in deciding that the prosecution had established a prima facie case at the halfway stage. Upon reviewing the record, however, we found this contention to be devoid of any merit. At the time of the appellant’s arrest, he was wearing a vest in which 16 slabs of substance containing diamorphine were found. He had been sighted in the transit lounge coming from the direction of gate B23, the gate used for the disembarkation of passengers from flight TG405. His air ticket, boarding pass and passport indicated that he had come from Phuket on flight TG405. He had a conversation with the customs officers in which he indicated that he was enroute to Toronto and had been paid HK$80,000 for his efforts. In the circumstances, there was ample evidence from which the trial judge could conclude that a prima facie case had been established by the prosecution.
The conversation within the customs bond office
11
      
 
Much was said by counsel for the appellant about the conversation between the customs officers and the appellant inside the customs bond office in which the officers ascertained that the appellant was enroute to Toronto and had been paid HK$80,000. Counsel for the appellant used two lines of argument. The first was a contention that the conversation was in fact completely inadmissible as customs officers do not possess the power to question suspects. Counsel for the appellant contended that the power to question suspects is given only to CNB officers, as s 32 of the Act grants them the same powers as police officers investigating seizable offences. In contrast, ss 25 and 26 of the Act empower customs officers only to search for, seize and detain illegal drugs and make arrests. Counsel contended that as the questioning of the appellant marked the commencement of investigations which lay solely in the province of CNB officers, the answers given by the appellant to SCO Rahman and HCO Juraimi were inadmissible.
12
      
 
In our judgment, counsel for the appellant’s argument lacked merit. We observed that this contention could in fact be dismissed on the short ground that evidence unlawfully obtained, once relevant, is in law admissible, and the court would only exercise its judicial discretion to exclude it if its reception would operate unfairly against the accused: 
Cheng Swee Tiang v PP
, following 
Kuruma s/o Kaniu v R
 and 
Callis v Gunn
. We did not think this principle of law to be in doubt, and, indeed, counsel did not seek to query it. We thought it useful, nonetheless, to deal with the legality of the questions asked by the customs officers in these grounds of judgment as it was argued fully before us. In our view, s 32 of the Act does not reserve the power to ask questions of suspects to CNB officers alone. Section 32 of the Act provides:
In any case relating to the commission of an offence under this Act, an officer of the Bureau shall have all the powers of a police officer under the Criminal Procedure Code in relation to an investigation into a seizable offence.
13
      
 
Thus the purpose of s 32 of the Act is to vest CNB officers with those particular powers found in s 118 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 224) (‘the CPC’). These are to compel the attendance of witnesses to answer questions, to conduct searches and to put persons on bond to appear in court without the order of the public prosecutor. The customs officers, in asking the appellant what he was carrying, where he was going and the price he was paid, were not attempting to do any of these things. Hence, they were not exercising any powers exclusive to CNB officers. In fact, in our view, the power to question suspects in the manner which the customs officers did is impliedly given to customs officers by virtue of ss 25 and 26 of the Act. This is because under s 25 of the Act, a customs officer may arrest without warrant ‘any person who has committed or whom he reasonably suspects to have committed an offence under this Act’. Furthermore, any suspect may be searched and any illegal articles found in the search detained. Section 26 gives the officer enhanced powers of search. In our view, it is not only natural, but also necessary, for an officer to question a suspect before arresting or searching him. To interpret ss 25 and 26 otherwise would risk illogicality. We were of the view, therefore, that it was perfectly legal for the customs officers to ask the appellant the questions which they did.
14
      
 
Counsel for the appellant’s second line of contention in relation to the conversation inside the customs bond office was to question the accuracy of the accounts given by SCO Rahman and HCO Juraimi. He sought first to show that the evidence of SCO Rahman and HCO Juraimi were suspect by highlighting inconsistencies between the evidence given by them at the preliminary inquiry and then later at trial. When we perused the notes taken at the preliminary inquiry, however, it appeared to us that there were no significant differences in the material parts of the two accounts. One difference, canvassed before us at some length, was the fact that, at the preliminary inquiry, SCO Rahman had stated that when he frisked the appellant he saw 16 blocks in the pouches of the vest. At trial SCO Rahman stated that he discovered that there were 16 blocks only later, when the CNB officers took over investigations. A similar problem arose with HCO Juraimi’s preliminary inquiry evidence. Both officers explained, however, that it was after the CNB officers had finished their investigations that they realized that there were 16 slabs. Thus, when they stated that there were 16 slabs at the inquiry, this was because by the time of the inquiry they already possessed that information. In our view, the difference was not material, and the explanation given by the officers was plausible. We noted also that, owing to an oversight on the part of the DPP in charge of the case, the two officers had only been informed on the morning of the preliminary inquiry itself that it was necessary for them to give oral evidence. They were thus unable to check their pocketbooks, giving rise to slight inconsistencies.
15
      
 
We were also directed by counsel for the appellant to the supposed inconsistencies revealed during the cross-examination of SCO Rahman and HCO Juraimi at trial. During SCO Rahman’s intense cross-examination he was compelled by counsel for the appellant to admit apparent inconsistencies between his evidence at trial and at the preliminary inquiry with regard to the three questions asked of the appellant inside the customs bond office. Apparently the answer to the third question, the query as to the price of his services, was ‘was paid $80,000’, not ‘was to be paid $80,000’. In addition, the reply to the second question ought to have included the word ‘someone’, thus the answer to the second question should not have been ‘to deliver to Toronto’, but ‘to deliver to someone in Toronto’. In our view, this elaborate hair-splitting acheived nothing. Although counsel managed to obtain an admission from HCO Juraimi that these were ‘serious types of errors’ it appeared to us that counsel was merely badgering an intimidated witness. Owing to the passage of time, it would have been unrealistic to expect the officers to remember each specific word. The import of the conversation was consistent and, to us, this was adequate. We did not think that the customs officers’ evidence had been shown to be unreliable and we disagreed entirely with counsel for the appellant’s purely technical approach.
The trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s version of events
16
      
 
Counsel for the appellants sought to show that the trial judge erred in rejecting the appellant’s version of events. He contended that the appellant only received possession of the vest after the aeroplane had landed in Singapore and not at any point before this. In this context, he questioned the adverse inference drawn by the trial judge from the appellant’s failure to mention such facts earlier. In his grounds of decision the trial judge stated:
17
      
 
… if that was what really happened, it would be natural and reasonable for him to tell the customs officers and the investigating officer about it, but he said nothing of the events to them and did not mention it in his cautioned statement. In our view, this inference was eminently sensible, especially in light of the fact that the appellant did make a cautioned statement. He could easily have given all the facts rather than three brief sentences. In addition, we found the trial judge’s rejection of the appellant’s version of events sound. The appellant’s story was far-fetched, to say the least. There was no reason for Law, if indeed it were Law who instructed the appellant, to have placed another man on the flight just to hand over the vest to the appellant on the plane’s touch-down in Singapore. The appellant’s story as to the unknown Chinese man who handed him the vest was vague and not supported even by a description of the man. In our view, the appellant clearly imported the diamorphine himself.
Sufficiency of mental element
18
      
 
Counsel vigorously asserted that the appellant possessed no knowledge that the vest contained diamorphine. In support he cited the appellant’s cautioned statement, which he viewed as exculpatory. The statement, it would be recalled, stated simply: The drug was not meant for Singapore. I was in transit in Singapore to Toronto. I know it is a drug but I do not know whether it is heroin. Counsel for the appellant emphasized repeatedly that the third sentence of the s 122(6) statement was ‘I now know it is a drug’, not ‘I know it is a drug’ and was, therefore, indicative of the absence of knowledge on the part of the appellant. He also stressed most strenuously that the interpreter Wu Nan Yong agreed with him. Wu Nan Yong did, in fact, agree with him that the Cantonese word for ‘now’ had been used by the appellant. However, counsel did not manage to establish that Wu thought the word ‘now’ indicated recent knowledge. Wu appeared to use it to mean the present tense. On re-examination, he stated, ‘I did not use the word ‘now’ but I used another word … 
I used a present tense to indicate that he has knowledge at that time
.’ [Emphasis added.] When the DPP repeated the italicized sentence to him he confirmed it. In our view, if the appellant had indeed wished to communicate the idea that he only came to the realization that the vest contained heroin after his arrest and not at any time before, he could well have stated thus in less subtle language.
19
      
 
Objection was also taken to the trial judge’s finding that there was sufficient mental element for the offence. Counsel took issue with the trial judge’s formulation of the common law test of possession. This was because the trial judge stated in his grounds of decision:
However, even if he did not have knowledge, he would nevertheless be liable. That is so because when physical possession of a drug is established, proof of knowledge of the drug is not necessary. This proposition can be traced back to the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision in 
Tan Ah Tee & Anor v PP
 where it was held that ‘possession’ in the Misuse of Drugs Act must be construed in the way it was construed by Lord Pearce in 
Warner v MPC
.
20
      
 
We agreed with counsel for the appellant that the statement ‘when physical possession of a drug is established, proof of knowledge of the drug is unnecessary’ was unfortunately too extreme. In 
Warner v Metropolitan Police Commisioner
, Lord Pearce stated that, in a normal case, there ought to be a very strong inference of fact that a man who is in physical possession of a parcel also possesses its contents. In his view, a mistake as to the quality of the substance could not negative possession. Nevertheless, Lord Pearce did state that the inference could be rebutted in several ways, for instance, where there appeared to be complete mistake as to the contents of the parcel, or complete ignorance as to the existence of the drugs. In the present case, however, although the trial judge’s statement of the law was too wide, the facts do not show anything that could rebut the inference that the appellant possessed the contents of the vest. There was no plausible manner in which the appellant could claim that the 16 slabs were slipped into the vest he was wearing by mistake. At the highest, his case was one of wilful blindness, which is not excusable on the common law test. Lord Pearce, at p 308 of his judgement, stated ‘… if he suspected that there was anything wrong about the contents when he received the parcel, the proper inference is that he was accepting possession of the contents by not immediately verifying them’.
21
      
 
Furthermore, we found that, in his grounds of decision, the trial judge in fact used two routes to establish sufficient mental element on the appellant’s part. In addition to the common law test, the trial judge also concluded that the presumption raised by s 18(2) of the Act, which presumes that the appellant knew the nature of the substance in his possession, had not been rebutted by the appellant. Before us, counsel did not query the trial judge’s use of that presumption. Neither did counsel query the finding made by the trial judge that the presumption had not been rebutted, and, in our view, that finding was sound. The drugs were discovered in a vest which the appellant wore under his clothes. From the photographs, the vest appeared neither light nor comfortable, nor were the slabs of drugs disguised. The appellant’s statements to the customs officers and the CNB officers also indicated guilty knowledge. In the circumstances, it was not in fact necessary for the trial judge to deal with the common law test of possession. In our considered opinion, s 18(2) raised a presumption that the appellant knew the nature of the drugs in his possession, and, on the facts, that presumption was not rebutted.
The use of the appellant’s cautioned statement as part of the prosecution’s case
22
      
 
We think it necessary to deal with one further point. In his grounds of decision, the trial judge referred to the suggestion urged on him that a cautioned statement could not be used as part of the prosecution’s case. Being persuaded by this suggestion, the trial judge only admitted the cautioned statement in evidence after the defence had been called and the appellant had decided to testify in his own defence. Although this point was not raised in the petition of appeal, the deputy public prosecutor was anxious for us to address it fully and this we now do.
23
      
 
The controversy arose from the wording of s 122(6) of the CPC, which provides:
Where any person is charged with an offence or officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, he shall be served with a notice in writing, which shall be explained to him, to the following effect:
‘You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for —
(set out the charge).
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. 
If you hold back until you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general
. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.’ [Emphasis added.]
24
      
 
The contention was premised upon the italicized portion of s 122(6) of the CPC. It was argued that if an accused decided to make a cautioned statement, this was in response to the warning in s 122(6), hence any statement made would be for the specific purpose of preventing any diminution of his defence should he testify in court. Thus, it was argued that until the defence was called and the defendant decided to testify, the statement was inadmissible.
25
      
 
In our considered opinion, we think it settled law that the issue of admissibility is governed solely by s 122(5) of the CPC. In 
Tsang Yuk Chung v PP
, it was argued before the Court of Appeal that the s 122(6) statement was inadmissible because the warning in s 122(6) of the CPC had not been adequately explained. Wee Chong Jin CJ explained the relationship between s 122(5) and 122(6) in these terms at p 266:
26
      
 
Section 122(6) itself does not provide for the admissibility of statements recorded thereunder. The admissibility of such statements must still be founded upon s 122(5) as one of the exceptions to s 122(1) which, prima facie, prohibits the use in evidence of any statement made by any person to a police officer in the course of a police investigation.
27
      
 
In 
Tan Boon Tat v PP
 it was again argued that the statement recorded under s 122(6) of the CPC was inadmissible as s 122(6) had not been complied with. Rajendran J, delivering the grounds of judgment of the court, agreed with the statement made in 
Tsang Yuk Chung
 that s 122(5) was the section to use to determine questions of admissibility. At p 14 he stated:
The admissibility of a statement recorded under s 122(6) is dependent on s 122(5) of the CPC or the Evidence Act (as the case may be). Non-compliance with the provisions of s 122(6) may put into jeopardy the possibility of the court drawing an adverse inference under s 123(1) but has little or no bearing on the question of admissibility.
28
      
 
Thus, to ascertain if the counsel for the appellant’s view was sound we looked to s 122(5), which provides:
Where any person is charged with an offence any statement, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, 
whether before or after that person is charged
 and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer of or above the rank of sergeant shall be admissible at his trial in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit.
Provided that the court shall refuse … if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise … [Emphasis added.]
29
      
 
As can be seen, s 122(5) of the CPC lays down only two conditions for the admissibility of any statement: that it be made to an officer of a specified rank, and that there be no threat, inducement or promise of the kind which the section makes provision for. Once those conditions are satisfied, the plain words of the section specify that the statement ‘shall be admissible at his trial in evidence’. Even more to the point, immediately after these words, the section then makes provision for the special case where the accused does in fact testify in his own defence: ‘if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit’. The clear implication, therefore, is that the statement is admissible as evidence whether the accused gives evidence or not. For these reasons, it is our view that s 122(5) of the CPC allows the prosecution to use the statement as part of the prosecution case. If the accused does testify, then the prosecution can go on to cross-examine him on the statement or impeach his credit. The purpose of the s 122(6) warning, then, is merely to warn the accused of the power given to the court by virtue of s 123(1) of the CPC to ‘draw such inferences … as appear proper’ from an accused person’s refusal to explain any fact which he may reasonably be expected to explain. We were, therefore, of the view that the trial judge erred in not admitting in evidence the appellant’s s 122(6) statement before the defence was called. A s 122(6) statement can and should be admitted as part of the prosecution’s case.

This is an appeal by the defendant against that part of the decision of district judge Ang Sin Teck giving judgment to the plaintiff in the sum of $15,580 with interest and costs. The plaintiff gave a respondent`s notice to contend that the decision should be affirmed on other grounds. The defendant also gave notice of appeal against the dismissal of its application for leave to amend its defence but this was abandoned at the hearing of this appeal. I allowed the appeal and dismissed the plaintiff`s claim.
On or about 2 October 1987, there was a leakage of water from the chilled water pipe of an airconditioning system and the plaintiff`s premises at 176 Orchard Road #04-01, Cold Storage Centrepoint were damaged. Cold Storage Centrepoint is a subdivided building to which the Land Titles (Strata) Act (Cap 158, 1988 Ed) applies. The plaintiff was then a subsidiary proprietor of a leasehold interest in respect of the premises which it occupied for the purpose of its business. The defendant is the management corporation for the building constituted by the plaintiff and other subsidiary proprietors under s 33 of the Act. The plaintiff claimed damages for negligence and further or alternatively for breach of duty under the Act. The claim for breach of statutory duty was dismissed. On the claim for negligence the learned district judge said he found the plaintiff had not proved its case but held that res ipsa loquitur applied and gave judgment for the plaintiff.
 Negligence
The plaintiff alleges that the leakage and the resulting damage were caused by the negligence of the defendant or its servants or agents. The particulars of negligence are:
 
 
(a) Failing to take all reasonable and effective measures whether by inspection, examination or otherwise, to ensure that there was or would be no risk of water ingress to the plaintiff`s premises through the burst water pipe or otherwise. 
 
(b) Failing reasonably to have foreseen the danger and risk from the water pipe bursting and that extensive damage could or likely to result therefrom (sic). 
 
(c) Failing to take reasonable and proper precautions to prevent the water pipe from bursting and thereby preventing the water ingress in the plaintiff`s premises. 
 
(d) The plaintiff would also rely on the `doctrine of res ipsa loquitur`.
  
 
 
Surprisingly there was little evidence of the chilled water pipe or of the airconditioning system of which the chilled water pipe was part. According to Chuah Lam Siang, the chilled water pipe is a metallic cylindrical pipe covered with insulation material carrying chilled water from the sixth level of the building to the fan coil units installed at the fourth level where the plaintiff`s premises are. Chuah is a civil engineer employed by the defendant`s managing agent as centre manager. The airconditioning system was maintained by the third party (which is not concerned with this appeal). The service and maintenance agreement with the third party is at TPB-7 and the `system` subject to the agreement is described in the list at TPB-10 which does not expressly include any chilled water pipe. Chuah said his employer was `Centrepoint Properties Ltd` but he was clearly mistaken as in the agreement and the correspondence the managing agent was `CS Properties Pte Ltd` and there was no mention of `Centrepoint Properties Ltd` in any document. (There was some confusion also over the identity of certain parties and their roles in the occurrence and the surrounding circumstances. The plaintiff acquired the premises from the transferror Cold Storage Enterprises Pte Ltd which is not the defendant or its managing agent although the surveyors appointed by the plaintiff`s insurers served it with notice of a claim; and the defendant at the commencement of the trial applied for leave to amend its defence on the wrong assumption that the transferror was the defendant; and the learned district judge refused leave also on the basis of the wrong assumption.) Teng Eng Teck, the service manager and a director of the third party, said that the insulation consists of approximately two inches of rock wool and finished with double sided aluminium foil. There were two fan coil units in the void between the false ceiling and the structural ceiling over the plaintiff`s premises. The section of the chilled water pipe which had a pin hole from which water leaked causing the damage complained of was in this void and it was changed soon after the occurrence of the incident and the system was repaired. The faulty section was taken away and was not available at the hearing. Teng attended to the repair. According to Chiu Lu Pao, a director of the plaintiff, it was the airconditioning maintenance people who took the pipe away.
The learned district judge found that the plaintiff had not proved its case on negligence. I have read his grounds of decision and the notes of the oral evidence and the documents admitted and I agree. As to para (a) of the particulars of negligence I am not sure what measures could be taken to eliminate the risk of `water ingress to the plaintiff`s premises through the burst water pipe` short of either sealing the plaintiff`s premises altogether or encasing the water pipe in an equally strong and durable sleeve or pipe, neither of which measures would be practical or reasonable. There was no evidence of any reasonable measures that could be taken. Paragraph (b) has to be considered with para (c). Even if it was the risk of the chilled water pipe bursting that was foreseeable, there was no evidence of failure to take any reasonable or proper precautions to prevent that happening. Teng, who had 20 years` experience at the time he gave evidence, said that it was not possible to detect the pin hole because of the insulation. To inspect the pipe, it would be necessary to remove all the insulation and drain off the water. This would involve shutting down the airconditioning system for the length of time needed to do all that and to re-do the insulation. There is also this evidence of Teng under cross-examination:
 
 
Q: Could there be any telltale signs before a leakage happens? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Let us say hole is very small, could water leak out to insulation and wet insulation? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: And obvious to naked eye? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Could not be possible that this hole through time becomes bigger and until a certain time the whole pipe break off to cause a gush of water? 
 
A: The pipe is under pressure, and if there is a small pinhole, the leak would be quite substantial.
  
 
 
Chuah gave this evidence:
 
 
Q: Could it be possible that there could be minor leaks, and give way? 
 
A: Not possible. System is under pressure, the leakage must be very sudden.
  
 
 
The gush of water would be as sudden as the onset of a pin hole and it would be quite unreasonable to remove the insulation for regular inspection even if the pin hole could be detected before the `quite substantial` escape of water. The defendant employed the third party to maintain the airconditioning system and Nalco South East Asia Pte Ltd to test the water in the chilled water pipe of the system at least once a month. This is Chuah`s evidence under cross-examination:
 
 
Q: The water treatment that was done to chilled water system was done by Nalco. Was it carried out before October 1987? 
 
A: If this is essential maintenance, since day one, we have engaged this kind of term contractor to carry out checks. 
 
Q: So it was? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Nalco was engaged by Centrepoint Property and not third party, ACBS? 
 
A: No. 
 
Q: Engaged by Centrepoint? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: As an additional precaution you said you have in-house maintenance team to check on pH level which Nalco got to do. Who are these in-house maintenance people? 
 
A: They are my supervisor and technicians. 
 
Q: They are not the third party, the ACBS? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Would you agree with me that the third party need not do anything to the chilled waterpipe during that period of contract, 1 January 1987 to end May 1988? 
 
A: Yes, just checking on the water system. The main purpose to detect whether there is any corrosion. 
 
Q: Where? 
 
A: In the system, the chilled water system. 
 
Q: So, how are they supposed to detect corrosion in the chilled water system? 
 
A: By checking the nitrite level. 
 
Q: What else? 
 
A: Of course, conduct pH test. 
 
Q: But then why should you engage Nalco to maintain the chilled water system, and nitrite and get your own men to check the nitrite if the third party were supposed to do that? 
 
A: Because the equipment that we have are less sophisticated. We have the equipment to check pH, a very basic test, whereas Nalco have more equipment to check on chemical proportion of the chilled water.
  
 
 
He was not cross-examined as to results of any test for the condition of the water conducted at any relevant time and there was no evidence of the results of any such test.
The learned district judge referred to the defendant`s engagement of Nalco to check the water and the evidence of Teng as to the probable causes of the pin hole in the chilled water pipe. He then said he found that the plaintiff had not proven, on balance of probabilities, the case on negligence. He would have found that para (c) of the particulars of negligence in the statement of claim had not been proved. On the evidence he was clearly justified in coming to that conclusion.
Before returning to the particulars of negligence, it is convenient that I now consider the alternative claim in breach of statutory duty. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of the statement of claim say:
 
 
(5) Further and or in the alternative, the defendants were at all material times charged with the duty under s 48 of the Land Titles Strata Act (Cap 158, 1988 Ed) to properly maintain and keep in a state of good service and repair the common property and any property vested in the defendants. The plaintiffs will refer to the Act for its full terms and effect at trial. 
 
(6) In breach of the duty in para 5 aforesaid, the defendants failed and or neglected to maintain the air conditioning unit within the plaintiffs` premises, thereby causing damages (sic) to the plaintiffs as particularized hereinafter.
  
 
 
Section 48 of the Act provides:
 
 
(1) A management corporation shall, for the purposes of the subdivided building concerned - 
 
... 
 
(b) properly maintain and keep it in a state of good and serviceable repair - 
 
(i) the common property; ...
  
 
 
By s 3 `common property` includes `central and appurtenant installations for services such as ... airconditioning`. No particulars of breaches are pleaded but, at the trial, counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the failure of the defendant to maintain and service the chilled water pipe constituted a breach of the 
 byelaws 
. Counsel for the defendant objected but the objection was overruled. In the event, the learned district judge held that he was bound by 
 Management Corp Strata Title No 586 v Menezes 
 and dismissed the claim for breach of statutory duty. It is clear that the pleaded case is breach of s 48 of the Act and not breach of the byelaws and the objection was properly taken but in the respondent`s notice no point is taken on the district judge`s ruling that he was bound by 
 Management Corp Strata Title No 586 v Menezes 
. Instead the point was taken that: 
 
The appellants were required to maintain the chiller pipes and if they had taken steps to maintain them, they would have discovered the pinhole and repaired it. They did not do so and they were negligent.
 
 
 
The plaintiff has not sought to establish breach of statutory duty and I did not hear submissions on 
 Management Corp Strata Title No 586 v Menezes 
 which in any case appears to me to have been decided on its own facts and in the then prevailing state of the Act which has since undergone substantial amendments and renumbering of material sections. The requirement to maintain the pipes has been resited in the area of negligence to which I now return.
Failure to maintain the pipes was not pleaded in negligence and there was no evidence as to what 
 maintenance 
 the pipes required. In any case, discovery of the pin hole and repairing it before a sudden gush of water would be inconsistent with the evidence.
In my judgment the learned district judge was right in dismissing the claim founded on negligence under paras 4(a), (b) and (c) of the statement of claim.
I turn now to the so-called doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. As Megaw LJ aptly describes it in 
 Lloyde v West Midlands Gas Board 
 at p 1246: 
 
I think it is no more than an exotic, though convenient, phrase to describe what is in essence no more than a common sense approach, not limited by technical rules, to the assessment of the effect of evidence in certain circumstances.
 
 
 
As is often the case, it has been pleaded as one of the particulars of negligence. Paragraphs 1 and 2 of the statement of claim allege that at all material times the plaintiff was the lessee and occupier of the premises and the defendant the management corporation for the building. These allegations are admitted in the defence. Paragraphs 3 and 4 allege:
 
 
(3) On or about 2 October 1987, at a time which the plaintiffs cannot precisely specify save that it was after office hours, a chilled water pipe in an airconditioning unit in the plaintiffs` premises burst, in consequence whereof the said premises became severely damaged by water which flowed therefrom. 
 
4 The said leakage and damage arising therefrom was caused by the negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents and has caused the plaintiffs damages as particularized hereinafter.
  
 
 
Particulars of negligence
... 
(d) The plaintiffs will further rely upon the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur.
 
 
 
The remaining paragraphs are not relevant to the claim in negligence but I observe that in para 6 where there is reference to the airconditioning unit it is said to be 
 within 
 the plaintiff`s premises just as in para 3 it is said to be 
 in 
 the plaintiff`s premises. The defence admits the leakage of water. It was not disputed that the water escaped from a pin hole in a section of the chilled water pipe which was in the void between the false ceiling and the structural ceiling over the plaintiff`s premises and the trial proceeded on that basis.
In 
 Bennett v Chemical Construction (GB) Ltd 
 a heavy electrical panel started to fall towards some workmen while it was being moved together with another panel by the defendant`s other workmen. The plaintiff attempted to arrest the fall and as he did so the second panel also fell forward and he was trapped under the combined weight of both panels and was injured. The plaintiff alleged negligence and breach of statutory duty and on negligence alleged that the defendant`s workmen had failed to observe that the two panels were tied together which caused them to fall when moved and secondly that the defendant`s workmen caused one or both panels to fall. Davies LJ said at pp 1575-1576: 
 
I have said that in my opinion it is not necessary to plead res ipsa loquitur. If the facts pleaded and the facts proved show that the cause of the accident was apparently and on its face due to some negligence, that is sufficient; and in my view the pleading in the present case does cover that case, for, by para 3(b) of the statement of claim, it is alleged that:
 
 
 
`the said accident was due to the negligence and/or breach of statutory duty of the defendants and/or their servants in that ... (b) the said workmen caused or permitted one or both panels to fall.`
 
 
 
In 
 Anchor Products Ltd v Hedges 
 a stack of boxes fell while being moved by the defendant`s servant and the plaintiff was injured when he sprang back to avoid being struck by them. The plaintiff alleged a number of particular acts of negligence and at the trial obtained leave to add an allegation that `the circumstances of the accident were such as to invoke the application of the doctrine res ipsa loquitur`. The plaintiff failed at the trial to establish the particular acts of negligence pleaded but the trial judge said `I think it more likely than not, that the cause of accident was some act of negligence on [the defendant`s] part` and gave him judgment. In the High Court Windeyer J said at p 497: 
 
But if a happening, unexplained, speaks for itself, why is its voice stilled because the plaintiff sought to explain it but failed to do so?
 
 
 
and Owen J said at p 503: 
 
In my opinion the rejection of the plaintiff`s explanation as to the reason why the boxes fell did not prevent the learned trial judge from concluding that the accident was of a kind which, in the ordinary course of events, would not have happened had due care been exercised by [the defendant] and from inferring from that state of affairs that he had been negligent.
 
 
 
The headnote expresses their opinion accurately and concisely. 
 
A plaintiff who tenders evidence directed to proving the defendant guilty of a particular act of negligence is not thereby precluded from relying upon the principle of res ipsa loquitur.
 
 
 
In 
 Ng Chun Pui & Ors v Lee Chuen Tat & Anor 
 a coach owned by the second defendant and driven by the first defendant along a dual carriageway travelling west suddenly crossed the central reservation or divider and collided with an east bound light bus on the other carriageway. A passenger in the bus was killed and the driver and three other passengers were injured. The plaintiffs were the personal representatives of the deceased and the driver and the passengers who were injured. At the trial the plaintiffs did not call oral evidence and relied on res ipsa loquitur. The defendants did call evidence. Their evidence was to the effect that a car had suddenly cut into the path of the coach and the first defendant reacted by braking and swerving a little to his right. The coach then skidded across to the other carriageway and collided with the bus. The trial judge said that because the plaintiffs had originally relied on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur the burden of disproving negligence remained upon the defendants and they had failed to discharge it. He gave judgment for the plaintiffs. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. In the Privy Council Lord Griffiths said at p 301: 
 
So in an appropriate case the plaintiff establishes a prima facie case by relying upon the fact of the accident. If the defendant adduces no evidence there is nothing to rebut the inference of negligence and the plaintiff will have proved his case. But if the defendant does adduce evidence that evidence must be evaluated to see if it is still reasonable to draw the inference of negligence from the mere fact of the accident.
 
 
 
and later at the same page: 
 
... it is the duty of the judge to examine all the evidence at the end of the case and decide whether on the facts he finds to have been proved and on the inferences he is prepared to draw he is satisfied that negligence has been established. In so far as resort is had to the burden of proof the burden remains at the end of the case as it was at the beginning upon the plaintiff to prove that his injury was caused by the negligence of the defendants.
 
 
 
See also 
 Teng Ah Kow & Anor v Ho Sek Chiu & Ors 
 where Karthigesu J (as he then was) referred to 
 Ng Chun Pui & Ors v Lee Chuen Tat & Anor 
.
I think it is convenient to summarize the principles from these authorities which are relevant in this appeal.
 
 
(a) It is not necessary to plead res ipsa loquitur if the facts pleaded and proved show that an accident was prima facie caused by some negligence on the part of the defendant. 
 
(b) A plaintiff who tenders evidence to prove the defendant guilty of a particular act of negligence is not thereby precluded from relying upon res ipsa loquitur. 
 
(c) It is the duty of the judge to examine all the evidence at the end of the case to decide whether negligence has been established. 
 
(d) The burden of proof remains at the end of the case as it was at the beginning upon the plaintiff to prove that his injury was caused by the negligence of the defendant.
  
 
 
I come now to the specific grounds in the petition of appeal. The defendant appeals against these findings of facts.
 
 
(1) 
 The plaintiff`s solicitors had written to the defendant for a joint survey 
  
 
 
The plaintiff`s solicitors` letter dated 6 February 1988 is at PB-29. It is addressed to Cold Storage Properties Pte Ltd and appears to have been sent by fax to 7323959. In the third party bundle of documents there are two letters from `CS Properties Pte Ltd` with the same fax number and a telex from `Joseph Tan, CS Properties`. They are described in the bundle as letters and telex from the defendant. Chuah in his evidence said that Joseph Tan was his predecessor. The defendant replied to the plaintiff`s solicitors` letter of 6 February 1988 by telex dated 10 February 1988 which says: 
 
We thank you for your fax ref SL/GBS/333/8712 dated 6 February 1988.
 
 
 
We have no objection to the joint survey (without obligation) as suggested by you. Kindly liaise with the undersigned for a convenient appointment.
Thank you.

Centrepoint Management
 
 
 
The learned district judge was entirely justified in finding this as a fact.
 
 
(2) (a) 
 The defendant had sole management and control of area of the airconditioning pipes above the plaintiff`s premises 
 
 
(b) 
 The area aforesaid was part of the common property 
 
 
(c) 
 By reason of s 48 of the LT(S)A the defendant had, factually, sole management and control of the aforesaid area 
  
 
 
The learned district judge referred to the `area of airconditioning pipes` at RA-28 and I was assured by counsel that they understood the `area` to mean the void between the false ceiling and the structural ceiling above the plaintiff`s premises although I doubt it. Over the next page, the learned district judge said he found that the defendant had sole management and control of that part of the airconditioning system which included the chilled water pipe that leaked.
Section 48(1) of the Act provides that a management corporation shall `control, manage and administer the common property for the benefit of all the subsidiary proprietors`. The chilled water pipe is part of the common property and the learned district judge would be justified to find that the defendant had management and control of the airconditioning pipes above the plaintiff`s premises but it is another thing to say that it did in fact have 
 sole 
 management 
 and control 
 of the pipes.
Common property in relation to the subdivided building means so much of the land for the time being not comprised in any lot shown on the strata title plan. See s 3 of the Act. No evidence was adduced as to whether the void between the false ceiling and the structural ceiling over the plaintiff`s premises was comprised in the plaintiff`s lot or any other lot. Certainly there was access to this void from the plaintiff`s premises. There was no evidence as to whether there was any other access but it would seem to be unlikely for security reasons. If `area of airconditioning pipes` meant the void then the finding is against such evidence as there is and cannot be supported.
The defendant submits that the learned district judge erred in law.
 
 
(1) 
 He drew an adverse inference against the defendant for disposal of the pipe when the pipe was not, and could not have been disposed of by the defendant 
  
 
 
Chiu said in examination-in-chief: 
 
On the morning of leak, the Centrepoint maintenance people came down. Later in the day the airconditioning maintenance people came down. I am not familiar with the airconditioning maintenance people.
 
 
 
A couple of days later, the leakage was rectified. I was present that day. They opened up the ceiling. I looked up and could see piping.
When they finally finished, I saw them taking the pipe and they assured me it wouldn`t leak. This was a pipe from the airconditioning.
When Chuah was cross-examined there was this question and answer:
 
 
Q: Your predecessor had arranged for joint-inspection of pipe after the incident and the letter appeared on p 30, PB. Later, your predecessor, Joseph Tan said he had no objection to joint-survey of it. Do you not agree that it could not be done because of throwing away of pipe by company? 
 
A: I am not aware of this because normal procedure is that if there is any replaced part we will dispose of it because we have limited place in the storeroom. Unless the tenant requires it. 
 
Q: Don`t you know that where insurance claim is filed, and despite that you threw away a part of pipe that would be of great help to my clients? 
 
A: As I said, unless there is a requirement we will not keep it. 
 
Q: Do you know why Joseph Tan threw away the pipe? 
 
A: No.
  
 
 
The questions were improper and ought not to have been allowed. In any case, Chuah`s answers were hypothetical as he had said he was not aware and he was employed by the defendant`s managing agent only after the material time. Teng said under cross-examination that he attended to the repair and he removed the section of the pipe with the pin hole in it. He was not asked and he did not say what he did with the section of the pipe that he removed.
The finding that the pipe was thrown away by the defendant was contrary to the evidence. It follows that any inference the learned district judge drew from that cannot stand. He was not justified in inferring that if the pipe had been produced the evidence would have been unfavourable to the defendant.
 
 
(2) 
 He failed and/or refused to draw an adverse inference against the plaintiff for not producing witnesses who investigated the leak after the incident, and their expert witness 
  
 
 
Mr Chan did not make any submissions on this.
Finally the defendant submits that the learned trial judge erred in fact and in law.
 
 
(1) 
 He concluded that the defendant had failed to rebut any inference of negligence on [its] part when the evidence was that the likely cause of the leak was a manufacturer`s defect 
  
 
 
Teng said that the chilled water pipes would have a life span of about eight to ten years. The building was completed in 1983 and so the pipes would be good until 1991. The incident occurred only four years later in October 1987. This is his evidence under cross-examination:
 
 
Q: From your 20 years` experience what would have caused such a pin hole? 
 
A: Two possible factors. One is corrosion, the other is manufacturer`s defect. 
 
Q: Would you not say that installation was sometime in 1983 when Centrepoint building was put up? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Did you not also say that the lifespan of pipe could be eight to twelve years? 
 
A: I said eight to ten years. 
 
Q: Eight to ten years from 1983 would carry you to 1991. Given the fact, is it likely to be due to manufacturer`s fault? 
 
A: I can`t say. 
 
Q: But given fact it can`t be due to corrosion? 
 
A: It is possible. 
 
Q: Assuming that it is caused by corrosion, how long would it take to corrode such a pipe to produce a pinhole? 
 
A: I would say four to five years. 
 
Q: So, in other words, the water content of chiller pipe would have to be acidic for four to five years before it would cause such a pinhole? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: Are there any ways in your trade to determine the acidity of water? 
 
A: That will have to be water treatment people. 
 
Q: Were you not consider that such water treatment are part and parcel of servicing maintenance? 
 
A: Air-conditioning do not do water treatment, because we do not know anything of chemicals.
  
 
 
There were two possible causes for the fault in the pipe and Teng was unable to say which was more likely. He went on to say he had not seen the hole itself in the pipe.
Testing the water is one way of detecting corrosion. There is no evidence of any other way to do so. Whether the fault in the pipe is due to manufacturer`s defect or to corrosion there is no reasonable ground for drawing an inference of negligence on the part of the defendant or anyone for whose act or omission the defendant can be liable. The learned district judge has not made any finding as to whether the occurrence of a pin hole in the chilled water pipe or more specifically in that section of the chilled water pipe above the plaintiff`s premises is reasonably forseeable. If it is reasonably forseeable then he should have gone on to consider whether the defendant had exercised all reasonable care in the circumstances. Here the evidence is that Nalco was engaged to test the water in the chilled water pipe at least once a month. The learned district judge accepted this. The defendant`s supervisor and technicians also tested the pH level, ie for acidity. Corrosion is a slow process and it would take four to five years to cause a pin hole to occur. There is no evidence of any circumstance which might or ought to have alerted the defendant to the danger of a pin hole occurring. I think the defendant had exercised all reasonable care in the circumstances. If an inference of negligence could reasonably be drawn on the case as pleaded and proved at the close of the plaintiff`s case it was no longer reasonable to do so after all the evidence had been adduced. There was no failure to take reasonable care to avoid the sudden occurrence of the fault in the pipe.
While this ground of appeal succeeds it is not quite right to say that the defendant had to rebut any inference of negligence. All the evidence at the end of the case must be examined and the burden of proof remains at the end as it was at the beginning upon the plaintiff to prove negligence. On the evidence manufacturer`s defect was one of two possible causes.
 
 
(2) 
 He held that res ipsa loquitur applied when: 
 
 
(a) 
 he had found that the plaintiff had not proven negligence 
  
 
 
Counsel for the defendant has taken me through the grounds of decision and I think it is clear that the learned district judge meant that negligence as pleaded in paras (a), (b) and (c) of the particulars of negligence had not been proved. Having found that the defendant was not guilty of any of the particular acts of negligence pleaded he was bound to consider whether the plaintiff succeeded on the principle of res ipsa loquitur upon which the plaintiff was entitled to rely.
 
 
(b) 
 the defendant did not have sole management and/or control of the area where the airconditioning pipes where (sic) located 
  
 
 
In 
 Scott v The London & St Katherine Docks Co 
 bags of sugar fell from a crane by which they were being moved and the plaintiff was injured. Erle CJ said at p 601: 
 
There must be reasonable evidence of negligence.
 
 
 
But where the thing is shewn to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.
In 
 Easson v London & North Eastern Railway Co 
 a four-year-old boy fell through a door in the corridor of a train he was travelling in. The door was later found open but there was no evidence as to how it became open. Goddard LJ said at p 424: 
 
In the present case it seems to me it is impossible to say that the doors of an express corridor train travelling from Edinburgh to London are continuously under the sole control of the railway company in the sense in which it is necessary that they should be for the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, or a doctrine analogous to it, to apply. Passengers are walking up and down the corridors during the journey and get in and out at stopping places.
 
 
 
Mr Chan submits that res ipsa loquitur did not apply since the defendant did not have sole management or control of the location of the pipes or the faulty section of the pipe. I have said that the defendant had management and control of the faulty section of the pipe in the sense that it is part of common property which the defendant had a duty under the Act to manage and control. This section of the pipe was so located that on the evidence access to it was through the plaintiff`s premises. No one could get to it without entering the plaintiff`s premises. No one could enter the void between the structural ceiling and the false ceiling without likewise entering the plaintiff`s premises. Quite clearly anyone perhaps not without the plaintiff`s knowledge or consent could have access to the faulty section of the pipe without the defendant`s knowledge. So the defendant did not have sole management and control of the faulty section of the pipe and of the place where it was located. But it does not follow that res ipsa loquitur cannot apply. It is a question of what inference may reasonably be drawn upon an examination of all the evidence. Referring to the cases where the door of a train comes open Goddard LJ said at p 423: 
 
None of the reported cases, however, really laid down any principle of law. They only show that in the circumstances of the case there was evidence on which the jury could find a verdict for the plaintiff.
 
 
 
Mr Cheah referred to 
 Henderson v Henry E Jenkins & Sons 
. The brakes of a lorry failed owing to the sudden escape of brake fluid from a hole in a pipe in the hydraulic braking system resulting from corrosion of the pipe. The trial judge found that the owners had taken proper care to maintain the lorry, that inspection of the pipes in situ was all that was required of them and that as the corrosion was at the back of the pipe they were not to blame for not seeing it. He found that the owners were not negligent. The Court of Appeal by a majority dismissed the appeal. The House of Lords by a majority of three to two allowed the appeal. Lord Reid said at p 291:
 If there were nothing in the evidence to indicate a probability that something unusual must have happened to this lorry to cause the very unusual type of brake failure which the learned trial judge has held in fact occurred here 
, then undoubtedly the respondents would have proved that they had exercised all proper care in this case. But if the evidence indicates a likelihood that something unusual has occurred to cause a breakdown, then I do not see how the owner can say that he has exercised all proper care unless he can prove that he neither knew nor ought to have known of any such occurrence. For if he did know of it he would have been bound to take adequate steps to prevent any resulting breakdown. [Emphasis added.]
There was something in the evidence. The leading expert called by the owners (the respondents) said that the pipe had been subjected to some unusual treatment from outside. Lord Donovan and Lord Pearson were of the same opinion. Viscount Dilhorne and Lord Guest did not think it was reasonable or practicable to lead evidence as to the history of the lorry. Viscount Dilhorne said at p 298: 
 
Nield J said the issue was whether the defect, and by that I think he meant the corrosion, was such as could have been discovered by reasonable care in accordance with the standards required at the time in 1963. I think that he stated the issue correctly.
 
 
 
In this case it is not known whether the fault in the pipe was due to corrosion or manufacturer`s defect. If it was corrosion there was no evidence that the pipe had been subjected to some unusual treatment. There was no evidence such as that the test results of the water carried in the pipe were in some respects unsatisfactory. The corrosion was not such as could have been discovered by the exercise of reasonable care. If it was manufacturer`s defect there was no evidence that the defendant ought to have known of it or that there was anything it could reasonably do or ought reasonably to have done. 
 Henderson v Henry E Jenkins & Sons 
 is in my opinion clearly distinguishable. It is not for the defendant to disprove negligence. It is also not for the defendant to furnish a reasonable explanation. The question is whether on the evidence at the end of the case, whether adduced by the defendant or the plaintiff or the third party does not matter, the court finds that negligence has been proved by the plaintiff.
For these reasons I allowed the appeal.
I also heard submissions on the quantum of damages. As to the piano that was damaged the learned district judge awarded the difference between the retail `list` price of $26,000 for an undamaged piano of the same make and model and the actual sale price of $14,500. It was a Steinway upright model Z-114. There was evidence that it was not reasonable or practical to repair it although there was no finding of fact as to this. Chiu said that model Z-114 was no longer in production. `It was around 1988`. When the damage occurred it would have been available. She also said the plaintiff was the sole agent for Steinway in Singapore. If it was unreasonable to repair it then the measure of damages is the cost of replacement since there was an available market. The plaintiff would have to give allowance for the salvage value of $14,500. The only evidence of the cost of replacement is that in 1986 selling a similar piano for $19,500 realized a `smaller profit`. I think $19,500 could be taken as the replacement cost in October 1987 and so the loss is $5,000. The cost of repairing the damaged false ceiling was $1,680. That was in November 1992, ie five years after it was damaged. In October 1987, the same person who undertook the repair quoted $1,295. Chiu`s explanation was that the plaintiff waited five years because the case was still going on and the learned district judge accepted it. Five years is far too long and $1,295 or $9,905 to do all the works in the 1987 quotation was not an amount that there is any evidence to suggest the plaintiff could not pay or that would cause any financial hardship to it. The difference is almost negligible but the correct measure of damages is the cost of replacement of $1,295 in 1987. I accordingly varied the damages in case it should be held that the plaintiff should succeed in its claim.

s 354 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
The appellant was charged in the subordinate courts with having, on 19 September 1993 at about 5pm, at Tanjong Rhu reclaimed land, used criminal force to outrage the modesty of one Lee Choon Nam (`the complainant`), by way of touching the complainant`s penis and thereby committing an offence punishable under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He pleaded guilty to the charge and, having been duly convicted, was sentenced to four months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. This appeal was brought against the sentence as being manifestly excessive.
The facts of the case were briefly as follows. The complainant was actually a special constable attached to Geylang Division Headquarters. On 19 September 1993, at about 4.40pm, he was one of the police officers who participated in what was termed an `anti-gay` operation at Tanjong Rhu reclaimed land. It appears that the operation was aimed at `flushing out` homosexuals who engaged in homosexual activity in that area. At about 5pm, the appellant approached the complainant and struck up a conversation with him. Shortly thereafter, they proceeded into some nearby bushes where the appellant placed his right hand on the complainant`s penis. The complainant identified himself at this juncture and promptly arrested the appellant.
The appellant (who appeared in person in the court below) stated in mitigation that he had merely been taking a stroll around Tanjong Rhu reclaimed land when the above incident took place. He asked the court to take into account as further mitigating factors the fact that he was working as a hawker to support a family of five and also the ill health of his father.
In meting out the sentence, the learned magistrate relied in the main on the oral judgment I rendered previously in 
 Chandresh Patel v PP. 
 This was a case in which the appellant, whilst a passenger on a Singapore Airlines flight, had used criminal force on a female passenger seated next to him, intending to outrage or knowing it likely that he would outrage her modesty by touching her vaginal area. Significant reliance was placed by the magistrate on a passage from the oral judgment, which was reproduced in his grounds of decision as follows: 
 
[T]he standard sentence where a victim`s private parts or sexual organs are intruded is now nine months` imprisonment and ... caning should additionally be imposed.
 
 
 
On appeal it was argued by counsel for the appellant that the above reliance on the principles set forth in 
 Chandresh Patel 
 was in fact misplaced, having regard to the crucial distinctions between the circumstances of that case and those occurring in the appellant`s case. In particular, counsel submitted that the above remarks quoted by the magistrate in his grounds, were directed mainly at the sort of situation encountered in 
 Chandresh Patel 
 itself, a case where a male accused violated the modesty of a slumbering woman without any prior advances or encouragement from her.
Having considered the above submissions as well as the arguments of the deputy public prosecutor, I agreed with counsel for the appellant that this was indeed a case to be distinguished from 
 Chandresh Patel 
. As pointed out by counsel, my observations on the appropriate sentences in cases concerning outrage of another`s modesty were addressed to the context of that case and also other cases bearing similar features. Indeed the reference to the above passage as quoted in the learned magistrate`s grounds of decision may (with respect) have been somewhat misleading. In the oral judgment I gave, that passage was in fact preceded by my examination of the facts of 
 Chandresh Patel 
, an exercise which led me to make the following comments: 
 
[T]his is not a case of someone who is guilty of a seemingly innocent act, like stroking a woman`s thigh on impulse, or making a naughty but harmless nudge. It is also not a case of someone who has had something to drink on the plane, and cannot resist pinching or smacking a passing woman passenger`s bottom, in which case a fine of $4,000 or $5,000 in today`s circumstances would probably be adequate punishment.
 
 
 
 
 
 In this case 
 
 the appellant went much further. For 
 this sort of offence 
 in Singapore, the standard sentence where a victim`s private parts or sexual organs are intruded is now nine months` imprisonment, and since early this month, caning should additionally be imposed. [Emphasis added.]
Certainly 
 Chandresh Patel 
 remains good law for cases bearing similar features, but the appellant`s case was not one which fell within this category. Unlike the appellant in 
 Chandresh Patel 
, the present appellant had not forced his attentions upon an unsuspecting and vulnerable victim of the fairer sex. The complainant in the present case was a young male police officer who had taken active part in a police operation expressly designed to catch out homosexuals engaged in homosexual activity in a secluded area. It would be rigidly dogmatic of a court, in passing sentence, to refuse consideration of these factors.
Indeed, I may add that I found it somewhat disquieting that an accused arrested as a result of such police operations should subsequently be charged with having outraged the modesty of the police officer he came into contact with. The facts of the present case, as narrated in the statement of facts, appear to be representative of what occurs in such operations. The accused, who is homosexual, meets another man in an area well known for being a homosexual haunt. He strikes up a conversation with this other man and, on finding him responding in a friendly fashion, assumes him to be a fellow homosexual. He then invites this other man to proceed to a more private spot, the intention being to engage in homosexual activity of some sort; and although this may not be explicitly articulated, it must be plain to both parties having regard to the circumstances of their interaction. It is at least arguable that as far as the accused can discern, there would appear to be little question of consent being forthcoming from this other man. Of course, the other man then turns out to be a police officer in disguise.
Consequently, although a technical offence under s 354 might have been committed, I am somewhat bemused that an accused caught in the manner described above should nevertheless be charged with the offence of outraging another`s modesty; and should, furthermore, be sentenced not just to imprisonment but also to caning. In the present case, of course, the appellant elected to plead guilty and so the above issues were not discussed. He chose solely to appeal against his sentence. I will only say, therefore, that having regard to the events leading to his committing the offence charged, a sentence of imprisonment and caning was quite unwarranted. Indeed, having regard to the reasons given above, and to the assortment of male inmates he will meet in prison, I am of the view that sentences of imprisonment are usually inappropriate for accused persons in similar cases.
Accordingly, I allowed the appeal and substituted a fine of $2,000 for the sentence of four months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.

The appellant, one Michael Peter Fay, pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to (inter alia) two charges of vandalism, which read as follows: 
 
DAC 15183/93
 
 
 
You, Michael Peter Fay, m/18 yrs
 
 
 
Fin No: F 1923331 Q
 
 
 
are charged that you, on or about 18 September 1993, between 1am and 8am, in front of No 15B Chatsworth Road, Singapore, together with Shiu Chi Ho, Stephen Freehill and Harun Sharudin bin Sufian Saufi, in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did commit an act of vandalism, to wit, by spraying paint from spray paint can on a motor vehicle bearing registration No SBN770M, in the possession of Mr Amarjeet Singh, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 3 of the Vandalism Act (Cap 341) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
DAC 15185/93
 
 
 
You, Michael Peter Fay, m/18 yrs
 
 
 
Fin: F 1923331 Q
 
 
 
are charged that you, between 17 September 1993 at about 7pm and 18 September 1993 at about 7am, at the multi-storey car park of Cairnhill Place, Cairnhill Road, Singapore, together with Harun Sharudin bin Sufian Saufi and Shiu Chi Ho, in furtherance of the common intention of you all, did commit an act of vandalism, to wit, by spraying paint from spray paint can, on motor car registration No SZA1078G, belonging to RMG Rent A Car Pte Ltd, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 3 of the Vandalism Act (Cap 341) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Following his guilty pleas, the appellant was convicted on (inter alia) the above two charges and sentenced to two months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane in respect of each of the two charges. In view of his guilty pleas, the appellant`s right of appeal was limited by s 244 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) to only the extent or legality of the sentences. The present appeal was, therefore, brought only against the sentences. As a preliminary, it will be useful to review the facts of the case.
 The facts
In pleading guilty to the two charges of vandalism in the court below, the appellant also admitted to the statement of facts tendered by the prosecution. In so far as the acts of vandalism alleged in the two charges were concerned, the statement of facts established that, on 18 September 1993, at about 1am, one Lokpal Singh Bhatia, son of one Amarjeet Singh, parked a motor car bearing registration number SBN770M in front of his residence at No 15B Chatsworth Road. The car was at the material time in the possession of Amarjeet Singh.
At about 8am on 18 September 1993, Amarjeet Singh drove the abovementioned car to his office. He did not notice that the car had been sprayed with red paint on the bonnet and along the length of the passenger`s side of the car. It was accepted in the court below that the paint was not present on the car when parked by Lokpal Singh Bhatia at about 1am on 18 September 1993. Some two hours later, Amarjeet Singh was informed of the vandalism of the car and at about 2.30pm he drove it to a respray shop in Bukit Merah. The spray paint was removed with thinner by one of the workers in the shop. The entire process took about 30 to 45 minutes.
A similar act of vandalism was also discovered on a car driven by one Peter P Kopyscianski on 18 September 1993. Kopyscianski had parked a motor car bearing registration number SZA1087G in the multi-storey car park at Cairnhill Place, Cairnhill Road at about 7pm on 17 September 1993. At about 7am on 18 September 1993, Kopyscianski returned to the car and observed that it had been sprayed with red paint, such paint not having been present when he parked the car the previous evening. The car was returned on the same day to RMG Rent A Car Pte Ltd from whom Kopyscianski had rented the car and the company removed the paint with the use of turpentine, polishing compound and car wax. The cost of repairs amounted to $150.
Investigations by the police led to the arrest of the appellant and several of his other friends on 6 October 1993. At the close of police investigations, a total of 53 charges was drawn up against the appellant. This comprised 45 counts of vandalism contrary to s 3 of the Vandalism Act, six counts of mischief contrary to s 427 of the Penal Code read with s 34 of the Penal Code, one count of dishonestly retaining stolen property contrary to s 411 of the Penal Code and one count of possessing dangerous fireworks contrary to s 3(1)(a) of the Dangerous Fireworks Act (Cap 72). Subsequently the prosecution proceeded with five charges. These were the two charges of vandalism with which we are concerned in this appeal, as well as the charge of dishonestly retaining stolen property and two charges of mischief. The appellant pleaded guilty to all the above charges and further consented to 20 other charges being taken into consideration by the district judge in the determination of his sentence. The prosecution then stood down the remaining 28 charges.
 The present appeal
On appeal before me counsel relied on two main grounds of appeal. The first was that, in construing the proviso contained in s 3(a) of the Vandalism Act, the learned district judge erred in deciding that paint per se was regarded as an indelible substance under the Vandalism Act: counsel contended that a proper construction of the proviso to s 3 of that Act demonstrated that Parliament had no intention of punishing with caning all acts of vandalism committed using paint. Counsel`s second argument was aimed at persuading this court that the appellant`s case was one suitable for probation and that the learned district judge should have so ordered.
 Whether all acts of vandalism committed using paint to be punished with caning
In considering counsel`s first argument, it is instructive at this juncture to lay out the pertinent statutory provisions in the case. Under s 2 of the Vandalism Act, an `act of vandalism` committed on private property is defined (inter alia) as follows:
 
 
(a) ... without the written consent of the owner or occupier in the case of private property - 
 
(i) writing, drawing, painting, marking or inscribing on any ... private property any word, slogan, caricature, drawing, mark, symbol or other thing.
  
 
 
An accused found guilty of an act of vandalism contrary to the Act is stated in s 3 to be liable to `a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years`. Subject to s 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code (which is not relevant in the case at hand), he `shall also ... be punished with caning with not less than 3 strokes and not more than 8 strokes`. An exception to the provision for caning is provided, however, in the proviso to s 3 which states: 
 
Provided that the punishment of caning shall not be imposed on a first conviction under this Act in the case of any act falling within -
 
 
 
 
(a) paragraph (a)(i) of the definition of `act of vandalism` in s 2, if the writing, drawing, mark or inscription is done with pencil, crayon, chalk or other delible substance or thing and not with paint, tar or other indelible substance or thing; or 
 
(b) paragraph (a)(ii) or (a)(iii) of that definition.
  
 
 
A direct reading of the above provision would seem to indicate plainly Parliament`s manifest intention to (inter alia) subject all acts of vandalism committed with paint to the penalty of caning. Mr Sherrard for the appellant argued however that there existed in fact more to the matter than met the eye. Counsel`s contention was that a scrutiny of the above proviso revealed an ambiguity because `paint` as enumerated in the proviso in reality constituted a broad category consisting of a myriad of varieties of paint. Thus paint could be delible or indelible depending on such diverse factors as the make of paint employed, the nature of the surface to which the paint is applied and so on. In counsel`s submission, the court in every case has to consider de novo whether the paint used in that case has been proved to be easily removable or not before deciding to inflict the punishment of caning, the onus of such proof being laid (according to counsel) on the prosecution.
Having considered the words of the proviso in the light of counsel`s submissions, I was unable to accept the construction counsel attempted to put upon the words `
 paint, tar or other indelible substance 
`. I could see no reason to deviate from the plain meaning of the words in the proviso. There is no evidence within the terms of the proviso or indeed anywhere else in the Vandalism Act of a Parliamentary intention to subject all acts of vandalism committed with paint to the sort of ad hoc test of indelibility which counsel suggested. `Paint` is specifically and explicitly mentioned in the proviso; and, as Lord Dunedin held in 
 Whiteman & Anor v Sadler 
, `
 (e)xpress enactment shuts the door to further implication 
`. The proviso is unambiguous in stipulating that an act of vandalism committed with paint, whether it be paint of one type or of another, attracts a mandatory minimum of three strokes of the cane. There appeared to me to be no cause to disagree with Lawton LJ`s observation in 
 McCormick v Horsepower Ltd 
 that `
 (t)he only safe and correct way of construing statutes is to apply the plain meaning of the words 
`. It was not shown to me in the course of the hearing that the plain meaning of the words used in the proviso would lead to absurdities or injustice of such proportion as to warrant a different construction. Conversely, to compel the courts to admit in every vandalism case involving paint, a plethora of evidence on the delibility or otherwise of the paint used in the offence, seemed to me to be throwing the floodgates open to endless and increasingly convoluted arguments about the exact scientific degree of ease with which any particular type of paint is removed: it is the sort of absurdity virtually guaranteed to thwart the legislative intent, as stated in the preamble, of providing for `
 exemplary punishment for acts of vandalism 
`.
 Whether a pre-sentence probation report should have been ordered
Counsel next submitted that the appellant`s case was one suitable for probation and that the district judge`s refusal to so order ran contrary to the legislative intent of the recent amendments to the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252), specifically the new proviso to s 5(1). This proviso stipulates that: 
 
[W]here a person is convicted of an offence for which a specified minimum sentence or mandatory minimum sentence of imprisonment or fine or caning is prescribed by law, the court may make a probation order if the person -
 
 
 
 
(a) has attained the age of 16 years but has not attained the age of 21 years at the time of his conviction; and 
 
(b) has not been previously convicted of any such offence referred to in this proviso and for this purpose s 11(1) shall not apply to any such previous conviction.
  
 
 
Interestingly enough, in arguing the suitability of the appellant for probation, counsel was concerned mainly to rely on the testimonials as to the appellant`s character supplied by such sources as the Singapore American School and the Kinski School which the appellant attended previously in the United States. There was a shying away from the psychiatric reports so heavily relied on in the court below and a criminal motion to adduce before this court further evidence as to the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (`ADHD`) allegedly suffered by the appellant was abandoned; rightly so, in my view. Indeed, counsel accepted the contradiction between the views of the appellant`s character expressed in the testimonials and the analysis of the appellant`s alleged ADHD condition given in the psychiatric reports; counsel said that it could be that what was observed in these psychiatric reports was the `
 immense anxiety and distress occasioned by (the appellant`s) predicament 
`.
Essentially therefore, the factors pointed out by counsel as those indicating the appellant`s suitability for probation were: his youth; his plea of guilt; the remorse he felt; his lack of antecedents; his agreement to co-operate with the police; and his family circumstances.
I do not doubt that the legislative intent behind the amendments to the Probation of Offenders Act was to promote the rehabilitation of young first-time offenders. However, as demonstrated by the wording of the above proviso, the legislature has entrusted to the courts the discretion to decide the suitability of such offenders for rehabilitation while weighing also in the balance the wider concerns of society. Indeed the delicate balancing of individual needs and community concerns is a crucial factor which, with respect, was not sufficiently highlighted. This court agrees that the administration of justice should be tempered with a keen regard for the needs of the individual as far as the ambit of our laws allows. At the same time, our judiciary must remain conscious of its responsibility to safeguard the interests of the law-abiding general public and to uniformly apply the law to all those who violate it.
Another related argument put forward (albeit briefly) was that the original legislative intent behind the provision for caning in s 3 of the Vandalism Act was directed at suppressing those violent political elements which existed in Singapore in the 1960s and which wreaked havoc throughout our city by, inter alia, inscribing anti-national slogans in public places, the implication being that all this was a far cry from the appellant`s conduct. In my opinion, however, it would be too simplistic to claim that s 3 of the Vandalism Act is aimed mainly at punishing riotous anti-national elements. That may have been one of the more urgent objectives at the time the Act was enacted in 1966 but a reading of the relevant Parliamentary Debates shows that the legislature was simultaneously concerned with containing anti-social acts of hooliganism.
Having regard to the above factors, I agreed with the district judge that the circumstances of the appellant`s case were not such as to warrant an order of probation. As I pointed out earlier, the appellant originally faced a total of 53 charges. He pleaded guilty to five charges and consented to 20 others being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing. Of the 20 charges taken into consideration, 16 of them were charges of vandalism committed with paint. Furthermore, all the acts of vandalism were committed relentlessly and wilfully over a period of 10 days, from 17 September to 26 September 1993, and amounted to a calculated course of criminal conduct. I was satisfied from my perusal of the district judge`s grounds of sentencing that, in passing sentence, he gave full consideration to all relevant mitigating factors, certainly all the factors listed out by counsel, including the appellant`s youth and his plea of guilt. I was further satisfied that, on the facts of the case and taking into account the need to secure the interests of the general public, he was fully justified in imposing a custodial sentence and the mandatory minimum of three strokes of the cane in respect of each charge of vandalism.
For the reasons given, I dismissed the appeal.

The appellant was charged with trafficking diamorphine (amended in the High Court by the trial judge to `trafficking by transporting`) under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`). He was convicted of the amended charge and was sentenced to suffer death. We dismissed his appeal against the conviction on 21 March 1994 without finding it necessary to hear the learned deputy public prosecutor. Our reasons follow.
The appellant was arrested on 3 June 1992 at Blk 119, Bukit Merah View, by two police officers, PC Koh Guang Peng (`PC Koh`) and PC Quek Suan (`PC Quek`), who were at that time patrolling the corridors of the block.
The two officers first saw the appellant on the 14th floor of the block when the appellant was outside a flat (`the flat`) padlocking the gate. He appeared surprised to see them and lowered his head and tried to walk past them quickly. They noticed that he was carrying a big red plastic bag.
The officers decided to check him and asked him for his particulars. The appellant took out his wallet and told them that he did not have his IC with him and that it was inside the flat. He turned around as though to return to the flat, but instead, he ran.
The officers gave chase and managed to grab hold of him twice but he pushed them away, and when he reached the end of the block on the 14th floor, he threw away the red plastic bag. This was followed by a pursuit which took place along the 13th, 12th, 11th and 10th floors and which finally ended on the 9th floor, where he was subdued and secured with handcuffs to the staircase railings.
According to the two policemen, the appellant had upset flower pots along the way and had thrown a flower pot or brandished a flower pot stand at them. The appellant on the other hand alleged that the two policemen had assaulted him from the rear when he was running and they had assaulted him further after he was secured with handcuffs to the staircase railings.
The two officers then checked his personal particulars and called for assistance. The appellant struggled to free himself from the handcuffs and told the officers that if they removed the handcuffs, he would jump down and commit suicide. When they ignored him, he bit his tongue with such force that the officers were not able to force open his jaws.
Eventually, three members of Task Force One arrived. They were Cpl Adnan bin Hashim, PC Chia Peng Hoe and PC Noor Hidayat bin Sukairi. They were briefed by PC Koh and PC Quek. After that, PC Quek, Cpl Adnan and PC Chia went down the block to look for the red plastic bag.
The red plastic bag was subsequently recovered on the grass verge by the block by PC Quek. A total of 40 sachets containing white powdery substance were found. On analysis at the department of scientific services, the sachets were found to contain not less than 35.63g of diamorphine.
Two statements were recorded from the appellant by the investigation officer Staff Sergeant V Kanasalingam. The first was a s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) cautioned statement recorded on 9 June and the second, a statement (`the investigation statement`) recorded on 10 June. The appellant accepted that he had made the statements but contended that they were not made voluntarily as they were tainted by inducements and promises of the staff sergeant.
The appellant, on the day of his arrest and in the days when he was in custody, underwent a series of medical examinations. As the physical and psychological well-being of the appellant was central to his defence and to his contentions that he did not make the two statements voluntarily, it is necessary to refer to the medical examinations.
On 3 June, the day of his arrest, he was examined by Dr Chua Tee Lian, who stated that the appellant`s vital signs were stable and his nervous system was intact. Dr Tee added that the appellant was conscious but was uncooperative and refused to open his eyes and mouth.
On 4 June, Dr Naranjan Singh examined the appellant and stated that he had mild asthma, and that he was displaying drug withdrawal symptoms. Dr Singh saw the appellant retching but did not consider the withdrawal symptoms severe enough to warrant rehabilitation.
On 5 June and 6 June, the appellant was again examined by Dr Singh. He found that the appellant`s condition had generally improved and there was no vomiting. His only complaint was the lack of appetite.
On 8 June, Dr Singh examined the appellant and found that there were no signs of withdrawal symptoms and there was no record of the appellant vomiting or retching.
Before and after the cautioned statement was recorded, the appellant was examined by Dr Lim Yong Hwa. Dr Lim testified that he had not particularly looked out for withdrawal symptoms but added that, from his own notes, he did not think that there were any withdrawal symptoms displayed by the appellant. Dr Lim also noted a compression of the median and radical nerves at the site of handcuff marks on the appellant`s wrists, which, in his view, was temporary. He, nevertheless, referred the appellant to the orthopaedic outpatient clinic at Changi Prison Hospital for review.
 Trial in the High Court
A voir dire was conducted to determine the admissibility of the two statements as there were allegations of assaults, deprivation of medical treatment and inducement with regard to the recording of the two statements. At the end of the voir dire, the learned trial judge ruled that the statements had been made voluntarily and admitted the statements in evidence.
In his s 122(6) statement, the appellant said `I do not wish to say anything`. In the investigation statement, he referred to the events leading up to his arrest.
Briefly, he said that, on 3 June, he was asked by one Ah Tee if he was prepared to deliver the drugs. He agreed and Ah Tee then handed him a plastic bag containing the 40 sachets. In return for having delivered the drugs, Ah Tee would give him two sachets. He was then instructed to transport the drugs to a bus stop in front of his mother`s flat at 8.15pm that night. He brought the drugs home at 3pm and placed them in a red plastic bag together with his clothing. He then smoked some drugs and went to bed. At 7pm he got up, dressed and had a meal. He then stepped out of the flat carrying the red plastic bag with the drugs and clothing when he was confronted by the two policemen who asked for his IC. He told them it was in his flat and said that he would show it to them. Instead, he turned and ran. The officers chased him. At the staircase landing of the 14th floor, he threw the plastic bag and ran downstairs until he was arrested at the 8th floor.
At the trial, the learned trial judge found that the appellant had been in possession of the drugs when he was arrested. Under s 17 of the Act, a rebuttable presumption arose from his possession of the drugs that he had been trafficking in the drugs. This was strengthened by the evidence that he was not merely in possession of the diamorphine but was transporting it.
The appellant`s main defence at trial was that the drugs were for his own consumption. He claimed to have been consuming heroin for the past 16 years and was consuming 15 straws a day for about a week before his arrest.
His evidence was that he had bought the 40 sachets of diamorphine for his own consumption because it was offered to him at the extraordinarily low price of $70 per sachet compared to the average price of $200. The appellant was unemployed but he said that he was able to pay $2,800 for the drugs because he had won money from an illegal lottery. The appellant admitted that he consumed a sachet in 2 to 3 days, hence, the 40 sachets would be sufficient to last him for 80 to 120 days.
The appellant claimed that after he had bought the drugs he went to his mother`s flat. He asserted that while he was unlocking the padlock, the two policemen approached him and that led to the chase, arrest and assaults. If accepted, this would have supported his defence of consumption and assisted him in rebutting the presumption of trafficking.
The learned trial judge did not believe the coincidence of the exceptional offer of drugs at such a low price and the illegal winnings, nor his explanation that he had such a large stock of diamorphine for his own consumption. Therefore, the learned trial judge found that the appellant had not rebutted the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Act on a balance of probabilities.
The main grounds of the appeal before us were that: 
 
 
(1) the learned trial judge had erred in fact and in law in holding that the s 122(6) statement and the investigation statement had been made by the appellant voluntarily; 
 
(2) the learned trial judge had erred in fact in finding that the appellant was leaving the flat and was walking towards PC Koh and PC Quek when they first saw him; 
 
(3) the learned trial judge had erred in fact and in law in his evaluation of the evidence of Associate Professor Edmund Lee (`Prof Lee`) from the National University of Singapore at the voir dire in relation to the withdrawal symptoms suffered by the appellant; and 
 
(4) the learned trial judge had erred in fact and in law in giving the evidence of Prof Lee the same consideration at both the voir dire and the trial when the purposes of his evidence were different for both stages.
  
 
 
We took into consideration the learned trial judge`s express findings that, even without the investigation statement, he would have found that there was sufficient evidence to convict the appellant. However, counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned trial judge had erred in admitting the statements as they had been tainted with inducement, threat and promise from the recording officer, Staff Sergeant Kanasalingam, and were obtained in oppressive circumstances.
At the voir dire, the appellant raised a number of allegations of threat, inducement and promise. Before us, the main contention submitted by counsel for the appellant was that the appellant was such a heavy user of drugs that the withdrawal from drugs after arrest affected his medical and psychological condition to the extent that the statements could not have been made voluntarily.
Expert evidence was adduced by the defence at the trial to show that the appellant was a heavy drug consumer who would suffer severe withdrawal symptoms when he was deprived of drugs. The expert called by the defence was Prof Lee. The most crucial fact relied by the defence at trial was the presence of morphine in the appellant`s urine during a test conducted on 9 June. His last intake of heroin would have had to be on 3 June. In Prof Lee`s written opinion, he stated that the presence of morphine in the appellant`s urine on 9 June was consistent with a consumption of 15 straws or half a sachet a day as claimed by the appellant. However, Prof Lee subsequently clarified that the presence of morphine in his urine was also consistent with a consumption of a sachet, a quarter sachet or even less than a quarter sachet. This observation clearly reduced the probative value of expert opinion in relation to the appellant`s defence.
In our view, the expert evidence given by Prof Lee was of no material assistance to the defence. In addition, the learned trial judge also referred to 
 The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics 
 in his judgment for confirmation that small amounts of morphine can be found in the urine several days after the last dose is consumed.
The thrust of the arguments of the appellant`s counsel on appeal was that the learned trial judge had erred in looking out only for evidence of withdrawal symptoms that were observable. Counsel for the appellant contended that the expert evidence adduced by the defence showed that the effects of withdrawal from drugs by a heavy user may not be readily observable and could still affect the drug user`s medical and psychological condition.
There may be the possibility that drug users who suffer from the effects of withdrawal from drugs might not display observable symptoms. However, the issue we were faced with was not merely whether the appellant was affected by the withdrawal from drugs. The issue was whether he had been affected to the extent that any statement given by him would not have been given by him voluntarily and was, therefore, unreliable.
With due respect to Prof Lee, his evidence fell far short of demonstrating how the effects of withdrawal from drugs affected the appellant`s medical and psychological condition. We would conceive that, in order for the effects of withdrawal from drugs to affect the drug user`s medical and psychological condition to render any statement he makes to be involuntary, he must be in a state of near delirium, that is to say, that his mind did not go with the statements he was making. Such, however, was not the case here. The learned trial judge, after reviewing the evidence of the medical witnesses called by the prosecution as well as the evidence of Prof Lee, concluded: 
 
... the accused suffered withdrawal symptoms in the period immediately following his arrest, but it was not (a) severe case and he recovered by the time he was discharged from the hospital on 8 June. I found that the accused was not suffering from any drug withdrawal symptoms which sapped his free will when he made his statements on 9 and 10 June.
 
 
 
In our judgment, this finding was fully supported by the evidence.
As for the allegations of inducement and promise, the learned trial judge said this in his grounds of judgment: 
 
I also considered the other allegations made by the accused, that the statement was not made by him, that he was promised that he would not be remanded at the lockup after making his statement, and that he can go to the remand prison and receive treatment, and counsel`s submissions on unfair treatment and oppression. It suffices for me to say that I did not accept these complaints and I was not persuaded that he was subjected to unfair or oppressive treatment.
 
 
 
Again, in our judgment, after reviewing all the evidence, this finding was fully justified.
We were, therefore, of the view that the learned trial judge had correctly allowed the investigation statement to be admitted in evidence.
During the trial, the prosecution`s version of the facts was that the appellant was first seen padlocking the door of the flat and that he had already turned from the door and had taken a few steps towards them before he was stopped by PC Koh and PC Quek. The defence`s version was, however, that the appellant had just reached his mother`s flat when he was confronted by the two officers.
The learned trial judge concluded that the evidence of the officers represented the true account of the events. This finding was material due to the nature of the appellant`s defence. If he had, indeed, been returning home after purchasing the drugs that were meant for his own consumption, that would be consistent with his defence that he was not trafficking the drugs. If, however, he had been leaving the flat with the drugs, that would be inconsistent with his defence that he was returning home after taking delivery of the drugs and it would also point towards the act of trafficking by transporting.
We agreed with the learned trial judge that there were other flaws in the appellant`s story. Firstly, the officers were standing between the lift on the 14th floor and the appellant as he was padlocking the door of the flat. According to the defence`s version of the facts, he had not used the direct and convenient route of taking the lift to the 14th floor and walking along the corridor to the flat. The appellant`s evidence was that he had taken the lift in the middle of the block to the tenth floor (even though the lift goes up to the 14th floor) and then walked along the tenth floor corridor to the staircase at the side of the block (although there was a staircase near the lift) and then climbed up the stairs to the 14th floor to the flat.
On appeal, counsel for the appellant endeavoured to explain the appellant`s indirect and inconvenient route to the flat on the 14th floor. He stated that at the time of his arrest, the appellant, who had been previously arrested and detained for drug consumption and was placed on a day release work scheme had absconded. Counsel then submitted that it was the very fact that he was an absconder coupled with the large quantity of drugs he was carrying that caused him to move about cautiously and that was why he had not taken the direct and convenient route to reach the flat. We did not find this explanation convincing.
However, during the trial, when the appellant was asked why he had not taken the direct route via the lift to the 14th floor, he could not offer any reasons. Moreover, the investigation statement made by the appellant corroborated the version of the facts as stated by the two officers. Hence, we found it difficult to accept the explanation made by the appellant`s counsel during the appeal, apart from it being unconvincing.
This finding of fact was reached by the learned trial judge after he had examined the evidence given by the appellant himself and the evidence of the two officers. He had clearly found the two officers` testimony to be more credible than that of the appellant. Hence we were of the view that the learned trial judge`s finding should not be disturbed.
Further, the learned trial judge rightly pointed out that the explanation for the appellant`s financial means to purchase the drugs were unsatisfactory. The appellant was unemployed at the time of his arrest and was depending on the generosity of his family and friends. The appellant stated that he had bought the huge amount of diamorphine (40 sachets) for his own consumption because it was offered to him at an extraordinarily low price of $70 per sachet instead of the average price of $200. That meant he would have had to pay $2,800 for the drugs. The appellant explained at trial that he had won money from an illegal lottery and was thus able to pay for the drugs.
We agreed with the learned trial judge that the coincidence of the exceptionally low offer of the drugs and his alleged winnings from the illegal lottery was difficult to accept. His explanation that the drugs were for his personal consumption, was, in our view, rightly rejected by the learned trial judge.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the learned trial judge had erred in fact and in law in giving the same consideration to the evidence of Prof Lee for both the voir dire and when the defence was called.
We accepted that the considerations at both stages were different. At the voir dire, the issue was whether the appellant`s will had been sapped as a result of his addiction and withdrawal from the drugs such that the statements were made involuntarily. At trial, the issue was whether he could rebut the presumption of trafficking by showing that he was such a heavy user of heroin and that he had the financial ability to purchase such a large quantity of diamorphine for his own consumption.
However, though the aims may have differed, the substance of Prof Lee`s expert evidence remained unchanged throughout. The underlying feature of Prof Lee`s evidence at both stages had always been the amount of drugs the appellant had been using during the period before his arrest.
Therefore, we were of the view that the learned trial judge had considered Prof Lee`s evidence adequately, both during the voir dire and the trial.
Counsel for the appellant also submitted that the learned trial judge had failed to give any consideration to the evidence of Prof Lee while reviewing the defence.
In his grounds of judgment, the learned trial judge stated: 
 
... Prof Edmund Lee, who gave evidence at the voir dire ,was recalled as a witness in the defence. He repeated his evidence given at the voir dire and expanded in his evidence on the accused`s consumption rate and the characteristics of drug withdrawal symptoms. I have touched on these parts of his evidence in reviewing the evidence in the voir dire and will not repeat them ...
 
 
 
It was clear to us that the learned trial judge had adequately dealt with this aspect of Prof Lee`s opinion when he reviewed the evidence given during the voir dire.
For the same reasons as previously stated, the substance of the evidence, both during the voir dire and at the trial, was extremely similar, and we were of the view that there was no real necessity for the learned trial judge to repeat the reasons for his findings at the trial stage.
Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal and affirmed the verdict and the sentence passed by the learned trial judge.

The appellant, Lu Lai Heng, was convicted and sentenced to suffer death on the amended charge of having in his possession 13 packets of substance containing not less than 524.82g of diamorphine without any authorization and, by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`), of having thereby trafficked, by offering to sell or distribute, the said drugs. This was an offence under s 5 and punishable under s 33 of the Act.
The appellant appealed against his conviction which we dismissed at the end of the hearing without finding it necessary to hear the learned deputy public prosecutor. We now give our reasons.
 The undisputed facts
Acting on information received that one Ah Heng residing at 8 Blanford Drive (`the house`) was trafficking in drugs, a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`the CNB`), the Police Tactical Team (`the PTT`) and the Criminal Investigation Department (`the CID`) raided the house on 21 December 1992 at about 4.45am. Upon a pre-arranged signal given by Assistant Superintendent of Police Stephen Koh (`ASP Koh`) from the PTT, the officers forced their way into the house. They rounded up the four occupants of the house and brought them to the hall. The four people arrested were the appellant, the appellant`s mother Mdm Teng Liang Eng (`Mdm Teng`), Lee Keng Pang (`Lee`) and Tung Peng Wah. Both Lee and Tung Peng Wah were tenants of Mdm Teng.
Subsequently, 13 packets of granular substance were recovered from the house. Three of these were discovered under a table in the appellant`s room at the front of the house (`the front room`) and the rest were found in a cupboard in Mdm Teng`s bedroom. The contents of the 13 packets were analyzed by the department of scientific services and found to contain in total not less than 524.82g of diamorphine. In the front room, an electronic weighing machine and a machine for the sealing of plastic bags were also found.
 The disputed facts
The disputed facts material to the appeal relate to some oral statements and a recorded statement made by the appellant after his arrest. The prosecution`s account of the facts was this. After the occupants of the house were brought into the hall, Assistant Superintendent Lim Chei Yoo (`ASP Lim`) of the CNB questioned Lee in Hokkien, believing him to be Ah Heng, as to the whereabouts of the drugs. The appellant was alone in the front room when the raid began. Inspector Gwee Hian Kwee (`Inspector Gwee`), a PTT officer, gained entry into the appellant`s room and arrested him. Inspector Gwee then brought the appellant out of his room into the hall. As he walked towards the hall with Inspector Gwee, the appellant answered ASP Lim`s question. He said he was Ah Heng, admitted that the drugs were with him and added that Lee was not involved in any way. ASP Lim then asked how much heroin the appellant had. He said he had half a pound of heroin. When asked to surrender the drugs, the appellant brought the officers to the front room and pointed with his chin to three plastic bags under a table in the room. The prosecution`s version of these matters was put forth by ASP Lim, ASP Koh, Inspector Gwee and Lee. The witnesses also testified that they did not see anyone assaulting the appellant in the hall. Neither did they see or hear anyone making or offering any threat, inducement or promise to the appellant.
At about 5.30am, ASP Lim approached the appellant in the front room and asked the appellant in Hokkien whether he had any more drugs to surrender to him. Two officers from the CID, Corporal Goh Cheng Huat (`Corporal Goh`) and Corporal Chua Siak Chew (`Corporal Chua`) were also in the front room. The appellant replied that he had another ten pounds of drugs kept in his mother`s room. The three officers then brought the appellant to Mdm Teng`s bedroom. The appellant used his head to indicate a cupboard in the bedroom and said that the drugs were inside the cupboard. ASP Lim opened the cupboard and found two plastic bags which contained ten packets of granular substance. The appellant told ASP Lim that there were ten pounds of drugs in total in the two plastic bags. Such was the evidence of ASP Lim, Corporal Goh and Corporal Chua. The officers also testified that no one offered any threat, inducement or promise to the appellant.
At 7.10am, ASP Lim recorded a statement from the appellant in the front room. ASP Lim said that there was no inducement, threat or promise made by him to the appellant before or during the recording of the statement. The appellant had elected to speak in English. After the statement was read back to the appellant by ASP Lim, it was affirmed to be true. The appellant declined to make any corrections or alterations to the statement and signed it. No one else was in the room when the statement was made and signed.
The admissibility of the oral statements and the recorded statement were challenged at trial. The appellant said that, after gaining entry into the front room, the officers forced him into a kneeling position. Then he was manhandled and dragged into the hall. When he told ASP Lim that he was Ah Heng, someone dragged him back into the front room and asked him where his revolver was. When he admitted that he had a revolver, he alleged that ASP Koh punched him in the face. He dodged but something grazed his cheek. The appellant alleged that, at 5.30am, ASP Lim told him that the drugs in Mdm Teng`s bedroom had been found. The appellant was then brought to Mdm Teng`s bedroom where the recovered drugs were shown to him. He denied that he told the officers about the ten packets of drugs and further denied that he showed them where the drugs were. He admitted that he said there were ten pounds of drugs in total but that he said this only after being shown the drugs. At that point of time, he was under the impression that his mother could be in trouble because the drugs were found in her room. When ASP Lim recorded the statement at 7.10am, the appellant was still worried that Mdm Teng could get into trouble. It was his understanding that ASP Lim would let his mother go free in a day or two if he admitted that he owned the drugs. As a result, he signed the statement.
 The trial judge`s ruling
At the conclusion of the voir dire, the trial judge, to quote his own words, was left in some doubt as to whether the appellant had been induced to give the recorded statement by the expectation held out to him that, by making the statement, he would get Mdm Teng out of trouble. Hence the recorded statement was not admitted into evidence. The oral statements, however, were admitted in evidence. The only allegation of any threat, inducement or promise made to the appellant was the blow by ASP Koh. However, the punch allegedly took place after the first oral reply to ASP Lim`s question in the hall, not before. Even then, the doctors who examined the appellant said that the bruise on the appellant`s cheek was unlikely to be a bruise from a punch. It was more consistent with a cut. Also, there were many corroborating witnesses for the prosecution who testified that the statements were voluntary. The trial judge found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the oral statements were made by the appellant voluntarily.
 The defence
The appellant admitted possession and ownership of the drugs found in the house. His defence was that the drugs were for his own consumption. The appellant had been an addict for more than a year. In the beginning, be bought packets of drugs weighing 7-8g each. Each packet would cost $200 to $300 and would last for two to three days. As his addiction became heavier, he needed more than one such packet per day. At the time of arrest, his rate of consumption was about two tablespoons of heroin per day. Each tablespoon would contain between 8-10g of the granular substance. He would smoke three to four times per day, each session lasting three to four hours. He would smoke only in his house and no where else.
The appellant did not have any gainful employment. By December 1992, he was spending at least $2,000 a week on drugs. The appellant said he supported his drug habit from money which he inherited from his late father. Further, he took money from Mdm Teng who had received a sum of money as compensation from the government when two of her shophouses were compulsorily acquired. He bought the ten pounds of drugs from a supplier for $15,000 about two to three months prior to his arrest. The drugs were intended for another customer who could not be found. The appellant bought the drugs instead because the price was a bargain. He saved $15,000 on the purchase. However, he denied he bought the drugs in order to resell them at a profit. About a month after the purchase, he bought another four pounds of drugs and paid a total sum of $11,600 for them.
The appellant said that he bought the sealing machine in mid-1992. The purpose of the machine was to properly seal the drugs supplied to him. This ensured that the drugs could be kept for prolonged use. The electronic weighing machine was used to check if the quantities of drugs supplied to him were correct. He denied that he used the equipment to weigh and package the drugs for resale or distribution.
 The prosecution`s rebuttal evidence
The prosecution led evidence to rebut the defence of consumption. ASP Lim gave evidence based on the seizure of drugs by the CNB in December 1992. He stated that the gross weight of heroin in a piece of 3cm straw was 0.14g and the average purity level was 12%. The net weight of pure heroin in each piece of straw would be 0.0172g. The gross weight of drugs found in the house was 5,116.69g which would be the equivalent of 36,548 pieces of straw. If the appellant had been consuming at the rate of 20g per day, he would have to consume 143 pieces of straw per day. At this rate, the appellant`s supply would last 256 days. If he was consuming at the rate of 15 pieces of straw per day, his supply would last 2,437 days.
Dr Leow Kee Fong (`Dr Leow`) who has five years` experience in the diagnosis and treatment of drug addicts in various drugs rehabilitation centres also gave evidence for the prosecution. He said drug withdrawal symptoms peak between 24 to 72 hours after the last intake of heroin by the addict. A heavy drug addict would consume more than five pieces of straw a day. He was not certain about the upper limit of the consumption of heavy drug addicts but stated it is usually about five to 15 pieces of straw. A person who consumed about 20 pieces of straw a day would experience severe withdrawal symptoms within 24 hours. In his opinion, if the appellant had consumed 15 pieces of straw on the day of his arrest, the appellant would exhibit severe withdrawal symptoms. The appellant, however, showed only moderate signs of withdrawal symptoms when he was examined on 22 December 1992 by Dr Leow. The appellant was examined daily thereafter by Dr Leow during his stay in the Changi Prison Hospital. However, the appellant`s condition did not get worse. Therefore, it was unlikely that the appellant was consuming about 140 pieces of straw a day prior to his arrest.
 The decision of the trial judge
The trial judge found that the appellant had not proved on a balance of probabilities that the drugs were for his own consumption. The trial judge did not believe that the appellant supported his drug habit by an inheritance from his father or that he took money from his mother. No documentary evidence was adduced to support his claim of the inheritance. Neither did Mdm Teng give evidence at trial on the financial matters of the family. Moreover, the appellant`s claim that he consumed at the high rate was rebutted by the prosecution evidence. The sheer quantity of drugs found in the house together with the items of equipment found in the front room led the trial judge to conclude that the appellant was untruthful in his claim that the drugs were for his own consumption. Hence the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption by virtue of s 17 of the Act that he was trafficking in the drugs. Accordingly, the trial judge convicted and sentenced the appellant to death.
 The appeal
Before us, counsel for the appellant contended that the statement recorded by ASP Lim at 7.10am on the day of the arrest should not have been admitted. Further, counsel submitted that, on the totality of the evidence, the appellant had proved on a balance of probabilities that the drugs were for his own consumption. Hence, he had successfully rebutted the statutory presumption that he was trafficking.
At the outset, it must be clarified that the written statement was not admitted by the trial judge. This was a misconceived submission. Counsel did not address us on the admissibility of the oral statements although it was raised in the petition of appeal. On reviewing the evidence on the voir dire, we were in agreement with the trial judge that there was no inducement, threat or promise made by anyone to the appellant. The oral statements were voluntary and admissible.
As for the second ground raised by counsel, we have considered the submissions of counsel and carefully reviewed the evidence at trial. We were of the view that the appellant had not proved on a balance of probabilities that the drugs were for his own consumption. He could not have consumed at the rate he claimed. Neither could he have afforded the drugs at the rate of addiction claimed. The large quantity of drugs found in the house and the equipment in his possession indicated that he was a trafficker. As such, we were in agreement with the trial judge that the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption by virtue of s 17 of the Act that he was trafficking in the drugs. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal.
Before concluding this judgment, we ought to observe that in our judgment the learned trial judge misdirected himself in excluding the written statement recorded by ASP Lim at 7.10am on the day of the arrest. The evidence was quite clear that ASP Lim or any other person in authority did not hold out to the appellant that his mother, Mdm Teng, would not be arrested or would be set free in a day or two if the appellant admitted that the drugs found in the cupboard in Mdm Teng`s room were in fact his. This was the appellant`s own perceived impression. That was what he said in evidence. Such a self-perceived inducement, in our judgment, could not in law amount to an inducement or promise within the meaning of s 24 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) (which incidentally is the same within the proviso to s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)). On the evidence, no such inducement or promise proceeded from ASP Lim or any other person in authority. In the words of Lord Salmon in 
 DPP v Ping Lin 
 at p 189 - this hope was self-generated; it certainly was not excited by anything said or done by ASP Lim or anyone else. Accordingly, the learned trial judge should not have excluded the written statement.

This was an appeal against a conviction of drug trafficking and a sentence of death under ss 5(a) and 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 The facts
On 1 June 1992, officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`), acting on information received at about 2pm, mounted a surveillance operation on Blk 102, Bukit Purmei Road, #07-68, Singapore (`the flat`). They scouted the vicinity for an observation post and found one at a construction site nearby. They left the vicinity at 2.40pm and returned to the CNB headquarters for further information to be received.
Acting on further information received, they returned to the vicinity at about 8.35pm on the same day and kept watch on the flat. At about 10.20pm, Narcotics Officer Quek Hock Hoe (`NO Quek`), who was stationed at the observation post keeping watch on the flat using binoculars, spotted a slim male Chinese wearing a white long-sleeved shirt entering the flat. NO Quek was unable to say, however, whether the male Chinese was carrying anything as his view was blocked by the parapet wall of the flat. Chief Narcotics Officer Lim Chei Yoo (`CNO Lim`) was immediately informed. At about 10.27pm, NO Quek spotted the same male Chinese leaving the flat and walking down the stairs leading to the lift. NO Chan, who was with NO Quek at the observation post, ran to inform CNO Lim, who was at a bus stop near Blk 102 (`the block`) along Kampung Bahru Road. CNO Lim then joined Narcotics Officer Yeoh Seng Hock (`NO Yeoh`) at the void deck of the block and both of them positioned themselves near the lifts.
Shortly after, one of the lifts opened. A slim male Chinese wearing a light-coloured long-sleeved shirt came out of the lift. He was carrying a blue canvas sling bag (`P55`). Upon seeing CNO Lim and NO Yeoh, he attempted to run. There was a violent struggle before he was, with the help of Senior Narcotics Officer Tan Boon Hock (`SNO Tan`) and another officer, put under arrest. He was later ascertained to be Lim Young Sien, the appellant. He was asked and replied that the bag belonged to him and that it contained money. In fact, it contained $40,000. CNO Lim then asked the appellant for the key to the flat. The appellant replied, `I don`t have. It`s in the house. There is another person in the house.`
While all this was taking place, NO Yeoh and other officers arrested a male Chinese who was sitting in a grey Honda Civic carrying a registration plate SBB1665R. His name was later ascertained to be Kek Bok Chye (`Kek`). The officers then brought him to the void deck near where the lifts were. With the exception of NO Yeoh and NO Jaafar bin Sohot, all the officers, Kek and the appellant went into the same lift and proceeded to the ninth floor. At the ninth floor lift landing, CNO Lim instructed the rest to remain there and guard the two arrested, while NO Riduan bin Mohd Noor, NO Iqbal bin Mohamed and himself would go to raid the flat. At the eighth floor landing, however, they saw a male Chinese walking up the stairs who appeared very nervous upon seeing the officers. He was also arrested and later ascertained to be one Koh Kim Seng (`Koh`). After bringing Koh up to the ninth floor lift landing, the three officers proceeded to the flat. The main door to the flat was locked while the hall windows were left open. After an unsuccessful attempt to kick open the door, NO Riduan used a broomstick to force open the latch. No one was then in the flat. Lying on the floor in the master bedroom were one red and black canvas sling bag (`P44`), one black clutch bag and some other items.
CNO Lim then asked NO Iqbal to have the three arrested persons brought to the flat. CNO Lim and SNO Tan questioned the appellant in Hokkien as to the contents of P44 and its weight. The appellant replied `
 pei hoon 
` (a colloquial term for heroin in Hokkien) and said that they weighed 14 pounds. The appellant told CNO Lim that the black clutch bag contained $4,000-$5,000. He also told CNO Lim that the keys to the flat were placed at the window grille. When asked how much money there was in the blue canvas sling back, ie P55, he replied `$40,000 and I got the 
 leow 
 from him`, pointing to Kek, who replied `say properly`, to which the appellant said `no choice, got it`. `
 Leow 
` means, literally, `ingredients` in Hokkien. In the context used, it meant the drugs that had fetched him the money contained in P55. The appellant also told CNO Lim that the flat was rented on his behalf by a friend from an Indian family. The owner, who was traced through a neighbour, arrived at 11.27pm and said that the flat had been rented by Koh. In one of the drawers, a spoon, four candles, a stack of plastic packets and an electronic weighing scale suitable for weighing small quantities of substance were found.
The 14 packets found inside P44 were sent to the department of scientific services (`DSS`) for analysis. They weighed 6,373g and, according to Dr Saw Chwee Guan from the DSS, contained diamorphine of not less than 804g. Kek, Koh and the appellant were then charged with having jointly trafficked in a controlled drug found in their possession at the flat. A statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) was recorded. In it, the appellant merely said, `I have nothing to say`. It was only admitted in evidence at the request of the defence.
In the course of investigation and before the appellant was charged, but after the s 122(6) statement had been recorded, several statements (`the long statement`) were taken under s 121(1) of the CPC from the appellant by NO Soh Koh Tong over a period between 5 June 1992 and 2 July 1992. As voluntariness was challenged, a trial within a trial was held. At the voir dire, the appellant contended that at about 2.30pm on 8 June 1992, just before the investigating officer was about to continue recording his statement, a senior officer of the CNB, one Teo Ho Peng, came to the room and said to the appellant, `... the statement should not be like that ... . If you maintain this, I want the three of you to die. I have so far hung 20-odd persons.` The learned trial judge held that it was for the prosecution to prove that the statement had been made voluntarily. As a result, a substantial part of the long statement was held inadmissible. That part of the long statement taken before the accused was threatened was, nevertheless, admitted, as the trial judge was satisfied that, in respect of it, there was no inducement, threat or promise. The admission of that part of the long statement was not challenged on appeal.
In the long statement, the appellant said that he was introduced to Kek by an addict friend. Through Kek he became acquainted with one Ipoh Chye who was a Malaysian from Perak. The appellant then asked Ipoh Chye to supply him with drugs. He got Koh to rent a flat for him because he did not want the authorities to know about his drug trafficking activities. He paid a downpayment of $700. The rent was also $700. On 1 June 1992, sometime between 9 and 10pm, Ipoh Chye called him and asked him to collect some drugs from a car parked at the Stadium Road car park. The appellant went there and collected a bag from the car boot which he took home in a taxi.
 At the trial
Before the learned trial judge, counsel for the appellant argued that the CPC gave no power to the police to record statements, whether written or oral, from accused persons. Section 121 of the CPC only conferred on the police the power to record statements from witnesses. Any statement taken from the appellant after he had been accused was therefore, so counsel argued, in breach of art 9(1) of the Constitution. After hearing counsel`s extensive submission, the trial judge held that the police had the power to record statements from the appellant under s 121(1) of the CPC. The appellant did not, however, appeal on this point. Neither, in our opinion, was it appealable. The trial judge rightly pointed out that the point had been decided by this court in 
 Mohamed Bachu Miah & Anor v PP 
.
At the close of the prosecution case, the learned trial judge was satisfied that the prosecution had established a prima facie case against the appellant and accordingly called for his defence. The appellant elected, as he was entitled to, to remain silent and called no other evidence. On the totality of the evidence before the court, the trial judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty as charged. Accordingly, the appellant was convicted and sentenced to suffer death.
 The appeal
Several points of appeal were raised before us by counsel for the appellant. First, it was argued that there was no evidence of one essential element of the charge, namely, the act of transporting. Secondly, the learned trial judge erred in his treatment of WNO Doreen Lek`s evidence. Thirdly, the trial judge failed to draw adverse inferences against the prosecution for not calling Kek and Koh as witnesses. As it is more logical to do so, we will consider the second issue first, before returning to deal with the first and third issues.
 WNO Doreen Lek`s evidence
In her statement tendered at the preliminary inquiry, WNO Lek testified that, at about 10.10pm that evening, while she was at the void deck of the block, she saw a male Chinese wearing a white shirt and dark pants alighting from a taxi and then walking up to the void deck. She stated that the bag carried by the male Chinese was blue in colour and identified P55 as the bag. Moreover, she identified the appellant as the male Chinese she had seen. At the trial, however, she told the court that she could not make any positive identification, either of the male Chinese or, more importantly, of the bag carried by him. At best, her testimony amounted to saying that she saw a male Chinese, who resembled the appellant, carrying a bag similar to P55.
The defence case was that WNO Lek`s sudden retreat from her statement at the preliminary inquiry was intended by the prosecution to minimize the damage done to the prosecution`s case by her identification of P55 as the bag that the male Chinese was carrying. If the appellant was going up to the flat at the material time with a blue bag P55, the appellant could not, so the defence argued, have been the person who carried up to the flat the red and black bag P44, which contained the drugs.
As to this argument, the learned trial judge said: 
 
There was some merit in counsel`s criticism of the evidence of WNO Doreen Lek although it must be noted that the bag referred to by counsel as a blue bag was in fact a dark blue/red bag.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant argued, inter alia, that the trial judge erred in not addressing the question whether WNO Lek`s evidence at the preliminary inquiry ought to have been admitted pursuant to s 147 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). Counsel for the respondent contended in her written skeletal arguments that s 147 could not apply because counsel for the appellant had not made any application before the trial judge for the purpose of invoking the section.
With respect to counsel, both arguments were, in their own ways, flawed. Section 147(3) provides: 
 
Where in any proceedings a previous inconsistent or contradictory statement made by a person called as a witness in those proceedings is proved by virtue of this section, that statement shall by virtue of this subsection be admissible as evidence of any fact stated therein of which direct oral evidence by him would be admissible.
 
 
 
The operation of s 147 was discussed in the oft-quoted case of 
 Muthusamy v PP 
, in which Taylor J said : 
 
On the request of either side, the court reads the former statement. If there is no serious discrepancy, the court so rules and no time is wasted. The first necessity is to read it with the confident expectation that it will be different from the evidence but looking judicially to see whether the difference really is so serious as to suggest that the witness is unreliable. Difference may be divided into four classes: (a) minor differences, not amounting to discrepancies; (b) apparent discrepancies; (c) serious discrepancies; (d) material contradictions.
 
 
 
In our judgment, the purpose of the time-honoured practice of applying for leave before counsel embarks on cross-examining a witness on previous inconsistent statements is to prevent precious judicial time from being wasted unnecessarily. For that purpose, it is important that the trial judge is satisfied that the previous statement is `inconsistent or contradictory` within the meaning of the section. Any failure to apply for leave to invoke the section is merely procedural. It does not in any way prevent a trial judge from invoking the section, provided that all the conditions are satisfied. In our judgment, it is only the last two classes of differences which are sufficient to invoke the operation of s 147.
In the present case, it was open to dispute whether the differences amounted to apparent or serious discrepancies. The colour of the bags, namely P44 and P55, was similar and could easily have caused confusion, especially if one only had a side view. Any discrepancy was, in a way, more apparent than real. Nevertheless, in view of the contrast between her positive identification at the preliminary inquiry and her ambivalence at the trial, it could be argued that such a retreat from her previous stance gave rise to a serious discrepancy. However, even assuming that it was so, the learned trial judge dealt with the problem impeccably. It was clear from his notes of evidence that he regarded WNO Lek`s evidence as being neither here nor there. It could not be disputed that her previous statements were in fact admitted in evidence, as defence counsel had painstakingly put them to her, without objection, during cross-examination. However, under s 147(5), the trial judge was fully entitled to conclude that, on the whole, her evidence, including her initial identification, was unreliable. It was, of course, not for us sitting in the Court of Appeal to interfere with the trial judge`s finding on the question of reliability of evidence, unless the trial judge had come to a conclusion wholly against the weight of the evidence. Be that as it may, we were in agreement with the trial judge`s rejection of WNO Lek`s evidence. It was clear to us that he had addressed his mind to the question. Having admitted WNO Lek`s previous statement, he was not obliged to accept as true what was contained in it. That admissibility and weight are two entirely distinct matters must be clearly borne in mind. In the premises, we were of the opinion that the trial judge`s treatment of WNO Lek`s evidence was beyond criticism.
 The element of transporting
Counsel for the appellant raised several points in his attempt to convince this court that the prosecution had failed to prove the element of transporting. First, he contended that no prosecution witness had been able to give evidence on transporting. Secondly, there was no admission of transporting in either the appellant`s oral statement or the long statement.
On the first point, counsel argued that NO Quek`s identification of the appellant was unreliable. At the material time, he was observing the flat through a pair of binoculars from an observation post situated at a construction site nearby. It was an observation made at night from a distance. Moreover, the appellant was of the same height and build as Koh, who was arrested at the eighth floor landing. In essence, the argument amounted to saying that the male Chinese seen entering the flat was not in fact the appellant and could, possibly, have been Koh. Moreover, even if the identification was correct, there was no evidence that the appellant carried P44, which contained the drugs, into the flat. In fact, NO Quek was unable to say whether the male Chinese seen entering the flat was in fact carrying anything as his view had been blocked by the parapet wall.
The fact that NO Quek could not see whether the appellant was carrying anything was a material one. Had the prosecution`s case rested entirely, or even substantially, on his evidence, there would have been a case for saying that there was no evidence that the appellant had, at the material time, transported the drugs in question. The prosecution`s case, however, rested mainly on the appellant`s long statement, the voluntariness of which, though challenged in the lower court, was not an issue in dispute in this appeal. Neither, in our judgment, could it have been successfully challenged. The only point raised by counsel for the appellant was that the long statement did not amount to a confession of the offence with which the appellant was being charged. In his long statement, recorded under s 121 of the CPC, the appellant said, inter alia, that: 
 
About two months after I absconded from the camp, I was introduced to Ah Chye by an addict friend in West Coast. My friend told me that Ah Chye had connection to obtain the heroin in large quantity. I spoke to Ah Chye and he replied that he would see about it. Ah Chye was subsequently arrested together with me on 1 June 1992 at Bukit Purmei.
 
 
 
About two weeks after the first introduction, I accidentally met Ah Chye and another male Chinese at Queensway Shopping Centre. He then introduced the male Chinese to me as Ipoh Chye, who is a Malaysian from Perak. Ipoh Chye is about the same age as me.
I then gave my pager number (No 2108541) to him after I told him that I needed supply of heroin.
Ipoh Chye then said that the price could be negotiable and I suggested to him that I would pay him the market price and he agreed. All the while, Ah Chye was with us and he also heard the negotiation. Ipoh Chye then said that, when the heroin arrived, he would contact me again and tell me what to do. Before we parted, I also gave my handphone number (No 7208646) to him.
...
On 1 June 1992 (Monday), sometime between 9pm and 10pm, Ipoh Chye called and told me to go to the car park at Stadium Road to collect the drug. I reached there at about 10pm and I saw the male Chinese in a car. He told me to collect from the boot. After collecting the drug, he drove off. I then took the bag home in a taxi.
Counsel for the appellant contended before us that the above statement did not in law constitute a confession. With respect to counsel, we found such an argument on the facts of the case to be totally unmeritorious. Section 17(2) of the Evidence Act provides: 
 
A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.
 
 
 
As we have said in the recent case of 
 Abdul Rashid v PP 
, the correct interpretation of s 17(2) is to be found in 
 Anandagoda v R 
, where the Privy Council dealt with the Ceylon Evidence Ordinance which is in pari materia with our s 17(2). As the Indian counterpart legislation does not bear the words `suggesting the inference that he committed the offence`, the Indian decisions are not helpful for our purposes. The relevant passage of Lord Guest`s judgment in 
 Anandagoda 
`s case4 reads as follows: 
 
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether, to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstances in which it was made, it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts ... The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt?
 
 
 
Rubin JC (as he then was), sitting as the trial judge in 
 Abdul Rashid 
, gave a lucid exposition of Lord Guest`s dicta in 
 Anandagoda 
`s case:4 
 
In my view, what s 17(2) purports to import and what 
 Anandagoda
 purports to signify is that a confession need not be an unqualified expression of guilt. Under our law, it is no more than a person`s statement admitting to his involvement in the offence charged in any manner or form. Be it minor or major, direct or indirect, explicit or inferential and whether in exculpation or in earnest, irrespective of its object, so long as the statement connects the accused in some way with the offence charged, it would be deemed to be a confession under s 17(2).
 
 
 
Of course, as we have said in 
 Abdul Rashid 
, it is not necessary for a statement to be of a plenary or unqualified nature for it to amount to a confession, so long as it connects the accused in some way with the offence.
Applying the test to the present case, we saw no reason why the appellant`s long statement did not, as counsel so strenuously contended, amount to a confession. At the time when the statement was recorded, the appellant knew that he was being charged for transporting the drugs in P44, between 9pm and 10.27pm on 1 June 1992, from Stadium Road car park to the flat. In his long statement, the appellant admitted to going to Stadium Road at the material time for the purpose of collecting `the drug`. He also admitted that he did in fact collect `the drug`. The only apparent discrepancy was that the drugs with which he was being charged had been found in the flat which was not his `home` whereas in the long statement the appellant apparently said `I then took the bag home in a taxi`. In this regard, counsel for the appellant also argued at length that the flat was not rented by the appellant. In our judgment, however, whether or not the flat had been rented by the appellant was immaterial. So far as the apparent discrepancy was concerned, we had no doubt whatsoever that, to the mind of a reasonable person reading it at the time and in the circumstances in which it was made, the statement, beyond suggesting the inference that he committed the offence, amounted to a confession that he committed the offence in question. With that alone, the appellant was rightly convicted.
The prosecution case was fortified by the fact that there was overwhelming circumstantial evidence pointing toward the appellant`s guilt. First, he knew the content of the bag P44 which contained the drugs and its weight. Secondly, he was caught leaving the flat, where the drugs were found, with another bag containing money amounting to $40,000. Thirdly, his answer `40,000 and I got the `leow` from him` suggested that he had received the money in P55 in consideration of the drugs found in the flat. All in all, the evidence, direct or circumstantial, was overwhelming. That being so, there remained only one issue, namely, that of the prosecution`s failure to call the other two persons who had been arrested together with the appellant. To that issue we will now turn.
 Failure to call Kek and Koh
In his oral judgment, the learned trial judge said, at p 33: 
 
It was apparent from the evidence led that these two persons were involved with the accused in the criminal conduct alleged against the accused. In fact, the two had originally been charged with the accused as jointly trafficking in the drugs in question. That being so, it is not surprising that they were not called as prosecution witnesses and I could see no reason why any adverse inference should be drawn.
 
 
 
Counsel argued that they were material witnesses who could give evidence on whether P44 was transported on the night of 1 June 1992 from Stadium Road car park to the flat. Caution was called for, so counsel argued, if they incriminated the appellant. Essentially, counsel contended that the trial judge should have drawn, under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act, an adverse inference against the prosecution for their failure to call Kek and Koh who would, if called, be unfavourable, so counsel argued, to the prosecution`s case. In order to support their argument, counsel for the appellant cited 
 Sia Soon Suan v PP 
, in which Ong Hock Thye Ag CJ said at p 118: 
 
The failure of the prosecution to call such an important witness inevitably reminds one of the presumption that ordinary prudence requires to be raised, especially as these articles categorically alleged to have been handed over by PW4 to ASP Zainal Abidin were shown by the prosecution evidence itself not to have been handed over to him.
 
 
 
In that case, the accused was charged for having, without lawful excuse, hand grenades and ammunition in a proclaimed security area in contravention of the Malaysian Internal Security Act 1960. However, the facts of the case must be clearly borne in mind. Possession of the articles was an essential element of the charge. The prosecution had no evidence, other than the evidence of one witness PW4, to prove possession. PW4 said in evidence that he handed the articles, which he allegedly seized from the accused, to one ASP Zainal Abidin. However, the latter, who was also called as a witness for the prosecution, contradicted PW4. He said that he was handed a large quantity of arms and ammunition which were already grouped and belonged not exclusively, if at all, to the accused. When the articles were allegedly being handed over by PW4 to ASP Abidin, one Lieutenant Badaruddin, a more senior officer, was, so PW4 testified, present. Lieutenant Badaruddin was not called. As a result, the prosecution had failed to prove an essential element of the charge. That this was so is apparent from what Ong Ag CJ said at p 118: 
 
Since the evidence of handing over to the police depended entirely on the evidence of PW4 alone, and he was contradicted by ASP Zainal Abidin, it can hardly be said that the prosecution had proved by evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the articles allegedly found on the person of the appellant were handed over to the police, and what is even more pertinent, that these very same articles were the very ones located in group 13. No one, it is to be remembered, had been able to say how they came to be in that group.
 
 
 
The facts in that case differed substantially from the facts in the present case in which all the essential elements of the charge were proved, as a result of which we were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. In fact, the witnesses had not been withheld from the defence, as the prosecution offered them to the defence at the close of the prosecution case. That was all that is required by law. In 
 Jazuli bin Mohsin v PP 
, Wan Yahya J, sitting in the High Court in Malacca, explained: 
 
In support of this contention, counsel cited 
 Abdullah Zawawi v PP
, in particular to the following passage of the judgment of Salleh Abas LP:
 
 
 
`The practice of making available a witness or witnesses from whom statements have been taken is to prevent the defence from commenting upon the honesty of the prosecution and thus invoking the often-quoted presumption of adverse inference under the s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950. But where the prosecution evidence falls short of proving a prima facie case at the end of its case, the right not to call such witness/witnesses and to make him/them available to the defence will be of no avail. If the doubt consists of the gap arising out of the matters adumbrated earlier, the prosecution must close this gap. It is not for the defence to call the offered witness/ witnesses to supplement the prosecution`s case.`
 
 
 
My reading of the above judgment is that the prosecution is not relieved of the adverse presumption under s 114(g) of the Evidence Act 1950 by merely making available a witness to the defence only in cases when they are unable to establish a prima facie case. In our present case, the accused is charged with soliciting gratification for himself and there is sufficient evidence on this adduced by the prosecution. The mere possibility of having another version of collective demand for the gratification does not ipso facto involve the rationale laid down in 
 Abdullah Zawawi
`s case.
 
 
 
In our judgment, the law is well settled that, in a criminal case, the prosecution has a discretion whether or not to call a particular witness, provided that there is no ulterior motive and the witness, who is available to, but not called by, the prosecution, is offered to the defence. There was, in the present case, no suggestion of any ulterior motive. In the premises, the trial judge was right in refusing to draw any adverse inference against the prosecution for their failure to call the two witnesses who had, rightly, been offered by the prosecution to the defence.
In our view, therefore, the appeal was without merit and accordingly we dismissed it.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiffs were in the business of a paper mill and are under receivership. Two other companies, City Carton Co Pte Ltd and Box Pak (S) Pte Ltd, were in the business of making paper cartons with the latter being a subsidiary of the former. The second and third defendants were, at all material times, directors of City Carton, Box Pak and the plaintiffs. The fourth defendant was the financial controller of City Carton and Box Pak from 1 June 1984 to March 1985 and of the plaintiffs from the same date to 31 January 1985.
City Carton and Box Pak had obtained supplies from Intraco Ltd, the first defendant herein, a public listed trading company. For some time prior to 24 May 1984 (the significance of this date will become apparent later), City Carton and Box Pak owed Intraco a total sum of $2,545,897. The relevant accounts of City Carton and Box Pak show that, at the time, they were in a very bad financial state, so much so that, of the total amount owing, Intraco had already written off $1.5m as irrecoverable.
It was clear that City Carton was insolvent (in the sense of total liabilities exceeding total assets) and was functioning solely on the continued support of its financiers and creditors and their willingness not to seek immediate repayment. Very much the same condition prevailed in Box Pak. There was only a very slim chance of unsecured creditors being paid. The evidence would appear to show that at the very most only 4-5% of the debts of unsecured creditors of these two companies could be repaid.
For about a year prior to 24 May 1984, Intraco had, together with the other creditors of City Carton, held discussions to see how City Carton, and its subsidiary Box Pak, could be rescued. Intraco`s objective in these efforts was no doubt to seek the recovery of the debts due to them from City Carton and Box Pak. Various proposals were considered to revive City Carton. At the end of 1983, one of the proposals discussed was the conversion of the debts owing by City Carton and Box Pak to Intraco into equity in those two companies (PB24-25). The conversion of other creditors` debts into equity was also explored (DB531-2 and 542-3). As late as 17 April 1984, the option contemplated was the conversion of Intraco`s receivables from City Carton into equity in that company (DB554-5).
Sometime very close to 24 May 1984, Multi-Pak became involved in the discussions. Multi-Pak was represented by the second and third defendants.
On 24 May 1984, an important event occurred, which gives rise to the present cause of action. Multi-Pak entered into an agreement with Intraco to take an assignment of the debts owing by City Carton and Box Pak to Intraco and, in consideration thereof, Multi-Pak agreed to pay Intraco the sum of $2,371,079.62 (`the assignment agreement`). It was a straight forward assignment with no other terms or conditions attached. At the time, neither City Carton nor Box Pak was in any way related to Multi-Pak. But Mr Peter Ng, the second defendant herein, was the managing director of all three companies, City Carton, Box Pak and Multi-Pak. The financial position of Multi-Pak was then rather precarious.
As this agreement is crucial to this action, and is only a very brief document, I shall set it out in full, excluding the long title: 
 
Whereas City Carton Co Pte Ltd and Box Pak (S) Pte Ltd (hereinafter called the debtors) are indebted to the vendor in the sum of $2,545,897.83 for goods sold and delivered and the vendor has agreed with the purchaser for the absolute sale of such debt for the price of $2,371,079.62
 
 
 
Now this agreement witnesseth that, in consideration of the sum of $2,371,079.62 paid by the purchaser, the vendor, as beneficial owner, hereby sells to the purchaser all the said debt of $2,545,897.83 due and owing to the vendor by the said debtor and all interest due and to become due for the same and the full benefit and advantage thereof to hold the same unto the purchaser absolutely.
In the agreement above, `the vendor` refers to Intraco and `the purchaser`, Multi-Pak.
On 6 June 1984, a cheque for $2,371,079.62 was issued by Multi-Pak to Intraco in payment of the assignment. The cheque was signed by the second and third defendants, as directors of Multi-Pak.
It would appear that, at about that period of time, Intraco began discussions with Multi-Pak with a view to becoming a shareholder in Multi-Pak. On 28 May 1984, a letter of confirmation of allocation of shares was issued by Multi-Pak to Intraco as follows: 
 
This serves to confirm that 20,000 shares of $100 each have been allocated to your company. These shares have been allocated at par and shall be payable fully in cash within one month from the date of allotment.
 
 
 
It was only on 11 June 1984 that Multi-Pak passed a resolution to allot the shares to Intraco. It would seem that, as of 14 June 1984, Intraco`s board had yet to formally approve the taking up of the $2m shares (PB67-68 and DB572-3). But, on 6 June 1982, Intraco`s company secretary wrote to Multi-Pak to confirm that its board had approved the subscription of the $2m shares in Multi-Pak. Having examined an internal memorandum from Mr Leslie Tan, a senior manager at Intraco, to the executive committee (PB60-61), it is clear to me that the approval then was that of the executive committee, not of the board. It is probable that the formal board approval came a little later. It was only on 20 June 1984 that Multi-Pak notified the Registry of Companies of the allotment to Intraco. What is significant is that, as of 24 May 1984, there was neither approval of the board nor of the executive committee of Intraco to take up the $2m shares in Multi-pak.
As part of the agreement to subscribe for the $2m shares in Multi-Pak, Intraco also agreed to lend $371,079.62 to Multi-Pak. Two cheques were accordingly issued by Intraco to Multi-Pak for the said two sums.
On 21 June 1984, a coordinated effort was made by both Multi-Pak and Intraco to deposit the said two cheques and the earlier cheque issued by Multi-Pak to Intraco for $2,371,079.62, into their respective accounts with the Standard Chartered Bank. The two cheques issued in favour of Multi-Pak were deposited first, followed immediately by the cheque issued in favour of Intraco for the assignment of the debts. All three cheques were banked in through the same teller. It is clear to me that this manner of banking in the cheques was made in an attempt to avoid any allegation that Intraco was using the money of Multi-Pak to buy its own shares, thus infringing s 76 of the Companies Act (Cap 185, 1970 Ed). I should mention here that an earlier attempt by the plaintiffs to include s 76 of the Companies Act as a ground to challenge the propriety of the payment of $2,371,079.62 to Intraco was unsuccessful as it was made after the limitation period had expired: see decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd v Intraco Ltd 
.
Sometime in January 1985, it soon became apparent that the concerted efforts to save Multi-Pak and City Carton could not succeed. It appears that the banks could not agree. On 24 January 1985, Arab Bank appointed three auditors from M/s Price Waterhouse as receivers and managers of Multi-Pak pursuant to a power under a debenture. Thereafter, all the efforts to revive Multi-Pak and City Carton came to a grinding halt.
By this action, the receivers on behalf of Multi-Pak are suing Intraco, the two former directors of Multi-Pak (the second and third defendants) and the financial controller of Multi-Pak (the fourth defendant) for the return of the $2,371.079.62 paid to Intraco. The action is based on three grounds, namely, constructive trust, conspiracy and resulting trust. I should mention, at this juncture, that the second to the fourth defendants are not parties to these proceeding because they have not been served with the papers. The present proceeding is entirely between Multi-Pak and Intraco.
 Constructive trust
The main ground advanced by the plaintiffs for the return of the money is based on constructive trust. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that, in law, where officers of a company, in breach of their fiduciary duties, misapply the funds of the company, and the funds then come into the hands of a stranger, as in this case Intraco, with actual or constructive knowledge of the misapplication or of the facts and circumstances underlying the transaction, the stranger becomes a constructive trustee for the misapplied funds. He further submitted that funds of a company are trust funds to be used by those in charge only for the purposes of the company.
In 
 Barnes v Addy 
, an attempt was made to make two solicitors of a trustee, who acted in breach of a trust, constructive trustees, without success. Lord Selborne LC laid down the principles on constructive trust as follows: 
 
Those who create a trust clothe the trustee with a legal power and control over the trust property, imposing on him a corresponding responsibility. That responsibility may no doubt be extended in equity to others who are not properly trustees, if they are found either making themselves trustees de son tort, or actually participating in any fraudulent conduct of the trustee to the injury of the cestui que trust. But, on the other hand, strangers are not to be made constructive trustees merely because they act as the agents of trustees in transactions within their legal powers, transactions, perhaps of which a court of equity may disapprove, unless those agents receive and become chargeable with some part of the trust property, or unless they assist with knowledge in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of the trustees.
 
 
 
In 
 Russel v Wakefield Waterworks Co 
, at p 479, Jessel MR said: 
 
In this court, the money of the company is a trust fund because it is applicable only to the special purposes of the company in the hands of the agents of the company, and it is in that sense a trust fund applicable by them to those special purposes; and a person taking it from them with notice that it is being applied to other purposes cannot in this court say that he is not a constructive trustee.
 
 
 
A recent case which adopted the principles enunciated in 
 Barnes v Addy 
 is 
 Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd (No 2) 
, where, under an arrangement, the money of one company was used by another company to buy the shares of the first mentioned company in breach of s 54 (the equivalent of our s 76) of the English Companies Act 1948. There, Buckley LJ declared (at p 405): 
 
If a stranger to a trust (a) receives and becomes chargeable with some part of the trust fund or (b) assists the trustees of a trust with knowledge of the facts in a dishonest design on the part of the trustees to misapply some part of a trust fund, he is liable as a constructive trustee (
 Barnes v Addy
, per Lord Selborne LC).
 
 
 
A limited company is, of course, not a trustee of its own funds; it is their beneficial owner; but, in consequence of the fiduciary character of their duties, the directors of a limited company are treated as if they were trustees of those funds of the company which are in their hands or under their control, and, if they misapply them, they commit a breach of trust (
 Re Lands Allotment Co 
, per Lindley and Kay LJJ). So, if the directors of a company, in breach of their fiduciary duties, misapply the funds of their company so that they come into the hands of some stranger to the trust who receives them with knowledge (actual or constructive) of the breach, he cannot conscientiously retain those funds against the company unless he has some better equity. He becomes a constructive trustee for the company of the misapplied funds.
I now turn to consider how these principles are to be applied to the facts of the present case. For a constructive trust to arise in the instant case, three things must be shown: (i) the payment of $2,371,079.62 by the directors of Multi-Pak to Intraco was in breach of trust (ii) that Intraco did receive the sum and (iii) that Intraco received the sum with actual or constructive knowledge of the breach.
In so far as the second element is concerned, it is not in dispute that Intraco did receive the $2,371,079.62. As for the third element, it is also not in dispute that if the payment of the $2,371,079.62 is shown to be in breach of trust by the directors of Multi-Pak, it cannot seriously be argued that Intraco did not know about it or could not have known about it. Intraco clearly knew the financial state of City Carton and Box Pak. Intraco negotiated with Multi-Pak on the assignment. Intraco had already written off $1.5m of the $2,545,897 as being bad debts. The only contentious issue that remains is the first: was there a breach of duty when the directors paid $2,371,079.62 for the assignment of what would appear to be bad debts amounting to $2,545,897?
Under s 157 of the Companies Act, a director is required at all times to act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of his duties. The word `honestly` does not mean that a director would only be in breach of duty if he had acted fraudulently. It means to act bona fide in the interests of the company: 
 Marchesi v Barnes & Keogh 
. In exercising their discretion, the directors should only act to promote or advance the interest of the company: see 
 Walker v Wimborne 
.
 What benefits for Multi-Pak?
So the question is: did the directors act in the interest of Multi-Pak when they decided to take the assignment of the debts of City Carton and Box Pak at the aforesaid price? The receivers` case is that there is no benefit at all for Multi-Pak to take an assignment of those bad debts. City Carton and Box Pak could never pay up those debts. Mr Nicky Tan Ng Kuang (PW3), a chartered accountant with M/s Price Waterhouse, having examined the accounts of City Carton and Box Pak, expressed the view that there was no commercial justification for Multi-Pak to purchase the debts of City Carton and Box Pak. He gave these reasons:
 
 
(a) assets of the companies are significantly less than their liabilities; 
 
(b) current assets are significantly less than current liabilities; 
 
(c) both companies have been making losses; 
 
(d) the whole paid-up share capital of these companies have been lost; 
 
(e) these companies had been selling their assets to fund their working capital requirements; and 
 
(f) the assets of these companies were all subjected to prior charges and there was no significant surplus for unsecured creditors.
  
 
 
I agree with Mr Tan that, on the face of it, there does not appear to be any commercial sense for Multi-Pak to have bought over the debts from Intraco when the debts were literally worthless.
Intraco`s case is that taking over the debts of City Carton and Box Pak did give Multi-Pak some benefits. In their amended further and better particulars, Intraco listed out the following as being `the benefits given and/or would be given` to Multi-Pak:
 
 
(a) the first defendant`s equity participation in the plaintiffs; 
 
(b) the first defendant`s management participation on the plaintiffs` board of directors; 
 
(c) facilitating the plaintiffs` obtaining of banking facilities; 
 
(d) new line of credit of $1m; 
 
(e) additional $1m credit line to be implemented but for the collapse of the plaintiffs; 
 
(f) the first defendant arranged to purchase raw materials (pulp and paper) with a view to eventual sale to the plaintiffs. The first defendant arranged to store the cargo in the first defendant`s warehouse free of storage charges for delivery to the plaintiffs as and when required; 
 
(g) all raw materials stored would be free of interest costs to the plaintiffs; 
 
(h) all deliveries of raw materials were intended to be made to the plaintiffs on a credit basis; 
 
(i) the first defendant agreed to purchase the whole of the plaintiffs` production regardless of market conditions, thus ensuring proper cash flow for the plaintiffs; 
 
(j) the first defendant arranged to create a market share for the plaintiffs` products by reducing the first defendant`s imports; 
 
(k) the first defendant arranged to provide the plaintiffs with expertise in marketing paper which the plaintiffs did not possess; and 
 
(l) the plaintiffs would be able to capture City Carton as a captive customer but for the collapse of the plaintiffs and City Carton.
  
 
 
It is of significance to note that Intraco have not identified the debts themselves as being a benefit. This certainly affirms what the plaintiffs have asserted: that the debts are of no value or of hardly any value.
From the list, it is quite clear that the most substantial benefits are those in items (a), (b) and (c). In his submission to me, counsel for Intraco conceded that there was no evidence to support benefits (d) to (h). The first three items of benefit effectively amount to this: that because Multi-Pak took an assignment of the debt, Intraco had agreed to invest $2m in Multi-Pak and be a shareholder; as a result, Multi-Pak was able to tap the management expertise of Intraco. Furthermore, because of the equity participation of Intraco in Multi-Pak, banks were more willing to extend credit facilities to Multi-Pak.
So it is crucial that we examine whether there is any evidence to link the assignment with Intraco`s equity participation in Multi-Pak. As I have indicated above, the assignment agreement itself provides no such link. It was not stated in the assignment agreement that, because of the agreement of Multi-Pak to take an assignment of the debts of City Carton and Box Pak, Intraco had agreed to inject $2m as equity into Multi-Pak. There was simply no connection between the two. Neither did Intraco call any evidence to support their contention that they injected $2m as equity into Multi-Pak because of the assignment.
Mr Jeffrey Heng (PW1), one of the receivers, said that when he spoke to Mr Leslie Tan about the $2,371,079.62 payment made by Multi-Pak to Intraco, Leslie Tan did not tell him much. Leslie Tan was the senior executive in Intraco who was in charge of this matter. He was the main person who dealt with the creditors and financiers of City Carton and Multi-Pak. He did not produce to Jeffrey Heng a copy of the assignment agreement when both copies were in fact held by Intraco. Neither did he say that the payment was linked to Intraco`s equity participation. I think this is significant. Another related aspect is this. On being appointed, the receivers instructed their solicitors to write to Intraco seeking information on the various payments. No explanation was offered that the equity participation was an integral part of the understanding relating to Multi-Pak taking an assignment of the debts.
Instead of producing evidence to show that the assignment was related to the equity participation, Intraco sought to rely on certain opinions expressed by Jeffrey Heng in court to these effects pursuant to cross-examination: `it was in the interest of Multi-Pak to see City Carton being viable`; `Multi-Pak wanted to take over City Carton as a subsidiary and that it would make a lot of commercial sense provided that City Carton would be viable`; `it fits with Multi-Pak`s commercial interest to have City Carton as its downstream`; `it would make a lot of commercial sense for Multi-Pak to have Intraco as a shareholder`; and `that it was in the interest of Multi-Pak to salvage City Carton`. These are expressions of opinion, not fact, and facts are what we should be looking for. Jeffrey Heng came into the picture long after the events. He has no knowledge of the facts.
It is not in dispute that Intraco did inject $2m as equity into Multi-Pak. But that alone is not enough. There must be evidence to show that Intraco`s injection of the $2m as equity into Multi-Pak was a consideration or part of the arrangement for Multi-Pak taking the assignment of the debts at a price of $2,371,079.62. Speculations or opinions of Jeffrey Heng, pursuant to questions put to him, are no substitute for real evidence, which is completely lacking. I am conscious that the main person in Intraco who dealt with Multi-Pak was Mr Leslie Tan, and he had passed away. But, from the records, there were also others who were involved. There was one Mrs Catherine Kuan, financial controller and company secretary of Intraco, who, from the records, was also closely involved in the whole matter. She was, together with Leslie Tan, made a director of Multi-Pak upon Intraco`s injection of $2m equity into Multi-Pak. Surely it cannot seriously be suggested that, in a public company, a decision of such a dimension rests on the shoulder of a single executive. A committee or a board of Intraco must have been involved in the whole venture. Indeed, the documents show that. There must be somebody from Intraco who could come forward to say what the whole arrangement was; what was paid for what. Only one witness was called by Intraco. He testified that he witnessed Leslie Tan`s signature. His evidence is of no help at all.
There is a further aspect in this matter which, on the face of it, does not support Intraco`s case; at least in the absence of explanation. The assignment agreement was entered into on 24 May 1984. The decision on Intraco`s part to inject $2m into Multi-Pak came later. As mentioned above, it was only on 11 June 1984 that Multi-Pak`s board passed a resolution to allot $2m of shares to Intraco. By 14 June 1984, the board of Intraco had yet to approve its equity participation in Multi-Pak. On 20 June 1984, Multi-Pak notified the Registrar of Companies that $2m shares had been issued to Intraco. In the normal course, one would expect that, if the equity participation constituted part of a larger arrangement, which included Multi-Pak taking an assignment of the debts of City Carton, all the necessary consents of the parties would have been obtained/given on or by the same date. If that did not happen and yet a party asserts that there was such an overall arrangement, the burden must surely be on that party by evidence to prove the link, to show what in fact happened and to explain why the documentation or formality proceeded on a slightly different footing.
Accordingly, I accept the submission of counsel for the plaintiffs that it is not proved that Intraco`s equity participation in Multi-Pak was a consideration for Multi-Pak accepting the assignment of City Carton`s debt to Intraco at a price of $2,371,079.62. It follows that benefit (a) has not been proved. For the same reasons, benefit (b) is also not proved: there is no evidence to show that because Multi-Pak had accepted the assignment of the debt at the price of $2,371,079.62, Intraco, in turn, agreed to participate on the board of directors of Multi-Pak. Similarly, for benefit (c). In fact, it seems to me clear that what are set out as benefits (b) and (c) are the things which would flow naturally from Intraco being a substantial shareholder [19%] of Multi-Pak.
Turning to benefits (i), (j) and (k), there is no evidence that such benefits were in fact conferred upon Multi-Pak by Intraco. Furthermore, even if there is such evidence, there is nothing to suggest that those benefits were part of the deal involving the assignment of the debts. Those benefits, if at all, and in all probabilities, arose from the fact that Intraco had decided to inject $2m into Multi-Pak and become a shareholder. Furthermore, or in the alternative, they came about because of the subsequent agency agreement entered into between Intraco and Multi-Pak.
It may be appropriate if I should, at this juncture, touch briefly on some aspects of the agency agreement. It is undated. There is no evidence before me to indicate when it was executed by the parties. I find, on a balance of probabilities, that it is more likely to be signed soon after Intraco had become a shareholder of Multi-Pak. Under the agency agreement, Intraco was given the exclusive right to market all Multi-Pak`s products in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. There was no fixed quantity which Intraco had to market. This was to be worked out between the parties quarterly. Neither were the prices agreed. The commission was fixed generally at 2%. Intraco agreed to provide a letter of credit at sight for all purchases from Multi-Pak. The agreement was for a period of one year with automatic renewal, subject to three months` notice by either party.
Under the agency agreement 90 days` credit was to be given. Intraco was to issue a letter of credit in respect of each purchase, but with regard to this, Intraco ran no great risk because Multi-Pak also agreed with Intraco that: 
 
in the event that [Intraco`s] customers have not paid, [Multi-Pak] shall arrange with the banks to extend the period of credit. If the banks are unable to extend the credit, or if, at the end of the extended period, the bill has still not been retired, Multi-Pak will arrange for repayment of the bank`s bills drawn against Intraco Ltd without recourse to them.
 
 
 
There appears to be a somewhat different arrangement for the sale of products of Multi-Pak through Intraco to City Carton. Not only did Intraco take no risk, namely, that if City Carton did not pay Intraco, Intraco need not pay Multi-Pak, what is also significant is that, irrespective of whether City Carton made payment for the products supplied, Intraco would be entitled to 1% commission from Multi-Pak.
What I can say is that there was nothing in the agency arrangements between Intraco and Multi-Pak which overly favoured Multi-Pak.
Turning to the last benefit (l), there is again no evidence to suggest that, but for the collapse of the rescue effort, a result of the assignment would be that Multi-Pak would capture City Carton as a captive customer. Apart from the fact that this is, at best, only a speculation, a question may be asked if it really was a benefit to Multi-Pak to have City Carton as a captive customer where, to all intents and purposes, City Carton was an insolvent company and was in no position to pay for the goods it would take. In my view, this alleged benefit begs the very question in this action.
 Payment by Multi-Pak of other debts of City Carton
A great deal of reliance was placed by Intraco on a transaction in August 1984 where the Bank of Montreal provided a term loan of $1.2m to Multi-Pak to enable the latter to provide a security in respect of City Carton`s debt to the Bank of Montreal. Counsel for Intraco contended that, as the receivers of Multi-Pak have not challenged the propriety of that transaction, it must be deemed to be in order, and, if that transaction is in order, there is hardly any basis to differentiate the present assignment from that arrangement.
I must point out that, on the facts, there is at least one major differentiating element in the Bank of Montreal arrangement. There, the offer of the $1.2m term loan was coupled with a further facility of $800,000 to be used by Multi-Pak for the following purposes:
 
 
(i) issuance of commercial sight letter of credit covering the importation of raw materials up to a limit; 
 
(ii) trust receipt financing and/or bill discounting up to a limit of $750,000; and 
 
(iii) overdraft up to a limit of $50,000;
  
 
 
subject to an overall limit of $800,000 at any one time.
Apart from this differentiating factor of an additional $800,000 facility, which was an integral part of the overall offer, Jeffrey Heng told this court that the receivers did seek advice from their solicitors on the propriety of the Bank of Montreal arrangement and it was only after obtaining solicitors` advice that they decided not to challenge that transaction. In any case, in my view, even if the decision not to pursue the Bank of Montreal on the $1.2m is not correct, that could not convert another transaction which is improper (like the present assignment from Intraco) into a proper transaction.
It is of interest to note that one of the terms of the offer by the Bank of Montreal was that Intraco must have `injected at least $2m in the form of equity` into Multi-Pak. I would expect to see some such express reference if the equity participation by Intraco in Multi-Pak formed a part of the arrangement whereby Multi-Pak would take the assignment of the debts from Intraco.
I ought to add that there is some evidence in the documents to show that, during July/August 1984, Multi-Pak had been paying off some other debts of City Carton. Without making a detailed study of the situation involved in each of the payments by Multi-Pak, I do not think it is possible to draw any conclusion. The general remark I made regarding the Bank of Montreal arrangement is equally applicable to these other payments.
I wish to re-emphasize that the assignment of the debts to Multi-Pak was a straightforward assignment with no other terms or conditions whatsoever. If it was in fact part of a wider arrangement, then it would be for Intraco to prove that. There is no evidence whatsoever of that. He who asserts must prove and cannot rely on conjecture.
In the premises, I hold that the directors of Multi-Pak had paid $2,371,079.62 to Intraco in return for worthless receivables. They had misapplied the assets of the company. By paying out the money to Intraco they had acted in breach of their fiduciary duties. I also hold that Intraco held the money as constructive trustees for they were fully aware of the circumstances surrounding the payment; they knew the financial state of City Carton. I think in law Intraco could be considered as having actual knowledge of the breach of fiduciary duties on the part of the directors of Multi-Pak, being aware of all the relevant facts. At the very least, there was clearly constructive knowledge.
 Conspiracy
In view of my decision above on the question of constructive trust, I think I need only deal very briefly with the second and third grounds of the plaintiffs` claim, namely, conspiracy and resulting trust.
Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted that the tort of conspiracy is constituted where it is shown that there has been a combination or agreement between two or more persons to effect an unlawful purpose resulting in damage to the plaintiffs. He said that, in the instant case, what happened was that Intraco, in combination with the directors of Multi-Pak, entered into the agreement for the assignment of the City Carton receivables with the unlawful purpose of making the directors breach their fiduciary duties as directors by not acting honestly and diligently in the discharge of their duties when they agreed to purchase worthless receivables for $2,371,079.62 from Intraco, causing damage or injury to Multi-Pak.
There are clearly two types of conspiracy. One is that which employs only lawful means but aims at an unlawful end, and the other, which employs unlawful means: see 
 Crofter Hand Woven Harris Tweed Co Ltd v Veitch 
, at pp 157-158, per Lord Wright; and 
 Rookes v Barnard 
, at p 397, per Lord Devlin. The former would only be actionable if it is shown that the predominant purpose of the conspirators is to injure the plaintiffs in his trade or business while, for the latter, no such predominant purpose need be shown. This distinction is reaffirmed by the House of Lords in 
 Lonrho plc v Fayed 
, where Lord Bridge, after reviewing the authorities, said (at pp 309-310): 
 
Where conspirators act with the predominant purpose of injuring the plaintiff and in fact inflict damage on him, but do nothing which would have been actionable if done by an individual acting alone, it is in the fact of their concerted action for that illegitimate purpose that the law, however anomalous it may now seem, finds a sufficient ground to condemn their action as illegal and tortious. But, when conspirators intentionally injure the plaintiff and use unlawful means to do so, it is no defence for them to show that their primary purpose was to further or protect their own interests; it is sufficient to make their action tortious that the means used were unlawful.
 
 
 
Lord Bridge clarified that the House did not intend, in 
 Lonrho plc v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd 
, to depart from the established rule and create a new principle that a plaintiff, seeking to establish the tort of conspiracy to injure, must in every case prove that the intention to injure him was the predominant purpose of the defendant, whether the means used were lawful or unlawful.
In the present case, in order to succeed in conspiracy, it must be shown that there was a conspiracy to do an unlawful act which caused damage to the plaintiffs. On the facts as discussed before, I am of the view that a case has been made out. Intraco and the two directors were working very closely to effect the assignment. Intraco knew the full facts. If, as I hold it is, that the directors had acted in breach of their fiduciary duties when they agreed with Intraco to take an assignment of the receivables, it seems to me to follow that Intraco and the directors had acted in concert to do an unlawful act: to cause a breach of s 157(1) of the Act, which is an offence under s 157(3). This will be the second type of conspiracy mentioned above and there is no need for the plaintiffs to show that the predominant purpose of the conspiracy was to injure the plaintiffs, so long as injury had in fact been caused.
The fact that Intraco might not have known that the directors of Multi-Pak would be acting in breach of s 157(1) is beside the point so long as Intraco were aware of all the relevant facts. As Buckley LJ said in 
 Belmont Finance (No 2) 
, at pp 404-405: 
 
In my judgment, the alleged conspiracy is established in respect of these three defendants, and they are not exempt from liability on account of counsel`s opinion or because they may have believed in good faith that the transaction did not transgress s 54. If all the facts which make the transaction unlawful were known to the parties, as I think they were, ignorance of the law will not excuse them: see 
 Churchill v Walton
. That case was one of criminal conspiracy but it seems to me that precisely similar principles must apply to a conspiracy for which a civil remedy is sought. Nor, in my opinion, can the fact that their ignorance of, or failure to appreciate, the unlawful nature of the transaction was due to the unfortunate fact that they were, as I think, erroneously advised excuse them.
 
 
 
 
 Resulting trust
 
I turn now to the point relating to resulting trust. The plaintiffs aver that the assignment agreement of 24 May 1984 did not exist `in or about May-June 1984 and was executed by the second defendant purportedly on behalf of the plaintiffs and by one Leslie Tan on behalf of Intraco subsequent to the issue of the writ herein,` and thus claim that the sum of $2,371,079.62 is repayable by Intraco to the plaintiffs as there is a resulting trust on the ground that it is money lent by the plaintiffs to Intraco or money held by Intraco for failure of consideration. The writ herein was issued on 24 July 1985.
There is no direct evidence as to the date on which the assignment agreement was executed by the parties. One Mr Tang Kum Hoong, an assistant manager in Intraco at the relevant time, said that he witnessed the signature of Leslie Tan to the assignment agreement though he could not recall when the date was. At the time, the directors of Multi-Pak had not signed the document yet. While he ventured to say that he witnessed Leslie Tan`s signature before the collapse of Multi-Pak, it seems to me that that was only speculative as he did not read the document and would not know to what it related.
But it is quite clear to me that, at the time the receivers were appointed, the debts owing by City Carton and Box Pak to Intraco had already been assigned to Multi-Pak. The records at Multi-Pak show that. On 4 February 1985, the receivers made demands on City Carton which included the debts assigned. The amount claimed was as at 31 December 1984. In the statement of affairs of City Carton (PB222) signed by the second defendant, it was stated that City Carton owed Multi-Pak $6,013,323, which included the assigned debts. A notice of assignment was given by Intraco to City Carton on 10 July 1984. In his evidence before me, Jeffrey Heng, having examined the records that were before him, said, `I would not dispute that Multi-Pak had assumed the debts of City Carton to Intraco.`
Taking all the foregoing into consideration, I find it clear that an assignment of the debts was effected before 31 December 1984. I would be inclined to think that the assignment agreement was probably executed on or about 24 May 1984, and, in any case, certainly well before 31 December 1984. So long as the assignment was effected at any time before 31 December 1984, or indeed before the collapse of Multi-Pak, there is no basis to allege that there is a resulting trust on the ground that it was a loan or that there was a failure of consideration. Of course, I would agree that it is strange that both copies of the assignment agreement should be in the possession of Intraco and both were unstamped. I can foresee a number of possible explanations for that but I do not think it would serve any useful purpose in going into that.
 Directors not being parties hereto
Counsel for Intraco submitted that, in view of the fact that the second and the third defendants are not parties to these proceedings, this court should not make any determination which would state that they were involved in the improper application of funds of Multi-Pak in breach of s 157(1) of the Act. Counsel noted that the writ was initially issued only against Intraco, and, later, the plaintiffs amended it to include the second to fourth defendants because they felt it was proper to do so. He submitted that this court has `no jurisdiction or power` to make a finding of breach of trust or conspiracy against the second and third defendants when they are not before the court. Counsel relied on the case 
 Kassim bin Adam & Anor v GE Bandukwala & Anor 
 in support of his contention.
It seems to me that 
 Kassim bin Adam 
11 is distinguishable. There, the plaintiffs sought (i) a declaration against the first defendant (who was abroad and was never served) that he, having abandoned the use of a rent-controlled premises, was no longer the statutory tenant and (ii) an order for the recovery of possession of the premises. The plaintiffs also sought to evict the second defendant who claimed to be in occupation of the premises as the licensee of the first defendant. The court held that, unless and until the first defendant was properly before the court, it could not adjudicate on whether he had forfeited his status as statutory tenant by cessor of possession or occupation. The court also held that it had no jurisdiction to make an order for recovery of possession against the second defendant, who claimed to be in possession as the licensee of the first defendant unless the first defendant was properly before the court and an order was made against him as well.
I am of the view that 
 Kassim bin Adam 
11 is a different sort of a case from the present. The plaintiffs here are not seeking a judgment against the second or third defendants. They are relying on the actions and conduct of the first, second and third defendants in seeking relief against the first defendant, Intraco. My judgment herein will only bind the plaintiffs and the first defendant. The plaintiffs cannot use it to enforce against the second or third defendant.
 Counterclaim
Finally, there is the counterclaim of $371,079.62 being the amount lent by Intraco to Multi-Pak. That this amount was paid and received by Multi-Pak is not in dispute. The books of Multi-Pak (PB123 and 125B) show that it was an advance from Intraco. Counsel for the plaintiffs could not and did not seriously contest that this sum should be repaid.
 Judgment
In the result, there shall be judgment for the plaintiffs against Intraco for the sum of $2,371,079.62. There shall also be judgment on the counterclaim of Intraco for $371,079.62. Interest shall be payable at 6% from 21 June 1984 on the net sum of $2m, being the difference between the two judgment sums. On the question of costs, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I rule that the plaintiffs shall be entitled to 90% of the costs of this action.

The respondent was charged with the murder of one Liang Shan Shan @ Leong Shan Shan (`the deceased`) as follows: 
 
Charge
 
 
 
That you, Oh Laye Koh, on or about 2 October 1989, between 1.05pm and 4pm, at a vacant land off Yishun Ave 2, Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Liang Shan Shan @ Leong Shan Shan, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 The facts
 
The respondent was a school bus driver who drove the deceased to and from school. On the morning of 2 October 1989, the deceased left for school in the respondent`s bus. When she failed to return home that afternoon, her mother telephoned the respondent`s home at about 3.30pm. The respondent was not in. At about 4.10pm, the respondent returned the call. He told the deceased`s mother that he had not picked up the deceased from school. He said that she was not there when he passed by her school.
On the morning of 14 October 1989, a highly decomposed body was found at a vacant plot of land off Yishun Ave 2. The body was positively identified to be that of the deceased. Due to the advanced stage of decomposition, the cause of death could not be determined exactly.
A few days after the deceased failed to return home (prior to her body being found), her father had gone to meet the respondent. At the father`s request, the respondent ran the route he took on 2 October 1989, stopping his bus near the rear gate of the school which the deceased attended. The respondent told the father that, on the day in question, he saw two of the deceased`s schoolmates crossing the road. Thinking that the deceased had already left, he made a U-turn and returned to his usual parking place. The respondent then brought the deceased`s father to a workshop at Yio Chu Kang, where he said he had gone to fix his bus brakes at between 3pm and 4pm on 2 October 1989.
It was, however, revealed during the course of the trial that the respondent had got his brakes fixed on the 
 morning 
 of 2 October 1989. He had in fact asked the workshop mechanic to lie to the deceased`s father that he (the respondent) had been at the workshop on 2 October 1989 between 1pm and 4pm. It was also revealed that the respondent had frequently teased the deceased and that the deceased had found him disgusting. The deceased had also been seen boarding a school bus resembling that of the respondent`s after school dismissed on 2 October 1989. On 16 October 1989, the respondent had led a police party to the vacant lot at Yishun Ave 2. He had pointed out the place where the deceased`s body had been found. He had also led the police to the spot where the deceased`s school books were found. The respondent was subsequently arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased.
At the trial, the prosecution sought to introduce in evidence three statements which the respondent had made to the police. A voir dire was conducted to assess whether the statements had been voluntarily made. At the conclusion of the voir dire, the learned trial judge was not satisfied that the statements had been voluntarily made, and he therefore declined to admit them in evidence. At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge held that the essential elements of the offence of murder relating both to the actus reus and mens rea as set out in s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) had not been established within the principles set out in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
. The trial judge felt that the circumstantial evidence adduced by the prosecution was not sufficient to support a prima facie case against the respondent and to warrant calling for his defence. The respondent was therefore acquitted and discharged without having his defence called upon. The public prosecutor appealed against the acquittal. After hearing the submissions, we allowed the public prosecutor`s appeal and ordered the case to be remitted to the High Court for the respondent`s defence to be entered. We now give our reasons.
 The circumstantial evidence
The prosecution had relied upon the following circumstantial evidence in the court below:
 
 
(1) On 16 October 1989 at about 5.30am, the respondent had actually led the police to the exact spot where the deceased`s body had been found. 
 
(2) At 7.40am that same morning, the respondent had led the police to another spot five kilometres from the spot where the deceased`s body had been found. At that other spot, some school books bearing the deceased`s name were found. 
 
(3) The respondent had told the deceased`s parents that he did not pick up the deceased after school on 2 October 1989. However, PW23, the brother of a schoolmate, testified that, whilst waiting for his sister on 2 October 1989 at the school, he saw the deceased (whom he knew by sight) boarding a school bus. He did not see anyone else in the bus apart from the driver. PW23 had been taken later to see the respondent`s school bus, and he had identified the bus to be similar to the one he had seen the deceased boarding. 
 
(4) The respondent had told the deceased`s father that he had gone to fix his bus brakes at between 3pm and 4pm on 2 October 1989. However, PW24, the motor mechanic testified that the respondent had in fact brought his bus to the workshop at 9am that morning, and PW24 had then rectified a fault in the bus brakes. 
 
(5) The respondent had requested PW24 to lie to the deceased`s father that he (the respondent) had been at the workshop on 2 October 1989 between 1pm and 4pm. 
 
(6) PW44, one of the respondent`s regular passengers, testified in his statement that the respondent had failed to pick him up at his workplace at the usual time of 4.55pm on 2 October 1989. The respondent had told him the next day that this was because his bus had broken down. 
 
(7) PW45, a classmate of the deceased, testified that she saw a school bus similar to the respondent`s at 1pm behind the school. She also testified that the respondent had telephoned her 
 that very same night 
. The respondent had asked her to forget a misunderstanding they had had in the past. He had then asked her to help him - he wanted her to be his witness to the effect that the deceased did not board his bus. 
 
(8) The respondent had frequently teased the deceased and the deceased had found him disgusting. On one occasion, the respondent had tried to snap a photograph of the deceased, and she had not been pleased about it. The deceased had also felt disgusted when the respondent had told her that she had a good body. According to PW45, the deceased had also complained that the respondent `talked nonsense` in the bus. 
 
(9) The senior forensic pathologist stated that `it was not possible to determine the cause of death exactly` due to the advanced stage of decomposition. However, there was evidence of trauma to the body, particularly a complete fracture of the lower jaw. The pathologist opined that the cause of the fracture `must be a blow delivered with great force`, a blow from a blunt object. However, the pathologist also stated that the injuries would be equally consistent with a fall on a hard object.
  
 
 
 
 The trial judge`s findings on the circumstantial evidence
 
The trial judge ruled at the conclusion of the voir dire that the respondent`s statements to the police were inadmissible. He was satisfied that the statements did not appear to have been made voluntarily. That being the case, the prosecution was left with only circumstantial evidence. The trial judge observed: 
 
Circumstantial evidence, however, has been laid down to be such as to be of a conclusive nature and tendency and 
 should exclude every hypothesis but that proposed to be proved by the prosecution
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The trial judge attached importance to the pathologist`s concession that the trauma with respect to the ante-mortem injuries on the head, apart from being caused by a blow, could be equally consistent with those from a fall. The pathologist had testified that the deceased could either have been hit by a hard object or hit on a hard object. As regards the injuries to the ribs, the pathologist agreed that they could be due to a fall. In the light of these, the trial judge concluded: 
 
Prof Chao`s evidence showed that all the injuries suffered by the deceased were on the right side of the body, ie they were linear in pattern and hence suggestive of an accident.
 
 
 
The trial judge then cited Lord Morris`s judgment in 
 R v Sharmpal Singh 
 at p 145: 
 
In their Lordships` opinion, the inability of the medical evidence to speak with precision about the degree of force used, together with other circumstances in the case to which they will later refer, opened up both manslaughter and accident as alternative possibilities requiring consideration.
 
 
 
As for the lies the respondent had told, the trial judge felt that for a lie to amount to corroboration, it must, amongst other things, relate to a material issue in the case. The trial judge referred to the caution raised in 
 R v Lucas 
, that a person may lie for a variety of reasons. He then set out his conclusion, which is worth reproducing verbatim: 
 
The material issue was whether the accused had done any intentional act or knowingly any act resulting in the death of the deceased. The subsequent conduct and lies told by the accused 
 could well, in my opinion,
 have been to dissociate himself from the death of the deceased 
 if it occurred accidentally in some fortuitous circumstances
 whilst he was with her, out of fear of being accused of perpetrating her death. 
 Far from dispelling an accident as a cause of the trauma
 suffered by the deceased, Prof Chao had very much equally attributed the trauma to an accident. I could not treat his evidence lightly as any injury falling under any of the limbs (a)-(d) of s 300 of the Penal Code must exclude an accidental or otherwise unintentional injury or one where the requisite knowledge of such an injury is lacking. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The trial judge went on to conclude that the essential elements of the offence relating both to the actus reus and mens rea as set out in s 300 of the Penal Code were not established within the principles set out in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
. He accordingly held that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case against the respondent which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. The respondent was thus acquitted and discharged.
 The public prosecutor`s appeal
The learned DPP submitted at the outset that the trial judge had erred in failing to find that the deceased`s death was homicidal. She contended that given the trauma suffered by the deceased, especially the complete fracture of the lower jaw, the trial judge had erred in concluding that `the injuries were linear in pattern and hence suggestive of an accident`. It was further contended that the trial judge erred in disregarding the pathologist`s opinion that the fracture of the jaw was caused by a blow from a hard object. The DPP pointed out that, when the pathologist agreed to defence counsel`s suggestion that the injuries were equally consistent with an accident, this was with reference to the other injuries on the deceased`s body and not the complete fracture of the lower jaw.
It was next submitted that the respondent had lied out of a realization of guilt and fear of the truth. The DPP contended that the lies the respondent told, as well as his actions in attempting to suborn witnesses to say something other than what they saw or knew, were for the purposes of throwing suspicion off him and to provide himself with an alibi. It was also argued that, if the deceased had in fact died in an accident, the respondent would have had every reason to say so, instead of resorting to lies, denials and deceptions. As for the trial judge`s finding that the respondent could have lied not because of his sense of guilt but because of his fear of being falsely accused, the DPP submitted that it was the respondent`s onus to establish this fact.
The DPP then came to what we considered to be the principal issue in this appeal, that the trial judge had misdirected himself in law in his application of the test enunciated in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
.1 The DPP submitted that the trial judge had imposed a higher burden of proof on the prosecution at the close of its case and that this was apparent from the trial judge`s grounds of decision with respect to the circumstantial evidence against the respondent.
 Our views
To reiterate, the trial judge held that before circumstantial evidence can secure a conviction, `it should exclude every hypothesis but that proposed to be proved by the prosecution`. The trial judge also observed that the respondent`s conduct and lies told could well `have been to dissociate himself` from the deceased`s death, `if this occurred accidentally in some fortuitous circumstances`. In addition to this, the trial judge had held in oral judgment: 
 
At the close of the prosecution case, what has to be decided remains a question of law. As a decider of law, I have to consider whether each essential element in the alleged offence is established on sound evidence. The injuries leading to the death of the deceased must be shown by the prosecution 
 beyond reasonable doubt
 to be intended injuries and not caused accidentally or otherwise unintentionally or that some other kind of injury was intended. ... I am unable to draw 
 prima facie
 an inference of the accused`s guilt from the cumulative pieces of various evidence 
 and be sure at the same time that there are no other coexisting circumstances which would weaken or destroy that inference.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It seems to us that even though the trial judge did not mention it expressly, he was in actuality applying the test propounded in 
 Sunny Ang v PP 
, that before circumstantial evidence can secure an accused`s conviction, it must lead inevitably and inexorably to one conclusion and one conclusion only: the accused`s guilt. In other words, the circumstantial evidence, taken in its totality, must lead to the irresistible inference and conclusion that the accused committed the crime. In such a case, the prosecution would not have proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt if there existed, in the mind of the court, any other reasonably possible explanation for the events in question.
The trial judge was thus applying the principle propounded in 
 Sunny Ang v PP 
 to find, at the close of the prosecution case, that there could well be other reasonably possible explanations for the deceased`s death. We would, however, reiterate, as was held by this court in 
 Tan Siew Chay & Ors v PP 
, that the 
 Sunny Ang 
 test is not relevant or applicable at the close of the case for the prosecution, when the court is not considering whether the prosecution has proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt (which is the purport of the 
 Sunny Ang 
 test). The 
 Sunny Ang 
 test arose out of the following direction the trial judge gave to the jury in his summing-up at the close of the case: 
 
Now, as I told you earlier on, one of the points about circumstantial evidence is its cumulative effect. Any one of these points taken alone might, you may think, be capable of explanation. The question for you is: where does the totality of them, the total effect of them, all lead you to? Adding them together, considering them, not merely each one in itself but altogether, does it or does it not lead you to the irresistible inference and conclusion that the accused committed this crime? Or is there some other reasonably possible explanation of those facts?
 
 
 
The prosecution case is that the effect of all this evidence drives you inevitably and inexorably to the one conclusion and one conclusion only: that it was the accused who intentionally caused the death of this young girl.
On appeal, this direction was held by the Federal Court to be perfectly adequate in a case where the prosecution were relying on circumstantial evidence. Therefore, the 
 Sunny Ang 
 test is relevant only at the end of the trial and is based on the cardinal principle that the accused`s guilt must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. There is one and only one principle at the close of the trial, that of guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and this principle applies equally to cases where the prosecution evidence is wholly circumstantial as it does to those where direct evidence is adduced. We would therefore wish to dispel any notion that the 
 Sunny Ang 
 test is somehow a separate and unique test reserved for use in cases where the prosecution evidence is wholly circumstantial.
Before we set out what we consider to be the correct test to be employed at the close of the prosecution case, it would be worthwhile to set out the observations made by this court in 
 Tan Siew Chay v PP 
 at p 37: 
 
Secondly, the test in 
 Sunny Ang
 is relevant and applicable at the close of the trial in considering whether the prosecution has proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt, and in that connection, where the evidence against the accused consists wholly of circumstantial evidence, the court will have to consider whether the evidence, looked at in its totality, would lead inevitably and inexorably to the one conclusion, and one conclusion only, that the accused has committed the offence with which he was charged. The test is not relevant or applicable at this stage, ie the close of the case for the prosecution, when the court is not considering whether the prosecution has proved the charge against the accused beyond reasonable doubt.
 
 
 
We also noted that the English case which the trial judge cited, 
 R v Sharmpal Singh 
, was a case where the court considered `alternative possibilities` 
 at the close of the trial, and not at the end of the prosecution case 
.
 What then was the test to be applied at the close of the prosecution case?
This was of course the next question to answer. It is helpful to refer once again to 
 Tan Siew Chay v PP 
. LP Thean J (as he then was), in enunciating the correct approach to be used, cited the famous passages of Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 on the interpretation of s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). LP Thean J said, at p 38: 
 
In considering whether the prosecution has made out a case against the accused, we have to adopt the approach as laid down by Lord Diplock, which we have set out earlier. We assume (a) that the evidence on the primary facts is true, unless the evidence is inherently incredible, and (b) that there will be nothing to displace the inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation. The application of limb (b) necessarily involves the court drawing inferences from the primary facts, and, in drawing such inferences, the court looks at the totality of the evidence and considers what inference, if any, that can reasonably be drawn therefrom. But, in considering any inference to be drawn, the court at this stage does not apply the test whether the evidence looked at in its totality would inevitably and inexorably lead to only one inference or inferences for establishing the essential elements of the charge.
 
 
 
 
 How did the application of this test affect the position of the respondent?
 
It was necessary to examine first the evidence of the primary facts adduced by the prosecution. At the risk of repetition, they were as follows:
 
 
(1) There was evidence that the deceased boarded a school bus at about 1pm on 20 October 1989, that no one else was then in the bus apart from the driver, and that the school bus was similar to the respondent`s. 
 
(2) The respondent had lied to the deceased`s father that he had brought his bus to the motor mechanic for repair of the brakes between 3pm and 4pm, and had requested the mechanic to lie to the deceased`s father that he had been to the mechanic`s workshop between 1pm and 4pm. 
 
(3) The respondent, on the very night of 2 October 1989, telephoned a classmate of the deceased asking her to be his witness and to say that the deceased had not boarded his bus. 
 
(4) The respondent led the police to the exact spot where the deceased`s body had been found and led the police to another spot where her school books lay. 
 
(5) The respondent`s conduct towards the deceased, for instance, his frequently teasing her and his attempt on one occasion to take a photograph of her [the deceased] [and the deceased`s disgust about what he said] and her complaint that the respondent [had] talked `nonsense`. 
 
(6) There was evidence of trauma to the body of the deceased, notably a complete fracture of the lower jaw. In this connection, the opinion of the pathologist was that this was caused by a blow delivered with great force, as the lower jaw was `quite a tough structure` and the fracture was a complete one separating the jaw into two halves.
  
 
 
The next question was what were the inferences that could reasonably be drawn from the primary facts. On the totality of the evidence, the inferences that could reasonably be drawn were these: that the death of the deceased was not suicidal or accidental but homicidal; that the respondent was the last person to be with the deceased; that injuries were inflicted on the deceased and, in particular, a heavy blow at the lower jaw of the deceased which, according to the pathologist, was inflicted with great force; that these injuries were inflicted by the respondent; that they caused her death; and that the injuries were inflicted with the intention falling within one or more of the paras (a), (b) and (c) of s 300 of the Penal Code or with the knowledge and in the circumstances falling within para (d) of s 300. Whether or not all or some of these inferences were irresistible was a different question; the court at that stage was not concerned with the question whether the case against the respondent had been established beyond reasonable doubt. On this point, we recalled the following passage of the judgment of Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 at p 52: 
 
Section 188(1) states the conditions precedent to the right and duty of the judge of trial to call on the accused to enter on his defence. ... 
 it does not place upon the court a positive obligation to make up its mind at that stage of the proceedings whether the evidence adduced by the prosecution has by then already satisfied it beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.
 Indeed, it would run counter to the concept of what is a fair trial under that system to require the court to do so. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Following 
 Haw Tua Tau 
, the court only assumes that there would be nothing to displace the inferences as to further facts or the state of mind of the accused which would 
 reasonably be drawn 
 from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.
The element of `intention` is rarely, if ever, proved by direct evidence; it is inevitably to be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. In this respect, `intention` is to be distinguished from `motive`, even though the presence of a motive may bolster the inference that an intention to commit the offence was existent. The absence of motive, however, need not necessarily mean that no intention was present. Therefore, from the totality of circumstances in the instant case, it was our opinion that a reasonable inference could be drawn to the effect that the respondent had caused the death of the deceased intentionally within s 300(a) of the Penal Code.
It thus followed that a case would have been made out against the respondent, which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. Applying the principles enunciated in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 to determine the procedure at the close of the prosecution case, we were of the opinion that the defence ought to have been called. Upon this basis alone, the appeal of the public prosecutor was allowed. We therefore ordered that the case be remitted to the High Court for the respondent`s defence to be entered.
We next come to the alternative ground of appeal, that pertaining to the voluntariness of the respondent`s statements to the police. At the trial, the prosecution had sought to introduce in evidence three statements made by the respondent to ASP Michael Chan, PW26 (`Insp Chan`), as follows:
 
 
(a) at 10.10am on 21 October 1989, an oral statement marked as exh P184 (`the 10.10am statement`); 
 
(b) at 10.20am on 21 October 1989, an oral statement marked as exh P185 (`the 10.20am statement`); and 
 
(c) between 11.25am and 2.20pm and signed at about 4.20pm on 23 October 1989, a written statement marked P157 (`the long statement`).
  
 
 
As stated above, the learned trial judge declined to admit all three statements, having been satisfied that they did not appear to have been voluntarily made. First, the trial judge felt that the respondent had been subjected to oppressive questioning in terms of the burdensome, harsh and wrongful manner and duration of time over which the interrogation lasted. Secondly, the trial judge was satisfied that the respondent had been assaulted and threatened. Thirdly, the trial judge was also satisfied that the respondent was induced to provide the statements in return for his being allowed to see his wife and to obtain his school bus. With respect to the statements given on 21 October 1989, the trial judge was satisfied that Insp Chan repeated the inducements to the respondent and had knocked his head prior to obtaining the two brief statements.
The public prosecutor appealed against the trial judge`s decision only as regards the 10.10am and 10.20am statements given on 21 October 1989. In the court below, the respondent had stated during cross-examination that he could not recall admitting to anything on 21 October 1989. A little later, during cross-examination, he stated that he did not give any oral statements. The prosecution had in the trial below contended on this last answer that, based on the principle in 
 Seeraj Ajodha v State 
, the two statements should have been admissible as the issue of voluntariness did not arise. The only issue was whether the two statements had in fact been made. In such a case, the prosecution argued that the statements would be admissible - the judge would then have the task of ascertaining the weight to be attached to the statements.
It would be worthwhile to reproduce the relevant part of Lord Bridge`s judgment in 
 Ajodha 
 at p 222: 
 
The defence is an absolute denial of the prosecution evidence. For example, if the prosecution rely upon oral statements, the defence case is simply that the interview never took place or that the incriminating answers were never given; in the case of a written statement, the defence case is that it is a forgery. In this situation, no issue as to voluntariness can arise and hence no question of admissibility falls for the judge`s decision. The issue of fact whether or not the statement was made by the accused is purely for the jury.
 
 
 
Whilst the verbatim records did indicate that the respondent was at times denying that he had ever made the statements, we were of the view that the trial judge was correct in rejecting the prosecution`s contention on the 
 Ajodha 
 point. The trial judge opined: 
 
The prosecution had sought to admit these [two] statements at the last moment at the trial (notwithstanding that a preliminary inquiry had been held and other evidence had been disclosed) and some three years after the accused`s arrest at the time of the trial and it could well be that his last two answers about his inability to recall the contents and that he had not given the statement stemmed from this difficulty.
 
 
 
We would agree with the trial judge`s observation. The passage of time could well have erased the respondent`s recollection as to whether he had given the two statements. These statements could well have been given by the respondent that morning, 
 and 
 given involuntarily. It would thus be unsafe to admit the two statements based on the 
 Ajodha 
 principle.
The public prosecutor`s appeal on the issue of the 10.10am and 10.20am statements was therefore dismissed. However, as we have stated, the circumstantial evidence at the end of the prosecution case would have been sufficient to warrant calling for the respondent`s defence. The public prosecutor`s appeal on this point was therefore allowed. We ordered the case to be remitted back to the High Court for the respondent`s defence to be entered.
 Order accordingly.",1994-04-25 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

The appellant was charged in the subordinate courts as follows: 
 
First charge
 
 
 
That you, on 23 March 1993 at about 11.10am, at Farrer Road/Bukit Timah Road, did drive off-peak car no SBV8873K which was issued with a licence subject to the restrictions referred to in s 11A(1) of the Road Traffic Act, read with r 35(1) of Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Registration and Licensing) Rules, without there being in force on the above-mentioned day and time a supplementary licence for that motor car in accordance with r 53(1) and (3) of the said rules, and you have thereby contravened the aforesaid restriction and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 11A(3) of the said Act.
 
 
 
Second charge
 
 
 
That you, on 23 March 1993 at about 11.10am, at Farrer Road/Bukit Timah Road, being the driver of off-peak motor car no SBV8837K, did exhibit a supplementary licence no 139517 on the front windscreen by folding up tab no 2 of the tenth column and tab no 3 of the unit column for the day, and, also, the tab no 0 of the unit column which was previously torn off was glued back to its original position to make it appear that the said motor car driven by you had a valid supplementary licence, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 129(2)(d) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 
 
 
Following the appellant`s plea of guilt in relation to both charges, the prosecution applied for a deterrent sentence. The district judge, being of the view that `
 a short deterrence was, in the circumstances, necessary and appropriate` 
, sentenced the appellant to a fine of $696 in respect of the first charge and to two weeks` imprisonment on the second charge. This appeal was brought against the custodial sentence on the ground that it was inappropriate and/or manifestly excessive. I dismissed the appeal after hearing the submissions of counsel and now give my reasons in writing.
 The facts
The facts of the case were briefly these. The complainant in this case was one Cpl Abdullah Sani bin Jantan, a police officer attached to the enforcement unit of the Registry of Vehicles (`ROV`). On 23 March 1993, at about 11.10am, he was proceeding on his rounds along Adam Road when he noticed an off-peak motor car (licence no SBV8837K) at Farrer Road near Bukit Timah Road. He stopped the car, which was being driven by the appellant. Upon checking the supplementary licence (no 139517), the complainant discovered that it had been tampered with in the following manner: the tab `2` of the tenth column and the tab `3` of the unit column had been folded backwards while the tab `0` of the unit column, which had previously been torn off, had been pasted back into its original position. The complainant seized the supplementary licence and lodged a report which led to the appellant being charged as above.
In making a mitigation plea on behalf of the appellant in the court below, counsel stated that the appellant had been on her way to the National University of Singapore (`NUS`) at the material time. At that point in time when she started off on her journey, there had only been used supplementary licences in her car. The appellant had decided to make temporary use of one of the used supplementary licences but she had (or so she claimed) intended to purchase a valid supplementary licence along the way and had in fact been driving to the Farrer Road post office to make the purchase when she was stopped by the complainant. Coincidentally, she was stopped just opposite the Farrer Road post office. According to the appellant (who volunteered her oral testimony), she told the complainant of her intention to purchase the necessary licence and he allowed her to cross the road to the post office in order to do so.
The above account was categorically denied by the complainant. On his evidence, the appellant, when stopped, had merely said that she was on her way to an urgent matter at NUS. After the complainant had recorded her particulars, he asked her whether she possessed a valid supplementary licence with which to continue her journey. The appellant responded by asking him where she could purchase one, whereupon he pointed out to her the Farrer Road post office. According to the complainant, the appellant had not been aware of the post office, nor had she at any point told him that she was already on her way there to purchase the necessary licence.
Having heard both oral testimonies, the district judge `
 unhesitatingly rejected 
` the appellant`s account of the circumstances surrounding her commission of the offence charged. He found, therefore, that he could not accept her claim in mitigation that she had been on her way to purchase a valid supplementary licence when stopped. In his view, the prosecution had applied for a deterrent sentence `
 with good reasons 
`; and, taking into account the fact that the appellant had engaged in `
 calculated and deliberate 
` deception by tampering with the used supplementary licence, the district judge was satisfied that a short custodial sentence was appropriate in respect of the second charge.
 The present appeal
On appeal before me, counsel for the appellant attempted to resurrect the argument that the appellant had actually been on her way to the Farrer Road post office to purchase the requisite supplementary licence when she was stopped. Counsel submitted that the district judge failed to consider adequately that the appellant`s claim 
 might 
 be true and that the district judge erred in failing to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt in rejecting her claim. I must confess that I found it somewhat difficult to comprehend counsel`s tenacity. The district judge was faced with two conflicting versions of the relevant events. Having had the opportunity to observe both the complainant and the appellant in the witness box, he found the appellant`s evidence `
 unconvincing 
` and chose to accept the complainant`s narrative instead. The appellant admitted in the course of her testimony that she did not know why the complainant had offered a version of events deviating from her own, but suggested that there might have been some sort of `
 miscommunication 
` between the complainant and herself. The complainant, for his part, was quite adamant that the appellant had not at any point mentioned to him that she was actually on her way to the Farrer Road post office to purchase a licence; and it may be noted that he was not cross-examined by counsel for the appellant in the court below. Furthermore, the appellant herself, when cross-examined, conceded that she had not had any `
 problem 
` with the complainant when he stopped her.
In view of the above, I saw no reason to disagree with the district judge`s assessment of the testimonies of both persons, especially since it was not demonstrated to me why the complainant, a police officer attached to the ROV and acting in his official capacity, should have had any cause to render an account of events completely different from that told by the appellant, unless his account were true.
Counsel next contended that the district judge failed to take into account relevant mitigating factors such as the appellant`s plea of guilt and her lack of antecedents; further that he placed `
 undue emphasis 
` on the difficulties encountered by the ROV enforcement authorities in deterring other persons minded to behave as the appellant had done. A perusal of the notes of evidence and of the district judge`s grounds of decision plainly showed, however, that contrary to counsel`s assertion, the district judge did in fact have full regard to all the relevant mitigating circumstances of the appellant`s case. At the same time, the prosecution having applied for a deterrent sentence, the district judge was clearly obliged to consider also the need to deter like-minded offenders and the appropriate way to achieve this. Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, I could find no cause to differ from his conclusion that the requisite deterrent effect would be gained through the imposition of a short custodial sentence.
In my view, this was no mere case of a driver having forgotten, in a moment of innocent carelessness, to display a valid supplementary licence. For such a forgetful driver, a hefty fine would be an adequate punishment. The appellant in this case, however, tampered with a used supplementary licence in such a way that her intent to mislead the authorities could not have been more obvious. I agreed with the district judge that the element of deceit in the present case made it all the more crucial that a custodial sentence be imposed. Indeed, I am of the view that custodial sentences should generally be imposed upon offenders who attempt some sort of trickery in relation to their supplementary licences, for instance, by folding back and/or pasting back used tabs to give an invalid licence the appearance of validity (as was done in this case). The `weekend car` scheme was structured with the express aim of affording substantial road tax savings to the owners of such cars. Our courts would hardly be providing adequate safeguard for the interests of all law-abiding car-owners if attempts by dishonest `weekend car` owners to take further and illicit advantage of the scheme were rebuked with just a fine.
Counsel further urged upon this court the view that a custodial sentence should not be imposed on the appellant, a part-time law student, because it would have `
 severe ramifications 
` on any plans she had for a legal career. I could not accept such an argument. As someone who was familiar with the stringent requirements of the law and who harboured some ambition moreover of a career in the law, the appellant ought to have been even more cognizant than the average motorist of the consequences flowing from an infringement of the law`s requirements.
Having regard to the reasons given above, I found the appeal to be wholly without merit and accordingly dismissed it.

The appellant Ong Lee Koon (Ong) was convicted and sentenced to death by the High Court on 11 August 1994 on the amended charge of trafficking by delivering 25 packets of substance containing not less than 29.57g of diamorphine (the 25 packets of heroin) to the appellant, Azmi bin Tuki (Azmi) and Azmi was similarly convicted and sentenced to death on the amended charge of trafficking in the 25 packets of heroin by transporting them. The act of delivery by Ong was said to be committed on 3 December 1993 at about 7am at the car park of Blk 108, Gangsa Road, Singapore and the act of transporting by Azmi was said to be committed by him on the same day shortly after 7am at the void deck of Blk 108, Gangsa Road. They were tried jointly. We heard the appeals on 20 February 1995.
Ong was originally charged with trafficking by selling the 25 packets of heroin to Azmi and Azmi was originally charged with being in possession of the 25 packets of heroin and that by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (the Act) of trafficking by offering to sell, deliver or distribute the same. The original charge against Ong was amended at the end of the trial and the original charge against Azmi was amended at the close of the prosecution case.
Acting on information received that a male Chinese driving a light green Audi car bearing the registration number SBE 4899Y would be delivering heroin to a male Malay in the early morning of 3 December 1993 at the car park of Blk 108, Gangsa Road (Blk 108), ASP Lim Chei Yoo (ASP Lim) and a team of narcotics officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) arrived at Blk 108 well before 7am and kept surveillance on flat #02-161. The CNB officers were dispersed at various vantage points and were under cover. At about 6.57am, a male Malay, later identified as Azmi, was seen leaving the flat and walking towards the car park behind Blk 108. He was empty-handed. At about the same time other CNB officers observed a motor car enter the car park. Azmi was seen walking towards the approaching car which stopped when it reached Azmi. At this point the CNB officers who were watching the car and Azmi had their view obstructed by a moving vehicle and could not see either the car which had stopped or Azmi. No sooner had the moving vehicle passed they saw the car moving out through the exit of the car park and Azmi walking towards Blk 108 carrying a plastic bag in his hand.
The CNB officers acted swiftly. Some of them intercepted the car at the exit before it could leave the car park. It was car SBE 4899Y and was being driven by a male Chinese who was later identified as Ong. There were no passengers in the car. ASP Lim who had positioned himself at the void deck of Blk 107 saw from his vantage point car SBE 4899Y being intercepted by the CNB officers. He immediately rushed to the scene and assisted in apprehending Ong, who was then being handcuffed by the two CNB officers who had intercepted car SBE 4899Y. When the situation was under control ASP Lim asked Ong in the Hokkien dialect the amount of `thing` he had given to the Malay. Ong replied `25 packets`. To further questioning directed to a red plastic bag lying on the front passenger seat Ong said that it contained $1750 in cash given to him by the Malay. By this time Inspector Chew Khai Chow (Insp Chew) had arrived on the scene and ASP Lim instructed Insp Chew to escort Ong in his car SBE 4899Y to Ong`s apartment block at Macpherson Green.
Whilst the above was taking place Inspector Chow Toong Chee (Insp Chow) heard over his walkie-talkie radio that Azmi was walking back towards Blk 108. Insp Chow was then proceeding on foot towards Blk 108 from the car park of Blk 142. He confronted Azmi at the lift lobby of Blk 108 when Azmi was about to enter the lift. Azmi was still holding a white plastic bag which was later described more specifically as a white plastic bag with red dragon motifs on it. This plastic bag will be referred to hereafter as `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs`. Insp Chow moved in to arrest Azmi who put up a violent struggle. He was pushed into the lift and handcuffed. During the struggle `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` fell to the floor of the lift and was retrieved by Insp Chow who retained personal possession of it until, as we shall see later, it was handed over to Insp Chew when Insp Chew assumed the role of investigating officer. Inside `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` Insp Chow saw there were three airmail envelopes.
Azmi was then taken to his flat #02-161 by Insp Chow. In the flat Insp Chow met two other CNB officers who had already arrived at the flat, and a female Malay who was later identified as Julaina bte Mohd Yatim, Azmi`s girlfriend. Insp Chow showed `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` which he had retrieved from the floor of the lift after making Azmi`s arrest and asked him in English what was in it. He replied in English that there were 25 packets of heroin in it. At this point the two other CNB officers left the flat and were replaced by a woman inspector who had arrived to guard Julaina. Insp Chow then continued questioning Azmi. However, evidence of the further questioning was objected to at the trial by counsel but was ruled admissible by the learned judge after a voir dire. No objections were raised at the appeal to the admissibility in evidence of this further questioning. The gist of the exchange between Insp Chow and Azmi conducted in English was that Azmi admitted that he paid $1750 to a person who came driving a green sports car whom he referred to as `Boh Gay`. He said that the heroin was for his own consumption but sometimes when his friends came to him for heroin he would sell them a packet for $90.
Thereafter, Insp Chow remained in the flat with Azmi, Julaina and the woman inspector until the Scene of Crime Unit arrived at about 1.20pm. Photographs were then taken in the presence of Azmi. For this to be done Insp Chow placed `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` on the floor and had it photographed. He then took out the contents of `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` which as we have noted before were three airmail envelopes; two of them were of the larger oblong size and the third of a smaller size. He marked the two larger oblong sized airmail envelopes `A` and `C` respectively and the smaller sized airmail envelope `B`. He then placed the three envelopes unopened side by side and had them photographed. After this he opened each envelope and had each envelope separately photographed with the contents of each beside it. Envelopes `A` and `C` contained 10 packets each and envelope `B` five packets of granular substance which Insp Chow believed to be heroin. This was later confirmed by Dr Lee Tong Kooi of the Department of Scientific Services who also certified pursuant to s 16 of the Act that the diamorphine content of the 25 packets of heroin contained in the airmail envelopes `A`, `B` and `C` was not less than 29.57g. All the foregoing were produced as exhibits at the trial.
After the photographing of the exhibits as described above Insp Chow returned the 25 packets of granular substance, which we now know to be heroin containing in total not less than 29.57g of diamorphine, to their respective envelopes, that is to say, ten packets into each of the airmail envelopes marked `A` and `C` and five packets into the airmail envelope marked `B`, and placed them in `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs`. None of the three airmail envelopes were sealed. It is also pertinent to note that Insp Chow`s evidence was that none of the 25 packets of heroin taken out of the three airmail envelopes for photographing were opened.
At about 2pm that same day, ie 3 December 1993 Insp Chow left the flat with Azmi for CNB Headquarters taking with him `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` in which were the three airmail envelopes marked `A`, `B` and `C` each containing ten, five and ten packets of heroin respectively. There at about 4.45pm Insp Chow handed to Insp Chew `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` together with its contents as described above. It was Insp Chow`s evidence that he either had physical possession or maintained personal control over `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` and the three airmail envelopes marked `A`, `B` and `C` each containing ten, five and ten packets of heroin respectively from the time he picked them up in the lift after making Azmi`s arrest until he handed them to Insp Chew.
We must now return to the events following the arrest of Ong at the car park of Blk 108. On arrival at Ong`s apartment block at Macpherson Green at about 7.30am a guard was posted over Ong`s car, the green Audi No SBE 4899Y and Ong was escorted to his flat #07-01 by two CNB officers and Insp Chew. A search was made of Ong`s flat and the following items were seized:
 
 
(i) a box containing a plastic sealer; 
 
(ii) a bundle of small empty plastic bags; 
 
(iii) a digital weighing scale stained with a powdery substance believed to be heroin, later confirmed to be heroin by Dr Lee Tong Kooi; 
 
(iv) a red coloured plastic container and two small plastic cups stained with a powdery substance believed to be heroin, later confirmed to be heroin by Dr Lee Tong Kooi; 
 
(v) twelve bundles of empty airmail envelopes, several mini empty plastic bags and a mini digital weighing scale; 
 
(vi) a brown clutch bag containing: 
 
(a) $56,128 in currency notes; 
 
(b) $42.55 in coins; 
 
(c) a POSB cash cheque for $1,100; 
 
(vii) a `Samsung` handphone and a pager.
  
 
 
Later at about 10.45am Ong`s car was searched in his presence. The following items were found and seized:
 
 
(i) a pink coloured plastic bag containing $1,750 in currency notes from the front passenger seat of the car; 
 
(ii) a white and pink coloured paper bag from the left rear floor board of the car; 
 
(iii) a black striped canvass bag from the boot of the car; 
 
(iv) a pink coloured plastic bag containing $74,100 in currency notes from the boot of the car; 
 
(v) four sachets of heroin found at the side pocket of front right side door of the car.
  
 
 
All the foregoing were produced as exhibits at the trial.
At about 12.40pm the same day, ie 3 December 1993, Ong was taken to CNB Headquarters by Insp Chew in Ong`s car. On arrival at CNB Headquarters at about 1.15pm. The `substances` seized from Ong`s car were weighed in his presence. They were later sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis and until then they were kept in Insp Chew`s personal steel cabinet. They do not form the subject matter of the charge against Ong in this appeal. They did, however, form the subject matter of other charges against Ong which were stood down pending the trial of the charge in this appeal.
Insp Chew confirmed in his evidence that at about 4.45pm on 3 December 1993 at CNB Headquarters he received from Insp Chow `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` containing three airmail envelopes marked `A`, `B` and `C` which contained 10, five and 10 packets of heroin each which Insp Chow had seized from Azmi at the time of making his arrest. It is not clear from the evidence whether Insp Chew examined the three envelopes further or whether he weighed the contents of the envelopes before, as he said, he locked them away in his personal steel cabinet. It was his evidence that only he had access to his personal steel cabinet and that it was not until 5 December 1993 which was a Sunday, at about 9.30am, that he found the time to mark and seal the exhibits before he sent them to the Department of Scientific Services on Monday 6 December 1993 at about 9.35am for analysis. He marked the three airmail envelopes referred to above as 10A, 10B and 10C. We have verified from the evidence of Dr Lee Tong Kooi that he did receive from Insp Chew the three airmail envelopes, 10A, 10B and 10C and, as noted previously from Dr Lee Tong Kooi`s certificate, that the diamorphine content of the 25 packets of heroin contained in the three airmail envelopes was not less than 29.57g. Neither Ong nor Azmi disputed the evidence of Dr Lee Tong Kooi.
Insp Chew explained in his evidence that the reason why he could not give his earlier attention to the `drug exhibits` and had to lock them away in his personal steel cabinet was because, firstly, both Ong and Azmi had complained of the effects of drug withdrawal after they had been brought to CNB Headquarters on 3 December 1993 and, accordingly, he had to make arrangements for them to be sent to the Changi Prison Hospital for observation and treatment and, secondly, since they were detained at the Changi Prison Hospital, he had to arrange for a judicial officer to go to the hospital on 4 December 1993, a Saturday, for Ong and Azmi to be charged and then, in the weekend, interviewed.
On 6 December 1993 Insp Chew recorded cautioned statements under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code from Ong and Azmi. Both their cautioned statements were admitted in evidence as part of the prosecution case without objection.
Ong said: 
 
The male Malay, Azmi, wanted 15 packets of heroin. I charged him $90 for one packet of heroin. I told him that I would not be free these few days and asked him to take another ten packets of heroin. He could return me the remaining packets of heroin when I was supposed to see him a few days later. Azmi agreed and he paid me $1750, which was all the cash he had with him then. Prior to this transaction, Azmi owed me $700 for heroin taken on the previous occasion. Azmi used to take ten or 15 packets of heroin from me every three or four days.
 
 
 
Azmi said: 
 
Out of the 25 packets of heroin, only 15 packets belongs to me and my girlfriend Julaina. The other ten packets of heroin belongs to a friend of mine named `Boh Gay`. He asked me to keep ten packets of heroin for him and he would collect the drugs from me in four or five days` time together with the $700 I owed him. The 15 packets of heroin are for my own consumption together with my girlfriend.
 
 
 
The foregoing was the prosecution`s evidence at the close of its case. Ong`s counsel at the trial chose to make a submission of `no case`. It was a submission in total disregard of the principles stated in and in the subsequent judgments of this court. It was altogether a pointless submission of `no case to answer` at the end of the prosecution`s case and failed to address the seminal question of whether the chain of evidence of the identity of the `drug exhibits` adduced by the prosecution was so inherently incredible that notwithstanding the other evidence before the court there ought to be an acquittal then and there. We make this point as counsel must act with responsibility in the conduct of the cases they are entrusted with and not make a submission of `no case` at the end of the prosecution`s case in a criminal trial just for the sake of making a submission. The drift of our stricture will be seen from the following extract from the learned judge`s grounds of decision: 
 
When the prosecution closed its case, (counsel) made a long submission that there was no case for his client to answer. He quoted from Bertrand Russell`s and the discourse on perceptual propositions and memory propositions. He complained about the absence of regulations and instructions for handling and safekeeping drug exhibits and argued that there was a break in the chain of evidence on the exhibits and argued that the lack of regulations for the handling of drug exhibits when there are regulations for handling urine specimens was a breach of art 12 of the Constitution which guarantees equal protection of the law. ...
 
 
 
Although (counsel) may have broken new ground by referring to Bertrand Russell`s philosophical discourse on the nature of truth, he did not persuade me that the philosophical approach can or should displace the legal standards for the treatment and analysis of evidence in criminal trials. I did not find this part of his submissions helpful.
The same can be said to his complaint on the lack of regulations or instructions on the handling and custody of drug exhibits. Whether regulations or written instructions should be made is a matter to be determined by the relevant ministry. Even if there are no regulations or instructions, officers who deal with drug exhibits must exercise care to ensure that they are properly handled and stored. I did not find any basis for finding any break in the chain of evidence as the exhibits were in the custody of Insp Chow and then Insp Chew at all material times before they were sent for analysis.
I also rejected the submission that there was infringement of art 12. There is no need for the handling of all exhibits to be regulated. There are no regulations for exhibits in cases involving bodily injury, in commercial crime cases and in road traffic cases. Urine specimens are a special class of exhibits in that the urine specimens are kept in standard containers supplied by the enforcement officer. One specimen may be confused with another specimen and the specimens are liable to be contaminated unless specific procedures are followed in sealing, labelling and handling them. Drug exhibits are already packed, in slabs, packets, sachets or straws when they are recovered, and can be marked and identified by their packing. I did not find that the absence of regulations for the handling of drug exhibits to be a deprivation of the equal protection of the law.
The learned judge then reviewed the evidence and gave his reasons for calling on both Ong and Azmi (on the amended charge) to enter upon their defence. This is what he said: 
 
There was the evidence of the officers on the stake-out, arrest and recovery of the drugs. Against the first accused (Ong), there was his cautioned statement in which he admitted that he had delivered 25 packets of heroin to the second accused (Azmi). The second accused`s admission of his receipt of the bag and his knowledge that there were 25 packets of heroin inside the bag gave rise to a presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. According to Insp Chow, he also admitted that he would sell some of it to his friends, although the second accused denied that, and said that 15 packets were intended to be consumed by him and his girlfriend and ten packets were held by him for the first accused. There was, however, no dispute that he was in the process of carrying the bag from the car park to his flat when he was arrested.
 
 
 
We entirely agree with the learned judge.
When the defences of Ong and Azmi were called, Ong indicated to the court that he wished to discharge both counsel assigned to him and from then on to undertake his own defence. Accordingly, the learned judge discharged both assigned counsel.
Ong indicated that he did not wish to give evidence himself but wished to call Insp Chow, Insp Chew and one other CNB officer, Cpl Goh Seow Thian, as his witnesses. Azmi, still represented by assigned counsel, elected to give evidence on his own behalf and to call a witness to testify on the nature and extent of his heroin addiction.
Faced with this unusual request from Ong, the learned judge on ascertaining from Ong that what he really wanted was to further examine Insp Chow and Insp Chew on their handling of the drug exhibits, particularly the three airmail envelopes which together contained the 25 packets of heroin, the subject matter of this appeal, very properly acceded to Ong`s request.
We will now summarize the evidence elicited by the further cross-examination of Insp Chow and Insp Chew by Ong.
Ong`s questioning of Insp Chow was directed at whether the 25 packets contained in the three airmail envelopes had been tampered with during the time they were taken out of the three airmail envelopes for photographing at Azmi`s flat and in the process of returning them to their respective envelopes and being placed in `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` and Insp Chow delivering them into the custody of Insp Chew at the CNB Headquarters. Insp Chow maintained that that was not possible as not one of the 25 packets had been opened whilst these exhibits were in his custody. Pressed by Ong for more details of the procedures, Insp Chow had taken in handling these exhibits at Azmi`s flat, Insp Chow said that after the photographing was over, he had first returned the 25 packets, still unopened, to their respective airmail envelopes, and had then placed each airmail envelope into a separate plastic bag provided by the Scene of Crime Unit and then finally placed the three Scene of Crime Unit plastic bags each containing a single airmail envelope into `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` and confirmed that this was what he had handed to Insp Chew at CNB Headquarters at 4.45pm on 3 December 1993. It will be noted that when Insp Chow first gave evidence he had not mentioned placing each airmail envelope with its contents into a separate Scene of Crime Unit plastic bag before placing them into `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs`.
Ong`s further examination of Insp Chew was also directed at his handling of the drug exhibits and their safe keeping until they were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. Much of this examination related to `the substances` contained in the white and pink coloured paper bag and the black striped canvas bag seized from Ong`s car of which no evidence was given at the trial but Ong insisted on questioning Insp Chew about them despite the learned judge cautioning Ong of the irrelevance of these questions as they did not form the subject matter of the charge he was being tried on and also of the possible prejudice such questions may have on his defence. From a reading of the transcript we are satisfied that the learned judge controlled the line of questioning extremely well without creating an impression that Ong, who was now conducting his own defence, was being prevented from putting forward his defence. The other aspect of Ong`s further examination of Insp Chew was an attempt to show that by keeping the 25 packets of heroin in his personal steel cabinet even though he was the only person who had access to it, and not keeping the 25 packets of heroin sealed and ready for despatch to the Department of Scientific Services in the store at CNB Headquarters, both Ong and Azmi had been prejudiced in some way. In what way was not clear from the line of questioning except that Insp Chew, being the investigating officer of this case, should not have had vital exhibits in his possession or under his control longer than it was necessary for the purposes of weighing and sealing and thus avoiding the possibility of them being mixed up with drug exhibits of other cases Insp Chew was investigating. The learned judge was not impressed with this line of questioning and the insinuations. Neither are we.
However, Ong elicited from Insp Chew an admission which was to be the basis, both at the trial and before us, of the contention that there was a break in the chain of evidence identifying the 25 packets of heroin delivered by Ong at the car park of Blk 108 on the morning of 3 December 1993 to Azmi and transported by Azmi to Blk 108 when he was arrested by Insp Chow in possession of the 25 packets of heroin and that sent by Insp Chew to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis on 6 December 1993. It was that Insp Chew had received from Insp Chow a Scene of Crime Unit plastic bag in which was `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` which contained three airmail envelopes marked 10A, 10B and 10C containing ten packets, five packets and ten packets respectively of substance believed to be heroin, making a total of 25 packets. It will be readily seen that this was quite different from what Insp Chow said when further examined by Ong.
On this discrepancy in the evidence of Insp Chow and Insp Chew, Ong submitted at the end of the trial that it could not be safely said that the three airmail envelopes marked 10A, 10B and 10C containing a total of 25 packets of heroin which Insp Chew sent to the Department of Scientific Services on 6 December 1993 and certified by Dr Lee Tong Kooi to contain not less than 29.57g of diamorphine were the same three airmail envelopes containing in total 25 packets of heroin which Insp Chew received from Insp Chow at CNB Headquarters on 3 December 1993 at 4.45pm. Accordingly, there was a breach in the chain of evidence with the consequence that the prosecution had not proved its case against him beyond a reasonable doubt.
The learned judge made short shrift of this submission. He said in his grounds of decision: 
 
I considered the first accused`s (Ong`s) submissions on the chain of evidence on the drugs recovered. The bag was retrieved at the place of arrest immediately after the second accused (Azmi) was subdued, and contained 25 sachets of diamorphine, as admitted by both accused. On that evidence, I had no doubt that the bag and envelopes recovered at the time of arrest were those carried by the second accused.
 
 
 
... There was more substance in the complaint over the conflicting evidence of Insp Chow and Insp Chew whether the three envelopes were kept in separate plastic bags when they were handed by the former to the latter. This did not reflect well on them. Neither of them made a record of this, and both tried to rely on their memories, but their recollections conflicted. If the conflict related to the recovered exhibits, it could have constituted a break in the chain of evidence. However, the bags were items supplied by the SCU which, if used, formed no part of the items seized, while the envelopes recovered were properly marked and accounted for. I therefore found that there was no break in the chain of evidence.
We have dealt with the evidence relating to the 25 packets of heroin from the time Azmi was seen carrying `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` which indisputably contained the three airmail envelopes, each containing ten, five and ten packets of heroin respectively at the car park of Blk 108 on 3 December 1993, through to Insp Chew sending them to the Department of Scientific Services on 6 December 1993 in much detail. It is abundantly clear that notwithstanding the discrepancy relied on there is not a shadow of doubt that the three airmail envelopes containing in total 25 packets of heroin which were recovered from Azmi by Insp Chow on 3 December 1993 were the same three airmail envelopes containing in total 25 packets of heroin sent by Insp Chew to the Department of Scientific Services on 6 December 1993 for analysis.
It seems to us from a reading of the further examination of Insp Chow and Insp Chew by Ong that there was some confusion over the plastic bag in which the three airmail envelopes containing in total 25 packets of heroin were carried from Gangsa Road to CNB Headquarters but there is no confusion at all in their evidence over the three airmail envelopes containing in total the 25 packets of heroin. Accordingly, we agree with the learned judge that there was no break in the chain of evidence.
We now turn to the case against Azmi. It will be remembered that when the trial commenced Azmi was charged with being in possession of 25 packets of heroin containing not less than 29.57g of diamorphine and that by virtue of s 17 of the Act (ie before it was amended on 10 December 1993) of trafficking by offering to sell, deliver or distribute the same. However, at the close of the prosecution case the charge against him was amended to one of trafficking by transporting.
Azmi gave evidence in his defence. In summary it was that he lived at flat #02-161, Blk 108, Gangsa Road, with his girlfriend Julaina and both of them were heroin addicts. He himself started consuming heroin in August 1993. At first it was one 3-cm straw per day. By the time of his arrest on 3 December 1993 he was consuming about two 3-cm straws per day. His evidence was vague really for he said that on some days he would consume up to seven 3-cm straws per day. He also mentioned that from about September 1993 he started buying a sachet at a time instead of single straws. A single straw cost him $10 and a sachet cost him $120. He also said by September 1993, his consumption had increased and that a sachet would last for slightly more than a week. As we said, his evidence on the consumption of heroin was rather vague. When questioned again by the learned judge, his answer was - `In a month, I would need two sachets, your Honour. It all depends on my craving.` He was also vague on the question of his girlfriend Julaina sharing the heroin he had purchased for his own consumption or whether she had her own source of supply; but from time to time when Julaina had a craving for heroin, he would give her a little from his supply.
Azmi`s original supplier of heroin was not Ong. Azmi said that he had met Ong by chance sometime towards the end of October 1993. During the course of conversation, the topic of heroin consumption and supply had arisen. Ong told Azmi that he could supply Azmi with heroin at $90 per sachet. Since this was considerably cheaper than what he was paying his supplier, Azmi agreed to purchase his supply of heroin from Ong whom he knew only as `Boh Gay`. In court he did identify Ong as the person whom he knew as `Boh Gay`. Azmi had taken his first supply of ten sachets at the price of $900 from Ong around 6 November 1993. However, when Ong delivered the ten sachets of heroin to Azmi at the car park of Blk 108 around 6 November 1993, Azmi was able to pay him only $200 and promised to pay the balance of $700 later. Ong did not object to this.
A day or two before 3 December 1993, Azmi decided to replenish his supply of heroin although at that time he still had three sachets of heroin left. He decided on this because he had some money with him. So he contacted Ong and told him that he wanted to buy 15 sachets of heroin. Ong asked Azmi whether he would be paying the $700 he still owed. Azmi proposed that he would pay for the 15 sachets in full, ie $1,350 and $400 towards the $700 he owed. Ong agreed. The delivery was set for 3 December at 7am at the car park of Blk 108.
On 3 December 1993 at around 7am, Azmi was awaken by his pager going off. He immediately got up and went down to the car park of Blk 108 taking the $1,750 with him to wait for Ong. Ong arrived driving his green Audi car and stopped when he saw Azmi. Azmi then handed Ong the $1,750 and Ong handed Azmi a plastic bag which Ong said contained 25 packets of heroin. When Azmi said that he wanted only 15 packets, Ong asked him to keep the ten extra packets which Ong said he would collect later when he was free. Azmi did not question Ong further. He took the plastic bag from Ong, which Ong told him contained 25 packets of heroin and Azmi walked back to Blk 108. Ong then drove off. When Azmi was about to enter the lift at Blk 108, he was arrested by a CNB officer, who we now know was Insp Chow, and taken up to flat #02-161. We have already recited the evidence of Azmi`s arrest by Insp Chow and the events following his arrest up to the time Azmi and the drug exhibits seized from Azmi were taken to CNB headquarters later that day at about 2pm. It is not necessary for us to repeat it again as Azmi`s account does not materially differ from the prosecution`s account on which our earlier summary of this evidence was based.
There are, however, other aspects of Azmi`s evidence that we must mention. One aspect relates to Azmi`s evidence as to when he last consumed heroin before his arrest on the morning of 3 December 1993. His evidence was that he consumed `about four to five straws on 2 December`. The `last straw ... I believe was at about 9pm on 2 December`. This evidence in our view is material because it will be recollected that at about 4.45pm on 3 December 1993, as Insp Chew testified, both Ong and Azmi complained of the effects of heroin withdrawal and were sent to Changi Prison Hospital where they were warded for observation and treatment. It was not denied by the prosecution that Azmi was given some medication to alleviate the effects of heroin withdrawal and that he was discharged from Changi Prison Hospital on 6 December 1993. This evidence was relied on by Azmi to support his contention that he was at least a mild heroin addict, if not more than a mild heroin addict.
The other aspect of Azmi`s evidence was his retraction of the oral admission he made to Insp Chow that sometimes when his friends came to him for heroin, he would sell them a packet for $90. He flatly denied that he had said any such thing to Insp Chow soon after his arrest when he was questioned by Insp Chow in his flat.
Azmi was cross-examined at length by the learned DPP on his evidence generally and in particular on the extent of his heroin addiction, his rate of consumption, his financial ability to support his addiction and his retraction of his oral admission referred to in the paragraph above. It is not necessary for us to rehearse the answers given by Azmi. Suffice it that we quote from the grounds of decision how the learned judge evaluated the whole of Azmi`s evidence. He said: 
 
The prosecutor cross-examined him (Azmi) at some length. Under cross-examination, he said he used one sachet every three to five days and that he and Julaina would consume six to seven sachets a month.
 
 
 
He was asked to elaborate on the order he placed and the drugs he received. He said he placed an order with the first accused (Ong) on 2 December for 15 sachets but when the first accused made delivery on 3 December, the first accused said he thought he had wanted more. When he told him that he did not want the ten extra sachets, the first accused said he will come back later to collect them, but he did not say when he would do that. This contradicted his cautioned statement which said that `he would collect the drugs from me in four to five days time`. Confronted with the contradiction, he gave two inconsistent explanations. First he said Inspector Chow told him to say that, then he said that he fabricated that because Inspector Chow did not believe what he said.
The prosecutor also brought his attention that the reference to the outstanding $700 in the cautioned statement contradicted his evidence that he had repaid $400. His answer was that `since it was only a concoction on my part, it can`t be true.`
The second accused admitted that he lied to Dr Leow at the Changi Prison Hospital when he told the doctor that he consumed 15 to 16 straws of heroin a day. His explanation was that he lied because Dr Leow did not believe that he was having withdrawal symptoms.
The second accused also said that he was not present when the photographs of the bag and its contents were taken, contrary to Insp Chow`s unchallenged evidence that he was there.
The second accused called his father, Haji Tuki bin Nah-Bi as a witness. His evidence, however only touched on peripheral matters which had no bearing on the issues of the case.
We will pause here to observe that the relevance of Azmi`s father`s evidence was to show that Azmi was employed by his father as a driver and was paid a salary since Azmi himself was unable to say when he was last gainfully employed before his arrest on 3 December 1993. It was relevant to show that Azmi had the means to support his heroin addiction. However, it seems to us that the learned judge did not, and rightly so, accept Azmi`s father`s evidence. Azmi`s father`s evidence was that he was a grass-cutter. There was no substance in his evidence from which it could be gathered how he was able to pay Azmi `between $40 and $50 per day`. We could not find any credibility in his statement that he gave Azmi $2,000 as salary for September and October 1993 and apparently the learned judge did not also or else he could not have dismissed his evidence as touching on peripheral matters which had no bearing on the issues of the case.
Be that so, the learned judge went on to say in his grounds of decision: 
 
Inspector Chow`s evidence was that he admitted paying $70 a sachet and $1,750 in all for the bag. This worked out to 25 sachets. The second accused had denied saying that, and had said in his cautioned statement and his evidence in court that he bought 15 sachets to be consumed by him and his girlfriend and was holding ten sachets for the first accused.
 
 
 
However, cracks in his credibility were exposed by the inconsistencies in his evidence and his admitted lies that I had referred to. I accepted Inspector Chow`s evidence that he admitted that he paid $1,750 for the drugs at $70 a sachet, and I rejected the claim that he bought the drugs solely for his own use with Julaina.
Hence, the learned judge found as a fact that Azmi had received from Ong the entire quantity of 25 packets of heroin found in `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` at the car park of Blk 108 on 3 December 1993 at about 7am and that the entire quantity of the 25 packets of heroin were for his own account. With this finding, we entirely agree. It is fully supported by the evidence in the case taken as a whole.
In the court below, it was submitted that on the evidence as found by the learned judge, Azmi could not in law be said to have transported the 25 packets of heroin. It will be remembered that initially Azmi was charged with being in possession of the 25 packets of heroin and that by virtue of s 17 of the Act (before it was amended on 10 December 1993) had trafficked in the same by offering to sell, deliver or distribute, but at the end of the prosecution`s case the learned judge amended the charge to trafficking in the 25 packets of heroin by transporting them. The evidence showed that the act of transporting was the carrying of the 25 packets of heroin from the car park of Blk 108 to Blk 108 en route to his flat in that block of flats. Clearly Azmi was in physical possession of the 25 packets of heroin and was in the act of conveying them to his flat. He was in that sense transporting the 25 packets of heroin.
The law on trafficking by transportation was dealt with by the Privy Council in and extensively reviewed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in and is summarized in the headnote (1) of the latter case as follows: 
 
Whether an act of conveyance of drugs amounts to trafficking by transportation depends on the purpose of the conveyance at the time of the conveyance. This purpose is not determined by reference to the intended use at the intended destination but by the ultimate intended use of the drugs. If the purpose is furthering or advancing distribution of the drugs, then the conveyance amounts to transporting under the Act. However, if they are solely for the use of the transporter and it is never intended that possession is to be parted with, whether at the intended destination or otherwise, then the conveyance does not amount to trafficking. The correct test is the state of mind of the transporter at the time he was transporting the drugs. This is so whether the accused is arrested during the transportation or later.
 
 
 
We also agree with the learned judge`s approach on the question. He said: 
 
When a person is in possession of more than two grammes of diamorphine, a statutory presumption arises. At the time of the alleged offences, the presumption under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act was that he was trafficking the drug. A person in possession of more than two grammes of diamorphine while transporting it is therefore deemed to be trafficking the drug he transported. Consequently, the burden was on the second accused to rebut the presumption by showing, on a balance of probabilities, that he was not trafficking the 25 sachets of diamorphine.
 
 
 
Azmi chose to rebut that presumption by his evidence that only 15 packets of those 25 packets of heroin were for his own and his girlfriend`s consumption; and also by his own evidence of the rate of his and his girlfriend`s consumption of heroin. He contended that the balance of ten packets of heroin were to be returned to Ong. But the learned judge did not accept this evidence. He did not find Azmi`s evidence on that aspect of the matter to be credible. He found that the entire quantity of the 25 packets of heroin were for Azmi`s own account. We agree with this finding. The learned judge also found that Azmi had admitted to Insp Chow that he would sell heroin to his friends when they came to him for heroin at $90 per packet. With this finding also, we agree. Thus on his own admission, Azmi was not transporting the entire quantity of the packets of heroin for his own and his girlfriend`s consumption. This, in our judgment, was admission of trafficking. Azmi, in our view, had not rebutted the presumption that he was transporting the 25 packets of heroin for the purposes of trafficking. The fact that some of the quantity of heroin may have been for his own and his girlfriend`s consumption would not rebut the presumption in the light of his own admission that he would sell to his friends when they came to him for heroin at $90 per packet. Furthermore, as we have said, we found Azmi`s evidence of the rate of his consumption of heroin vague so much so that no reliance could be placed on it. In our view, it was exaggerated. His evidence of his girlfriend`s rate of consumption of heroin was even more vague. Azmi`s evidence that he decided to replenish his supply of heroin on 3 December 1993 `because he had some money with him` does not bear examination. His claim that he worked as a tourist guide after he stopped working for his father in October was unsubstantiated. His father`s evidence that he paid Azmi $2,000 as back pay in October was not accepted either by the learned judge or by us. The fact that he could not pay Ong in full for the quantity of heroin he took from Ong in November 1993 and that he still owed Ong $300 for the November supply places in serious doubt his ability to purchase 25 packets of heroin or even 15 packets of heroin for that matter on 3 December 1993 for his own consumption. The ease with which Ong gave Azmi credit also raises a doubt as to whether Azmi was really purchasing heroin from Ong for his own consumption.
Our evaluation of Azmi`s evidence on the totality of it is that he supported his recently acquired habit of heroin consumption by trafficking in heroin by selling to his friends when they came to him for heroin at $90 per packet. It will be remembered that on his own evidence he started consuming heroin in August 1993 by consuming one 3-cm straw per day. In the absence of more credible and supporting evidence from Azmi it is difficult to believe that in four months his heroin consumption had increased from one 3-cm straw per day to six or seven 3-cm straws per day, depending on his craving. In our judgment, even on the lowest standard of proof, Azmi has not rebutted the presumption that he was transporting the 25 packets of heroin for the purpose of trafficking by his evidence of consumption.
However, the learned judge took a different approach. In his grounds of decision, he said: 
 
I accepted that some portion of the 25 sachets purchased that day was intended for consumption by the second accused (Azmi) and his girlfriend. This should be taken into account as there was evidence that they were both consumers. Though I did not accept that all the sachets were meant for their consumption, an allowance had to be made for that. In my assessment an allowance of one month`s requirement (seven sachets not taking into account the three sachets left over from the last purchase) would be fair and reasonable, since his November and December purchases were made less than a month apart. On that basis, there was a balance of 18 sachets from the 25 sachets purchased, with a pro-rated diamorphine content of not less than 21.29g.
 
 
 
It was not necessary for me to fix a figure on the weight, as any weight above 15 g would have brought on the same penalty. I amended the charge against the second accused by changing the weight from not less than 29.57 g to `more than 15 g and not more than 29.57 g` and found him guilty and convicted him on it.
With respect to the learned judge, that in our view was an erroneous approach. It was erroneous because there was no reliable evidence of the rate of consumption of heroin much less the rate of his girlfriend`s rate of consumption. There was no evidence at all of the purity of the heroin Azmi and his girlfriend were in the habit of consuming. There was no evidence at all of the purity of the heroin contained in the 25 packets. There was no evidence at all of the manner in which Azmi and his girlfriend consumed the heroin, that is to say whether they smoked it, `chased the dragon` with it (ie inhaled), injected themselves with it or swallowed it. In our judgment, the learned judge`s assessment of seven sachets of heroin for Azmi`s and his girlfriend`s consumption for one month was conjectural; there was no factual basis to make such an assessment. There were too many variable components to make any such assessment meaningful. As Mr Peter Fernando, in criticizing the learned judge`s apportionment, submitted to us, why seven sachets for a month`s supply and not ten or more? What evidence was there except for what Azmi said that he and his girlfriend had consumed seven sachets from the previous month`s supply, leaving three remaining? It was equally consistent that Azmi and his girlfriend had not consumed seven sachets in November but had sold some of it to some of his friends as it was his evidence that he would sell some heroin to his friends when they came to him for it. Furthermore there was no evidence that each packet of heroin was separately weighed or analysed. It would be wrong to assume that the diamorphine content in each of the 25 packets of heroin was exactly the same. Then again Azmi said in his evidence that he replenished his supply of heroin because he had some money. He could have been buying a two months` supply instead of one month`s as Mr Fernando suggested. It was all speculation. In the light of these comments, we found Mr Peter Fernando`s submission that a more favourable apportionment to Azmi ought to have been made which would result in Azmi being convicted of possession or in the alternative of trafficking in less than 15g of diamorphine wholly unmeritorious.
In the unreported case of , where a submission was made to this court that the learned judge in that case had seriously erred in not making an apportionment of a quantity of heroin in the possession of a known addict as to what proportion was for his own consumption and what proportion would be trafficked in, this court said: 
 
Lastly Mr Kumar urged upon us that the learned judge had seriously erred in not apportioning a part of the 29.63g of diamorphine for the appellant`s own consumption in view of his finding that the appellant was a drug addict and needed some of the drugs for his own consumption. The substance of this submission is that, had the learned judge done so it could have resulted in the learned judge finding that at least half or more was for his own consumption in which case he could not be trafficking in more than 15g of the diamorphine and would not be subject to the penalty of death. We find no merit in this submission. There was no evidence or sufficient evidence before the learned judge of the appellant`s rate of consumption of heroin or of the purity of the heroin he consumed. Any such exercise would have been an exercise in futility and purely whimsical. In our judgment the learned judge was right not to have considered it at all.
 
 
 
These observations are equally applicable to this appeal. The learned judge, in our judgment, ought not to have embarked on the apportionment he did. It follows that he ought not to have amended the charge to one of trafficking in more than 15g and not more than 29.57g but should have convicted Azmi of the charge of trafficking in not less than 29.57g of diamorphine.
In the result, we are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no break in the chain of evidence identifying `the white plastic bag with red dragon motifs` containing three airmail envelopes which in total contained the 25 packets of heroin which were recovered from Azmi by Insp Chow on 3 December 1993 and that sent by Insp Chew on 6 December 1993 to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis and certified to contain not less than 29.57g of diamorphine, the subject matter of the charges against Ong and Azmi. We are also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Azmi has failed on a balance of probabilities to rebut the presumption that he was transporting the 25 packets of heroin for the purpose of trafficking in them. Accordingly, we dismiss the appeals of Ong, the first appellant, and Azmi, the second appellant, and confirm the sentences of death passed on each of them by the learned judge.

The appellant was convicted on two counts of aggravated outraging of modesty under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The appellant was a supervisor at Sardi`s Restaurant (Sardi`s). The complainant, who was 20 years old, worked as a waitress at Sardi`s from 5 September 1994 to 14 September 1994. This was a period of some 11 days.
The first charge alleged that on 14 September 1994 at about 4.55pm at Sardi`s, the appellant used criminal force on the complainant intending to outrage her modesty, to wit, by pressing his hand against one of her breasts and by pressing his private part against the complainant`s buttocks. It was alleged that, in order to commit this offence, the appellant wrongfully restrained the complainant by hugging her body tightly.
The second charge alleged that at the same place and about the same time, the appellant committed a similar offence by kissing the complainant`s right ear and neck region and rubbing his private part against hers. Again, wrongful restraint was alleged.
The appellant refused to mitigate in the court below and was sentenced to two years and seven months` imprisonment and four strokes of the cane on each charge. The prison terms were to run concurrently. The appellant appealed to this court against conviction only.
After hearing counsel for the appellant and the deputy public prosecutor, I allowed the appellant`s appeal. I now give the grounds for the decision.
 The evidence in the court below
The main plank of the prosecution`s case was the evidence of the complainant. She testified that on 14 September, she started work at 12 noon. The appellant was her supervisor. Another supervisor was one Lena. At about 4.45pm, while the complainant was working at the dining area of Sardi`s, the appellant allegedly called her over to the bar counter. The complainant alleged that the appellant then asked her if she had a friend who worked as a call-girl. The complainant said `no`. Whereupon the appellant hugged the complainant from behind. While doing so, he allegedly touched the complainant`s body, breasts and buttocks. The complainant said that she told him to let go. She asked him why he did that. When she wanted to leave, he touched her breast again. The complainant said that she felt the appellant`s private part on her buttocks.
Thereafter, the complainant went to her locker to change as it was nearly time for her break. When she came out of the toilet, she saw the appellant entering the corridor to go to the men`s toilet. The appellant allegedly hugged the complainant tightly again. She was surprised and covered her face with the apron she was holding. The appellant pressed his private part against hers. He also kissed her on the right ear and neck. The complainant testified that she told the appellant to release her and that if he did not, she would scream. This alleged second incident could not be seen from the dining area as there was a common door which was closed.
The complainant told the court that when she asked the appellant to let her go, the appellant said, `Why should I there is nobody around.` She pushed him and asked him a second time to release her. She finally managed to push him away. She went straight to the kitchen and put her things in her locker. She then went off for her break.
About an hour later, the complainant returned from her break. She did not see the appellant again that evening. She continued her work. The complainant said that during the first incident, she did not know where Lena was. After that, she saw that Lena was at the cashier`s counter. Before finishing her work, she told one `aunty` who was working in the kitchen that the appellant touched her. She did not tell anybody else until she went home.
The next day, the complainant told her sister, Zaiton, as she could not sleep that night. This was at about 2pm. The complainant told Zaiton that she had something to tell her regarding the complainant`s work. She did not tell Zaiton what happened over the telephone but did that when she went over to Zaiton`s shop. Zaiton then took the complainant to the police post at Bukit Batok to make a police report. After that, the complainant did not go back to work at Sardi`s.
Cross-examined, the complainant said that it did not occur to her during the first incident to scream. This was because there was nobody around. She maintained that though there were people working in the kitchen, there was nobody in the dining area. When she saw Lena, she did not complain to her as she did not know Lena well. She was also confused and was afraid that Lena would not believe her as she did not see what had happened. When pressed further, she said that she would not know whether Lena saw the incident. She merely assumed that it was the case as there was nobody around.
The complainant said that she was the only waitress left, as at about 4.30pm the rest had gone out for their break. She could not remember who was working that day.
During the second incident, she did not scream as she was in a confined area. According to her, it was useless for her to scream. She did not go back into the toilet because she was afraid that he would follow her in. So she tried to walk past him. Even though she knew that there was nobody there, she threatened to scream as she wanted to scare the appellant so that he would let go. On both occasions she raised her voice so that she was speaking louder than normal.
In her opinion, her voice would not carry from the bar counter to the cashier`s counter as there was piped in music. The distance was about eight metres. After the second incident, she ran out of the toilet area. The appellant allegedly called her back but she went into the kitchen. There were two persons in the kitchen but she did not tell them about the incidents. This was because there was nothing they could do. She told `aunty` later because she knew her better. However, the complainant did not know her name and could only guess her age as around 40.
During the break, she walked around. She was still fearful of the appellant. At the time, she was confused and did not think of calling anyone. She went back to work as she felt that she needed to return to work. At that time, she did not know if the appellant was still there. She worked for about two more hours. She did not tell anyone else at the restaurant. She did not know why she told `aunty` about the incident.
When the complainant went home, she did not tell her parents as they might worry. They were sleeping at the time. The next day, she worked up at about noon. Nobody was in the house then.
Zaiton gave evidence that, on 15 September 1994 at about 2pm, the complainant called her to say that she had a problem and needed to talk to her. Zaiton told the complainant to go to Zaiton`s work place. At about 3pm, when the complainant arrived, she was in tears and was quite angry. Zaiton asked her why and the complainant told her what happened. The complainant told Zaiton that she had a problem with her supervisor and that her supervisor molested her. Zaiton asked the complainant why she did not scream and she answered that this was because the appellant was holding her tightly and that there was nobody around. Zaiton then told the complainant to report the incidents to the police.
Zaiton said that she asked the complainant why she did not tell her parents. The complainant told her that their mother was having heart problems that day and that she did not wish to worry her. So far as Zaiton knew, the complainant had no boyfriend.
Corporal Gunasegarar presented a sketch plan of Sardi`s. The partition behind the cashier`s counter had a wooden partition of 130 cm and a top glass panel of 40 cm. The glass was not of clear glass. In his view, someone at the dining area would not be able to `see exactly` what happened at the bar counter. However, he thought such a person would be able to see the figures of the persons at the counter. The same is true of someone seated at the cashier`s counter. A conversation at the bar counter at a higher voice than normal 
 will 
 be heard by the cashier.
No other witness was called by the prosecution. The identity of `aunty` was not made known to the defence.
The appellant, on the other hand, told the court that on 14 September 1994, he was working at Sardi`s. At about 3pm, he called the complainant over to the bar counter as something appeared to be troubling her. He was concerned as she was his subordinate. He did not like his subordinates to work with a sad face. The complainant asked the appellant if he had a girlfriend. The complainant then told her that she had a quarrel with her boyfriend of three years. She was almost in tears, so the appellant tapped her shoulders to console her. He maintained that apart from tapping the complainant on her shoulder, no part of his body came into contact with the complainant. The conversation lasted about ten minutes.
At about 5pm, he went to the toilet. When he was entering the men`s toilet, he saw the complainant coming out of the ladies` toilet. She was still upset, so he told her not to be upset. There was no physical contact with the complainant.
The appellant`s statements taken under s 121 and s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) were admitted as evidence. In both of them, he denied committing the offences. In his s 121 statement, the appellant said that occasionally when he talked to the complainant, he might have touched her arms. It was his habit to do so. He could not recall any encounter between the complainant and himself which was in any way sexual. He could not recall any vivid event that happened on 14 September 1994. The statements were made on 18 October 1994.
After 6pm, when dinner was served, the appellant did notice the complainant in the restaurant. The appellant explained that he did not mention what took place on 14 September 1994 to the police because he was only called up by the police after his reservist training. He was told that a waitress accused him of molesting her, which he denied to the police. When asked at the time whether he recalled the two incidents at the bar counter and outside the toilets, he said there was nothing to recall. He was able to recall what happened on 14 September only after he was told by counsel to recollect what happened that day, and after thinking about it. His explanation for saying in the statement that he could not recall the events on 14 September was that the officers had kept on accusing him of molesting the waitress and that he had kept on denying it. He would say the same thing if the allegations had said that he committed the offences on 13 September 1994, or any other day. This was because, to him, all the dates were the same as nothing had happened.
The appellant`s father, Khoo Sin Cheong (Khoo), was called to give evidence on the complainant`s demeanour on that fateful day. He told the court that he saw the complainant at about 6pm that day. Khoo was the food and beverage manager at Sardi`s. Normally, he would not be able to describe her behaviour. She behaved ordinarily as though nothing was wrong. The appellant was sometimes quite strict to the waiters and waitresses.
Khoo said that the complainant was a new worker for about ten days. He felt that she had a strange behaviour and was lazy at work. He did not observe this strange behaviour on 14 September. He then said that the strange behaviour was that she stood there and did not work. This was also observed on the morning of 14 September. He did not notice any change when he saw her after 6pm. He did not know why she did not turn up for work on 15 September. She never called at all. He did not ask her why she quit.
Chan Mei Fong (Chan) gave evidence that she works at Sardi`s. She worked there on 14 September 1994. Every day before leaving Sardi`s, she would go to the toilet. This would be between 4.45pm to 5pm. There was only one toilet the staff used. On that day, she did not notice anything happening at the toilet. She usually spent five minutes at the toilet. However, it was quite clear that she was only relating her normal routine and could not remember what happened on 14 September 1994.
Quek Lye King (Quek) testified that he worked at Sardi`s as a part-time waiter. He is still working there. He remembered seeing an album of the complainant and her boyfriend. The complainant did not tell him about her relationship with the boyfriend. He also said that he could remember that the appellant told him that the complainant had broken off with her boyfriend. He could not be sure if the complainant stopped working the following day. The complainant did not personally tell him about it.
 The finding below
The district judge held that this case essentially involved the words of the complainant against those of the appellant. He was also aware that sexual offences are easy to allege and very difficult to rebut. The court therefore had to be very careful. Nevertheless he was convinced beyond all reasonable doubt that the complainant was telling the truth and the appellant was an untruthful witness.
He held that it was desirable to have some corroboration in sexual offences. However, the court could convict without corroboration if it was totally convinced of the truth of the victim`s testimony. The complainant`s testimony in this case was corroborated by the testimony of her sister and the making of the police report. Section 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) was relied on.
The district judge held that the complainant`s apparent distress when relating the incidents to her sister was not corroboration as it was observed some 20 hours after the alleged incident. There were many intervening events.
The district judge accepted the complainant`s explanation for not screaming. She was shocked, frightened and confused. The appellant also admitted that there was nobody around. He also accepted her explanation for not making a police report at the time of her break. She was also confused then.
In the district judge`s view, no adverse inference ought to be drawn against the prosecution for not calling `aunty`. was relied on for the proposition that the prosecution had a discretion whether or not to call a particular witness, provided there was no ulterior motive in the decision. In this case, the district judge was not sure whether `aunty` was a prosecution witness in the sense that a statement was recorded from her. Even if she was, there was no ulterior motive on the part of the prosecution for not calling her.
Furthermore, he was of the view that the appellant`s demeanour and testimony in court showed that he was untruthful. The reasons were that the appellant`s story about what happened could not be true as the complainant did not have a boyfriend. Moreover, the appellant did not mention this when the police statements were recorded from him. Section 123 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) was referred to. Also, in his statement, the appellant stated that he could not remember what happened on 14 September. Yet, in court, he could remember in detail what happened. He was evasive when asked why. Also, his testimony that there was no physical contact outside the toilets was different from his instruction to counsel as can be seen by counsel putting to the complainant that the appellant patted her on her shoulder. The appellant also said in the police statement that he may have touched the complainant`s arms. However, in court, he said he patted her shoulders. In the district judge`s view, this was a material difference.
The district judge was convinced that all the appellant`s lies were deliberate and related to material issues. These indicated a consciousness of guilt. These were corroboration of his guilt. was relied on.
He was satisfied of Zaiton`s impartiality although she was the complainant`s sister. If the complainant had a boyfriend for three years, she would have known of it. There was no reason to disbelieve her as she would not know the importance of the question to the defence.
If what the appellant said was true, there would be no reason for the complainant to bring a false allegation against him as he was a caring supervisor who showed concern. Her subsequent abrupt resignation and lodging of the police report was incongruous with the appellant`s testimony. She would not have sacrificed her job if the appellant had not molested her.
In the district judge`s view, Khoo was also untruthful. He first said that the complainant had no `strange behaviour` in the morning. Then he said that she had a strange behaviour. He could not explain the contradiction. Khoo meant that the complainant`s strange behaviour was that she stood there and did not work and that she was lazy. However, the appellant`s description of her was that she was a new worker and was a little bit slow in her work. The appellant also said that she was responsive to his instructions. The two descriptions were therefore different. Furthermore, Khoo could not possibly have remembered an ordinary day more than five months ago.
Chan`s evidence was not useful as she merely said what she normally did. She could not remember what happened on 14 September. In any event, the incident lasted only a short time and it could have occurred without her noticing it.
The district judge also disbelieved Quek. The complainant was not close to the staff there and there was no reason for her to show him a photograph of herself and her boyfriend. In any event, she did not have a boyfriend.
For these reasons, the district judge disbelieved the appellant. There was no reason for the complainant to bring false evidence against the appellant who admitted that he did not know why she would lie in court.
 The appeal
Before me, counsel for the appellant raised several grounds of appeal. First, he made the unremarkable submission that, in a criminal case such as this, the burden is on the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. A conviction cannot stand even if the allegations as a whole `may be true`. It can only be sustained if it `must be true`. Secondly, he argued that evidence in corroboration must be independent. He conceded that it is settled law in Singapore that the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) would allow the evidence of Zaiton to be corroborative of that of the complainant`s. However, he submitted that the court should view such evidence with much circumspection as Zaiton`s evidence was not independent of the complainant`s. Hence, the weight to be attached to it should be less than what it would have been had Zaiton`s evidence been totally independent. Thirdly, counsel submitted that the district judge ought to have drawn an adverse inference under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act against the prosecution for failing to call `aunty`. In addition, counsel submitted that the district judge erred when he held that the appellant`s lies amounted to corroboration. Lastly, he addressed me on the evidence that was presented below.
It is apparent from the evidence presented in the trial below that this case involved, in all material aspects, only the bare allegation of the complainant against the bare denial of the appellant. No doubt, several other issues were raised in the trial below, some of them by the appellant. Nevertheless, none of these other issues are really material. In my view, it is important in a case of this nature, to scrutinize the evidence with great care, and to bear in mind at all times that essentially all that is before the court is a bare allegation and a bare denial. The court should be vigilant against being sidetracked by irrelevant issues.
In , Rigby J expressed the view that in cases of sexual offences, it is unsafe to convict where there is no independent evidence.
In , the same view had been enunciated by Spenser-Wilkinson J. There, he said at p 33: 
 
Whilst there is no rule of law in this country that in sexual offences the evidence of the complainant must be corroborated; nevertheless it appears to me, as a matter of common sense, to be unsafe to convict in cases of this kind unless either the evidence of the complainant is unusually convincing or there is some corroboration of the complainant`s story. It would be sufficient, in my view, if that corroboration consisted only of a subsequent complaint by the complainant herself provided that the statement implicated the accused and was made at the first reasonable opportunity after the commission of the offence.
 
 
 
So far as the complainant`s recent complaints to Zaiton and the police are concerned, s 159 of the Evidence Act states: 
 
In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.
 
 
 
Now, it is not controversial that the complainant`s previous complaint to her sister and the lodging of the police report are technically corroboration, in view of s 159 of the Evidence Act. However, the fact remains that these are not corroboration by independent evidence. All the complaints originated from the complainant. They therefore have little additional evidential value. Otherwise, by the same token, the appellant`s previous denials made to the police are also technically corroboration under s 159 of the Evidence Act.
In the classic case of , Lord Reading CJ emphasized that in order for evidence to amount to corroboration, the evidence must be independent of the testimony which is sought to be corroborated. It is clear that had it not been for s 159 of the Evidence Act, a recent complaint cannot be corroboration of the complainant`s testimony. This was so held in . The reason simply is that the complaint originated from the complainant as well, and is not independent.
The position in Singapore is of course as stated in . Hence, a previous complaint goes beyond the question of consistency and is admissible evidence. In my view, although s 159 has the effect of elevating a recent complaint to corroboration, the court should nevertheless bear in mind the fact that corroboration by virtue of s 159 alone is 
 not 
 corroboration by 
 independent 
 evidence. It would be dangerous to equate this form of corroboration with corroboration in the normal sense of the word. I can see no reason why a s 159 corroboration of a complainant`s testimony should necessarily carry more weight than a s 159 corroboration of the accused`s denial. Both appear to me to be equally self-serving.
Hence, I agree with counsel`s submission that the court should treat Zaiton`s evidence with great circumspection. Despite s 159, Zaiton`s evidence is no more weighty that the appellant`s s 121 and s 122(6) statements. It would be erroneous to attach to them such weight as would have been the case had they been independent evidence. Thus, I am of the view that even though there was technically corroboration of the complainant`s allegations, the corroboration is not of sufficient weight to materially affect the fact that all there is before the court is essentially the bare allegation of the complainant.
In my view, in a case such as this, the observation in 
 Balwant Singh 
 should normally apply. For this reason, if Spenser-Wilkinson J meant in that a mere corroboration by virtue of s 159 is sufficient to remove the caution that the complainant`s testimony must be unusually convincing, then I respectfully disagree. If the complainant`s evidence is not unusually convincing, I cannot see how the fact that she repeated it several times can add much to its weight. I am of the view that even though a previous complaint goes beyond the question of consistency in Singapore, it normally does not go very far, so far as its weight is concerned.
As for 
 Teo Eng Chan 
, the facts of that case must be borne in mind. That was a case of rape. The victim had previously put up strenuous resistance and had successfully prevented one Teo from having sexual intercourse with her or of making major advances preliminary to sexual intercourse with her on a bed in the privacy of a bedroom. Furthermore, she was able to resist him for half an hour. The defence`s contention that she consented to having sexual intercourse with the four accused, including Teo, would require the court to accept that two days after the incident, the victim would consent to four persons, including a perfect stranger, having sex with her across three seats in the cabin of a lorry in a dark and deserted quarry. As Coomaraswamy J said in that case, accepting it would go against the grain of logic and common sense. That was a case where the defence was so obviously specious that the court could safely convict even without corroboration. In any case, there was other corroborative evidence against three of the accused.
In any event, whether the complainant did or did not make an earlier complaint is of little evidential value either way here. The complainant did relate the alleged incident to her sister the day after and did subsequently lodge a police report. This is hardly a case where the complainant took an exceptionally long time. In this respect, 
 Teo Eng Chan 
 is also relevant. On the other hand, the fact that she did relate the matter to her sister can hardly strengthen the prosecution`s case, otherwise all a complainant has to do is to repeat her allegations several times to different people. The making of the police report is neither here nor there because, if the complainant had not made a police report, there would have been no prosecution and hence no trial! Of course, if what a complainant says in court is materially different from what she told the witnesses, then different considerations apply.
Turning to the question of the appellant`s defence, I am of the view that whether the complainant did or did not have a boyfriend is totally immaterial and is of little relevance. Even if the complainant did not have a boyfriend and the incident alleged by the appellant did not happen, the appellant could still nevertheless be innocent of the charges. Similarly, even if the alleged incident about relating her boyfriend troubles to the appellant did happen and she did have a boyfriend, it would still be possible for the appellant to have molested the complainant. Whether the complainant had or had not a boyfriend and whether the appellant did or did not console the complainant and tapped her shoulders simply had no bearing at all to the relevant issue. This issue remains whether the appellant molested the complainant as alleged.
As this matter is immaterial and irrelevant, there was no reason to expect the appellant to disclose this when making the s 122(6) statements. That being the case, it would be quite improper to draw an adverse inference against the appellant for failing to mention it. Section 123(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code states: 
 
Where in any criminal proceedings against a person for an offence evidence is given that the accused, on being charged with the offence or officially informed that he might be prosecuted for it, failed to mention any such fact, 
 being a fact which in the circumstances existing at the time he could reasonably have been expected to mention
 when so charged or informed, as the case may be, the court, in determining whether to commit the accused for trial or whether there is a case to answer, and in the court, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences from the failure as appear proper; and the failure may, on the basis of those inferences, be treated as, or as capable of amounting to corroboration of any evidence given against the accused 
 in relation to which failure is material.
 [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In this case, the appellant had already denied the charges in the police statements. That is the only 
 material 
 thing he could have said. As the appellant said, whether the allegations against him related to 14 September or some other day was immaterial to him because as far as he was concerned, nothing happened at all on 14 September or any other day. Therefore whether the appellant did console the complainant on 14 September is quite immaterial. It may well be that the appellant was confused about when this incident took place. Hence, no adverse inference should have been drawn against the appellant by the district judge.
As the alleged incident about consoling the complainant could have happened on any day and is in any event immaterial, it would be quite explicable for the appellant to be unable to remember the event when he was in the police station. As for his testimony in court, it could very well be the case that the appellant was mistaken as to the date when it happened simply because it was immaterial. His attempt to place it as happening on 14 September instead of any other day is understandable, for otherwise he could only make a bare denial in court.
As it is, the appellant did make the allegation in court. Nevertheless, the fact remains that it was immaterial and irrelevant. Thus, all the defence had was essentially only a bare denial.
That being the case, the discrepancy between the appellant`s testimony in court that he did not touch the complainant outside the toilets and counsel`s question to the complainant that the appellant only tapped her on the shoulders is quite immaterial. Furthermore, at best it is only a minor inconsistency. With the greatest respect to the district judge, I am unable to see how the difference between touching the complainant on the shoulders and on the arms can be said to be a material inconsistency on the facts of this case. It was never part of the allegations against the appellant and was hence not relevant, much less material.
In any event, I must respectfully disagree with the district judge`s finding that the complainant did not have a boyfriend. I am of the view there is insufficient evidence to come to the conclusion. The only evidence is Zaiton`s statement that, to her knowledge, the complainant did not have a boyfriend. This is at best an equivocal answer. Furthermore, it is questionable whether it can be inferred from this that the complainant had no boyfriend. There is no reason why Zaiton could not have been unaware of it if the complainant did have a boyfriend for three years. It is also pertinent to note that when it was put to the complainant that she was unhappy because she had broken up with her boyfriend, she did not once deny that she had a boyfriend. Therefore, to hold that the appellant and Quek could not be believed because the complainant had no boyfriend is, with the greatest respect, putting the cart before the horse.
I must also respectfully disagree with the district judge`s conclusion that the appellant`s lies were deliberate and related to material issues. Even if the appellant lied, these related to immaterial matters. As was stated above, whether the complainant had a boyfriend or not was immaterial. Whether the appellant did console the complainant was also immaterial. , therefore, did not apply. In that case, it was observed at p 876: 
 
The English Court of Appeal in 
[1981] 1 QB 720
 has held that the mere fact that an accused tells lies should not be taken as evidence of his guilt, but that lies can in certain circumstances amount to corroboration because it indicates a consciousness of guilt. Lord Lane CJ held at p 724 that there were four criteria to satisfy before a lie could amount to corroboration:
 
 
 
`The lie ... must first of all be deliberate. Secondly it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly the motive for the lie must be a realization of guilt and a fear of truth ... Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by [independent] evidence ... .`
 
 
 
As the alleged lies here relate to immaterial issues, it can be seen that the second requirement is not satisfied. Therefore the alleged lies cannot amount to corroboration. In any event, there is no clear independent proof that what the appellant had told the court were lies. There is no clear evidence that the complainant had no boyfriend. Therefore the only evidence tending to show that what the appellant had told the court is untrue is only the complainant`s testimony in court. This is not independent evidence. That being the case, the last requirement of the test is also not satisfied. It would hence be circular reasoning to use this to substantiate a finding that the appellant was untruthful. Thus, I am of the view that the alleged lies of the appellant`s cannot amount to corroboration.
It is questionable whether it is proper to assess the appellant`s credibility in a case such as this, where all the appellant can offer is a bare denial, by looking at the performance of the appellant in court when giving evidence on essentially immaterial issues. In this case, the appellant was only questioned by the police more than one month after the event. If what the appellant said was true, it would be unfair to expect him to remember what happened on the day in question, simply because it was an ordinary day. By the same token, the appellant would be placed at a disadvantage because any witness he offers may simply be disbelieved because they should not be able to remember a totally mundane day. The appellant was therefore in a very disadvantaged position.
I now come to the question of the prosecution`s failure to call `aunty`. Section 116 of the Evidence Act states: 
 
The court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business, in relation to the facts of the particular case.
 
 
 
 
 Illustrations
 
 
 
 
The court may presume -
 
 
 
...
(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds it ...
 
 
 
and laid down the proposition that the prosecution has a discretion whether or not to call a particular witness. However, it is important to understand the context in which those cases were decided.
In , the Court of Appeal observed that: 
 
To begin, the prosecution has an undoubted discretion whether or not to call a particular witness, provided that there is no ulterior motive in the decision. A witness who is available to, but not called by the prosecution should be offered to the defence. These principles were reiterated recently in ... .
 
 
 
We were of the view that the essence of the discretion and the duty is to ensure fairness of the trial and to the accused. The prosecution should not conceal material evidence or witnesses from the court. The duty may be discharged, in appropriate cases, by giving the particulars of such witnesses to the defence.
In that case, the witness, one Oi, was not offered to the defence. However, the appellant there was personally acquainted with Oi. Oi had also been offered to the defence at the preliminary inquiry. The prosecution there did not receive any indication from the defence that they required Oi or needed help in tracing her. The fact that Oi was not a witness at the preliminary stage should have alerted the defence that she would not be called or produced at the trial. The absence of Oi was therefore brought about by the inaction on the part of counsel for the appellant there.
Similarly, in , the witnesses had been offered to the appellant. In any event, the appellant`s guilt was proven beyond reasonable doubt even without the witnesses. It was observed at p 266 that: 
 
In our judgment, the law is well settled that, in a criminal case, the prosecution has a discretion whether or not to call a particular witness, provided that there is no ulterior motive and the witness, who is available to, but not called by, the prosecution, is offered to the defence.
 
 
 
However, the facts of the present case are completely different. In this case, not only has the prosecution not offered `aunty` to the defence, but it has not even told them (or the court for that matter) who this `aunty` is. It would therefore be unfair to the defence as the defence would not even know whom to call. The rationale behind 
 Tan Ah Lay 
 and 
 Lim Young Sien 
 is that if the prosecution does not call a particular witness, it is open to the defence to do so. If the prosecution does not even identify this witness, how is the defence going to call her? In my view, the prosecution had not discharged in any way its duty to make `aunty` available to the defence.
No doubt, the existence of `aunty` was apparently not even known until the complainant gave evidence in court. However, that is all the more reason for the prosecution to call `aunty` or make her identity known to the defence. If need be, an adjournment of the trial should have been requested.
Furthermore, the entire case here turns on the credibility of the complainant. If the complainant had not told `aunty` of the incident as she alleged, it would have a very material bearing on the credibility of her testimony. By not calling `aunty` and not making her available to the defence, the defence is put in an invidious position of being unable to rebut a bare allegation by the prosecution`s chief witness. I am therefore of the view that, in order to be fair to the defence, an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the prosecution under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act. Had it not been the case, the appellant would have been unfairly handicapped in the conduct of his defence.
Once an adverse inference is drawn against the prosecution under s 116(g) of the Evidence Act, in the present case, the credibility of the complainant would have been shaken. It would then be very difficult to come to the conclusion that the complainant`s evidence was unusually convincing. In this instance, it would be quite fatal to the prosecution`s case, as well as to the safety of the conviction.
I should mention that the district judge also took the view that the complainant had no reason to bring false evidence against the appellant. The district judge relied on the fact that the appellant was unable to venture a reason why the complainant would lie in court. With the greatest respect, whether the appellant could venture a reason is neither here nor there. In my view, if a trial judge is going to rely on the fact that the complainant had no reason to falsely accuse the appellant, then this should be found as a fact based on credible evidence. There is no evidence at all on this. The burden of proving a lack of motive to falsely implicate the appellant is on the prosecution. Even though the prosecution was making a negative assertion, the burden of proof is still on it. It is not for the defendant to prove that the complainant had some reason to falsely accuse him. This is a fact that would be wholly within the complainant`s knowledge and nobody else`s. The defence therefore cannot be expected to prove this. It would be a circular argument to believe the complainant when she said that she had no reason to falsely accuse the appellant, and then say from that that the complainant is believed because she had no reason to falsely accuse the appellant. It is precisely because there can well be reasons why a complainant would make false allegations against an accused that it is often unsafe to convict in cases of sexual offences where there is no independent evidence to corroborate the complainant`s allegations.
Where a defendant is already greatly disadvantaged in a trial such as this, particular attention must be paid to where the burden of proof lies. A negative assertion by the prosecution must still be proven by the prosecution. Nothing in the Evidence Act shifts this burden to the appellant. The trial judge should therefore not have relied on the unproven assertion that the complainant had no reason to lie when assessing the complainant`s and the appellant`s credibility.
Finally, I should say that I have examined the notes of evidence in this case very carefully. With respect to the district judge, I am not satisfied that the complainant`s evidence in this case is unusually convincing. There were inconsistencies in the complainant`s evidence, some more material than others. Some of these include the complainant`s explanation for not screaming, which showed that this was a result of a conscious decision after assessing the circumstances. This showed she was not confused, as evidenced by her alleged ability to issue a bluff by threatening to scream even though, according to her, there was nobody there. Her behaviour in returning to work after the alleged incident also required some explanation. Her reasons for telling `aunty` and not the others were also suspect. It is also not improbable that she decided not to return to work much earlier than she said she did, because the next day she woke up at 
 noon 
. In any event, she appeared to have slept very soundly. There was also no reason for the complainant to assume that Lena did not see the alleged incident and would not believe her, unless it never happened at all.
No doubt, some of these can be attributed to the pressures of giving evidence in court. However, the same benefit must also be given to the accused when assessing his evidence. Some of the inconsistencies may even be explained by her youth and the much made observation that victims of sexual offences may not always react in a predictable manner. However, I am not satisfied that all of the inconsistencies can be so explained away. In my view, they would certainly raise a reasonable doubt.
In conclusion, although the district judge was initially aware that the case involved the bare allegation of the complainant against the denial of the appellant, it appears that he might have lost sight of this fact when assessing the appellant`s credibility as well as the complainant`s. Inferences were drawn against the appellant which should not have been drawn.
For these reasons, I was not satisfied that the prosecution had proven its case beyond reasonable doubt. The conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal and set aside the convictions and the sentences.

The appellant was tried in the subordinate courts on a charge of having committed an act of gross indecency under s 377A of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He was alleged to have touched the penis, chest, nipples and buttocks of one Koh Geok Soon (Koh) on 13 September 1993 in the X-Ray room of Alexandra Hospital. The charge was amended on the initiative of the magistrate at the close of the prosecution`s case to delete the references to the `chest, nipples and buttocks`. He was convicted of the charge and sentenced to ten months` imprisonment. He has appealed against his conviction and sentence.
 The prosecution`s evidence
At the material time, the appellant was a radiographer, working at Alexandra Hospital. Koh had injured his left wrist while working at Jurong Shipyard. He went to Alexandra Hospital to seek treatment. He was first examined by Dr Mary Ann Phipps at the Accident & Emergency Department. Dr Phipps referred him to the X-ray department for an X-ray of his injured wrist to be taken. The appellant was the radiographer on duty in the X-ray room. There was no one else in the room. The appellant directed Koh to sit on a chair beside the X-ray table and stretch out his left hand. Without any further explanation, the appellant unbuckled Koh`s belt, unhooked and then unzipped his trousers. The appellant lowered Koh`s underwear, exposing his penis and scrotum. He proceeded to place a gonadal shield (the shield) over Koh`s scrotum. While Koh remained seated, the appellant took an X-ray of Koh`s left wrist.
Koh was then asked to lie down on the X-ray table. He did as he was told, with the shield still covering his scrotum. The appellant covered him with a blanket and proceeded to another room. He returned shortly, lowered the blanket, held Koh`s penis and rubbed it once. He commented that Koh`s penis was not circumcised properly. He released Koh`s penis and, after covering him with the blanket again, he left the room again. When he came back a while later, he spoke to Koh in Hokkien and told Koh that he had studied in Japan, where men and women took communal baths and the men could touch the women`s breasts. The appellant then put his hand beneath Koh`s shirt and briefly rubbed Koh`s chest and both his nipples. On removing his hand from Koh`s chest, the appellant asked Koh whether he visited prostitutes, whereupon Koh replied that he was a bachelor. The appellant walked away from the X-ray table and returned with a piece of paper (P2) on which was written `4106619 Henry`, being his pager number and name. He handed P2 to Koh and told him to call him if he was free, but to do so at night. Koh took P2 and kept it in his left trouser pocket.
Koh was still lying on the X-ray table. The appellant turned him onto his left side. He pulled Koh`s trousers and underwear down to expose the anus. He lifted Koh`s right leg to an extent that Koh felt some pain at his anus. He asked Koh whether he suffered from anal piles, and said that anal piles would recur and operations would never be able to eradicate the problem. He asked Koh if he could examine his anus, and, as he spoke, his fingers were touching Koh`s buttocks. Koh told the appellant `no`. The appellant flipped Koh back to his supine position on the X-ray table. He then removed the shield and pulled up Koh`s underwear and trousers. He gave Koh the X-ray film for his wrist and told him to bring it to the doctor.
Koh brought the X-ray to the Accident & Emergency Department. While Dr Phipps examined the X-ray film, Koh enquired whether a person with a hand injury needed an examination of only the hand or the entire body including the penis and anus. Dr Phipps replied that only the hand had to be examined. Koh briefly informed Dr Phipps that the appellant had examined his penis and also wanted to examine his anus. He showed Dr Phipps the piece of paper (P2) which the appellant had given to him. He mentioned that he wanted to lodge a police report. Dr Phipps called for Staff Nurse Tan Kay Lean. After some discussion between Staff Nurse Tan and Koh, Koh proceeded to the Alexandra Hospital Police Post to lodge a complaint. His complaint was noted in the station diary by PC Suhaimi bin Ngapi at 2055 hours. ASP Loke Tuck Whye, the investigating officer, arrived later and interviewed Koh. They subsequently left for Clementi Police Station.
Koh`s evidence was that he had simply gone along with what the appellant did, believing that these were established medical procedures. He did not protest initially at what was done despite his suspicions being aroused. He did, however, refuse to allow the appellant to examine his anus. When he eventually managed to obtain confirmation from Dr Phipps that his injury did not necessitate any examination of the genitals and anus, he became angry and agitated and proceeded to complain about what the appellant had done to him. He clarified in cross-examination that he harboured no grudge against the appellant. Nevertheless, he felt that what the appellant had done would damage the reputation of the hospital and he did not want others to end up in a similar position.
At the close of the prosecution`s case, the defence submitted that there was no case to answer. It was submitted that a charge under s 377A requires the prosecution to prove that the appellant had committed the act of gross indecency `with` Koh. According to the defence, this meant that Koh must have consented to the commission of the offence. This submission was premised on the English Court of Appeal case of . 
 Preece 
 dealt with s 13 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956 (the SOA 1956), which reads: 
 
It is an offence for a man to commit an act of gross indecency with another man, whether in public or private, or to be a party to the commission by a man of an act of gross indecency with another man, or to procure the commission by a man of an act of gross indecency with another man.
 
 
 
Section 377A of our Penal Code states in substantially similar terms: 
 
Any male person who, in public or private, commits, or abets the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any male person of, any act of gross indecency with another male person, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 2 years.
 
 
 
The brief facts in 
 Preece 
 were as follows. Police officers found two men masturbating in adjoining cubicles in a public lavatory. There was a hole in the wall separating the two cubicles, through which it was possible for either occupant of a cubicle to look into the adjoining cubicle. Both the appellants, Preece and Howell, did not know each other and there was no prior arrangement to meet in the lavatory. From the evidence, however, it was clear that they were watching each other masturbate. They were both charged under s 13 of the SOA 1956 and convicted by the trial judge. On appeal, only one aspect of the trial judge`s directions to the jury was challenged. This involved the following statement: 
 
[The second situation contemplates] one man masturbating in public in view of another male spectator who himself commits no indecent act. If the jury is satisfied that the prosecution have proved those facts, and that the masturbation was directed intentionally towards the male spectator, that is sufficient to establish that the first man, the masturbator, committed an act of gross indecency with another man even though the other man, the spectator, did not consent to or approve of it, and the jury should convict the first man but acquit the spectator.
 
 
 
Scarman LJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, opined that `the complete offence requires the participation, the cooperation, of two men.` These words clearly indicated the court`s view that some element of physical reciprocity would have been required. On the facts in 
 Preece 
, the appeals of both Preece and Howell were dismissed, since it was clear that they had both willingly participated in a grossly indecent act in public. It was submitted that, by parity of reasoning, our s 377A requires two male persons to act in concert or with mutual consent. The argument canvassed by the defence was that the use of the preposition `with` meant that consent was an element of the offence of gross indecency itself. Thus, where the facts revealed that an accused (A) had committed an act of gross indecency on, against, or towards another person (B), this would not come within the ambit of s 377A.
In the proceedings below, the magistrate took the view that the decision in 
 Preece 
 must be approached with caution. 
 Preece 
 only required deliberation on whether an element of participation was required in cases of gross indecency in public not involving actual physical contact between two men. More critically, when 
 Preece 
 was decided, the law on gross indecency in England had been fundamentally transformed by the enactment of s 1 of the Sexual Offences Act 1967 (the SOA 1967). This created a statutory defence to the offence of gross indecency, provided the act is a homosexual act done in private between two consenting males above the age of 21. In the premises, the magistrate relied instead on another English authority which he found to be more persuasive. This was the decision of the Court of Appeal in . 
 Hall 
 was decided prior to the enactment of s 1 SOA 1967 and it was subsequently not followed in 
 Preece 
. Both cases concerned s 13 of the SOA 1956. In 
 Hall 
, Lord Parker CJ accorded a wider meaning to the word `with` contained within s 13 SOA 1956. In Lord Parker CJ`s view, the meaning of `with` in s 13 did not mean `with the consent of` but would include `directed towards` or `against`. A person could still be charged and convicted under s 13 SOA 1956, notwithstanding that the other person named in the indictment did not consent to the act.
Relying on 
 Hall 
, the magistrate ruled that consent was not an element of a s 377A offence. Section 377A of the Penal Code was enacted in 1938. It was based on s 11 of the English Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, from which s 13 SOA 1956 came to take its present form. The magistrate took the view that Lord Parker CJ`s definition of the word `with` in 
 Hall 
 could be adopted and applied to the present case. Nevertheless, he ordered the amendment of the charge to delete the references to the appellant having touched Koh`s chest, nipples and buttocks as he felt that these acts were not grossly indecent within the meaning of s 377A. He proceeded to call upon the appellant to enter upon his defence.
 The defence
The appellant testified that he was on duty at the Alexandra Hospital on the day in question between 2pm to 9pm. Koh was called into the X-ray room at about 8.20pm. He confirmed Koh`s identity and thereafter told Koh that he was going to take an X-ray of the left wrist. Koh was told to sit down on the chair which was then facing away from the X-ray table. The appellant obtained the shield and explained to Koh that it was necessary in order to protect his gonads during the X-ray. The appellant explained to Koh that he was trained in Japan and shields were widely and effectively used in that country. The appellant asked Koh for his consent to have the shield fitted. Koh agreed, whereupon the appellant requested him to unzip his trousers and lower the front of his underwear. Koh did so. The appellant used his left hand to help Koh pull down his underwear as the latter was already seated, and then proceeded to apply the shield with his right hand. In the course of doing so, he could have touched Koh`s penis and scrotum accidentally. Meanwhile, Koh told the appellant that he had undergone a circumcision at Singapore General Hospital and it was done badly. After the shield was applied, the appellant took a white X-ray gown and covered the lower part of Koh`s body to protect his modesty.
The appellant proceeded to take two X-ray exposures of Koh`s left wrist. He took the X-ray cassette to the control room and handed it to his assistant for processing. He returned to the X-ray room to remove the shield from Koh. After the shield had been removed, Koh was told to put on his underwear and trousers. Koh mentioned that he wanted to make a claim (presumably, in relation to his injury) and he asked when the X-ray result would be ready. The appellant told Koh that, after the X-ray had been developed, he would give it to him and he could then proceed to see the doctor. The appellant told him that if he needed to make a claim, he would need a radiologist`s report. Koh asked when the radiologist`s report would be ready. The appellant said it would take about two weeks. Koh then asked the appellant to help him by telling him the contents of the radiologist`s report. The appellant said he could not reveal the report. Koh pestered him for assistance, and he told Koh that the most he could do was to inform Koh when the radiologist`s report was ready. He asked Koh how he could be contacted. Koh replied that he did not have a telephone at home and thus asked the appellant for his telephone number. Koh begged the appellant to help him. The appellant felt that he should accede to Koh`s requests. He was a staunch Christian and he was hopeful that Koh might have a good impression of him and subsequently be persuaded to receive the gospel. He wrote his personal pager number and his Christian name `Henry` on P2 and gave P2 to Koh. He then left the room to retrieve Koh`s X-ray film. He returned to hand the X-ray to Koh. The entire episode in the X-ray room lasted less than ten minutes.
The appellant`s defence was that he had acted in accordance with the hospital`s procedures. He denied asking Koh to lie down on the X-ray table. He never had any improper motives. If he had touched Koh`s penis, it was purely accidental, and then only in the process of putting on the shield. To support his defence, the appellant called witnesses to testify to the quality of his character. He also produced various testimonials to show that, among other things, he had been a competent radiographer and a devout and zealous Christian. Essentially, the defence attempted to show that it was so difficult to understand why the appellant would have wanted to outrage Koh`s modesty that there was reasonable doubt as to the case against him.
After a lengthy trial, the magistrate accepted that Koh was a witness of truth and rejected the appellant`s version of the events. He was satisfied that the charge against the appellant had been proved beyond reasonable doubt and he accordingly convicted the appellant.
 The appeal
On appeal, counsel`s main argument was that the magistrate had erred in law in ruling that consent was not an element of a s 377A offence. It was submitted that the prosecution had to show that the appellant had committed the act of gross indecency `with` Koh, meaning that Koh must have consented to the act. Essentially, this was what had been canvassed below on behalf of the defence at the close of the prosecution`s case. It was submitted that the magistrate had relied wrongly on , when was subsequently not followed in .
It is pertinent to note the stages of development of the law in England in relation to the offence of gross indecency. I begin by considering the law in England before s 1 SOA 1967 was enacted. The corresponding legislation (s 13 SOA 1956) was not in pari materia with our s 377A; nevertheless, the provisions were analogous and worded in substantially similar terms. The common law touching on s 13 SOA 1956 in England prior to the enactment of s 1 SOA 1967 was as stated in 
 Hall 
; `with` in s 13 had a broader meaning of `directed towards` or `against`. It was immaterial whether the act took place in public or private, or whether there was consent between the males involved. Three years after the Court of Appeal`s statements in 
 Hall 
, s 1 of the SOA 1967 came into force, creating a statutory defence to the s 13 offence provided the act of gross indecency was a homosexual act done in private, between two consenting males above the age of 21. There is no such `consenting adults` defence in Singapore as Parliament has not adopted similar legislation here.
 Preece
was decided in a different statutory context. Indeed, in the critical passage relied upon by counsel in this appeal, Scarman LJ observed (at p 375): 
 
We think the complete offence requires the participation, the cooperation, of two men. 
 The offence, now that the words `in private` have been deleted, is one of an indecent exhibition by two men in a public place
. It is to be observed, though we do not rely on it, that the side note to s 13 is `indecency between men`. [Emphasis added]
 
 
 
Thus, Scarman LJ suggested more generally that s 13 SOA 1956 was inappropriate unless both men (A and B) named in the indictment were jointly participating in or consenting to the act of gross indecency in public, notwithstanding that there was no actual physical contact between them. This scenario was exactly what the facts in 
 Preece 
 disclosed, and both accused accordingly had their appeals dismissed. Where one man (B) was not a `willing party`, in the sense of not being a voluntary participant to A`s act of gross indecency, then the act was only `directed towards him` and did not involve his active participation. However, if the approach in 
 Hall 
 was adopted, B would be named in the indictment although he might have been an innocent and unwilling `participant` to the indecent act. The court in 
 Preece 
 found this unsatisfactory. The residual offence in s 13 SOA 1956, taking into account the `consenting adults` defence, was limited to that of an indecent exhibition by two men in a public place. In view of the embarrassment and distress that could be caused to perfectly respectable men like B, the court refused to follow 
 Hall 
, ruling that the participation or cooperation of two men was required in order to make the offence in s 13 SOA 1956 complete. After all, A could still be charged with other offences, such as indecent exposure or public nuisance; there were other effective sanctions against A`s conduct.
Undoubtedly, the introduction of s 1 of the SOA 1967 has fundamentally changed the character of the offence under s 13 SOA 1956. In a situation where two adults engage in a `private` homosexual act, consent may afford a defence. It follows that the defence in s 1 SOA 1967 is not available if there is no consent. On a fortiori reasoning, it is beyond argument that consent cannot be an ingredient of the s 13 SOA 1956 offence where private acts are concerned. To require this would make utter nonsense of s 1 SOA 1967, since consent is now a defence to the charge where a private act is involved. Conversely, where a `public` act is involved, it seems that the only offence which falls within s 13 SOA 1956 is that where two men make a public exhibition of themselves. Having narrowed the applicability of s 13 thus, the court in 
 Preece 
 was drawn to the inevitable conclusion that consent was an element of the offence. The corollary of this proposition is that lack of consent to the act may be a defence to a s 13 charge.
In summary, the decision in 
 Preece 
 has given rise to some critical distinctions in English law between private and public acts of gross indecency:
 
 
(a) Consent is a statutory defence to private acts of gross indecency; ergo, lack of consent is no defence to a private act and consent cannot be an element of the offence. 
 
(b) Consent is not a defence to public acts of gross indecency. Indeed, consent seems to be an element of the offence (see 
 Preece 
). By the same token, lack of consent may be a defence.
  
 
 
These delineations have been drawn on the basis that the element of consent may alter the entire character of the offence, according to whether the acts are private or public acts. They may well be inevitable consequences in England because of the advent of s 1 SOA 1967. In the present appeal, the DPP argued that we here are not bound to adopt a similarly arduous and convoluted approach. It is clear, and counsel for the appellant did not dispute, that consent is not a defence to a s 377A charge. Counsel`s submission on appeal essentially required this court to consider whether consent should be made an element of the offence, as 
 Preece 
 seems to suggest it should.
In my judgment, 
 Preece 
 stands for a proposition which only makes sense in a wholly different statutory background. There is no justification for adopting the court`s approach in 
 Preece 
 when the local legislation remains on an entirely separate plane. The law as it stands in Singapore does not embrace any `consenting adults` defence. The law does not draw any distinctions between `private` and `public` acts of gross indecency. Section 377A itself does not appear to be limited to acts of `indecency between men` who make a public exhibition of themselves. I note that the marginal note to our s 377A reads `outrages on decency`, even though I do not place reliance on this. In contrast, the English courts have been drawn inexorably into pondering over the implications of the distinction between `private` and `public` acts by virtue of the `consenting adults` defence. This defence correspondingly requires further consideration whether consent should be a defence or an ingredient of the offence. I do not see why the present approach in England need be adopted. The state of the law in Singapore on gross indecency is reasonably clear and straightforward. It reflects the law in England prior to the SOA 1967 and 
 Preece 
. Parliament has not seen the wisdom or the necessity to keep in step with the changes in English legislation. There is also no other cogent reason to impose the requirement that consent must be an ingredient of the s 377A charge. On the face of s 377A, no such indication may be discerned.
My sympathies lie with those perfectly respectable gentlemen who may well be innocent `victims` of a grossly indecent act. It is true that they may find themselves named within the charge as persons `with` whom the offence of gross indecency has been committed. Nevertheless, I do not see any real cause for concern. If they did have any homosexual tendencies, they would almost invariably have been charged with the offence as well. The very fact that they are not similarly charged can only attest to their innocence of the act. No aspersions are being cast on their sexual proclivities. Technically, of course, as consent is not an element of the s 377A offence, they could also be charged with the offence, but I am confident that the judicious exercise of prosecutorial discretion will prevail to ensure that such travesties of justice do not occur. There will be no distress or embarrassment, much less any injustice, as long as the law is understood and enforced on a clear and unambiguous basis.
In the light of the above analysis, I am of the opinion that the magistrate did not err in holding that 
 Hall 
 represents good law. 
 Preece 
 was decided according to the precepts of a new chapter in the English law on gross indecency. The law in Singapore, however, has not had the occasion to open such a chapter. I have no difficulty in affirming the magistrate`s decision that the meaning of `with` in s 377A would include `directed towards` or `against`. The appellant was thus properly charged under s 377A, as consent is not an element of the offence.
The issue of whether a hospital X-ray room is a `public` or `private` place did not arise for consideration at the trial or on appeal. An offence under s 377A can be committed regardless of where the act takes place. Nonetheless, in view of counsel`s reliance on 
 Preece 
, it may be useful to consider this point briefly. Under the English law, `private` acts of gross indecency may not be caught by s 13 SOA 1956. Consent is a statutory defence only to private acts. A fortiori, consent cannot be an ingredient of the s 13 offence where private acts are involved. On this basis, the issue raised in the present appeal can alternatively be disposed of on the narrower ground that the act in question took place in private. The X-ray room may have been located within a hospital, which is undoubtedly a public place. Nevertheless, the relevant words in s 377A are `in public or private`. The X-ray room was not a place within the hospital to which the public had general or unrestricted access. Both before and after the decision in 
 Preece 
, consent was not an ingredient of the offence where a private act is concerned (see 
 Hall 
, per Lord Parker CJ at p 277). Even assuming that our legislation is similar to that which prevails in England, and if I were to agree with counsel that 
 Preece 
 is persuasive, consent would only be an ingredient of the offence if the act involved was a public act. Accordingly, where a grossly indecent act is done in private, as in the present case, consent cannot be a required element of the s 377A offence.
In counsel`s other main ground of appeal, he invited the court to consider what would amount to a grossly indecent act. He submitted that the magistrate had erred in ruling without legal authority that the act of touching the penis was a grossly indecent act. He argued that the cases on gross indecency all involved some highly repugnant forms of immorality. The acts complained of in the present case did not fall into those categories of gross indecency. In my opinion, this submission was unmeritorious. What amounts to a grossly indecent act must depend on whether in the circumstances, and the customs and morals of our times, it would be considered grossly indecent by any right-thinking member of the public (per Egbert J in the Supreme Court of Alberta, 3). The court does not sit to impose its own moral standards or precepts, but to enforce the morals of the general public. From the evidence, I have no doubt that the acts complained of in the present case would be considered grossly indecent by any right-thinking member of the public.
Turning to the magistrate`s findings on the evidence, counsel submitted that, by making references in his grounds of judgment to `possibilities` and `probabilities`, the magistrate had applied the wrong standard of proof and had failed to require the prosecution to prove their case beyond reasonable doubt. Having perused the magistrate`s grounds of judgment, I note that these references were not indicative of the standard of proof he had applied in assessing the totality of the prosecution`s evidence. These references were made by the magistrate in the course of dealing with the evidence adduced on behalf of the defence, to show that the defence had not raised any reasonable doubt in his mind. They were not employed in dealing with any material aspects of the prosecution`s evidence. Accordingly, in my view, the magistrate was well aware of the standard of proof required of the prosecution and had not applied the wrong standard of proof.
Finally, it was submitted that, on the totality of the evidence, the magistrate had drawn the wrong inferences and had wrongly concluded that the case had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. It is settled law that an appellate court may be disposed to interfere with the inferences drawn from the evidence if such inferences are plainly wrong or perverse. I need only recite the salient findings of fact. The magistrate found as a fact that the appellant had touched Koh`s penis in the course of conducting the X-ray on his left wrist. He found that the appellant had commented about Koh`s circumcision, touched Koh`s nipples and buttocks and had wanted to examine Koh`s anus. The magistrate also accepted Koh`s evidence of the other surrounding circumstances. This included the appellant having talked about his training in Japan, communal baths in Japan and about visiting prostitutes. The undisputed fact was that the appellant had given Koh his name and pager number on P2. The magistrate found that the appellant had asked Koh to call him but only to do so at night.
In any event, the findings were not based solely on acceptance of Koh`s bare allegations. There was corroboration of Koh`s evidence from the contemporaneity of his complaints to Dr Phipps, Staff Nurse Tan and ASP Loke, as well as his immediate police report. Dr Phipps testified that Koh had appeared a little angry after the incident, and had become intensely agitated after she confirmed that he had been subjected to an unsolicited and unwarranted physical examination by the appellant.
This is not a case where the facts are equivocal, nor one where the conviction depends largely on inferences which have to be drawn from the circumstances. The appellant was a radiographer performing a routine wrist X-ray on a patient. There is simply no conceivable reason for him to do anything even remotely connected to examining the patient`s private parts. Even though there is no requirement in a s 377A charge to show that the accused had homosexual tendencies, the act of touching Koh`s penis was itself an indication of such tendencies. Whether or not he is a homosexual in reality is irrelevant. The appellant had no business to do the acts which he was found to have done. Such conduct was clearly not within the scope of his appointment as a radiographer. In my opinion, the totality of the evidence points only to the conclusion that the appellant had committed the offence as charged. I find no reason to disturb the magistrate`s findings and accordingly I dismiss the appellant`s appeal against his conviction.
 Sentence
The magistrate imposed a sentence of ten months` imprisonment. Counsel urged the court to consider the following additional points in mitigation. The appellant is married with two children, aged 12 and 7 respectively. He is the sole breadwinner in the family and has to support his elderly and infirm father who is in his eighties. His wife has had to find employment as a stenographer in view of the charge against him. Counsel pointed out that in , I had imposed a fine of $2,000 in respect of an offence under s 354 of the Penal Code, reversing the lower court`s sentence of four months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. He urged the court to consider placing the appellant on probation. In any case, he submitted that ten months` imprisonment was clearly excessive and if imprisonment was warranted, a shorter term was sufficient and appropriate.
I indicated during the appeal that probation was clearly inappropriate in the present case. The offence was a serious one, having been committed in the course of the appellant`s employment. 
 Tan Boon Hock 
`s case4 was clearly distinguishable from the present case. That case involved an accused succumbing to an agent provocateur who had taken part in an operation expressly designed to `flush out` homosexuals. I expressed my bemusement that the accused should have been charged with the offence of outraging modesty in view of the rather exceptional circumstances of that case. In the present case, the charge was one under s 377A, where the mandatory punishment prescribed is imprisonment, with no option to impose a fine. There are varying degrees of gross indecency and I find it difficult to say that the present act was one which was so gravely repugnant as to warrant a very lengthy custodial term. I have no doubt that a substantial term of imprisonment may be justified where the offence was one involving 
 fellatio 
 in public, as in ,5 where I upheld the sentence of six months` imprisonment in respect of an accused who had committed such an act in the children`s pool of a public swimming complex. On the other hand, it is clearly inappropriate to treat this case as being similar to an offence which has taken place in private between consenting adults, for which a short custodial sentence of a few weeks` imprisonment may suffice.
My other misgiving is that the appellant will be placed in a precarious position by an extended term of imprisonment within a confined male environment, bearing in mind the nature of the offence for which he has been convicted. In this respect, he is not unlike the accused in , who was a self-confessed homosexual who had been convicted of a s 354 offence. Protection of the accused is not generally a principle to be considered in sentencing. Nevertheless, in the particular circumstances of this case, and having regard to the nature of the offence, I am of the opinion that ten months` imprisonment may be excessive and unjustifiably harsh.
The appellant has performed his duties well in the past, receiving favourable testimonials and generally complimentary comments about his character and the quality of his work. He has no previous convictions. All this has to be balanced against the important element of the public interest. Also, the act was done in the purported discharge of his professional duties as a radiographer. The appellant abused the trust reposed in him. Having considered all the circumstances as well as the mitigating factors, I am minded to allow the appeal against sentence. I substitute a sentence of three months` imprisonment for the sentence imposed by the magistrate.

s 60 Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322)
 
The first and second appellants were convicted of dishonestly receiving stolen property under s 411 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and the third appellant was convicted of assisting in the disposal of such property under s 414 of the Penal Code. On appeal to the High Court, I dismissed the appeals of the three appellants on 17 January 1995.
Counsel for the appellants subsequently brought this motion pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (the SCJA) and applied for an order that the following questions which, he claimed, were questions of law of public interest which had arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which had affected the event of the appeal, be reserved for the decision of the Court of Appeal: 
 
 
(1) whether in respect of the first and second appellants, the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that they had `reason to believe`, as defined in the Penal Code, that goods were stolen properties; 
 
(2) whether in respect of the first and second appellants the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that they had recovered the stolen goods dishonestly pursuant to a common intention on their part; and 
 
(3) whether in respect of the third appellant, the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that he had knowledge that the goods were stolen properties.
  
 
 
The respondent submitted that none of the above questions of law were of public interest and that this was an attempt by the appellants to appeal against their convictions which had been finally determined by law.
The relevant provisions of s 60 of the SCJA state : 
 
(1) When an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court, the Judge may, on the application of any party and shall on the application of the Public Prosecutor, reserve for the decision of the Court of Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the event of the appeal.
 
 
 
...
(5) For the purposes of this section but without prejudice to the generality of its provisions - 
(a) any question of law regarding which there is a conflict of judicial authority shall be deemed to be a question of public interest; and 
(b) the reservation of a question of law for the consideration of the High Court under the provisions of any written law relating to criminal procedure or the exercise by the High Court of any power of revision under any such written law shall be deemed to be an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter.
 
 
 
The principles governing an application under this section were fully expounded in my judgment delivered on behalf of the Court of Appeal in 
 Abdul Salam bin Mohamed Salleh v PP 
 and reiterated in my decision in 
 Chan Hiang Leng Colin & Ors v PP 
 and which I will not repeat at great length. Suffice it to say, an application under s 60 of the SCJA must satisfy two essential elements, namely, that the question stated must be a question of law of public interest which had arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of this question must have affected the event of the appeal. It is clear from the terms of s 60 that even if the prescribed conditions were satisfied, the court retained a discretion whether or not to allow a reference to be made to the Court of Appeal where the application was made by a party other than the Public Prosecutor.
It is obvious that the question stated must be a question of law and questions of fact, although affecting the event of the appeal, are not questions within the purview of s 60: per Karthigesu J [as he then was] in 
 Balasubramaniam v PP 
. What is a question of public interest would necessarily depend on the facts and circumstances of each case. Section 60 is not an ordinary appeal provision to argue points of law which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the application or extension of established principles of law or the application of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by the higher courts. As was stated by Raja Azlan Shah Ag LP in the Malaysian Federal Court decision of 
 Ragunathan v PR 
: 
 
We think that the proper test for determining whether a question of law raised in the courts of the appeal is of public interest would be whether it directly and substantially affects the rights of the parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this court or by the Privy Council or is not free from difficulty or calls for discussion of alternative views. If the question is settled by the highest court or the general principles in determining the question are well settled and it is a mere question of applying those principles to the facts of the case the question would not be a question of law of public interest.
 
 
 
Turning then to the specific questions stated. With regard to question (1) counsel for the appellants contended that there was a conflict of judicial authority in two previous High Court decisions of 
 Tan Ser Juay v PP 
 and 
 Koh Hak Boon & Ors v PP 
 on the interpretation of the words `reason to believe` as defined under s 26 of the Penal Code, and thus in accordance with s 60(5) of the SCJA, that question `shall be deemed to be a question of public interest`. Section 26 of the Penal Code is as follows: 
 
A person is said to have reason to believe a thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing and not otherwise.
 
 
 
The principle which can be extrapolated from 
 Tan Ser Juay 
 is that mere suspicion that goods were stolen property was not sufficient to satisfy the ingredient of `reason to believe`. In 
 Koh Hak Boon 
, the case of 
 Tan Ser Juay 
 was discussed and I came to the conclusion that the words `reason to believe` involved a lesser degree of conviction than certainty and a higher one than speculation. Taking the two cases together, I am of the view that there was really no contradiction nor conflict of judicial authority on the interpretation of the words `reason to believe`. The words which may be used to explain the phrase `reason to believe` was meant to be an indication or measure of the degree of knowledge required for the element of the offence to be satisfied. There was simply no real issue of law arising as the definition of that ingredient of the offence had been settled and this was an instance of merely applying the principles to the facts of the case. The question was in essence directed at a specific issue of interest to the parties alone and the application for reference was really an appeal in disguise.
Likewise, questions (2) and (3) which related to whether the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the appellants received the goods dishonestly knowing that they were stolen goods were not questions of law let alone questions of law of public interest, but were essentially questions of fact, of which I had already ruled in favour of the respondent.
This whole process of making an application for reference to the Court of Appeal under s 60 of the SCJA was but an attempt by the appellants to have a second bite at the cherry by disguising their attempt to appeal against their convictions. This was certainly not the intention of s 60 of the SCJA. Parliament had clearly provided that the High Court would be the final appellate court for criminal cases commenced in the subordinate courts and the Court must be mindful of the interest of maintaining finality in such proceedings. Accordingly, in the exercise of my discretion, the application to reserve the above questions to the Court of Appeal was dismissed.

s 408 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
The appellant pleaded guilty in the district court to the following charge: 
 
You, Sim Yeow Seng, M/42 years, NRIC:S0026803H, are charged that you on or about 26 September 1990, at M/s Honest Manufactory at 11 Syed Alwi Road, Teck Heng Long Building #02-00, Singapore, being employed as a servant, to wit, a shipping clerk, and in such capacity were entrusted with dominion over certain property, to wit, a cash cheque for $7,777.27, belonging to the said M/s Honest Manufactory, committed criminal breach of trust of the aforesaid cheque and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 408 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The district judge convicted the appellant upon his guilty plea and sentenced him to one year`s imprisonment. The present appeal was brought against sentence.
 The appeal
In passing sentence on the appellant, the district judge noted that in the absence of aggravating circumstances, the usual punishment for a first offence under s 408 of the Penal Code, where the accused pleads guilty and where the sum involved lies between $5,000 and $10,000, is an imprisonment term of nine months coupled with a fine. In the present case, however, although the appellant had pleaded guilty, the district judge pointed out that he also had on record a conviction sustained in 1993 for criminal breach of trust. On that occasion an additional charge of cheating under s 420 had been taken into consideration on that occasion and the eventual sentence had been a fine of $5,000.
Having had regard to the appellant`s 1993 conviction, the district judge held that a sentence of one year`s imprisonment was appropriate. In his view: 
 
Repeated acts of dishonesty for personal gain give rise to the implication that the person has a defect in character and a propensity for enrichment through illegal means. For such a person, it is the duty of the court to indicate strongly to him that his dishonest conduct is wrong and would be viewed with severity by the law and members of his community.
 
 
 
On appeal counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant`s previous conviction should not have been taken into account during the sentencing process. That conviction, so counsel argued, had been in respect of an offence which had been committed only subsequent to the commission of the offence for which the appellant was being sentenced by the district judge. In counsel`s submission, no authority existed to show that such prior convictions could be taken into account by a sentencing court.
In fact, the district judge referred in his grounds of decision to the case of 
 R v Wilson 
, in which existed a factual situation virtually identical with that found in the appellant`s case. The accused in 
 R v Wilson 
 pleaded guilty to a charge of housebreaking and stealing. In between the commission of this particular crime and the passing of sentence, however, he had also committed (and been convicted of) other offences; and these other offences having been taken into account by the sentencing judge, a sentence of two years` imprisonment with hard labour was imposed. The accused applied for leave to appeal against this sentence, on the basis that the sentencing judge had erred in taking into consideration his previous convictions. Lowe J, in a dissenting judgment, held that since a judge must have regard to circumstances right up to the time he imposed sentence, it would be inconsistent and unreal to oblige him to ignore the fact of previous convictions when this was laid before him; and in this regard it mattered not that the previous convictions were in respect of offences committed subsequent to the offence for which sentence was being considered. In coming to this conclusion, Lowe J referred, inter alia, to the following passage in 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (2nd Ed) Vol IX para 365: 
 
The court, in fixing punishment, for any particular crime, will take into consideration the nature of the offence, the circumstances in which it was committed, the degree of deliberation shown by the offender, the provocation which he has received, if the crime is one of violence, the antecedents of the prisoner up to the time of sentence, his age and character, and any recommendations to mercy which the jury may have made.
 
 
 
The above reasoning was taken up by the Singapore High Court in 
 PP v Boon 
 
 Kiah Kin 
. One of the issues in 
 PP v Boon Kiah Kin 
 was whether, in passing sentence for an offence, the sentencing court could consider the offender`s previous convictions for similar offences if these previous convictions had been received only subsequent to the commission of the offence before the sentencing court. As the coram in 
 Boon Kiah Kin 
`s case2, I held that `all earlier offences of similar nature should be put before a sentencer, regardless of whether the convictions therefor were obtained before or after the commission of the offence for which the defendant is being sentenced.` The sentencer then has the discretion, upon consideration of the defendant`s antecedents, to enhance the sentence. In this conclusion I was fortified by the reasoning employed by Lowe J in 
 R v Wilson 
 and by the remarks of his brother judges in that case, which remarks made plain that had it not been for the presence of specific statutory provisions, they too would have been inclined towards his view.
Counsel in the present appeal submitted that 
 PP v Boon Kiah Kin 
 was no authority for the district judge`s decision in this case. It was tirelessly pointed out to me by counsel that in 
 Boon Kiah Kin 
, the previous convictions in question had been in respect of offences committed prior to the offence before the sentencing court; whereas in the appellant`s case the previous conviction was sustained in respect of an offence committed subsequent to the commission of the offence before the sentencing court. I could not see, however, why this slight difference in the sequence of commission and conviction should obscure the direct relevance of 
 Boon Kiah Kin 
 to the present case. The rationale of 
 Boon Kiah Kin 
 and, indeed, of Lowe J`s judgment in 
 R v Wilson 
 is that a sentencing court should have regard to all of the accused`s antecedents up to the moment of sentencing because these antecedents reveal his character, his attitudes and the likelihood of rehabilitation. So long as previous convictions are shown to exist, therefore, it does not matter whether they were in respect of offences committed before or subsequent to the offence for which the court is considering sentence.
It is, of course, true, as the district judge noted, that the appellant`s previous conviction in this case could not give rise to any inference of defiant disregard of the law, since the offence for which the district judge was sentencing him was the first in time to have been committed. It is also true however - and this too was noted by the district judge - that the offence of criminal breach of trust necessarily involves dishonesty; and a record of repeated convictions for such an offence indicates a propensity to dishonest means of self-enrichment. All things being equal, the need to deter an accused from further gravitating towards such wrongdoing is basis enough for the sentencing court to enhance sentence to an appropriate degree; although, as I stated in 
 Boon Kiah Kin 
, it should simultaneously be remembered that the accused is being punished solely for the offence before the court and any enhancement ought not to bring the sentence beyond the tariff applicable to the offence.
Another ground of appeal raised by counsel was the allegation that the appellant had committed both offences of criminal breach of trust in order to pay off loan sharks. I was disinclined to regard such an allegation as possessing any mitigating value. This court has said time and again that financial difficulties cannot be relied upon in mitigation of an offence save, possibly, in the most exceptional or extreme of circumstances (
 Lai Oei Mui Jenny v PP 
); and, in the present instance, no evidence of exceptional or extreme circumstances was shown either to me or to the district court.
Two other points about the appellant`s case need to be touched on briefly. $7,777.27 might not be an awesome sum but it was certainly money which a small business concern like M/s Honest Manufactory could ill afford to lose; and it speaks very poorly for the appellant that he was so ready to take advantage of the trust which led his employers to hand over a cash cheque to him. Having misappropriated the cheque, he vanished almost immediately and made no attempt to contact his erstwhile employers or to make restitution during the four years before his arrest. In short, it would seem that the appellant suffered no compunction during those four years; and, in the light of this, any credit attributed to him for pleading guilty on the day of the trial must surely be minimal.
For the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that no complaint could be found with the sentence of one year`s imprisonment; and I accordingly dismissed the appeal.

This was an appeal by the plaintiffs against the decision of the learned senior assistant registrar given on the application of the defendants ordering that the statement of claim herein be struck out and the action dismissed with costs pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of the Supreme Court and under the inherent jurisdiction of the Court. I dismissed the appeal. The plaintiffs have appealed to the Court of Appeal. I now give my reasons.
 The parties
The first plaintiff is an advocate and solicitor practising in the firm of ASK Wee. The second plaintiff is a bank officer and a member of the Bukit Timah Saddle Club (BTSC). The third plaintiff is a medical practitioner.
The defendant is a firm of solicitors who acted for one Lawrence G Cohen (Cohen), a member of BTSC.
 The facts
What led to these proceedings were three incidents on 28 September 1993.
 First incident
At about 6pm Cohen was driving along the road leading to BTSC on his way there for riding lessons. He was overtaken by the second plaintiff who drove past him at a speed which, in his view, was very much in excess of the speed limit. Cohen was disturbed by this as the speed and the noise of a speeding vehicle could cause horses in the riding path along the said road to bolt. This in turn could injure the rider and or the horse. His two daughters were also at that time scheduled for riding lessons at the club. When Cohen eventually caught up with the second plaintiff at the BTSC car park he went up to her and advised her of his concern and that he was going to report her to the BTSC disciplinary committee. According to Cohen, the second plaintiff made some rude and sarcastic remarks in reply and appeared not to be remorseful.
 Second incident
At about 7pm, after his riding lessons Cohen went to the BTSC stable office and asked a riding instructress for the surname of the second plaintiff with a view to making a report to the disciplinary committee on the first incident. Before Cohen could get a reply from the riding instructress, the second plaintiff said `
 Tan, and don`t you forget it 
`. Feeling more incensed, Cohen went to the club house and consulted the club captain who advised him to lodge a formal complaint with the BTSC disciplinary committee. Cohen then left the club house and proceeded to the car park from where he intended to drive home. This was at about 7.45pm.
 Third incident
According to Cohen as he was walking toward his car he was confronted by the three plaintiffs. The first plaintiff then said to him `
 If you want to fight, fight me and not a woman. 
` The first and third plaintiffs then moved forward towards him in a threatening manner and seemed to be preparing for a fight. Cohen then suggested that they settle the matter at the nearest police station. The suggestion was not taken up by the plaintiffs but the intervention of some club members prevented the situation from getting worse.
On or about 7 October 1993, Cohen was served with a private summons dated 30 September 1993 (PSS 456/93). The charge read: 
 
You, Lawrence Cohen ... are charged that you on 28 September 1993 at approximately 7pm in the compound of the Bukit Timah Saddle Club did threaten one Justine Tan Tun Hwa with bodily injury with the intent to cause her alarm and you have thereby committed an offence under s 503 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
On being served with PSS 456/93 Cohen instructed the defendants to defend him. In the meantime, his complaint arising out of the three incidents had been lodged with the BTSC disciplinary committee. Pending the decision of the BTSC disciplinary committee, Cohen withheld filing cross-summonses and instead instructed the defendants to write to the Attorney General to seek his intervention to withdraw PSS 456/93 on his undertaking not to pursue criminal proceedings against the plaintiffs arising out of the said incidents.
Accordingly the defendants on 22 November 1993 wrote to the Attorney General. Their letter to the Attorney General contained the following passage (the passage complained of): 
 
Mr Wee, Ms Tan and Dr Sen [referring to the plaintiffs] had deliberately and wilfully entered into the BTSC grounds to intimidate our client by threatening him with violence and to attempt to provoke a breach of the peace.
 
 
 
Pending a reply from the Attorney General, as there was no settlement in the meantime, Cohen filed a formal complaint and, accordingly, two cross private summonses, being PSS 537/93 and PSS 538/93, were issued on 1 December 1993 against the second and first plaintiffs respectively. He did not proceed against the third plaintiff because he had learnt that the latter was ill with cancer.
On 2 December 1993 the Attorney General replied declining to interfere with the process issued.
Pending the hearing of the summons and the cross-summonses, Cohen attempted to settle the matter by offering to exchange suitable private apologies with the second plaintiff and all three private summonses would be withdrawn. The second plaintiff, however, insisted through M/s ASK Wee`s letter of 3 January 1994 to the defendants as follows: 
 
Our client is prepared to reconsider the matter and proposes to settle PSS 456/93 as follows: 
(1) your client makes an open apology to our client for behaving like a typical road bully; 
(2) your client indemnifies our client in respect of the legal costs and expenses to which she had been put through; 
(3) your client makes a donation (to be agreed upon) to the Cancer Society as a sign of his remorse.
 
 
 
As we understand them, PSS 537/93 and PSS 538/93 are in respect of matters in which your client is the complainant. We are instructed to say that our client does not accept that they should be used as a collateral purpose to coerce our client to withdraw PSS 456/93. 
We are therefore instructed that since your client has seen fit to prefer charges against Richard Wee and Ms Justine Tan, he should be prepared to prove his case. Our clients stand ready to defend those charges vigorously.
 
 
 
Those being the terms, it was not surprising that no settlement could be achieved. The three summonses had by then been fixed for hearing with PSS 456/93 to be heard before PSS 537/93 and PSS 538/93. PSS 456/93 was heard over three days from 4 to 6 January 1994 in Court 18 of the Subordinate Courts. Cohen was represented by Mr Wong Meng Meng, a partner of the defendant firm. At the conclusion of the prosecution case in PSS 456/93, Cohen was acquitted without his defence being called.
Notwithstanding his acquittal, Cohen was still prepared subject to certain terms to withdraw his cross-summonses when they came up for hearing on 7 January 1994. Mr Anthony Wee Soon Kim of the firm of ASK Wee, acting for the first and second plaintiffs, indicated that he had no instructions to settle. The magistrate thereupon decided (and rightly so in the circumstances) to speak to the parties in his chambers without counsel being present. After the magistrate had spoken to the parties an agreement was arrived at whereby the cross-summonses would be withdrawn. The terms of the settlement were then written out by Mr Wong Meng Meng, passed to Mr Anthony Wee Soon Kim, read and approved by the first and second plaintiffs and finally signed by all three parties. The terms recorded as an undertaking (the undertaking) read: 
 
We, Larry Cohen, Justine Tan and Richard Wee, each undertake not to commence or take any proceedings hereafter of any kind or nature, whether criminal or civil, in respect of the three incidents on 28 September 1993 at the Bukit Timah Saddle Club, and in respect of any acts or correspondence arising therefrom, including the lodging of an appeal in PSS 456/93, save that the proceedings within the jurisdiction of the Club shall not be affected by this undertaking.
 
 
 
Dated 7 January 1994.
 
 
 
Following the signing of the undertaking by Cohen, the first and second plaintiffs, PSS 537/93 and PSS 538/93 were withdrawn.
Notwithstanding the undertaking to which only the third plaintiff was not a party, the plaintiffs commenced this suit against the defendants on 7 February 1994 claiming damages for defamation arising from the passage complained of. A similar claim was brought by the third plaintiff (as sole plaintiff) in S 249/94 on 21 February 1994 against Cohen. In this suit it was alleged that the defendants `
 falsely and maliciously wrote and published of and concerning 
` the plaintiffs the passage complained of, the natural and ordinary meaning of which meant and were understood to mean that the plaintiffs were guilty of one or more criminal offences. In S 249/94, the third plaintiff alleged that Cohen caused the defendants herein to write to the Attorney General the letter of the 22 November 1993 which contained the passage complained of.
On being served with the writ endorsed with the statement of claim, the defendants entered appearance and immediately filed an application in summons-in-chambers entered No 984/94 for an order that the statement of claim be struck out pursuant to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1990 and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court on the following grounds:
 
 
(1) it discloses no reasonable cause of action and/or; 
 
(2) it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; and/or 
 
(3) it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the court.
  
 
 
It is the defendants` case that the letter of 22 November 1993 was written by them as solicitors for and on the instructions of Cohen. The passage complained of referred to description of events at the BTSC based on instructions which instructions they believed to be true and of which they had no reason to believe otherwise. In any event, the action was misconceived for the following reasons:
 
 
(i) there was the compromise set out in the undertaking; 
 
(ii) the letter of 22 November 1993 to the Attorney General is, in any event, privileged; 
 
(iii) as a matter of public policy, actions such as these proceedings against a firm of solicitors acting within its instructions in these circumstances should not be allowed to succeed; 
 
(iv) the case comes within the de minimis principle.
  
 
 
 
 The law
 
At the hearing of their application before the learned senior assistant registrar and at the appeal before me, the defendants chose to rely only on the defence of qualified privilege on the ground that this would dispose of the action without the need to deal with the other grounds.
The law on qualified privilege in an action for damages for defamation is conveniently set out in 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) ch 13 para 441 of which read: 
 
There are occasions upon which, on grounds of public policy and convenience, a person may, without incurring legal liability, make statements about another which are defamatory and in fact untrue. On such occasions a man, stating what he believes to be the truth about another, is protected in so doing, provided he makes the statement honestly and without any indirect or improper motive. These occasions are called occasions of qualified privilege, for the protection which the law, on grounds of public policy, affords is not absolute but depends on the honesty of purpose with which the defamatory statement is made. The rule being founded on the general welfare of society, new occasions for its application will necessarily arise with continually changing conditions.
 
 
 
In para 442, 
 Gatley 
 listed nine classes of statements protected by qualified privilege but added that they 
 `illustrate but do not exhaust the general principle; for we may not substitute a catalogue for a principle.` 
The relevant ones are classes 1, 2 and 3:
 
 
(1) statements made in the discharge of a public or private duty; 
 
(2) statements made on a subject-matter in which the defendant has a legitimate interest; 
 
(3) statements made by the defendant to obtain redress for a grievance.
  
 
 
For a communication to fall under class 1, there must be a duty on the defendant to make the communication and an interest in the party to whom it is made. See 
 Gatley 
 para 449. For a communication to fall within class (2) the communication must be made by someone with an interest in the subject matter to someone who has a corresponding interest in receiving the information. The interests of the maker and the recipient may be common but they need not be identical. See 
 Gatley 
 para 504. To fall within class (3) the complaint must be addressed to the appropriate authority which has the power or duty to act. See 
 Gatley 
, para 523. It is the stand of the defendants herein that in making the representation to the Attorney General in their letter of 22 November 1993, they were discharging their duty to their client who had an interest in the making of the representation with a corresponding interest on the part of the Attorney General to receive the same. The representation was to stop a frivolous prosecution.
But notwithstanding the occasion of qualified privilege the publication must not have been actuated by malice. On qualified privilege and malice, see 
 Maidstone Pte Ltd v Takenaka Corp 
 where Yong Pung How CJ discussed exhaustively the law pertaining thereto.
On the law on qualified privilege, the learned Chief Justice said at p 782: 
 
The law treats the publication of statements that are false in fact and injurious to the character of another as malicious, unless it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal, social or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned. It is also essential that the recipient of the publication shares a common interest with the publisher or has a corresponding legitimate interest or duty to receive the publication. These occasions are referred to in the law as occasions of qualified privilege and the rationale for the protection is the common convenience and welfare of society: see generally 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander
 (8th Ed) at para 443. Such being the case, the occasions when the law offers the protection of qualified privilege are not fixed and necessarily vary with the changes in social conditions and values. The determination of whether an occasion is one of qualified privilege is one of law. The requirements stated above were set out by Scrutton LJ in 
 Watt v Longsdon
 [1929] 2 All ER Rep 284 at p 290 in the following terms:
 
 
 
`With slight modifications in particular circumstances, this appears to me to be well-established law, but, except in the case of communications based on common interest, the principle is that there must be either interest in the recipient, and a duty to communicate in the speaker, or an interest to be protected in the speaker and a duty to protect it in the recipient. Except in the case of common interest justifying intercommunication, the correspondence must be between duty and interest; there may, in the common interest cases, be also a common or reciprocal duty.`
 
 
 
It is for the defendant to a libel action to prove that the defamatory publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. Where, as in the present case, the defendant relies on the existence of a common interest, he has to show that the publication was for the fair and reasonable protection or furtherance of his own interests and that the receiving party had a legitimate interest in the subject matter of the publication: 
 Stuart v Bell
 
[1891] 2 QB 341
 and 
 Watt v Longsdon
.
 
 
 
On the law on malice, this was what the learned Chief Justice stated at pp 787-789: 
 
The protection afforded by qualified privilege is not an absolute one. It will be lost if the occasion that gives rise to it is misused, ie in common parlance, if the publication is made with malice. The burden of proving this is on the plaintiffs. This area of the law was authoritatively and exhaustively considered by Lord Diplock in 
 Horrocks v Lowe
 
[1975] AC 135
 at pp 149-151 and it would not be out of place for me to set out the very lengthy passage which was stressed by counsel:
 
 
 
`My Lords, as a general rule, English law gives effect to the ninth commandment that a man shall not speak evil falsely of his neighbour. It supplies a temporal sanction: if he cannot prove that defamatory matter which he published was true, he is liable in damages to whomever he has defamed, except where the publication is oral only, causes no damage and falls outside the categories of slander actionable per se. The public interest that the law should provide an effective means whereby a man can vindicate his reputation against calumny, has nevertheless to be accommodated to the competing public interest in permitting men to communicate frankly and freely with one another about matters with respect to which the law recognizes that they have a duty to perform or an interest to protect in doing so. What is published in good faith on matters of these kinds is published on a privileged occasion. It is not actionable even though it be defamatory and turns out to be untrue. With some exceptions which are irrelevant to the instant appeal, the privilege is not absolute but qualified. It is lost if the occasion which gives rise to it is misused. For in all cases of qualified privilege there is some special reason of public policy why the law accords immunity from suit - the existence of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, on the part of the maker of the defamatory statement which justifies his communicating it or of some interest of his own which he is entitled to protect by doing so. If he uses the occasion for some other reason he loses the protection of the privilege.
 
 
 
So, the motive with which the defendant on a privileged occasion made a statement defamatory of the plaintiff becomes crucial. The protection might, however, be illusory if the onus lay on him to prove that he was actuated solely by a sense of the relevant duty or a desire to protect the relevant interest. So he is entitled to be protected by the privilege unless some other dominant and improper motive on his part is proved. `Express malice` is the term of art descriptive of such a motive. Broadly speaking, it means malice in the popular sense of a desire to injure the person who is defamed and this is generally the motive which the plaintiff sets out to prove. But to destroy the privilege, the desire to injure must be the dominant motive for the defamatory publication; knowledge that it will have that effect is not enough if the defendant is nevertheless acting in accordance with a sense of duty or in bona fide protection of his own legitimate interests.
The motive with which a person published defamatory matter can only be inferred from what he did or said or knew. If it be proved that he did not believe that what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence of express malice for no sense of duty or desire to protect his own legitimate interests can justify a man in telling deliberate and injurious falsehoods about another, save in the exceptional case where a person may be under a duty to pass on, without indorsing, defamatory reports made by some other person.
Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, `honest belief`, If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated as if he knew it to be false. But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true. The freedom of speech protected by the law of qualified privilege may be availed of by all sorts and conditions of men. In affording to them immunity from suit if they have acted in good faith in compliance with a legal or moral duty or in protection of a legitimate interest the law must take them as it finds them. In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognize the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfection of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be `honest`, ie a positive belief that the conclusions they have reached are true. The law demands no more.
Even a positive belief in the truth of what is published on a privileged occasion - which is presumed unless the contrary is proved - may not be sufficient to negative express malice if it can be proved that the defendant misused the occasion for some purpose other than that for which the privilege is accorded by the law. The commonest case is where the dominant motive which actuates the defendant is not a desire to perform the relevant duty or to protect the relevant interest, but to give vent to his personal spite or ill-will towards the person he defames. If this be proved, then even positive belief in the truth of what is published will not enable the defamer to avail himself of the protection of the privilege to which he would otherwise have been entitled. There may be instances of improper motives which destroy the privilege apart from personal spite. A defendant`s dominant motive may have been to obtain some private advantage unconnected with the duty or the interest which constitutes the reason for the privilege. If so, he loses the benefit of the privilege despite his positive belief that what he said or wrote was true.` 
 
It is therefore for the plaintiffs to show that the publication was made with the dominant intention of injuring them. The fact that the defendants might have known that the publication would injure the plaintiffs is not sufficient. Such a dominant and improper motive can be proven if it is shown that the defendants knew that the statement was false. This is usually conclusive and it is no excuse that the publication was made carelessly such that it did not reflect the defendants` true belief even though there was no intention to publish the false statement: 
 Leverman v Campbell Sharp Ltd
 [1987] 36 DLR 401. 
Following Lord Diplock, a defendant will also be held to have made the statement with malice if he made it recklessly as to its truth. A defendant is not reckless, for the purposes of proving malice, if he did so believing it was true, even if he was careless, impulsive or irrational in coming to that belief.
 
 
 
The occasion of qualified privilege is also available to an agent acting on behalf of his client who has an interest in making the communication, makes it on the client`s behalf to another person who has an interest in receiving the communication. Thus in 
 Baker v Carrick 
, the solicitor, acting on behalf of his client, gave written notice to an auctioneer not to part with the proceeds of the sale of certain goods entrusted to him for sale, on the ground that the owner of the goods had committed an act of bankruptcy upon which an order in bankruptcy might be made against him. In an action by the owner of the goods against the solicitor for libel it was held that the occasion was privileged since the solicitor was acting in the ordinary course of his duty to his client and the occasion would have been privileged had the notice been written by the client himself. Turning to the present proceedings unless the passage complained of was published recklessly by the defendants as to its truth the statement was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. In writing the letter of the 22 November 1993 they were acting on instructions which were not inherently incredible or logically impossible. As such they were not obliged to verify the truth of their instructions. If so, they were not reckless as to its truth.
In
 Wee Soon Kim 
 
 Anthony v The Law Society of Singapore 
, the plaintiff there made an application to court pursuant to s 93 of the Legal Professional Act (Cap 161) for an order that the Law Society of Singapore be directed to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a disciplinary committee to investigate the complaint of the plaintiff against two advocates and solicitors, GSH and TKQ. The substance of the complaint was that both GSH and TKQ made reckless allegations against the plaintiff and that TKQ as solicitor for GSH failed, inter alia, to verify the source of GSH`s information. The application was dismissed by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was). At pp 12-13, the learned judicial commissioner said: 
 
... It is not for an advocate and solicitor, whether in his capacity as counsel or solicitor, to believe or disbelieve his client`s instructions, unless he himself has personal knowledge of the matter or unless his client`s statements are inherently incredible or logically impossible. His duty to his client does not go beyond advising him of the folly of making incredible or illogical statements. 
Here, I would refer to an ex curia opinion of Lord Halsbury on this subject. His Lordship said (as quoted in [1988] 15 LQR at p 264):
 
 
 
`A thesis has been propounded on the other side more extravagant, and certainly more impossible of fulfilment; that is, that an advocate is bound to convince himself, by something like an original investigation, that his client is in the right before he undertakes the duty of acting for him. I think such a contention is ridiculous, impossible of performance, and calculated to lead to great injustice. If an advocate were to reject a story because it seemed improbable to him, he would be usurping the office of the judge, by which I mean the judicial function, whether that function is performed by a single man, or by the composite arrangement of judge and jury which finds favour with us. Very little experience of courts of justice would convince any one that improbable stories are very often true notwithstanding their improbability.`
 
 
 
 
 My decision
 
I was of the view that even if the passage complained of was untrue and therefore defamatory, it was clearly privileged. It was made by the defendants on behalf of and on the instructions of their client in the ordinary course of their duty as solicitors. The instructions were not inherently incredible or logically impossible. It was addressed to the Attorney General to invite his intervention to withdraw PSS 456/93. This is a power vested on him by art 35(8) of the Constitution. Hence the Attorney General was the appropriate authority with an interest in or a duty in connection with the subject matter of the passage complained of. The occasion would also have been privileged had Cohen written the letter of 22 November 1993 himself. There was no evidence that the publication was actuated by malice, the burden of proof of which is on the plaintiffs. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal with costs.

This is an appeal against the forfeiture of a vehicle, No YE6954K, ordered under s 20(4) of the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95, 1988 Ed) following the conviction of the appellant for an offence under s 20(1) of the same Act.
 Brief facts
The brief facts are that on 28 April 1994, at about 1.45pm, the appellant, who was driving the vehicle, was tailed from the junction of Woodlands Ave 5 and Ave 2 by some Ministry of Environment officers in a car, as they suspected that he would be dumping refuse illegally. His vehicle was seen to be carrying some wood waste.
The appellant travelled to Lorong Gambas, along which he turned into a dirt track some 100m in. The officers waited at the junction between the track and Lorong Gambas. While doing so, they heard the sound of rubbish being unloaded. A few minutes later, the appellant came out in his vehicle. They stopped him, and found that the vehicles` skip was empty. A heap of waste wood was found in an area reached by the track. The vehicle was seized and the appellant was eventually charged that he: 
 
... on 28 April 1994 between 1400 and 1410hrs, did drop a lorry load of refuse from the stationary vehicle No. YE 6954K at a vacant land off Lorong Gambas which is a public place and [he had] thereby contravened s 20(1) of the Environmental Public Health Act (Cap 95) and committed an offence punishable under s 21(1) of the aforesaid Act.
 
 
 
At the trial, the appellant was found guilty, fined $2,000 and the vehicle was forfeited under s 20(4) pursuant to the written application of the Public Prosecutor. The district judge held that he had no discretion to make any other order besides forfeiture once it was proven that the vehicle had been used to commit an offence, and the Public Prosecutor had made a written application. That decision was handed down before judgment was given in the case of 
 Toh Teong Seng v PP 
.
The appellant has in the end only appealed against the forfeiture. The Prosecution seeks to remit the case back to the district judge for him to determine whether the discretion should be exercised in the light of further evidence which the prosecution seeks to adduce.
 Forfeiture
The offence itself is set out in s 20(1): 
 
Any person who drops, scatters, spills or throws any dirt, sand, earth, gravel, clay, loam, manure, refuse, sawdust, shavings, stone, straw or any other matter or thing in any public place, whether from a moving or stationary vehicle or in any other manner shall be guilty of an offence.
 
 
 
The provisions governing forfeiture are set out in sub-ss (4) and (5): 
 
(4) A court on convicting any person of an offence under subsection (1) shall, on the written application of the Public Prosecutor, make an order of the forfeiture of the vehicle which has been used in the commission of the offence notwithstanding that no person may have been convicted of that offence.
(5) An order for the forfeiture or for the release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under subsection (4) may be made by the court before which the prosecution with regard to an offence under subsection (1) has been or will be held.
 
 
 
 
 Construction of sub-ss (4) and (5)
 
It was held in 
 Toh Teong Seng 
 that the court has a discretion under s 20(4) to determine whether forfeiture of vehicles should be ordered. The prosecution has rightly declined to challenge the correctness of that decision. The reasoning behind that decision bears re-examination.
It was pointed out by this court in that case that s 20 is not well-drafted, for it is self-contradictory. Section 20(4) makes forfeiture conditional on a conviction under s 20(1) and the written application of the Public Prosecutor. It also states, however, that forfeiture shall be made notwithstanding that no one has in fact been convicted.
Section 20(5) on the other hand allows the court, before which the prosecution to an offence under s 20(1) is held, to order either the forfeiture or release of a vehicle liable to forfeiture under s 20(4). Forfeiture is only possible under s 20(4) if there has been a written application by the Public Prosecutor. Thus, it would follow that, to reconcile the two sub-ss, s 20(4) must be read in such a way that a discretion is conferred upon the court whether or not to order forfeiture. In 
 Toh Teong Seng 
, it was therefore held that the word `shall` as used in s 20(4) must be directory rather than mandatory in its effect.
As noted in 
 Toh Teong Seng 
, this discretion is also necessary in the light of the other provisions of s 20. A claim for the vehicle may be made by the owner of the vehicle under s 20(8) (read with sub-ss (6) and (7)) if no prosecution has been made. But, if a prosecution has been made, not resulting in a conviction, there is apparently no provision for the release of the vehicle. Given that the owner may not be involved at all in the offence, as his vehicle may have been stolen perhaps, the court should have the discretion to decide whether or not to release the vehicle concerned.
 Factors governing the discretion
As stated, the prosecution does not seek to challenge the correctness of 
 Toh Teong Seng 
. Rather, a number of grounds have been put forward which, it has been submitted, should be considered in the exercise of the discretion. It has also been argued that the case should be remitted back to the district judge, and that further evidence be adduced to establish that this is a case in which the discretion should be exercised in favour of forfeiture. These two propositions will be considered.
 Grounds for the exercise of discretion
The prosecution has put forward a number of grounds which are supposed to be considered in determining the discretion as to forfeiture, namely:
 
 
(1) whether the vehicle is owned by the offender, and if not whether the owner had connived, participated in, or had nelsonian knowledge of the commission of the offence, taking into account the control by the owner of the use of the vehicle and the knowledge or suspicion that the offence was going to be committed; 
 
(2) whether the owner had benefited from the commission of the offence; 
 
(3) the value of the vehicle; 
 
(4) the rampant use of vehicles in general in illegal dumping, and the consequent need for deterrence; 
 
(5) the extent of the use of the vehicle in the commission of the offence; and 
 
(6) steps taken by the owner to prevent the use of the vehicle in the commission of offences.
  
 
 
Both grounds (1) and (2), if their conditions are met, would present cogent and strong reasons for forfeiture. Certainly the involvement of the owner in some way, whether by participation or through nelsonian knowledge, would be sufficient to attract forfeiture. These, therefore, should be considered in the exercise of the discretion, subject to points raised below concerning the position of the owners.
With regard to ground (3), it was noted in 
 Toh Teong Seng 
 that forfeiture of a vehicle worth tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of dollars would be quite wrong when a fine of at most $2,000 may be levied. As was noted in 
 Gue Song Yam v PP 
 forfeiture whether of vehicles or implements may be out of all proportion to the maximum fine imposed by law. It may also be out of all proportion to the gravity of the offence. The courts would be wary of ordering forfeiture in light of this. It does not follow, however, that in all cases forfeiture would not be ordered if the vehicle was worth a considerable sum. A comparison between the value of the vehicle and the gravity of the offence would be necessary. Where the offence was particularly serious, then forfeiture may be justified, notwithstanding the value of the vehicle in question. But, if the offence is not that serious, the courts would be reluctant to forfeit a vehicle which is worth so much more than the maximum fine. The value of the vehicle is thus a peripheral consideration, to be taken into account in the light of other factors.
Ground (4) is concerned with the deterrence that a forfeiture may have on illegal dumping. This is only a relevant consideration when dealing with an owner who is himself guilty of an offence. An innocent owner cannot be held liable for the actions of others, no matter how much of a deterrent forfeiture of his vehicle would be.
Ground (5) only makes sense in the context of a continuing offence. Section 20(1) is however only concerned with discrete acts; a vehicle is thus either used or not used in the commission of an offence. It is meaningless to talk of the extent of use of the vehicle.
Ground (6) would impose a duty on the owner to ensure that his vehicle is not used for illegal dumping. While the culpability of the owner would to some degree be dependent on the steps taken by him to ensure that his vehicle was not used illegally, in the absence of actual participation or a disregard for the consequences of the use of his vehicle, it is difficult to see why the owner should be penalised. The effect would be to allow forfeiture for mere negligence. Such a result would only be justified in the presence of clear words to that effect. The court would be very reluctant to impose such a wide duty, particularly in view of the fact that s 20(4) provides for a penal sanction.
Thus, some of the grounds put forward by the prosecution would be relevant factors in determining whether the discretion to order forfeiture should be exercised.
 Further evidence
The prosecution has also sought to adduce further evidence tending to show the complicity of the owners of this particular vehicle, Mosco Chong Trading & Services Co, in the illegal dumping. It is argued that the case ought then be remitted back to the district judge for his consideration.
There are a number of possible avenues for this. The prosecution appears to take the view that a disposal inquiry under s 386 of the Criminal Procedure Code should be held. The relevant subsections of s 386 read as follows: 
 
(1) During or at the conclusion of any inquiry or trial in any criminal court the court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal of any document, livestock or other property produced before it.
(2) The power conferred upon the court by this section includes power to make an order for the forfeiture ... or for the delivery to any person of any property regarding ... which appears to have been used for the commission of any offence but shall be exercised subject to any special provisions regarding forfeiture ... or delivery contained ... in any other Act applicable to the case.
 
 
 
It is clear, however, that s 386 cannot be applicable in this instance. The exercise of the discretion regarding forfeiture was made under s 20(4), which is a provision `regarding forfeiture contained in [another act] applicable to the case.` In 
 Hoh Chee Kim & Ors v PP 
, it was held that the equivalent of s 386 had to be read subject to s 20 of the Pawnbrokers Enactment (Cap 85) of Malaysia since the latter governed the disposal of the items in question.
Reference would thus need to be made to s 20 of the Environmental Public Health Act itself. Sections 20(6), (7) and (8) would cover a situation similar to a disposal inquiry. These read as follows: 
 
(6) If there be no prosecution with regard to an offence under subsection (1), the vehicle seized under that subsection shall be forfeited at the expiry of 3 months from the date of seizure unless a claim thereto is made before that date. Any person asserting that he is the owner of such vehicle may personally, or by his agent authorised in writing, give written notice to the Commissioner that he claims the vehicle.
(7) Upon receipt of a notice under subsection (6), the Commissioner may direct that the vehicle be released or may refer the matter by information to a Magistrate. 
(8) The Magistrate shall, on receipt of an information under subsection (7), or on the written application of the Public Prosecutor, hold an inquiry and proceed to determine the matter and shall, on proof that the vehicle was used in the commission of an offence under subsection (1), order the vehicle to be forfeited, or may in the absence of such proof order its release.
 
 
 
However, s 20(6) operates only when there has been no prosecution of an offence. That is not what has happened here. Where there has been a prosecution, s 20(4) and s 20(5) would be the applicable provisions. A remitting of the case in this situation would therefore amount to a retrial. Reference must thus be made to the applicable provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 Retrial, further evidence and revision
In general, the court has available to it the option of ordering a retrial under s 256, Criminal Procedure Code, calling for further evidence under s 257(1) or conducting a revision of proceedings under s 268(1) read with s 266(1).
Section 256 governs retrial upon the hearing of an appeal. The power to order a retrial is available on an appeal either from an acquittal or a conviction. No such power is provided in an appeal as to sentence or from any other order. Even if such a power is available, a retrial will not be ordered simply because the prosecution seeks to adduce further and better evidence: 
 Puspa Kumar v State of Sikkim 
.
Section 257(1) reads: 
 
In dealing with any appeal under [Chapter XXVIII] the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate`s Court.
 
 
 
Such further evidence is only called when it is necessary in the interests of justice: 
 Apabhai Hemabhai Patel v State of Gujarat 
. There is no indication of any such necessity here which would point to a failure of justice.
Section 266(1) states that: 
 
The High Court may call for and examine the record of any criminal proceeding before any subordinate court for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or order recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court.
 
 
 
Section 268(1) reads: 
 
The High Court may in any case, the record of the proceedings of which has been called for by itself or which otherwise comes to its knowledge, in its discretion exercise any of the powers conferred by sections 251, 255, 256 and 257.
 
 
 
A revision is generally ordered when it is urgently demanded in the interest of public justice: 
 Re Radha Krishna Naidu 
. Again, that is not apparent in this situation.
The prosecution in effect seeks to have two goes at obtaining forfeiture. That is unjust, especially when there is nothing on the record itself which indicates the complicity or participation of the owners.
Furthermore, the evidence which the prosecution seeks to adduce may not be sufficient to secure forfeiture even if the case is remitted. That evidence relates to the low use of official disposal facilities, the fact that the offence was committed during working hours, and the apparent lack of instruction about illegal disposal. It is not at all clear that that evidence taken either singly or as a whole would be sufficient to secure forfeiture. That evidence may raise some suspicion of the involvement of the owners, but no one is ever convicted merely on suspicion alone. Everyone is innocent until proven guilty, even owners of vehicles used in illegal dumping.
 The position of the owners
Even if the case is remitted, it must be noted that only the driver, and not the owners, has been prosecuted. Even if the grounds for exercising the discretion exist, and some evidence of the owner`s involvement is adduced, the owner, if he has not been charged, would not be able to refute the allegations directly and have his case heard. There is simply no mechanism for the representation of an owner without his being charged. Section 20(10)(a) states that, for the purposes of s 20(1), the person having charge or control of the vehicle could be deemed to have committed the offence. That is wide enough to cover owners of vehicles. Since it is their property which is liable to be forfeited, owners of vehicles should be charged to enable them to defend themselves.
 General considerations
Some general comments have to be made. Forfeiture is not a really suitable punishment for offences of this nature. Of course forfeiture of an offending vehicle may satisfy the desire to see offenders duly punished, but it is an inflexible tool. The illegal dumping of refuse is an offence which is capable of gradations in seriousness. A cigarette butt thrown out of a car would fall within the ambit of s 20(1). It must be asked whether that is sufficient to justify forfeiture of the car. Of course it could be argued that the Public Prosecutor would have considered various factors in deciding whether to apply for the forfeiture of a vehicle. Be that as it may, such factors would, on the construction of the existing section, have to be placed before the court as well. If Parliament felt that the Public Prosecutor`s discretion was sufficient, and that courts should merely order what the Public Prosecutor decided, then it should so legislate in very clear terms.
As it is, a discretion to impose a wide range of fines would be more effective in punishing offenders and deterring the commission of such offences. $2,000 is the maximum fine for a second conviction punishable under s 21(1) of the Environmental Public Health Act. In view of the possible seriousness of the offence, this is woefully inadequate. A range of fines of up to $100,000 would be a better tool in combating illegal dumping than forfeiture. Fines are precise, amenable to variation and therefore more likely to be effective.
 Order
The appeal is allowed; forfeiture of the vehicle is thus set aside, and the vehicle is to be returned to its owner.

 The facts
 
 
Cur Adv Vult
 
 
The plaintiffs and the defendants were cabin crew staff of Singapore Airlines Ltd (SIA); all 28 of them were members of SIA`s staff union (SIASU/the union) and in particular of the cabin crew division of SIASU. In 1987-88 the eight (8) plaintiffs were delegate members of the cabin crew division of SIASU. In June/July 1988, elections (the elections) for delegates were held for the 1988-89 term and the plaintiffs were candidates as a group bearing electoral numbers 1 to 20 (group 1). The defendants, led by the first defendant, also stood as a group for the elections, opposing the plaintiffs, with electoral numbers 21 to 40 (group 2).
As part of their election campaign, the defendants circulated to members of the cabin crew division of SIASU a pamphlet (the pamphlet) which contained the following words/comments: 
 
Overhead crew rest-door 5 8-bunk & 2 seat shown
 It is a sellout
 
 
 
Are we being served? Vote 21 to 40
Further, above a diagram showing the configuration the following words appeared in the pamphlet: 
 
This is the standard crew bunks for all Boeing 747-400 series. It is vital to have the above since we are going to operate long haul flights with it. The union has agreed to remove the crew bunks since the weight is about 1,000kg. To make matters worse, the union has accepted the space to become a huge coat closet.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs were defeated by the defendants in the elections. The first Boeing B747-400 (the Boeing) ordered by SIA arrived in Singapore in March 1989. It did not have cabin crew rest bunks (the bunks) nor were coat closets installed in lieu of such bunks. The bunks were first fitted in SIA`s tenth Boeing which arrived in Singapore in May 1991; the previous nine Boeings did not have coat closets where the bunks were supposed to be located.
 The pleadings
In the statement of claim the plaintiffs alleged that they lost the elections because of the pamphlet (see AB4) which contents they contended were defamatory of the plaintiffs as in their natural and ordinary meaning the words meant and were understood to mean that:
 
 
(1) there had been an agreement or contract corruptly made by the plaintiffs sacrificing the interests of the cabin crews for their own private interest, and they had acted in bad faith; 
 
(2) the plaintiffs did nothing to preserve the interests of the cabin crews and had acted in conspiracy (particulars were furnished of this allegation); 
 
(3) the plaintiffs not only did something wrong but compounded their error.
  
 
 
In the further and better particulars which they rendered of the statement of claim the plaintiffs alleged that the words `It is a sellout` in the pamphlet would lead reasonable people to conclude that the words referred to the plaintiffs as they were members of, and representatives of the cabin crew division in, the union.
The plaintiffs alleged that by reason of the false and malicious publication of the pamphlet by the defendants, they had been seriously injured in their reputation and had been brought into public scandal, odium and contempt. They prayed inter alia, for damages and an injunction to restrain the defendants from further printing, distributing, publishing or circulating the pamphlet.
The defendants denied that the pamphlet referred to the plaintiffs and if it did, they denied that the words in question were defamatory in their natural and ordinary and any meaning. In the alternative, the defendants pleaded that the words were true in substance and fact as they were expressions of opinion and fair comment made in good faith and without malice on a matter of public interest. In support of the defence of fair comment for the words `
 the union has agreed to remove the crew bunks since the weight is about 1000kg 
`, pursuant to O 78 r 3(2) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1990, the defendants furnished, inter alia, the following particulars: 
 
(1) the principal object of SIASU as stated in their constitution shall be to regulate relations between the members and their employers for the purpose of, inter alia, to improve the working conditions of the members and enhance their economic and social status; a further object of SIASU as stated in their constitution was to represent the members before their employer and or other persons whenever necessary or desirable in their interest;
... 
(3) at the material time SIA had an order with the Boeing Aircraft Co for three or more Boeing 747-400 (the Boeing[s]) which standard model is fitted with the bunks; 
(4) it was an important requirement of cabin crew staff of SIA that the Boeings should come complete with the standard crew bunks for safety, welfare and other reasons: 
(5) as in other important issues pertaining to the employees of SIA, SIASU represented its members in negotiations with the management of SIA over the issue of the bunks in the Boeings; 
(6) at a meeting between SIASU and SIA`s management on 28 August 1986 (the meeting), SIASU raised the issue of the bunks but was told by the management that providing the bunks in the Boeings was not justifiable. SIASU instead of raising objections or making further representations on the issue, merely accepted the management`s decision without any reservation; 
(7) during the run-up to the elections certain cabin crew of SIA were told by SIA`s acting director of cabin crew that the Boeings earmarked for delivery to SIA would not have the bunks; 
(8) the defendants were of the honest opinion that the removal of the bunks was prejudicial to the interests and welfare of the cabin crew staff of SIA.
 
 
 
The defendants also relied on ss 8 and 9 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75) (the Act) for the pleas of justification and fair comment respectively. The defendants denied that the plaintiffs lost the elections because of the pamphlet but admitted that the eight plaintiffs together with 15 others were unsuccessful candidates.
 The evidence
The plaintiffs, save for the eighth plaintiff Soh Weng Cheok (Soh), testified although Soh was present in court; neither did Soh (who had emigrated to Australia in 1990) file his affidavit evidence-in-chief. Only the seventh defendant Kho Man Poh (Kho) testified on behalf of the defendants. Except for Soh, the plaintiffs still work for SIA - the first plaintiff is a cabin crew executive, the second, third, fourth, sixth and seventh plaintiffs are in-flight supervisors and the fifth plaintiff is a chief steward.
I shall first deal with the testimony of the first and second plaintiffs Mohamed Hussain bin Abdul Rahman (Rahman) and Timothy John Woodford (Woodford); they said:
 
 
(1) they were delegate members of the cabin crew division of SIASU from 1985 to June 1988; 
 
(2) the pamphlet was circulated to all members of the cabin crew division eligible to vote in the elections. The pamphlet expressly/impliedly stated that the plaintiffs had dishonestly or for some ulterior purpose or benefit compromised or deliberately failed to protect the interests of the cabin crew; they had no idea how the defendants got the bunk layout printed in the pamphlet as the same was not with SIA at the material time. The bunks was one of the contentious issues raised in the elections as at that time the Boeing was due to be delivered to SIA; 
 
(3) the need for the bunks in the Boeing was first raised by SIASU representatives at the meeting (see minutes at AB5-9) which they both attended; SIA`s then director of cabin crew, Yap Kim Wah, had explained (item 5 at AB8) that as not all Boeings would be used solely for long haul routes, providing the bunks would not be justifiable; SIASU`s request, however, was put as an item in the wish list of cabin crew of the Boeing, meaning that SIA would let the Boeing come in first, settle its long distance routes and then review the matter. As the Boeing was not yet in and there was no outright refusal of SIASU`s request it made no sense to arm-twist SIA further and the subject was not pursued; 
 
(4) by the date of the elections no decision had been made to have SIA`s Boeing fitted with the bunks yet the defendants led by the first defendant capitalized on the issue by the pamphlet which gave voters the false impression that there was some dishonesty or collusion in the way SIASU representatives dealt with SIA management; that was why candidates from group 1 which included the plaintiffs lost the elections; 
 
(5) in fact, the first Boeing to have the bunks installed was delivered to SIA on or about 21 May 1991 prior to which the nine Boeings previously delivered did not have a `
 huge coat closet 
` in the rear where the bunks were supposed to be located; there were just empty spaces. In the B747-200 and B747-300 aircraft, the flight crew had the rest bunks installed at various locations and, in the latter, the flight crew`s bunks installed in the upper deck were, in the Boeing, converted into a large closet space. There is, however, no closet space in the tail section of the Boeing as alleged in the pamphlet; 
 
(6) therefore, the allegations in the pamphlet are manifestly untrue. This was known to the seventh defendant, Kho, as he attended the meeting; 
 
(7) their reputations had been smeared by the defendants` unfounded allegations and, to date, they were still asked by some SIASU members why the plaintiffs never got the bunks for the cabin crew or why they had `sold out` to management.
  
 
 
Under cross-examination and re-examination Rahman (PW1):
 
 
(1) said that in 1988 SIA had between 2,000 to 2,500 cabin crew staff of which close to 2,000 were members of SIASU and who voted in the elections; 
 
(2) disagreed that the words `
 the Union 
` refer to SIASU - the ordinary cabin crew member would take the words to mean the cabin crew division of SIASU notwithstanding that there is no such creature as a cabin crew union; 
 
(3) said 43 candidates vied for 20 seats in the 1988 elections and save for three independent candidates, the other 40 were divided equally between groups 1 and 2; 
 
(4) said he held the office of vice president in SIASU after the 1985 elections - he was the only executive committee member from group 1 whilst from group 2 the seventh and tenth defendants were office bearers; 
 
(5) agreed that the pure jet allowance ($50) paid by SIA to cabin crew who served on jet aircraft was an issue but not a crucial issue in the elections; 
 
(6) confirmed that by the time of the elections a collective agreement had been signed with SIA albeit late, covering all employees. He agreed that to a certain extent the collective agreement issue could have affected the outcome of the elections; 
 
(7) agreed that there could be many reasons why voters did not vote for candidates from group 1; 
 
(8) said long haul flights were the London-Singapore sector which prior to the use of the Boeings was operated by SIA by the use of B747-300 aircraft which did not have the bunks - the cabin crew took their rest periods in passenger seats. However, the Boeing was to be used in addition to and not as replacement for the B747-300 aircraft for the London-Singapore sector; the B747-300 aircraft was also used by SIA for short flights; 
 
(9) said before SIA took delivery of the Boeings he was aware of only one American carrier which had the bunks installed in the aircraft; 
 
(10) said before SIA took delivery of the aircraft, he knew that some carriers had the bunks installed in the aft and some in the cargo hold of, the Boeing; 
 
(11) said it was the cabin crew division of SIASU who brought up the issue of the bunks at the meeting, they registered the point to SIA`s management that the bunks were essential, the fact that SIASU kept quiet did not mean that they had forgotten about the bunks; the minutes (which were prepared by SIA) only recorded SIA`s views not SIASU`s - SIASU did not accept SIA`s explanation. It was only a question of timing as to when SIASU would raise the matter again, hence the request was put in the wish list; the right timing would have been after the elections because the Boeing was arriving in mid-June 1989 and those elected would be able to negotiate with SIA on firmer ground. In fact, it was one of the specific objectives in the election manifesto of group 1 (see exh P1) to improve the rest area and rest periods especially in the Boeing; 
 
(12) said SIASU did raise the subject again informally whenever they met with SIA`s management; 
 
(13) pointed out that although the divisional delegates and group 1 were not named in the pamphlet, the finger was pointed at SIASU and in particular at the plaintiffs. It was well known in cabin crew circles that group 1 comprised the majority of the incumbents from the 1985 elections and that he was the most active incumbent. Further, the delegates from the 1985 elections who were not active had resigned by the time of the elections and they did not seek re-election; 
 
(14) said the minutes of meetings between SIASU and the management of SIA would not be available to a cabin crew member of the union and the only way the latter would know what transpired between management and SIASU would be through circulars or at `meet the members sessions` held periodically by the union; 
 
(15) said although it was not stated in SIASU`s constitution it was understood by union members that the divisional delegates would be responsible for the day to day running of cabin crew matters as well as their interests vis Ã  vis the collective agreement with SIA; 
 
(16) said that the first defendant secured close to 1,500 votes, he obtained about 400 votes. This was to be contrasted with the 1985 elections where he secured 1,160 votes; 
 
(17) explained that the new cabin crew at the material time had the jet allowance as well as a separate allowance of $80; SIASU agreed to incorporate the jet allowance into the salary as that would increase the bonus element and the union intended to negotiate for the $80 allowance to be included in the salary also - it was not a question of the cabin crew being paid an overall increase in salary of $30 after deducting the jet allowance; 
 
(18) said his reputation was smeared by the pamphlet as it said he had sold out. He was asked by Philip Voon and by many other friends from the cabin crew division whether that allegation was true.
  
 
 
 
 Under cross-examination Woodford (PW2)
 
 
 
(1) pointed out that if anyone in SIASU was to be blamed for the union`s failings it should be Kho, the seventh defendant, as he was then the general secretary, the most active office bearer and the person most closely identified with SIASU; subsequently Kho was ousted from the executive committee notwithstanding which he remained as an active divisional delegate until the elections; 
 
(2) said that the tenth defendant, Kwek Song Eng (Kwek), was similarly an active divisional delegate and was also an office bearer after the 1985 elections. For the elections it was widely known that both Kho and Kwek were incumbents and that they had crossed sides to align themselves with the defendants. In fact, the first defendant, Eddie Chew, was an incumbent in the 1985 elections; 
 
(3) said he was not a member of the executive committee after the 1985 elections but most cabin crew staff knew that he was a divisional delegate because new members would ask and they would be told that it was him. In fact he was the vice-chairman of the division and the chairman was either the first plaintiff or the first defendant; 
 
(4) said that when the issue was raised at the meeting he listened to the management`s explanation why SIA would not install the bunks in the Boeing, he neither agreed nor disagreed. In his mind he wanted to carry on with negotiations although he accepted that for short flights there was no justification for the bunks; however, if the aircraft was used for short as well as long haul flights, then the bunks should be installed; 
 
(5) explained that he did not pursue the issue at that time because the timing was not right; he wanted to gather enough data/movement such as the routes for the Boeing (which task he left to the first plaintiff) to counter what the management had to say, he wanted more clout; the matter should have been raised again before the first Boeing came in but he could not as he was not elected; 
 
(6) said that besides exh P1 the plaintiffs put up some posters on the election day itself to refute certain allegations made by the defendants who raised a lot of issues to undermine the plaintiffs; 
 
(7) said that while he cannot say the plaintiffs lost the elections as a result of the pamphlet it was a contributing factor to the extent of 80%; 
 
(8) pointed out that if he was selling anybody out he was selling himself out as he was part and parcel of the cabin crew; he was asked by cabin crew members of SIASU on flights and he would have to explain to them that he was not selling them out.
  
 
 
Much the same evidence as that of the first and second plaintiffs was given by the third, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh plaintiffs. In their cross-examination or re-examination:
 
 
(a) the third plaintiff (PW3) clarified that he was not an office bearer after the 1985 elections but as a divisional delegate he (together with the fifth plaintiff Adrian Lam) was assigned by the chairman the duty of looking into crew grievances and bar discrepancies. He was not aware of the goings on in the executive committee, even so he regarded himself as a prominent union leader as he was well recognized by crew members in the divisional delegates because of his duties. In the cabin crew context the divisional delegates would be considered the cabin crew union and so would `
 the Union` 
. In 1987 he was nominated by the divisional delegates to go to Seattle to help plan the galley layout for the Boeing. He ascertained from a visit to the factory that the Boeing can fit eight of the bunks if the buyer requested for them as it is not a standard feature. He was aware that the initial Boeings delivered to SIA were used for short flights and for training but the later deliveries were used for long haul flights; the Boeings without the bunks did not have coat closets, there were just empty spaces where the bunks could have been installed. 
 
(b) the fourth plaintiff (PW4) explained that as a divisional delegate of SIASU he was assigned the tasks of crew operations, rostering and operating patterns; 
 
(c) the fifth plaintiff (PW5) confirmed the evidence of the first and second plaintiffs that to cabin crew members `
 the Union 
` would mean delegates from the cabin crew division of SIASU; 
 
(d) the sixth plaintiff (PW6) said he had not heard any cabin crew ask Woodford why he never got them the bunks and why he had sold them out; 
 
(e) the seventh plaintiff (PW7) said he had heard cabin crew union members ask the first and second plaintiffs in his presence why the latter had sold them out.
  
 
 
I turn next to the defendants` case. The evidence of their only witness Kho, who is also an SIA in-flight supervisor, is as follows:
 
 
(1) he was first elected as a divisional delegate to represent the cabin crew in the Singapore Airlines Transport Union (SATU) in 1978; SATU eventually split into two unions one of which was SIASU. Before SIASU was registered in 1984-85 he was its pro-tem chairman and it was during that period that SIASU came to know that SIA was in the midst of purchasing the Boeing for its long haul flights (of 12 hours duration or more). He and other union leaders were aware that the Boeing purchased by SIA would not come with the bunks; 
 
(2) in the 1985 elections of SIASU he was a successful candidate together with the tenth defendant (Kwek) and ten others, who included six of the plaintiffs. He was duly elected as a divisional delegate, then as an executive committee member and finally as the general secretary of SIASU which office he held until the (1988) elections; 
 
(3) the issue of the bunks was first raised at the divisional delegates level of SIASU at the meeting (which he attended); the management said the bunks would not be installed in the Boeings SIA had purchased because of the cost, they had a deadweight of 1,000kg and would raise fuel consumption. The divisional delegates present at the meeting accepted the management`s explanation and thereby tacitly agreed to the removal of the (standard) bunks; 
 
(4) the divisional delegates did not pursue the matter after the meeting, not even at the executive committee level of SIASU, the management did not want to talk about it any more. The impression created amongst the divisional delegates was that either he or the first plaintiff would bring it up if necessary as both of them were in the executive committee. Hence the matter was kept in abeyance until it was brought up as an issue in the elections; 
 
(5) together with the 19 other defendants he stood as a team (group 2) for the elections led by the first defendant; the pamphlet was one of many the defendants produced during the campaigning period which was between 30 June and 16 July 1988. The defendants brought up the matter of the bunks because they felt it was a pressing issue as the bunks are essential on long haul flights to ensure proper rest for the cabin crew to enable them to provide the high quality in-flight service demanded of them; 
 
(6) the word 
 sellout 
in the pamphlet had no improper connotation and it was never the defendants` intention to state there was corruption, improper or immoral activity on the part of the plaintiffs. The defendants thought that SIASU had not done a good job in protecting the interests of the cabin crew; they blamed the entire union and especially the executive committee as well as the divisional delegates for failing to secure the bunks; they just gave up without a fight. In this context 
 sellout 
 meant they did not do their job diligently; there was no intention to single out the plaintiffs or the divisional delegates for blame as if so he would be blaming himself too, being one of the incumbents. He agreed that cabin crew would know that he, the first, second, third and fourth plaintiffs were divisional delegates by virtue of their being very senior staff but he was not certain about the other plaintiffs; cabin crew of SIA has a high turnover; 
 
(7) he, the first and five other defendants were responsible for the publication of the pamphlet which came from various sources; 
 
(8) the words `
 the union has agreed to remove the crew bunks since the weight is about 1,000kg 
` were true because the union accepted the management`s explanation that the bunks were impractical due to the weight; the words did not suggest that the plaintiffs had acted in conspiracy as alleged; 
 
(9) the words `
 to make matters worse, the union has accepted the space to become a huge coat closet 
`were the defendants` belief at that time as it had been the practice of SIA to turn empty spaces in aircrafts into coat closets -indeed the first few Boeings had coat closets in the space meant for the bunks. Therefore the words were not defamatory of the plaintiffs; 
 
(10) the bunks were amongst a number of issues that were hotly canvassed during the elections and any of them could have influenced the majority of the cabin crew to vote for the defendants; it is therefore absurd for the plaintiffs to say they lost the elections because of the pamphlet; 
 
(11) both groups as well as independent candidates put up posters in the same locations including the cabin crew reporting room where SIA staff reported for work. Besides the pamphlet the defendants produced another poster relating to the jet allowance (see exh P2). Pamphlets were also inserted into the lockers of each cabin crew save for those that the defendants knew to be non-union members or opposition candidates; 
 
(12) when the Boeings were first delivered to SIA in 1989 they came without the bunks; the bunks were standard on Cathay Pacific aircraft and there was no reason why SIA cabin crew could not have them; 
 
(13) he denied that the plaintiffs suffered loss and damage as a result of the publication of the pamphlet which purpose was for vote catching.
  
 
 
Under cross-examination Kho said he understood from the fourth defendant who had visited the aircraft`s factory at Seattle, that the standard bunks provided in the Boeing were 4 plus 2 but he had no evidence that SIA had told the manufacturer not to supply the bunks. He agreed that the 8-bunk layout shown in the pamphlet was not the standard format as the defendants had alleged. Further at the meeting no one from SIA actually used words to the effect that the bunks were standard fittings but because they weighed 1,000kg SIA would remove them as they were dead weight. He could not recall whether in subsequent discussions with the management SIA had ever said they were going to remove the bunks; there was no physical removal of the bunks as the defendants stated in the pamphlet. Putting the bunks on the wish list was like sweeping the issue under the carpet as, unless it was raised again, the matter ended there; it was of low or no priority to SIA. He agreed it was possible that the plaintiffs who were present at the meeting told the management that they wanted to bring up the issue of the bunks at a later date. The bunks which were eventually installed in the Boeing by SIA were in accordance with the layout shown in the pamphlet which he sourced from some airline journal.
 The law
I turn next to the law. In order to succeed in their claim the plaintiffs will have to prove that the following words in the pamphlet:
 
 
(1) `it is a sellout`, 
 
(2) `the union has agreed to remove the crew bunks since the weight is about 1,000kg`, and 
 
(3) `to make matters worse, the union has accepted the space to become a huge coat closet`
  
 
 
were published of and concerned each and every one of them
 and 
 the words were defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning or in their secondary meaning. Only then does the burden shift to the defendants to prove that the words were true or were fair comment made upon a matter of public interest.
The defendants in their closing submissions contended that only the word 
 sellout 
 is capable of a defamatory meaning. Even so, their counsel argued, the sting in the word is removed when construed in the context of the whole pamphlet as it must be (
 Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies 
 at p 397); it is not defamatory and it does not imply the meaning alleged by the plaintiffs, namely, that they had acted in bad faith and had made some corrupt agreement for their own benefit sacrificing the interests of the cabin crew.
 The findings
In the 
 Concise Oxford Dictionary 
 the word `sellout` is defined as`a betrayal`. Therefore substituting 
 betrayal 
 for 
 sellout 
in the first statement in the pamphlet, the sentence reads `
 It is a betrayal 
`. There can be no doubt that those words are defamatory in their natural and ordinary meaning, that is to say, in the meaning in which reasonable men of ordinary intelligence, with the ordinary man`s general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs, would be likely to understand them; the natural and ordinary meaning may also include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader would draw from the words. Betrayal connotes disloyalty or treachery. Far from removing the sting in the word `sellout` (as the defendants contended), the second and third sentences (`the union has agreed to remove the crew bunks since the weight is about 1,000kg. To make matters worse, the union has accepted the space to become a huge coat closet`) read in the context of the first sentence, are clearly defamatory. There is no necessity therefore to consider the secondary meanings ascribed to the three sentences by the plaintiffs nor the defendants` counter argument that such meanings cannot be sustained as the special knowledge on the part of readers to support such inferential meaning or innuendo has not been particularized. The fact that the defendants intended the pamphlet to catch votes and not to malign or defame the plaintiffs is of course no defence as the question is 
 not 
what the defendants did or did not intend but what reasonable men, knowing the circumstances in which the words were published, would understand to be the meaning (see 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) p 45 para 89).
Before I make the further determination whether the plaintiffs have discharged the burden of proving that the libellous words refer to them, I wish to first deal with the defences of fair comment and justification and ss 8 and 9 of the Act upon which the defendants also rely.
In so far as fair comment is concerned, counsel for the defendants in his submissions stated that the defendants have to prove the following three factors:
 
 
(1) the words `it is a sellout` are comment; 
 
(2) there is a basis of fact for the comment; 
 
(3) the comment is on a matter of public interest.
  
 
 
Another factor to be considered is that the comment must be fair. Counsel contended that the comment `it is a sellout` was based on the second sentence which he said was a fact. With respect, I reject that argument;the second sentence `the union had agreed to remove the crew bunks since the weight is about 1,000kg`was not a 
 fact 
, indeed the first and second plaintiffs who attended the meeting denied they had agreed to the removal and Kho who also attended the meeting admitted there was no such agreement although he argued it could be implied. Neither was it established as a fact that the manufacturer installs the bunks in the Boeing as a standard feature and that SIA specifically requested for the bunks to be removed from the ten (10) units which it ordered; indeed Kho admitted he had no evidence to support this allegation. Therefore there were no facts upon which the defendants based their 
 statement, not comment 
, `it is a sellout`.
Indeed even the sentence in the pamphlet, `This is the standard crew bunks for all Boeing-400 series,`was admitted by Kho to be incorrect. In this regard I am in agreement with the plaintiffs` contention that Kho`s evidence is generally unreliable and should not be accepted because of various inconsistencies, a number of which counsel highlighted in his closing submissions.
As for s 9 of the Act which states: 
 
In an action for libel or slander in respect of words consisting partly of allegations of fact and partly of expressions of opinion, a defence of fair comment shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved if the expression of opinion is fair comment having regard to such of the facts alleged or referred to in the words complained of as are proved
 
 
 
it cannot assist the defendants as there was no truth in their allegation which in any event was not an expression of opinion.
The defence of fair comment therefore fails. I would add that I do not see how an issue regarding the bunks can be considered a matter of public interest, it would at best be of interest to cabin crew staff of SIA and further narrowed to those who have to serve on long haul flights.
The defendants` plea of justification is similarly not supported by the facts and they cannot avail themselves of s 8 of the Act which states: 
 
In an action for libel or slander in respect of words containing two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence of justification shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff`s reputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charges
 
 
 
as they failed to prove the truth of the substratum of facts for the second sentence.
The plaintiffs further did not adduce any evidence to substantiate the contention in the third sentence that `To make matters worse, the Union has accepted the space to become a huge coat closet.`The facts were to the contrary: the first nine Boeings delivered to SIA did not have the bunks, neither did they have coat closets let alone huge coat closets in the spaces meant for the bunks. Clearly, the defendants have failed to discharge the burden of proving the truth of what they alleged.
I turn now to the second limb of the plaintiffs` burden of proof, that is, can the ordinary reader identify them by the words `the union` in the pamphlet? There was conflicting evidence from the witnesses on the meaning of the word `the union` - it could mean SIASU or the executive committee of SIASU or the divisional delegates representing the various divisions of SIASU or, as the plaintiffs contended, the divisional delegates representing the cabin crew. Rahman had testified that the fact that he and the other plaintiffs were incumbent delegates would be known to staff of the cabin crew division of SIA. Kho agreed that cabin crew staff would know that he and the first four plaintiffs were divisional delegates.
The defendants on the other hand contended that `the union` can only refer to SIASU as a whole. Even if the cabin crew staff knew that the plaintiffs were incumbent delegates this fact would only be known to senior cabin crew of at least the same rank as the plaintiffs but not the ordinary cabin crew as the division has a high turnover. Counsel for the defendants pointed out that not a single witness was called to substantiate the plaintiffs` evidence that they had been asked by cabin crew why they had sold them out. Conversely if the plaintiffs` contention was accepted, then it is arguable that cabin crew would also know that the first, seventh and tenth defendants were also incumbent delegates and `the union` would refer to them as well. It cannot be that the defendants would issue a pamphlet criticizing themselves; therefore the plaintiffs` interpretation of the word cannot be right, there is also no such creature as a cabin crew union.
Before proceeding further I am dismissing the claim of the eight plaintiff with costs as he did not, and could not in any event, testify having failed to comply with the order of court made on 25 March 1994 to file his affidavit evidence-in-chief before taking the witness stand.
For them to succeed in this action, the plaintiffs must satisfy the court that the ordinary reader of the pamphlet would equate them with the words `the union`.
Counsel for the defendants had cited 
 Knupffer v London Express Newspaper 
 to support his contention that the plaintiffs had failed to establish their identity as the persons defamed. His opponent on the other hand sought to distinguish the case. The facts in that case were as follows.
The respondents printed and published in their newspaper on 1 July 1941 the following words: 
 
The quislings on whom Hitler flatters himself he can build a pro-German movement within the Soviet Union are an emigre group called Mlado Russ or Young Russia. They are a minute body professing a pure Fascist ideology who have long sought a suitable 
 fuehrer
 - I know with what success. Established in France and the United States they claim to have secret agents able to enter or leave the Soviet Union at will. Hitler intends to nominate a puppet 
 fuehrer
 from their ranks to replace the Soviet national leaders of the Kremlin and establish a reactionary totalitarian serf State on the German and Italian model. The proposed line of operation is the seducing of Red Army officers from their allegiance to their country and with their aid destroying trade unions, co-operatives, collective farms and the Soviet parliamentary system with a ruthless massacre of all the present leaders, great and small, of the Russian people. The vast majority of Russian emigres repudiate these people, but Hitler is accustomed to find instruments among the despised dregs of every community. He intends Ukrainian pogroms as a starting point for general anarchy in Russia.
 
 
 
The appellant, a Russian resident in London, brought an action against the respondents for damages for libel, setting out the above words in the statement of claim, and alleging that they had been falsely and maliciously printed and published of him by the respondents. The respondents who did not plead justification, denied that they printed or published the words of the appellant or that they were reasonably capable of being understood to refer to him. Evidence was given at the trial that the appellant had joined the Young Russia Party in 1928, that in 1935 he became assistant representative of the party in Great Britain, and that in 1938 he was appointed representative of the party in Great Britain and head of the British branch. The headquarters of the party were in Paris until June 1940 when they were removed to America. The total membership was about 2,000 and the British branch comprised 24 members. Four witnesses who were acquainted with the appellant were called on his behalf and were asked questions to the following effect: `To whom did your mind go when you read the article?`
Each intimated that it was to the appellant. Stable J held that the words of the libel referred to the appellant and entered judgment for him for Â£3,500 damages. The Court of Appeal held that the words could not be regarded as referring to him and allowed the appeal. The appellant appealed to the House of Lords who affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeal. In dismissing the appeal, Viscount Simon LC (at p 121) pointed out that the four witnesses identified the appellant as the subject of the article because they happened to know the appellant as the leading member of the society in England and not because there was anything in the article itself which ought to suggest even to his friends that he was referred to as an individual.
The Lord Chancellor posed the following two questions in the attempt to identify the appellant as the person defamed. 
 
The first question is a question of law - can the article having regard to its language, be regarded as capable of referring to the appellant? The second question is a question of fact - does the article in fact lead reasonable people, who know the appellant, to the conclusion that it does refer to him? Unless the first question can be answered in favour of the appellant the second question does not arise ... .
 
 
 
Applying the first test to this case I am of the view that the question of law must be answered in favour of the plaintiffs. Leaving aside the contentious interpretation of the word `the union`, the court must look at the entire wording in the pamphlet (apart from the three sentences) to determine whether the cabin crew members of the union would know that the `mudslinging` (in Kho`s words) was aimed at the plaintiffs. It was Kho`s evidence that the pamphlet together with another pamphlet (exh P2) and the plaintiffs` pamphlet (P1) were put up in the reporting room where all staff reported for duty; P1 contained the photographs of the 20 candidates in group 1 below this caption: 
 
SIA Cabin Crew Divisional Delegates Election
 
 
 
Please vote Nos 1 to 20
 
 
 
On the reverse side of P1 were the words: `Vote wisely for an effective team`.
The plaintiffs then set out on the left side under the title `Our Achievements`six items and on the opposite side they set out an equal number of items under the title `Our Objectives` which included as item 4 the following objective: 
 
Seek for better rest area and test periods
 
 
 
Our current rest area and rest periods need to be improved. We shall seek to improve on this especially with the operation of the B747-400 series.
 
 
 
The pamphlet contained these words: `Are we being served? Vote 21 to 40.`
Exhibit P2 which touched on the twin issues of the pure jet allowance of $50 and the increment of $80 contained, inter alia, the following statements: 
 
Super jumbo sale
 
 
 
Vote 21 to 40
 
 
 
Eddie Chew + Team
 
 
 
However, Cabin Crew Divisional Chairman Eddie Ang Soon Chye & Team agreed to abolish the pure jet allowance.
 
 
 
`Eddie Ang and Team is cutting cost at our expense.`
Would the cabin crew who reported for duty on reading P1, P2 and the pamphlet come to the conclusion that the last referred to candidates 1 to 20? It is a reasonable inference they would. Knowing that the election was for representation in the cabin crew division of SIASU, it is unlikely that voters would equate the words `the union` with the executive committee of SIASU let alone SIASU itself as the defendants contended.
The second question is one of fact. It is not disputed, as the defendants contended in their closing submissions, that no independent witness from the cabin crew division be it from the rank and file or from the senior staff gave evidence to support the plaintiffs` contention that the defendants well knew that voters at the elections equated `the union` with the incumbent plaintiffs who were seeking re-election. Is that omission fatal to the plaintiffs` claim? I think not. Apart from direct evidence from witnesses, the court can take into account relevant surrounding circumstances which would or might lead those who read the libel to conclude that the plaintiffs were the persons referred to in the pamphlet. The test of whether words that do not specifically name the plaintiff refer to him or not is this: Are they such as reasonably in the circumstances would lead persons acquainted with the plaintiff to believe that he was the person referred to? If in the circumstances the description is such that a person reading the alleged libel would reasonably believe that the plaintiff was referred to, that is a sufficient reference to him. At the same time it is not necessary for every person to know who the defamatory words referred to, indeed that would be an impossibility in many cases. However, if a substantial number of persons who knew the plaintiffs when reading the pamphlet would believe that it referred to them, then the plaintiffs have made out their case.
Even if the ordinary member of the public who reads a defamatory statement would not regard it as referring to the plaintiff, it will still be held to refer to the plaintiff if it has been published to readers who as a result of special knowledge or facts would understand it as so referring, which was the plaintiffs` contention. The question then is, `how ordinary sensible men ... having the special knowledge proved, could understand the words complained of` (per Lord Reid in 
 Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd 
 at p 1243). In essence the pamphlet must, to the mind of the cabin crew who voted in the election, point to the plaintiff incumbents as the persons who were referred to.
Again one has to consider the three pamphlets that were put up in the cabin crew reporting room. From P1, cabin crew would know that the plaintiffs were incumbents who were relying on their previous achievements and future objectives to be re-elected. Reading item 4 of the plaintiffs` objective in P1 with P2 and the pamphlet, it would be obvious to any cabin crew voter that the words `it is a sellout` must refer to Eddie Ang`s team, that he was leader of the plaintiffs and that the defendants led by Eddie Chew opposed them. I have no doubt that the plaintiffs have passed the second test.
My views are supported by the second authority cited by the defendants 
 Price Waterhouse Intrust Ltd v Wee Choo Keong 
. In that case, on the issue of identification of the appellants in the libellous letter which did not name the appellants specifically, the Court of Appeal held that the test was whether the words used in the letter were such as would reasonably lead persons acquainted with the appellants to believe that they were being referred to. The letter in question was not published to the public at large but to the Official Receiver and a bank, each of whom knew the following facts: that at the material time Quality Oil was in receivership, with the appellants as receivers and managers, that while Quality Oil was in receivership its assets were sold to Pioneer (another company) and that the appellants as receivers and managers were the persons who had negotiated, concluded and completed the sale. An ordinary sensible person aware of these facts when reading the letter would reasonably come to the conclusion that the words complained of referred to the appellants.
As for the defendants` other contention that the first, seventh and tenth defendants being incumbent delegates it cannot be that they would criticize themselves if the words `the union` meant cabin crew divisional delegates, I would refer to the other holding in 
 Price Waterhouse Intrust Ltd v Wee Choo Keong 
 - it was immaterial that the words complained of also referred to other persons, since there was no requirement in law that they be shown to refer exclusively to the appellants.
The plaintiffs have made out their case that they were known to voters in the elections to be the persons referred to in the pamphlet. Accordingly, there will be judgment for the plaintiffs and costs (one set), and a permanent injunction is granted to restrain the defendants from further printing, publishing, distributing or circulating the pamphlet. However, there was no cogent evidence to support the plaintiffs` contention that they lost the elections as a result of the pamphlet - any number of factors could have been responsible for their defeat. Neither have their careers suffered as all of them have since risen to senior positions in the cabin crew division of SIA attaining at least the rank of chief steward and in the case of the first plaintiff he is now a cabin crew executive. I therefore award the first to seventh plaintiffs nominal damages in the sum of $10 each.

The plaintiff is a prominent politician, a Member of Parliament and an advocate and solicitor. The defendants run a restaurant. Their managing director, Mr Leong Mun Kwai (Leong), and assistant general manager, Mr Sham Sang @ Sham Loon Sang (Sham), gave evidence. Leong was the mind and management of the defendants. He played the key role in the publications of the three advertisements, the subject matter of the plaintiff`s claim for compensatory and exemplary damages for the libel contained in them. Further, his motivations, attitude and his responses and conduct towards the plaintiff, even in the witness box, were not only patronizing but unnecessarily provocative and quite mischievous.
On 29 May 1992, the plaintiff and his party supporters in the SDP had a birthday dinner celebration at the defendants` restaurant. The plaintiff and his wife arrived late. The karaoke singing was already in progress. In fact, Leong was on stage singing. The plaintiff was asked to sing and that night $1,000 was raised by way of contributions from his supporters and friends. On the table was a copy one of the earlier advertising handbills of the defendants. Handbills were one of the defendants` commercial media to advertise and promote business. That handbill publicized the karaoke singing competition then conducted by the defendants to raise funds for charity. Unlike the two handbills in question, there was in that handbill only an insignificant reference to the defendants` restaurant; this reference could easily have been missed. I accepted Sham`s evidence that he had announced that the singing competition was for the cause of charity. He had also announced that the plaintiff would sing a popular song Chinese song known as `Rong Shu Xia`. Those present would, as usual, donate and the amount of the donation depended on the popularity of the singer, the song or both. I also accepted that Sham had announced that publicity would be given. One of the questions in this case was what was exactly the publicity to be given. This aspect was relevant because it was a defence that the plaintiff had consented to or acquiesced in the eventual advertisement of the charitable occasion and the plaintiff`s contribution in it. I was of the view that probably what was announced was that publicity would be given to the charitable event, including the roles of the defendants and the plaintiff, on that occasion. What was definitely not announced was anyway near the kind, nature, form and get-up which the three advertisements eventually took.
On 24 June 1992 there appeared on p 6 of the 
 New Paper 
 the defendants` advertisement containing a photograph which showed the plaintiff holding a microphone. About 95% of the advertisement referred to the restaurant, what it was offering to customers, the menu and the set meals. It was an advertising puff. Next to the plaintiff was a caption in Chinese and a caption in English. That they were different was significant. The Chinese version mentioned that `Member of Parliament Chiam See Tong`s single song `Rong Shu Xia` raised $1,000.` On the other hand, and it was significant to note, the version in English was general and did not refer to the plaintiff`s role at all. Instead, it stated: `Charity/Fund collection/Community Chest Activity Dedication Songs are welcome.` In that way and to the English non-Chinese reader, the plaintiff was delinked from the charity event under reference. The offer was for the period 26 June 1992 till August 31 as stated. An ordinary reader in English, who did not read Chinese, of that page of the 
 New Paper 
 would conclude that the plaintiff was making a commercial announcement for the defendants. Having read and seen Leong in his responses, I concluded that Leong deliberately made use of the photograph of the plaintiff and his popularity as a Member of Parliament in such a way in the advertisement that his purpose was to promote the defendants` business as a restaurant.
The attention of the plaintiff to the advertisement was drawn by a reporter of the 
 New Paper 
. He was outraged and said that he had not allowed the defendants to use his photograph in advertisements. He said it would cheapen his image in the eyes of the public and had belittled him by the suggestion that he had agreed for reward to be used for a commercial purposes in advertising the business of the defendants. He also said that he felt that his reputation as a Member of Parliament and as an advocate and solicitor was compromised; that he was unworthy of his status in both capacities.
I now refer to the two copies of the handbill, exhs P4 and P5. Exhibit P5 is the larger version and P4 is smaller and in English with Chinese captions. Again an ordinary reader in English, who could not read Chinese, would conclude that the plaintiff was advertising for the business of the defendants.
In the law of defamation, a very helpful test of what is defamatory is that formulated by Lord Atkin in 
 Sim v Stretch 
 at p 1240, which was this: `Would the words tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally?` In our context, the question I asked myself as representing the reasonable man was: `would a substantial and respectable proportion of the English but non-Chinese readership of the 
 New Paper 
 and the handbills think less well of the plaintiff after reading them?` 
 Tolley v JS Fry & Sons Ltd 
 was referred to. It represented a finding in the particular context of the gentlemen`s game of golf and the socially unacceptable implication that one`s amateur status was being `prostituted`. In my view, in this case, what was in issue was quite important and was on a different scale as the tone and standards of any holder of high public office and those of an advocate and solicitor required a careful, proportionate and purposeful expression in the law of defamation. Neither a casual, easy-going and liberal approach nor a highly puritanical standard would be warranted. The law must protect a person`s good name; a fortiori that of a holder of public office.
I considered the three advertisements on the basis set out above and also in the context of the commercial purposes of the defendants and the circumstances in which those advertisements were being circulated. I came to the conclusion that all three advertisements were defamatory of the plaintiff and that to the ordinary English reader, who did not read Chinese, the photographic portrait suggested that the plaintiff had consented to the use of his photograph for publicity either for gain or to sponsor a private restaurant and that he had done so by taking advantage of his position as a Member of Parliament and also for the benefit of promoting himself as an advocate and solicitor. In my view, a substantial proportion of the responsible and right-thinking English but non-Chinese readership would have thought less well of the plaintiff after reading the handbills.
The defence that the three publications were first as a matter of law incapable of bearing the innuendoes asserted by the plaintiff therefore failed. The connected defence that in fact they were not defamatory of the plaintiff also failed. The only other defence was that the plaintiff had agreed, expressly or tacitly (by way of acquiescence), to the use of the plaintiff`s photograph as they had appeared in the three publications. I rejected these claims of both Leong and Sham. The circumstances relating to the dinner and the rendition of the Chinese song by the plaintiff at the highest could only have meant that the plaintiff had agreed to the use of his photograph for the purpose of publicizing a charitable act and nothing else. That would have been a good thing to have done. In contrast, it was very different to portray the plaintiff in the way it was deliberately done. I did not believe Leong`s claim that he was doing the plaintiff a favour, by presenting him in a good light. In my judgment, he had used the photograph to attract customers to the business of the restaurant and had wrongfully appropriated the reputation of the plaintiff both as a Member of Parliament and an advocate and solicitor for commercial purposes.
The subsequent conduct of the defendants as represented and expressed by Leong was most enervating and aggravating. It provoked the plaintiff into suing. On 24 June 1992 the solicitors of the plaintiff wrote to the defendants complaining of the libel and demanding that all publications should cease. An article appeared in the 
 New Paper 
, and it raised the propriety of the appearance of the photograph of the plaintiff. More than a month later, that is on 27 July 1992, the defendants through Leong faxed the office of the plaintiff. The defendants replied on the plaintiff`s letter in Chinese. It stated as follows: 
 
... you must have learnt from the 
 New Paper
 about your photograph being featured only in the past `advertisement` or handbills (30,000 copies had been printed at the time.) Since you are occupied with too many unwanted thoughts and have made known your `objection`, discontinued publication of your photograph is understandable. As a matter of fact, commercially (other than for the purpose of charity) your photograph carries negative effect. Finally, I would still offer my advice to you as a friend, the rising temperature in this weather easily makes one dizzy with a headache, so drink a cup of Chinese 
 Hua Tuo
 herbal tea would do one good, physically and mentally.
 
 
 
It was signed by Leong with the date 28 July 1992 and time as 4 pm. This was a most offensive response; there was nothing contrite about it. The circulation of the remaining handbills continued. It was also mischievous because, having heard Leong and having heard and understood what was behind his mind when he responded, I was left clearly with the impressions that Leong was hitting back with a venom and that his response conveyed the mischievous message that the plaintiff did not understand things Chinese and needed things Chinese to put him right. This I found was totally unacceptable. Leong should not have allowed his predisposition for politics (having been an ex-PAP member and currently a leader in another opposition party) to have entered into this dispute. Leong unfortunately reflected the same intransigence in court when he gratuitously repeated the advice that the plaintiff could benefit from drinking the herbal tea. At one point, he even suggested (and I reject it out of hand) that the plaintiff, having either expressly or tacitly agreed to the advertisement, was immediately afterwards distancing himself just to avert any disciplinary action which the plaintiff was fearful might be taken by the Law Society of Singapore.
I considered the submissions on damages. For the record, the plaintiff left the amount entirely to the court. He did not name a figure. He declined to do so, in spite of the court`s invitation. We looked into a number of awards of defamation cases, including the sums paid in some cases settled out of court. It is unnecessary to refer to them in this judgment. They are all in the record. Taking into account the sound principle that a reputation of integrity and honour for holders of public and professional offices should be protected and the aggravations of Leong, I awarded the sum of $50,000 to the plaintiff to repair the reputation and status of his high office as Member of Parliament and to compensate the plaintiff for his anguish and hurt feelings. I also allowed the injunction as prayed for because Leong did not appear to think he was committing a wrong. I also ordered costs to be taxed on the High Court scale.

These were appeals against Rubin J`s dismissal of the appellants` applications for the transfer of police summons proceedings from the subordinate courts for trial in the High Court pursuant to s 185 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). Both appeals were heard together as similar issues arose. At the conclusion of the hearing, we were of the unanimous opinion that we had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeals. We dismissed the appeals accordingly and we now give our reasons.
 Background
The appellants are Jehovah`s Witnesses. They faced charges under s 4(2) of the Undesirable Publications Act (Cap 338) (UPA) for being in possession of certain prohibited publications and cassette tapes which were published by one Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society (WTBTS) and the International Bible Students Association (IBSA). Both the WTBTS and the IBSA are bodies which are closely associated with Jehovah`s Witnesses. The first and second appellants in Crim App 18/95 faced further charges under s 21(1)(a) of the Films Act (Cap 107) for being in possession of uncensored religious video tapes.
The appellants conceded that the relevant publications were prohibited material either under gazette notification No 123 of 1972 (Order 123), or gazette notification No 405 (Order 405). By Order 123, the Minister for Culture, in the exercise of his powers pursuant to s 3(1) UPA, prohibited the importation, sale and circulation of all publications published or printed by the WTBTS. By Order 405, the Minister for Information and the Arts exercised the same powers under the UPA and prohibited the importation, sale and circulation of all publications published or printed by the IBSA.
 The application and the decision below
By separate criminal motions (No 36/94 and No 6/95), the appellants applied under s 185 CPC for the cases to be transferred and tried in the High Court on the grounds that there were questions of law of unusual difficulty (s 185(1)(b)) and that such an order was expedient for the ends of justice (s 185(1)(e)). The appellants contended that the prohibitions in Orders 123 and 405 were arbitrary and sweeping. They impinged on their right to practise their chosen faith, contrary to art 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, read in the context of arts 15(1) and 152(1), under which `every person has the right to profess and practise his religion and to propagate it` and which enjoins the government to `care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore`.
In the proceedings before Rubin J, counsel for the appellants outlined the issues as follows: whether the respective ministers had exercised their discretion lawfully in making Orders 123 and 405; whether these orders were promulgated in contravention of the principles of natural justice and whether they were ultra vires the UPA. Counsel contended that there were questions of law of unusual difficulty, in connection with the phrases `public interest` under s 3(1) UPA and `public order` under art 15(4) of the Constitution. Finally, counsel contended that the constitutional arguments to be advanced on behalf of the appellants reached beyond the jurisdiction of the subordinate courts.
Rubin J dismissed both motions, agreeing with the prosecution that the very same issues raised by the appellants had already been fully dealt with twice by the learned Chief Justice in 
 Chan Hiang Leng Colin & Ors v PP 
 
 
 
[1994] 3 SLR 662
  and in its sequel, reported in 
 
 
[1995] 1 SLR 687
 . Rubin J noted that in both the 
 Chan Hiang Leng Colin 
 cases, the order primarily challenged was Order No 179 of 1972 (Order 179), under which the Minister for Home Affairs had ordered the dissolution of the Singapore Congregation of Jehovah`s Witnesses under s 24(1) of the Societies Act (Cap 262). Nevertheless, the learned judge opined that `the reference to Order 179 does in no way alter the composite of the issues at hand`; in those cases, the argument canvassed was also that Order 179 was invalid and void on account of it being ultra vires the UPA and thus contrary to arts 12, 15 and 152 of the Constitution. In essence, the same challenge was raised in both the cases before him.
 The appeal
The first hurdle for the appellants was to establish that they had a right of appeal against Rubin J`s decision. Correspondingly, this required them to satisfy us that we had jurisdiction to entertain the appeals.
Section 241 CPC makes it plainly clear that there is no general right of appeal in criminal cases except where the law expressly provides such a right. The general criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is contained in s 29A(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (SCJA), which provides: 
 
The criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall consist of 
 appeals against any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction
, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellants, Mr William Glen How QC, acknowledged that the preliminary question which had to be addressed was whether the High Court, in dealing with a s 185 CPC motion, was making a decision in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction. He referred us to s 18(2) SCJA, which states: 
 
Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall have the powers set out in the First Schedule.
 
 
 
We were referred in turn to item 10 of the First Schedule to the SCJA. The material portions of item 10 of the First Schedule provide that the High Court has the additional power to `transfer any proceedings to any other court or to or from any subordinate court`. Counsel submitted that this implied that the High Court had both the jurisdiction and the power to deal with motions for transfer pursuant to s 185 CPC. By extension, this meant that the High Court was exercising its original criminal jurisdiction when entertaining such motions. In counsel`s submission, this could be inferred since s 18(2) was inserted within Part III of the SCJA under the title `Original Jurisdiction`.
Counsel sought to fortify his submissions by relying on 
 Kulwant v PP 
. In 
 Kulwant 
, Coomaraswamy J observed (at p 13) that under the CPC then in force (Cap 113), the High Court has `original jurisdiction` other than trial jurisdiction to hear specific applications in criminal matters. Section 184 (now s 185 CPC) was cited as one such application.
Mr Bala Reddy contended on behalf of the prosecution that the Court of Appeal was only empowered to hear appeals in criminal cases against orders of finality. He relied on the decision of 
 Mohamed Razip bin Fadzillah & Ors v PP 
. This case raised the question whether there was a right of appeal against an order of the High Court in respect of a bail application. The Court of Appeal ruled that there was no such right. The court reasoned that in general, only orders of finality, ie those resulting in conviction and sentence or acquittal were appealable. An order made on a bail application was, however, interlocutory and tentative in nature.
Arguing by analogy, the prosecution submitted that s 185 CPC involved the exercise of the High Court`s discretion as to an interlocutory matter. The High Court was not exercising its trial jurisdiction. No judgment or order of finality could have been made. In the premises, no right of appeal lay to the Court of Appeal since there was no specific provision in law enabling the appeals to be brought.
 The decision of the court
The CPC is silent as to any question of appeal against a decision of the High Court made under s 185 CPC. The appellants` only recourse was to attempt to bring themselves within the ambit of s 29A(2) SCJA, which they sought to do.
It may be helpful to set out first the various heads of criminal jurisdiction which the SCJA confers on the High Court. Section 3(a) SCJA provides that the High Court shall exercise original and appellate criminal jurisdiction. Section 15 and s 19 SCJA specify the scope of the High Court`s original criminal trial jurisdiction and appellate criminal jurisdiction respectively. Finally, s 27 SCJA clothes the High Court with general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction over all subordinate courts.
We considered whether the High Court was acting in the exercise of its `original jurisdiction` in hearing a s 185 CPC application. In this regard, we noted that Coomaraswamy J`s observations on s 184 CPC (now s 185 CPC) in 
 Kulwant 
`s1 case appeared to support the appellants` arguments. The relevant dicta (at p 13) are as follows: 
 
The CPC has instances giving the High Court original jurisdiction other than trial jurisdiction to hear specific applications in criminal matters. Under section 184, the High Court is vested with power to transfer a criminal case from one court to another on the application of the prosecution or the accused. Another example is found in s 249 where the High Court can hear an application where a person desirous of appealing is debarred from so doing because of not having observed some formality or requirement of the CPC.
 
 
 
The concept of `original jurisdiction` has been defined to mean `jurisdiction to consider a case in the first instance ... to take cognizance of a cause at its inception, try it and pass judgment upon the law and facts`: 
 Black`s Law Dictionary 
 (6th Ed). In 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
, the Court of Criminal Appeal observed (at p 457): 
 
The all-embracing original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court under s 15 of the (Supreme Court of Judicature) Act is not in all cases exercised by the High Court but the administration of criminal justice in respect of what we may call the less serious criminal cases, generally those cases not involving the sentence of death or life imprisonment, is entrusted to the subordinate courts. The exercise of the original criminal jurisdiction of the High Court involves generally the more serious criminal cases or such less serious criminal cases as may be transferred from the subordinate courts to the High Court.
 
 
 
It is implicit from the above dicta that `original jurisdiction` refers to original trial jurisdiction. In respect of the High Court, its original criminal jurisdiction is enumerated under s 15 SCJA, which denotes its trial jurisdiction. For this reason, the dictum of Coomaraswamy J did not assist the appellants. In the present cases, as the prosecution rightly pointed out, there was no trial which had commenced in the High Court. The High Court had not yet taken cognizance of the offences in question. The only matters before the High Court were the applications under s 185 CPC. We recognized that both the magistrate`s court and the High Court may have been jurisdictionally competent to try the offences in question. Nevertheless, the proceedings had been validly commenced in a magistrate`s court, which had properly taken cognizance of the offences and had proceeded to exercise original criminal jurisdiction.
We turned to consider the prosecution`s submissions. Sections 29A(2) and 44 SCJA are the key provisions relating to the criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. While s 44(1) of the pre-existing SCJA may have been deleted and recast as s 29A(2) SCJA, the remaining sub-ss (2) to (5) in s 44 have been retained without any amendment. This clearly indicates that the reasoning and conclusion of the Court of Appeal in 
 Mohamed Razip 
 remain applicable. Accordingly, we agreed with the prosecution`s submission that the Court of Appeal is generally empowered only to entertain appeals which are concerned with orders of finality, ie those resulting in conviction and sentence or acquittal. On this premise, Rubin J`s decision did not give rise to a right of appeal.
We should add that in 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
, the Court of Criminal Appeal had the occasion to deal with an appeal against an order of the High Court dismissing a criminal motion under s 184 CPC (Cap 113) (now s 185 CPC). The Court of Criminal Appeal disposed of that appeal on the merits, agreeing with the High Court that the appellants had not brought themselves within the requirements of s 184 CPC. Nevertheless, no questions touching on the right of appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeal`s jurisdiction were raised. We were of the opinion that decision did not preclude us from disposing of these appeals on the basis that we had no jurisdiction.
We were unanimously of the view that there was no right of appeal lying to the Court of Appeal against Rubin J`s decision. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeals.

You, Kuek Ah Lek @ Kuek Yong Lek ... are charged that you, between February 1994 [sic] at the proposed erection of a pair of two-storey semidetached house located at the junction of Toh Avenue and Upper Changi Road Singapore, did harbour one Indian national, namely Rengasamy Kannadasan ... being a holder of a social visit pass and who has acted in contravention of s 15(1) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133), by remaining in Singapore after the expiry of the visit pass, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 57(1)(d), punishable under s 57(1)(ii) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133).
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution case
 
The prosecution`s case was that on 22 June 1994, at about 9.45 to 9.55am, a party of officers from the Immigration Department conducted a check for overstayers at the worksite of a pair of semidetached houses at Toh Avenue (the worksite). Five workers were detained. The workers identified the appellant as their employer. One of the officers paged for the appellant, who returned the call. The appellant was told to go to the worksite. He arrived there at about 10.30am. Three of the workers were subsequently ascertained to be valid work permit holders and a fourth was a Singapore citizen. The fifth identified himself as Selvanathan Thirunavukkarasu. The identity of this fifth worker was later ascertained from his passport to be Rengasamy Kannadasan (Kannadasan).
The appellant was arrested and escorted to his office at Tan Quee Lan Street. Payment vouchers and work cards relating to Kannadasan were seized. Senior Immigration Officer Png Eng Hock`s (SIO Png) conditioned statement was admitted in court. His evidence was that he approached Kannadasan, who was standing near a heap of sand and cement. Kannadasan gave his name as Selvanathan Thirunavukkarasu. However, he produced a green work permit (P11) under the name of Sethu Sangilimuthu. Kannadasan admitted that he was overstaying. He was arrested.
This was corroborated by Sub-Inspector Savinder Singh (SI Savinder). SI Savinder also gave evidence that on that afternoon, he and Senior Immigration Officer Wong Kong Wa escorted Kannadasan back to the worksite. Kannadasan`s passport was retrieved from the second floor of the uncompleted building. It was kept in a bag. The name on the passport was Rengasamy Kannadasan. Kannadasan said that the passport was his. According to the passport, Kannadasan entered Singapore on 10 November 1992. He was granted a 14-day social visit pass. He had been overstaying in Singapore since 25 November 1992.
Joseph Yeo, a records officer at the Ministry of Labour, gave evidence that a work permit was issued to Sethu Sangilimuthu. The photograph on P11 was not the same as that on the application form for the work permit. The work permit was not issued to Kannadasan. According to the records at the Ministry, no work permit was issued to Kannadasan. As far as he knew, the actual work permit was still with the real holder.
The main prosecution witness was Kannadasan. He gave evidence that after arriving at Changi Airport on 10 November 1992, he went to Tekka Market. He was told that was where all the Indians would be and that he would be able to get employment. Ten days after arriving in Singapore, he managed to get employment. He worked at different places under different employers, often for only two to three days. Kannadasan was approached by the appellant when he was at a site in Geylang. The appellant asked Kannadasan if he would work. Kannadasan said he would and the appellant took him to the worksite at Toh Avenue. Kannadasan was paid $35 per day at the worksite. His job was to mix cement and to do other general work. Kannadasan said that he was paid by the appellant. Whenever the appellant paid him, he had to sign a receipt. These are the payment vouchers produced in court. The appellant called him Muthu. This was because he told the appellant that his name was Muthu. He had never shown anyone his passport before.
Kannadasan told the court that throughout the period from the end of 1993 till 22 June 1994 he stayed at the worksite. The appellant permitted and told him to stay there. Originally he stayed in a container at the worksite. Subsequently the appellant told them to destroy the container. They then slept in the building. The appellant told him in English `You sleep there.` This was either in February or March.
Kannadasan said that the name on P11 was not his, but the photograph was. He had previously bought P11 for $10 from an Indian national at Tekka. He obtained it before working at Toh Avenue. He had never shown anyone P11 except the appellant. The appellant saw P11 on an occasion when he was keeping his wages in his purse. He had taken the card out. The appellant saw P11 and asked for it. After viewing both sides of P11, the appellant returned it to him. The appellant did not say anything.
Kannadasan explained that he had first given his name as Selvanathan Thirunavukkarasu because he had been told by an Indian national named Rajah, that if he did that, he would get a lighter sentence. When the officers from the Immigration Department asked where his passport was, he led them to the place where he kept it.
Under cross-examination, Kannadasan told the court that before he went to the worksite at Toh Avenue, when he was working at various diverse places, his employers would pay him different wages. Sometimes he was paid $30 a day, and sometimes $20. He had previously worked for some 30 employers. He was always paid in cash and those employers did not ask him to sign any payment vouchers. These employers never asked for his work permit and he never showed them. If the employers asked him to work for four to five days, they would ask him to stay at the site.
Some of the employers knew that Kannadasan was an overstayer and an illegal worker. They would tell him that he had no work permit. They would say that there are many people from India at Tekka. Therefore, they would only pay him $20. If he asked for more, they said that they would get someone else. Nobody paid him more than $30 except the appellant. He denied that he asked to be paid $35 per day. He also denied that the appellant told him that out of the $35, $20 was for his wages, $14 was for the foreign worker levy and $1 was for his income tax. He denied that the appellant saw P11 on the day he was taken to Toh Avenue. He maintained that the appellant only saw P11 on that one occasion when he took it out. That was about two weeks after he started work.
Kannadasan told the court that the appellant did not ask to see his passport. He would have shown the appellant his passport if he had asked for it. If the appellant had then asked him to leave, he would do so. He told the appellant his name was S Muthu because the name on P11 was Sethu Sangilimuthu. He did not tell the appellant that his passport was with his agent and that his agent was in India. The appellant used to bring Kannadasan and the other workers food. Kannadasan agreed that it was a bonus or a gesture of the appellant`s appreciation for their work. The appellant would also buy them drinks every day. Kannadasan agreed that, when he was arrested, he was once placed in the same room as the appellant. The appellant had confronted him and said `Muthu, you have cheated me.` He did not say anything in reply. He did not know why the appellant had confronted him in that manner.
The investigating officer, Lim Peng Siah (Lim) testified that the contractor at the Toh Avenue worksite was Guan Seng Construction Pte Ltd (Guan Seng). The appellant was a director of Guan Seng. The appellant had told him that he was in charge of the operation of Guan Seng. The other director, his wife, only dealt with administrative matters.
Lim told the court that the appellant had told him that he did not know that Kannadasan had overstayed in Singapore. The appellant also told him that Kannadasan had showed him a green work permit and told the appellant that it was a valid work permit. The appellant said he believed Kannadasan. The appellant said that he had asked Kannadasan for his passport and Kannadasan had told him that it was with his agent. The appellant mentioned that he had asked Kannadasan on several occasions. Lim also gave evidence that Kannadasan had told him that he was paid $35 a day. Kannadasan had told him that he had shown the appellant his green card. However, Kannadasan had said then that he showed it to the appellant on the second day that he was employed.
 The defence case
The appellant gave evidence that he had never previously engaged illegal workers. He paid his Thai workers $16 per day, increasing to $17 per day in the second year they were employed. These were workers with valid work permits. His company kept proper documents and accounts.
On the day he went to Geylang, he had gone to see a friend. It was about 7am. It was his friend`s site. The appellant had some miscellaneous work to do in Geylang, so he dropped by the site and visited his friend. There, he met Kannadasan, who had just woken up. The appellant asked Kannadasan if he was interested in working for him. He also asked Kannadasan if he had a work permit. Kannadasan said `yes` and followed the appellant to his pick-up. The appellant asked for Kannadasan`s work permit and was shown P11. Kannadasan told him that his name was Muthu. The appellant saw that the particulars in P11 were printed by a computer. The validity was stated to be until 1995. He believed it was a valid work permit and did not suspect anything. The appellant asked for Kannadasan`s passport but was told that it was with Kannadasan`s agent and that he had gone to India.
The appellant asked Kannadasan how much he wanted for the day. Kannadasan replied that he wanted $35. The appellant asked why it was so expensive, and was told that Kannadasan needed to pay the levy. He had needed a worker for that day, so he offered Kannadasan the job.
The appellant testified that he paid his skilled Thai worker $19 a day. This was not inclusive of the foreign worker levy. The appellant had to pay this. The total wage cost for this worker was around $35 a day. The appellant said that he paid Kannadasan fortnightly. He would ask to see his passport on these occasions. Kannadasan would tell him that it was with his agent, who had gone to India. He believed Kannadasan because he kept his Thai workers` passports.
The appellant denied that he had a container at the worksite. He did not tell Kannadasan to stay at the construction site or give him shelter. Kannadasan did ask if he could stay at the construction site. The appellant told him there was no place for him.
On 22 June 1994, the appellant cooperated fully with the immigration department officers. He volunteered all the payment vouchers and documents relating to Kannadasan. Lim even remarked that the appellant was an honest employer as all the documents were proper and complete. When he was left in the room with Kannadasan, the appellant had confronted him. The appellant told Kannadasan that he had given him trouble. The appellant said `Muthu, you have cheated me.` Kannadasan bowed his head and kept repeating that he was sorry.
Under cross-examination, the appellant said that he had seen other work permits before. They were green. These belonged to his friends. He had not really seen the ones belonging to his workers as they were kept in a safe in the office. He merely glanced at those. P11 looked like the ones his friends had. The appellant believed Kannadasan because whenever the appellant asked him questions, he would answer without hesitation. He did not ask for the agent`s name. He asked to see the passport because he merely wanted to have a further look.
When asked if the appellant provided Kannadasan with shelter, he replied that it was a construction site. The workers slept everywhere. He did not buy them beds. The workers merely took a plank each and slept on it.
 The finding below
The district judge held that the appellant`s defence was contradictory. If the appellant was convinced that the work permit was genuine, there was no reason to insist on the passport. It was highly incredible that the appellant, an experienced businessman, would actually accept the reasons given by Kannadasan for not being able to produce the passport. The appellant himself said that Kannadasan was giving excuses. If the appellant recognized that these were in fact excuses, he should have been put on alert and realized that Kannadasan was trying to conceal the fact that he was an overstayer. The appellant made no effort to ascertain the particulars of the agent, his address or even his name during the approximately seven months Kannadasan was employed. The appellant must have realized that the agent could not have been in India for seven months.
The district judge held that even if he were to accept the appellant`s evidence, he could only conclude that the appellant did not really bother to have sight of Kannadasan`s passport or that he was indifferent as he knew that Kannadasan was in Singapore illegally. The appellant`s conduct was insufficient to rebut the presumption in s 57(8) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (the Act) and did not amount to screening of foreign workers. The appellant`s failure to enquire into the status of Kannadasan for seven months amounted to wilfully shutting his eyes to the immigration status of Kannadasan.
By virtue of s 57(9) of the Act, the appellant`s defence would not hold unless he could prove that he had exercised due diligence to ascertain that the work permit was valid. Section 57(10) states that an accused is deemed to have exercised due diligence only if he had personally checked the passport or travel documents of the employee. The appellant had not personally checked Kannadasan`s passport. He would therefore be deemed not to have exercised due diligence.
The district judge dismissed the defence`s argument that s 57(9) and s 57(10) only came into effect on 22 April 1994 on the ground that the offence was a continuing one as the appellant carried on the act of employment until 22 June 1994. In any event, even without s 57(9) and (10), the appellant had not discharged his obligation.
On the charge of harbouring, it was held in 
 Thyagarajan v PP 
, that giving permission to sleep in a particular place can constitute providing shelter. It was not strenuously resisted by the appellant that Kannadasan had slept at the worksite from February until his arrest upon being told to do so by the appellant. All the appellant said was that this was a construction site and the workers slept everywhere. The presumption under s 57(7) was therefore raised that the appellant knew that Kannadasan was a person who had contravened the Immigration Act. Based on the appellant`s testimony and s 57(9) and (10), he had not rebutted the presumption. The appellant was therefore found guilty.

By an amendment in 1993, which came into effect on 22 April 1994, sub-ss (9) and (10) were inserted into s 57. These state:

(a) the person harboured or employed by him had, at the material time, in force a pass or permit issued under this Act or the regulations; and 
(b) where such person is the holder of a visit pass, that person had, at the material time, in force a work permit issued under the Employment of Foreign Workers Act or had obtained the written consent of the Controller to work in Singapore.
 
 
 
 
 The first charge
 
Applying the relevant statutory provisions to this case, the first question for the court was whether the appellant had shut his eyes to the obvious. If he had, then the appeal must fail regardless of when the 1993 amendments to the Act came into force.
In my view, the evidence could not show that the appellant had shut his eyes to the obvious. The relevant evidence included the fact that the appellant had paid Kannadasan $35 a day. It was not really in dispute that this was what a worker with a valid work permit would be paid. An illegal worker would have been paid about $20 a day. Furthermore, it was not disputed that each payment of wages made to Kannadasan was documented by Guan Seng. Every time he was paid, Kannadasan was made to sign a payment voucher. This was inconsistent with the appellant having shut his eyes to the obvious. If the appellant had done so, he would not have paid Kannadasan $35 a day and would not have made him sign the payment vouchers. It was inconceivable that the appellant would take the risk of engaging an illegal worker and pay him the market rate for a legal one.
As for the fact that Kannadasan had persisted in giving the appellant excuses when he asked for his passport, at the highest, this can only show that the appellant had not exercised due diligence. First, there is no evidence that the appellant had in fact recognized at the material time that what Kannadasan had said were excuses. The suggestion that these were excuses was made by the prosecution. The appellant did not admit that he knew that they were excuses at the relevant time. At most, the appellant`s answers could only be taken to mean that, with the benefit of hindsight, he had since realized that they were excuses.
Also, the fact that the appellant asked for Kannadasan`s passport does not show that he suspected the work permit to be invalid or a forgery. If he had done so, it would have been more logical for him to have offered a much lower wage to Kannadasan. There was absolutely no evidence that Guan Seng could not secure any more work permits. It was just as consistent with the appellant`s evidence that he asked for Kannadasan`s passport as a matter of routine. That being so, it would not be surprising that he did not pursue the matter vigorously. The allegation that he asked to see Kannadasan`s passport every time Kannadasan was paid his wages was, of course, an exaggeration. This was consistent with a belief that the work permit was valid. With the greatest respect to the district judge, there was nothing inherently contradictory about the appellant`s defence.
The prosecution also sought to rely on the fact that it would be an offence to employ a foreigner who had a work permit issued to another employer. The prosecution`s argument was that this should have put the appellant on notice. Ignorance of the law is no defence, or so it is said. That may be so, but this maxim does not elevate facts which would have put an accused on notice if he had knowledge of the law to one which would have put him on notice regardless of whether he had the requisite knowledge of the law. If the appellant was truly unaware that something was in contravention of the law, then the fact remained that it did not put him on notice because he was unaware that the relevant circumstances should have put him on notice. Nevertheless, the fact that the appellant was in the business of a building contractor and had previously employed foreigners was a relevant fact. It is open to the court to draw the proper inference when a person claims that he is unaware of legal provisions that are relevant to his trade. On the other hand, it would be unreal to expect a layman to know every legal provision that is relevant to his trade. In this regard, other evidence before the court cannot be ignored. In this case, even though the appellant had employed foreign workers before, the appellant`s evidence that it was his wife who took care of the administrative matters was not disputed. That being the case, it was not improbable that he could be ignorant of the relevant laws.
Hence, I was of the view that there was insufficient evidence to justify the finding that the appellant had shut his eyes to the obvious. At the highest, the prosecution`s evidence could only show that the appellant had not exercised due diligence. This, of course, left the question of what standard of due diligence the appellant must discharge before he could establish this defence.
As s 57 sub-ss (9) and (10) only came into effect on 22 April 1994, art 11(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1992 Ed) was relevant. This states: 
 
(1) No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed.
 
 
 
It is not controversial that a provision taking away a defence, which s 57(9) undoubtedly is, is a substantive provision. Hence, any attempt to apply it retrospectively would be unconstitutional. It was observed in 
 Plewa v Chief Adjudication Officer 
 by Lord Woolf in the House of Lords at p 329: 
 
... I would have been inclined to attach more importance to the possible retrospective unfair effect of s 53 than the Court of Appeal did in 
 Tunnicliffe
 [
 Secretary of State for Social Security v Tunnicliffe
]. This is because it removed the defence of due care and diligence. If recipients would not have been under a liability in fact to make a repayment under the former machinery then from the practical point of view they were being placed under a liability which did not previously exist by the change in law.
 
 
 
This observation was applicable here. If the appellant could have relied on certain defences before the 1993 amendments, he would not have been under a liability under the law at that time. The 1993 amendments, in effect, took away parts of these defences and limited their scope. The effect would be to put the appellant under a more onerous duty. That being the case, the 1993 amendments could only apply to acts of employing or harbouring Kannadasan on or after 22 April 1994. For this reason, it was insufficient to just say that the offences were continuing ones. If the amendments were intended to apply to that part of the course of conduct occurring after the amendments came into effect, then at least the charges must be amended to reflect this.
It must then be answered what defences were available to an accused before 22 April 1994. The case of 
 Naranjan Singh s/o Ujagar Singh v PP 
 is highly relevant. There, I approved of a statement from the grounds of judgment from the magistrate`s court: 
 
`An example of rebutting the presumption of the mens rea could possibly be that the employee had represented to the employer that he had valid permits or had shown the employer permits which were subsequently discovered to be forged ... Furthermore, the accused was a person in the business of employing labourers which were foreigners ... Defence counsel`s submission that ... (as) the accused had not asked (Murugan) about his employment status nor checked (his) passport ..., it merely amounted to negligence ... which could not be mens rea ... could not (be accepted) ... I recall again the passage by Justice Chua at p 31 last paragraph of 
 PP v Vadivelu
:
 
 
 
""[The social policy of the Immigration Act offences] would not be achieved if mere negligence and recklessness on the part of the accused to enquire about the status of the illegal immigrant or overstayer, if he knows or has reasons to believe that the person is a foreigner, would be sufficient to rebut the presumption of knowledge.""`
 
 
 
I must agree with this articulation of both the magistrate and the learned judge. The social implications of unrestricted immigration, which the Immigration Act attempts to curb, are obvious. It was toward the controlling of such immigration, and toward the proper enforcement of the Act, that in practice the courts have treated s 57(1) as if it did impose a strict liability, and have placed a high obligation on the part of an employer of foreign workers to establish that they were not illegal immigrants or overstayers before employing them. To my mind this strict approach, certainly as regards s 57(1)(e), must be taken. To allow an employer to evade the section by doing what would, in effect, amount to wilfully shutting his eyes to [the] immigration or employment status of his foreign employee, would make proper control and enforcement impossible. It cannot be placing too onerous a duty upon employers in Singapore to require them to screen their foreign workers before employing them to ensure compliance with immigration policy and the law.
 
 
 
Thus, an accused under the provisions in force before 22 April 1994 would not be able to rebut the presumption by merely saying that he did not know of the employee`s employment and immigration status. Mere negligence or recklessness was not a sufficient defence. However, an employer was not negligent if he had inquired from his employee what his employment status was or had checked his employees` permits. He would be absolved even if the permits turned out later to have been forged.
In 
 Naranjan Singh 
, the defendant had neither inquired from his employee his employment status nor checked his passport. It was a case where the defendant did absolutely nothing to screen his employees. That being so, he was clearly negligent or reckless. It was in this context that I said that there was a duty on the part of employers to screen their foreign workers. If he had not done anything to screen the workers, then it would be no defence to say that he was ignorant of his workers` employment and immigration status.
Parliament, on the other hand, has decided to go one step further. It introduced s 57 sub-ss (9) and (10). The fact that Parliament inserted ss 57(9) and 57(10) shortly after 
 Naranjan Singh 
 was decided supported the proposition that it would have been sufficient to check the work permit of the employee before the amendment. Had it not been the case, then the 1993 amendments would appear to be superfluous. For these reasons, I was unable to accept the learned DPP`s submission that the standard of due diligence required of an employer before 22 April 1994 was the same as the standard required after that date.
Hence, prior to 22 April 1994, it would have been sufficient for a defendant to show that he had screened his workers by examining the work permits of the workers. There was then no requirement to examine the passport as well, unless he had reasons to suspect that the work permit was not genuine. It was probably the case that either method sufficed.
Applying the principles to the facts of this case, until 22 April 1994, the appellant had no duty to check Kannadasan`s passport. It was sufficient for him to have checked P11. Did he do so? The appellant`s evidence was that he checked P11 before agreeing to employ Kannadasan. Kannadasan`s evidence was that the appellant did so only about two weeks after he was employed. According to his testimony in court, this was purely due to chance. He had just happened to have taken P11 out of his purse and the appellant had just happened to see it. However, it was apparent from the evidence of the investigating officer that Kannadasan had told him that the appellant checked P11 the second day he was employed. This, in my view, was a material contradiction. This, together with the fact that the appellant was paying Kannadasan the wages for a legal worker meant that Kannadasan`s evidence on this was, at least, of doubtful credibility.
No doubt, Kannadasan had already been dealt with for overstaying. If one were only to look at the Immigration Act, then one could say that Kannadasan would have no motive for lying. However, if what the appellant said was true, then Kannadasan could be charged for cheating as well. There was thus manifest reason for Kannadasan to lie. Hence, 
 PP v Vadivelu 
 could easily be distinguished on this point.
I was therefore of the view that it would have been against the weight of the evidence to hold that the appellant did not ask to see P11. Looking at the whole of the evidence, including the fact that Kannadasan was paid the wages of a legal foreign worker as well as the fact that payments of his wages were carefully documented by the appellant`s company, the almost inescapable conclusion was that the appellant did check Kannadasan`s work permit and believed it to be genuine. In my view, that was a sufficient exercise of due diligence before the amendments came into effect on 22 April 1994.
From 22 April 1994 onwards, the question that remained was whether the amendments that were effected were intended to apply to employers who had employed foreign workers before 22 April 1994 and had continued to employ them on or after 22 April 1994. If the amendments were not meant to apply to employers in relation to these workers, then the appellant was entitled to be acquitted. This is because the old standard of due diligence was applicable to him, and he could discharge this by examining P11. If, however, the amendments were meant to apply to such a situation, then it would be apparent that the appellant had no defence to the charge, even if his evidence was accepted. This is because in relation to the employment of Kannadasan from 22 April 1994 to 22 June 1994, the appellant had not exercised due diligence. It was his own evidence that he did not check Kannadasan`s passport.
I was of the view that the legislature, in amending s 57 in the manner it did, intended that employers continuing to employ foreign workers from 22 April 1994 onwards should exercise a greater degree of diligence. It is the act of employing an illegal worker that Parliament intended to proscribe. Whether he was employed for the first time on 22 April 1994 or had continued in his employment on that day could not be relevant. The obligation was a continuing one. Parliament could not have intended that once an employer had checked his worker`s work permit and passport, the employer had no more duty to ensure compliance with the Act. The mischief the Act was directed at would not be addressed.
For this reason, the amendments were intended to apply to an employer who employs foreign workers on or after 22 April 1994, even if the worker was first employed before the amendments came into effect. This is not giving retrospective effect to the amendments, for, prior to 22 April 1994, the old standard of due diligence applied. The new standard only applied for the period of employment after 22 April 1994. Counsel`s argument in the district court, that Parliament cannot have intended that on 22 April 1994, all employers have to check their workers` passports was, in my view, ill-conceived. Clearly, Parliament did not intend this. What Parliament intended was that if the employer knew that his worker`s employment was to continue after the amendment came into effect, he would take steps to discharge the enhanced standard of due diligence. There was nothing to prevent the employer from discharging this enhanced duty by doing the necessary checks once he learnt that the amendments had been passed or when the commencement of the amending legislation was announced. Nobody asked him to wait until the very last day.
Based on the appellant`s own evidence, he had no defence to the first charge. This was because he did not check Kannadasan`s passport. I was unable to accept counsel`s submission that there could somehow be a defence even if the appellant did not check Kannadasan`s passport because he believed that the passport was not available. The short answer was that, in such a case, the employer should not employ that foreign worker until the passport is made available.
Nevertheless, for the reasons I have stated, the charge should be amended to state that the relevant period of employment was `between 22 April 1994 and 22 June 1994`. This would not cause any prejudice to the appellant. Hence, subject to the charge being thus amended, I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against conviction in respect of the first charge.
 The second charge
It was quite apparent that the prosecution was not seriously relying on the fact that the appellant had bought Kannadasan food and drinks as a basis for the second charge. In my view, this was quite correct. The prosecution was relying on s 57(7) of the Act. This only applies to one who `has given shelter` and not merely food. In any event, the food was provided by the appellant to all his workers as a bonus for working hard, and not as an act in the nature of harbouring.
The question then was whether there was sufficient evidence to show that the appellant had given shelter to Kannadasan. It was not disputed that Kannadasan slept in the uncompleted building. However, this was insufficient to constitute an act of harbouring. In 
 Darch v Weight 
, it was held that harbouring involves a positive act of providing shelter. In 
 Thyagarajan v PP 
, the prosecution`s evidence, on the basis of the overstayer`s testimony alone, was that the overstayer had slept in the defendant`s barber shop. The only other evidence was that this occurred on nights when the defendant had given him the keys to the shop. Chua J held that there was insufficient evidence to prove that the defendant there permitted the overstayer to stay overnight in his shop. The act of entrusting the keys to the overstayer on certain nights could be equally consistent with requiring him to lock up the shop. Therefore it could not be inferred that the defendant knew that the overstayer was sleeping in the shop on those nights. The defendant`s conviction was accordingly quashed.
In the present case, the only evidence the prosecution could adduce to show that the appellant had permitted Kannadasan to sleep in the uncompleted building was Kannadasan`s testimony. The same thing was true of the allegation that the appellant permitted Kannadasan to sleep in a container which was subsequently broken up (though I had difficulty imagining how a container can be broken up). The district judge`s finding on this charge was as follows: 
 
PW3 [Kannadasan] had testified that he slept at the site in question from February till the date of his arrest upon being told to do so by the accused. This fact was not strenuously resisted by the accused. All the accused said was that this was a construction site and the workers slept everywhere. He only added that he did not provide them with beds.
 
 
 
With the greatest respect, this was not a sufficient treatment of the evidence. The appellant, in his evidence-in-chief, had denied that he had told Kannadasan to sleep at the site. His evidence was that he told Kannadasan that there was no place for him. Furthermore, he denied that he had a container at the worksite for the purpose of accommodating his workers. No doubt, the appellant did not seriously challenge Kannadasan`s allegation during 
 cross-examination 
, but that was only because the prosecution did not adequately pursue this issue. The entire cross-examination on this element of the second charge could be found in the following extract of the notes of evidence: 
 
Q: I put it to you that you harboured Muthu at this worksite in Toh Avenue between February and June 1994 knowing that he is an overstayer?
A: Just now I have expressed my position. I did not know that he was an overstayer. It was because of this work permit. I believed this work permit. I was convinced by this work permit. 
Q: So you are saying that you did harbour him or provide him with shelter? 
A: The issue arises, this piece P11 affected me very much. Since this is so and I believed P11 is a real one. If I believed this is legal, proper I would not know that he has overstayed. If I knew, I would chase him away and would not have employed him. 
Q: So what you are saying is that you did provide shelter but you did not know he was an overstayer? 
A: That is the construction site. They all sleep everywhere. I did not buy them beds. They just took a plank and sleep. 
Q: You have heard Muthu`s evidence. He said that you told him to sleep at Toh Avenue and you told him to guard the things there. Is there any reason why he should say this? 
A: I have Thai workers there. My things are not looked after by anybody. I have not asked Muthu to do so. If he wants to distort this, what can I do ...
 
 
 
With the greatest respect, the prosecution might just as well have said to the appellant `I put it to you that you are guilty of the offence.` The question was so loaded with nuances that it alleged all the requisite elements of the offence! Just because the appellant knew that some of his workers were sleeping at the site, it did not follow that he knew that Kannadasan was sleeping at the site. Similarly, even if he had given consent to some of his workers sleeping at the site, it did not follow that he had permitted Kannadasan to sleep at the site. The prosecution should have proceeded to ask whether the appellant was aware that Kannadasan was sleeping at the site. If that had been done, then the appellant`s evidence would have been tested. There would then at least be some basis, apart from Kannadasan`s evidence, for the court to infer that the appellant consented to Kannadasan sleeping at the site. However, he did not do so.
That being the case, since the only evidence against the appellant on this charge was Kannadasan`s testimony, it was imperative for the district judge to make a finding that his testimony was compelling to the extent that a conviction might be based solely on it. The district judge did not make such a finding of fact. In fact, given the numerous contradictions, inconsistencies and improbabilities in Kannadasan`s testimony, it is doubtful if such a finding could properly be made.
As the burden of proof was on the prosecution to show beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had given Kannadasan shelter, there was insufficient evidence to justify the appellant being convicted on this charge. This is because there was insufficient evidence that the appellant knew that Kannadasan was sleeping in the uncompleted building. There was thus insufficient evidence to show that the appellant permitted Kannadasan to sleep there. That being so, there was insufficient evidence to show the positive act of providing shelter. Therefore, the presumption in s 57(7) did not arise.
Accordingly, I set aside the appellant`s conviction on the second charge.
I should say that had the act of providing shelter been proved, it would not be unconstitutional to invoke the presumption in s 57(7) in respect of the amendments, even though part of the period of 90 days fell before 22 April 1994. In 
 R v St Mary (Whitechapel) 
, a statute was passed prohibiting the removal of a widow from a parish within 12 months after the death of her husband. A pauper`s husband passed away and the parish obtained an order for her removal. Before she was actually removed, the statute came into effect. It was held that the pauper could not be removed till the 12-month period had passed. Lord Denman CJ held at p 127: 
 
It was said that the operation of the statute was confined to persons who had become widows after the Act was passed, and that the presumption against a retrospective statute being intended supported this construction: but we have before shewn that the statute is in its direct operation prospective, as it relates to future removals only, and that it is not properly called a retrospective statute because a part of the requisites for its action is drawn from time antecedent to its passing.
 
 
 
This is directly applicable to the 90-day period in s 57(7).
 The sentence
The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for eight months and seven months on the first and second charges respectively. The sentences were ordered to run concurrently. The district judge held that as the appellant had claimed trial, he did not deserve the statutory minimum term as there was no indication of remorse or regret. However, it was not a serious aggravating factor as he did not prolong his trial unnecessarily.
With respect, it appears to me that the district judge`s reasoning was not exactly on all fours with sentencing principles. An accused is entitled to claim trial. Although an accused who pleads guilty may usually expect a discount, it does not follow that the court can impose a heavier sentence merely because he had elected to contest the charges instead. The mere fact of claiming trial is not an aggravating circumstance. As the appellant had not unnecessarily prolonged his trial, there was no aggravating circumstance at all.
In respect of the first charge, Parliament had seen fit to impose a minimum sentence of six months` imprisonment. This is so even if an accused was a victim of deception, so long as he did not exercise the requisite amount of due diligence. In view of the fact that the period over which the appellant could be said to have employed Kannadasan illegally was from 22 April to 22 June 1994, as well as the fact the appellant was a first time offender and that there was no aggravating circumstance in this case, I was of the view the minimum sentence prescribed by the Act was appropriate.
As I have set aside the appellant`s conviction on the second charge of harbouring, the sentence on this must, for what it is worth, be set aside as well. In the event, I allowed the appellant`s appeal against sentence on the first charge and reduced the sentence to six months` imprisonment.

The appellants and one Tan Seng Kim (Tan) were jointly tried before the High Court on charges under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act). Tan was charged for attempting to export to Spain 226 rubber pellets containing not less than 871.77g of diamorphine and the appellants were both charged for abetting Tan in the commission of that offence. All of them were convicted. Only the appellants appealed against their convictions. We dismissed their appeals and now give our reasons.
 The prosecution case
On 15 April 1994 Tan was under surveillance by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB). They saw him leaving his home at Blk 201B, Tampines St 21 #04-1063 and walking to Blk 201E, Tampines St 23. A short while later the first appellant, Goh Joon Tong (Goh), was seen in his car driving up to Tan, who then got into the car. A few moments later, Tan came out of the car and was seen holding a white envelope and appearing to be counting the contents of the envelope. Goh returned in his car to the same place a few minutes later, picked up Tan and drove to a car park behind Blk 201E where the two of them appeared to have a conversation. Thereafter, Tan was seen leaving the car and carrying a pink plastic bag, and Goh drove off. Tan returned to his flat with the plastic bag.
On the following day, 16 April 1994, CNB officers again kept a surveillance on Tan`s flat. They saw him leaving the flat and carrying a suitcase and a briefcase. He took a taxi to Changi Airport Terminal 2 and all the way he was trailed by the CNB officers. At the airport Tan checked in for flight SQ 342 to Madrid. He checked in his suitcase and went about the airport. Eventually he made his way to the screening room of the departure gate for his flight. There he was stopped by ASP Lim Chei Yoo who took him to the search room in the screening room and asked him if he had anything to surrender. Tan took out a rubber pellet from his trouser pocket which he admitted to be heroin. He was placed under arrest and his briefcase was searched but nothing incriminating was found.
The CNB officers retrieved Tan`s luggage. As they were on their way to pick up the luggage Tan said in Hokkien `this time hang`. ASP Lim asked him if there was any drug in his luggage and he admitted that there was. After Tan had identified his suitcase and told the officers the combination to its lock, he was then taken together with the suitcase to the CNB office at the airport. In the office he told ASP Lim that there were 225 pellets packed in three fruit boxes in the suitcase and that he was paid $100 for each pellet.
The suitcase was opened and three `Dodol` boxes were found inside which contained a total of 225 pellets in rubber covering. These pellets together with the pellet surrendered by Tan formed the subject matter of the charge against him.
Goh was arrested at 1.50am on 17 April 1994 at Bedok Industrial Park E, as he was going to his car. After his arrest the car was searched, but nothing incriminating was found. At about 3.55pm, CNB officers went with him to the flat at Blk 710, Bedok Reservoir Rd, #09-3128 which he occupied. The flat was searched but no drugs were found. During the search the officers found and recovered a bunch of six keys which Goh said belonged to his old house but subsequently on 23 April 1994 admitted that the keys were to a house in Batam. The CNB officers also searched two other flats at Blk 230, Tampines St 24, namely, #06-132, where his mother was staying and #05-130, where his wife and children were staying, but again no drugs were found.
The second appellant (Ko) was arrested on 17 April 1994 at about 2.10am at his residence at Blk 119, Simei St 1, #08-518. The CNB officers found no drugs or drug paraphernalia there. They also searched his car but nothing incriminating was found.
 Examination of the recovered property
The 226 pellets recovered from Tan were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for examination and on analysis were found to contain a total of not less than 871.77g of diamorphine. The three `Dodol` boxes recovered from Tan`s suitcase bore inscriptions `75`, `75` and `M55` and `M60` respectively at the bottom. These inscriptions with the specimen handwriting in Ko`s pocket diary and other handwriting specimens taken from him were examined by a government document examiner, Mrs Ng Gek Kwee, and she found a high degree of similarity between the handwriting specimens and the inscriptions and opined that the evidence was consistent that the maker of the specimen handwritings wrote the inscriptions at the bottom of the `Dodol` boxes.
 Tan`s statements
Two statements were recorded from Tan: a short statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (the Code) and a long one under s 121 of the Code. A voir dire was conducted by the learned trial judge to determine the admissibility of these statements and he found that they had been made by Tan voluntarily. Accordingly, the statements were admitted in evidence.
Similarly, two statements each were recorded from Goh and Ko respectively under ss 122(6) and 121 of the Code. The learned trial judge also held separate voir dires to determine the admissibility of their statements respectively. He first held a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the statements recorded from Goh (Goh`s voir dire) but at the conclusion he deferred making a decision thereon and then proceeded to hold a voir dire to determine the admissibility of the statements recorded from Ko (Ko`s voir dire). At the conclusion of Ko`s voir dire he held that the statements recorded from Goh and those from Ko had been voluntarily made.
Tan`s s 121 statement implicated Goh. Briefly, in so far as material, Tan said that he was given `the heroin in the three packets of `Dodol` boxes` on 15 April 1994 at 12.35pm at the main road in front of the Afghanistan Restaurant, St 23, Tampines, and Goh asked him to deliver the heroin to his contacts in Barcelona, Spain, and for his services he would be paid $100 for each rubber pellet. He further said that two or three days prior to that date, he was asked by Goh to book an airline ticket to Barcelona via Madrid, and on 14 April 1994 Goh telephoned him and asked him to wait in front of the Afghanistan Restaurant. Accordingly, at the appointed time he went there and Goh came in his Mercedes Benz motor car and gave him the three `Dodol` boxes containing heroin in a light transparent plastic bag and one rubber pellet.
 Goh`s and Ko`s statements
The statement recorded from Goh under s 122(6) of the Code was as follows: 
 
I admit that I give him [Tan] the `
 lobang
` and he did everything himself. If anything happened he bears the responsibility. He was the one who want to do this thing. He was in trouble with financial difficulties. I helped him by bringing back money from people overseas.
 
 
 
A long statement was recorded from Goh under s 121 of the Code, and the material portions read as follows: 
 
... Jeffrey Tan paged me on my pager 7096643 asked me to arrange for him to deliver heroin to Barcelona. I checked with my contacts in Bangkok. The telephone number is 4817693 and the person is known to me as `Lau Eh`. A few days later I was contacted and told to go to Batam and collect the heroin. I went to Batam with a friend of mine known as Koland, whom I know for ten years through my brother. There at Batam, we were met by the Jakarta syndicate. I wish to state that Koland and myself have the key to heroin store at Batam. There, I and Koland told that three boxes of heroin pellets were needed by Jeffrey Tan. We told this to the Jakarta syndicate. The three boxes were packed by Koland and the Jakarta syndicate. After the packing we counted that there was 225 pellets of heroin. The 225 pellets were packed into three Jamilah Dodol boxes and Koland after counting the heroin pellets marked the boxes with the amount of heroin pellets it contained. ... The Jakarta syndicate then brought and handed the three boxes of heroin to me in Singapore on 15 April 1994 at about 12 noon at Tampines Junior College inside a plastic bag. I then contacted Jeffrey Tan at his house at Tampines and asked him to meet me at St 23, Tampines, in front of a coffee shop at about 12.30pm on the 15 April 1994. I drove my car and upon reaching the spot I saw Jeffrey awaiting for me. I handed him three boxes containing 225 pellets of heroin and one pellet of heroin for Jeffrey to deliver these heroin to the Barcelona syndicate. My commission was $10 per pellet of heroin. The commission for Koland was $10 per pellet of heroin. ...
 
 
 
In his statement recorded under s 122(6) of the Code, Ko said: 
 
I knew the heroin pellets were to be brought to Madrid by Jeffrey. Lau Goh was to bring the rubber pellets of heroin from Batam and hand it to Jeffrey. The date and the time that Jeffrey would leave Singapore was not known to me. The arrangements with Jeffrey was made by Lau Goh. Lau Goh was arrested by CNB. I was to assist Lau Goh to earn a commission. ...
 
 
 
Again, a long statement was recorded from Ko under s 121 of the Code, and the material portions stated as follows: 
 
4 The occasion that Lau Goh and me were involved in the delivery of heroin to Madrid, Spain was in mid-April 1994. About one week before the arrest of Jeffrey Tan by the CNB, I went with Lau Goh to Batam there again. Lau Goh and myself went to the rental house in Batam and took out the balance of heroin pellets that were left behind and packed them into the Dodol boxes and sealed them. The marking behind the boxes were written by me when I first received the heroin pellets from `Botak` on the first occasion. `Botak` handed to me and Goh the heroin pellets in the Dodol boxes, and when we went back to the rental house we counted the contents and marked behind each box the amount it contained.
... I went to Batam on 9 April 1994 at about 2pm with Lau Goh and his family. After we arrived at Batam, Lau Goh`s family and me stayed at the Holiday Hotel. I and Lau Goh then went to the rented house and packed three Dodol boxes with about 210 heroin pellets and sealed with transparent plastic and the heroin pellets were kept in the hotel room of Lau Goh. The three Dodol boxes were then put into a transparent plastic bag so that when clearing customs the Singapore customs officer or enforcement officer would take it as real Dodol packages and would not enquire. The figures written by me behind the boxes were to confirm the exact amount delivered by `Botak` in Batam. 
5 The three boxes of Dodol containing the heroin pellets were brought into Singapore by Lau Goh, I accompanied him with his family to Singapore on 10 April 1994.
 
 
 
Two CNB officers also went to Batam to carry out the investigation. Together with two officers of the Batam police, they raided a house at No 11 Blk 2, Taman Nagoya Indah which they located with the help of a sketch drawn by Ko. They gained entry into the house with the keys seized from Goh, and they also found that the two keys seized from Ko also opened the padlock of the front gate and the master bedroom door of the house. They conducted a search of the house, and from the sealed ventilation grille above the door of the front bedroom they recovered four plastic bags containing pellets. All the four officers said that there were 253 pellets, although the photographs of the pellets taken during the raid showed that there were 263 of them. The pellets were similar in appearance to those recovered from Tan`s suitcase. Three empty `Dodol` boxes of a size similar to the three Tan had in his suitcase and plastic wrappers, clinical gloves and other packing paraphernalia were also recovered. However, none of the items found in the Batam house were produced in evidence.
In the course of the trial, Tan indicated that he wished to plead guilty but his plea was not accepted and the trial proceeded. When called upon to make his defence, he elected to remain silent and did not adduce any evidence in his defence.
 Goh`s defence
Goh gave evidence in his defence. His defence was one of denial. He stated that he had indeed gone to Batam for a holiday with his family and Ko. Previously, he had been given keys to a house in Batam by a person known to him and Ko. The keys were passed to him through Ko. That person had said that he and Ko could use the house as a holiday home. He had visited the house in 1993, but had not been back since. The offer to use it as a holiday home was not taken up as he felt that the house was rundown.
Goh said that he had known Tan for about five years. He knew that Tan was in financial difficulties, and he had been approached by Tan for help. He gave Tan some debt collection assignments abroad, which enabled Tan to earn some commission. Tan had informed him in 1994 that he was again in financial difficulties. Tan told him that he was going abroad, and asked for a loan, to which he agreed. On 15 April 1994, he met Tan at Tampines. They sat in the car and he gave Tan about $1,000, but Tan had requested for more. He agreed to the request, and accordingly left to obtain the money. He then returned to the meeting place, when Tan got into his car; another $500 was given. He also gave Tan some coconut biscuits he had in his car as a present. He did not know that Tan was attempting to export drugs on 16 April 1994 and he did not supply Tan with any drugs.
He reiterated that what he said in the s 121 statement was not true. What was said there was not what he had told the sergeant but what the sergeant himself had said.
 Ko`s defence
Ko also gave evidence in his defence. His defence related primarily to his trip to Batam. He admitted that he had been to the house in Batam on two prior occasions. That house was owned by a mutual friend of Goh and himself. The friend had asked him to deliver the keys to Goh, but he had inadvertently kept some keys. On one of the occasions when he went to the house, he had left behind some boxes of `Dodol`. He admitted that the figures on the three `Dodol` boxes recovered from Tan`s suitcase were in his handwriting but he could not remember why he wrote them or what they referred to. He said that the admission in his s 121 statement that the figures represented the number of pellets `Botak` delivered to him in Batam was not true. He also denied the reference in the statement that he assisted Goh to arrange for drug couriers, that he helped Goh to store heroin pellets in a house in Batam and that he helped to pack the pellets into the three `Dodol` boxes that Goh delivered to Tan. He did not know that there were pellets hidden in the Batam house.
He renounced his s 122(6) statement and s 121 statement as untrue, and said that he had signed them because of the threats and promises he received.
 Decision below
The learned trial judge found that the case against Tan was not disputed. In particular, Tan did not dispute that he had checked in for the flight to Madrid and that there were 225 heroin pellets in his suitcase and one on his person and admitted the offence in his s 121 statement. In the midst of the trial he had wanted to admit the charge.
As against Goh the learned trial judge found that there was evidence consisting of his s 121 statement, Ko`s statements and his possession of the keys to the Batam house. In his s 121 statement, Goh admitted his involvement in conspiring with Ko, Tan and others to abet Tan to export the diamorphine. Ko`s confessions in his ss 122(6) and 121 statements were admissible against Goh under s 30 of the Evidence Act. However, the learned trial judge held that Tan`s s 121 statement was not admissible against Goh as Tan and Goh were not facing the same charge. The learned trial judge did not accept Goh`s defence and found him an untruthful witness.
With regard to Ko, the learned trial judge found that Ko admitted his involvement in his ss 122(6) and 121 statements and that he also implicated Goh. Ko had admitted his inscriptions on the three `Dodol` boxes recovered from Tan. Here again the learned trial judge did not accept the defence of Ko and found that there was too much that was not explained. He did not believe Ko when he said that he made the statements because of some promise, threat and assault that he received.
He found that the prosecution had proved its case against all the three accused beyond any reasonable doubt and he convicted each of them on the charge they each faced.
 The appeal
As the main evidence against both Goh and Ko rested on the statements recorded from them respectively, their appeals were directed on the admissibility of the statements. Counsel for Goh complained of the way in which the learned trial judge determined the admissibility of Goh`s statements. What happened at the trial was this. As we have related, the learned trial judge held separate voir dires, namely, Goh`s voir dire and Ko`s voir dire to determine the admissibility of Goh`s statements and Ko`s statements respectively. At the end of Goh`s voir dire, the learned trial judge postponed making a decision on the admissibility of Goh`s statements until he had heard all the evidence adduced in Ko`s voir dire. In the latter voir dire Goh gave evidence for Ko. At the conclusion of Ko`s voir dire, the learned judge decided, inter alia, the admissibility of Goh`s statements and in arriving at this determination took into account his assessment of the credibility of Goh`s evidence given in Ko`s voir di re. Counsel submitted that what the learned trial judge did was wrong and was seriously prejudicial to Goh, and on that ground Goh`s statements ought not to have been admitted.
This submission raised two points for consideration. The first was whether the learned trial judge was right in postponing his determination of the admissibility of Goh`s statements until he had concluded the hearing of Ko`s voir dire. We think that generally it is desirable that a trial judge, having conducted a voir dire to determine the admissibility of a statement made by an accused, should at the conclusion of the voir dire make a ruling on the admissibility of that statement. That obviously is the most convenient stage to make the ruling. However, this is not an immutable rule. It is essentially a matter of procedure which is best left to the trial judge to decide. If a trial judge, in conducting more than one voir dire to determine the admissibility of statements of two or more accused, finds that it is more convenient to make the determination at the conclusion of all the voir dires, there could not be any objection to such a procedure. It is not vitally important at which stage he should make the determination. What is vitally important is that if the trial judge at the time when he makes the determination harbours any doubt whether the statement has been caused by any inducement, threat or promise, then he must exclude it, as in such a case the prosecution has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that the statement has been voluntarily made. Hence, we do not see anything seriously wrong in the learned trial judge postponing his decision on the admissibility of Goh`s statements until the conclusion of Ko`s voir dire, although, quite candidly, we cannot see any reason why he could not have done so, and indeed should not have done so, at the conclusion of Goh`s voir dire.
The second point is a more serious one and is really the core of counsel`s complaint, namely, that the learned trial judge in this case took into account his assessment of the credibility of Goh`s evidence given at Ko`s voir dire in arriving at his decision that Goh`s statements had been made voluntarily, in the sense that they had not been caused by any inducement, threat or promise: see s 122(5) of the Code. It was submitted that that evidence was inadmissible to determine the admissibility of Goh`s statements. The mainstay of counsel`s argument is this court`s decision in 
 Lim Seng Chuan v PP 
. There, the High Court convicted the accused relying, inter alia, on the evidence adduced in a voir dire held to determine the admissibility of the confession or statement made by the accused. On appeal, it was held that evidence admitted in the voir dire to determine the admissibility of the accused`s statement or confession cannot be relied upon as substantive evidence in the main trial. Wee Chong Jin CJ said, at pp 172-173: 
 
Where evidence is led before a court for it to decide whether or not a cautioned statement or a confession should be admitted as evidence against an accused person, the proceedings during which such evidence is led and heard by the court has invariably been termed `a trial within a trial` by our courts. Furthermore, it has always been the invariable practice during a trial within a trial to lead only such evidence as is material to the issue of admissibility.
 
 
 
Later, the learned Chief Justice said, at p 174: 
 
... It seems to us that fairness to the accused, which is a fundamental principle of the administration of criminal justice, requires that a trial within a trial ought to be considered a separate or collateral proceeding. In the course of a trial within a trial evidence may be given which would be inadmissible evidence on the charge against the accused but may be relevant on the issue to be decided at the trial within a trial.
 
 
 
In the instant case, the learned trial judge had considered this decision, but he distinguished it from the issue before him. He said: 
 
It is important to note that in 
 Lim Seng Chuan
 the issue considered was the use of evidence given in a voir dire as substantive evidence, not the reliance in a voir dire on evidence extrinsic to that voir dire to determine the admissibility of a statement.
 
 
 
The learned trial judge then referred, inter alia, to the Irish case of 
 R v Murphy 
, the English case of 
 R v Watson 
 and also the Malaysian case of 
 PP v Mustaffa bin Ahmad 
 as authorities to the effect that a confession of an accused which has been admitted on the ground that it has been made voluntarily would still be excluded by the court, if evidence subsequently emerged casts some doubt as to the voluntariness in the making of such a confession. The learned trial judge then said: 
 
On the basis of these authorities, a court is not obliged to close its eyes on evidence relating to the voluntariness of a statement even after it has been admitted. In the present case, if there was evidence that the recording officer had assaulted Ko, that should be taken into account in deciding whether he is to be believed when he denied assaulting Goh. If such evidence is relevant after the statement is admitted in evidence, a fortiori it is relevant before any finding is made.
 
 
 
The learned trial judge was eminently correct on what he said at this point. However, he went further and said: 
 
The next question is whether such evidence should be restricted to evidence supporting inadmissibility, and not evidence to the contrary. That should not be so. Justice must be administered equally for the defence as for the prosecution; it is not good enough to doff one blinker and wear the other. All evidence relevant to the issue, whether in favour of admission or exclusion, should be considered. This does not conflict with the ruling in 
 Lim Seng Chuan
 because the evidence is only used to determine the admissibility of the statements and not as substantive evidence.
 
 
 
It is this part of the judgment that has given us some concern. We do not disagree with what was said in 
 R v Murphy 
 and 
 R v Watson 
. Where a statement (including a confession) of an accused has been admitted in evidence on the ground that it has been made voluntarily (in the sense we have previously stated) and subsequent evidence adduced raises some doubt as to the voluntariness in the making of such statement, clearly the trial judge in such an event, notwithstanding that such statement has been admitted in evidence, would be entitled to attach little or no weight to the statement and accordingly would not treat it as part of the substantive evidence in the main trial. It may be thought this is overly in favour of the accused as the learned trial judge seemed to have thought. That may be so. But the rationale or the purpose for such an approach is to guard against any impropriety of the investigating authorities in obtaining a statement from the accused. In this connection, s 24 of the Evidence Act and s 122(5) of the Code make specific provisions for exclusion of a confession or statement of the accused on the ground that it has been caused by inducement, threat or promise. It does not follow, however, from this approach that evidence in one voir dire and the assessment of the credibility of witnesses in that voir dire is admissible in evidence in another voir dire, whether held earlier or later, to determine the admissibility of a statement which was in issue in that other voir dire. We agree that 
 Lim Seng Chuan 
 was concerned with evidence in a voir dire being used in the main trial, but in our view the same consideration applies to evidence obtained in one voir dire being used in another voir dire. As was held in 
 Lim Seng Chuan 
, a voir dire is to be insulated from the main trial, and equally in our opinion it should be insulated from another voir dire.
Turning to the case at hand, the evidence of what Goh said in Ko`s voir dire and his credibility in giving that evidence, in our opinion, ought not to have been taken into account by the learned trial judge in determining whether Goh`s own statements were admissible in evidence. To that extent, the learned trial judge, with respect, erred.
However, this error had not operated to the prejudice of Goh. The use of the evidence given at Ko`s voir dire was only an alternative basis for the finding that Goh`s statements had been made voluntarily. The learned trial judge held that, even wholly on the basis of the evidence adduced at Goh`s voir dire, he was satisfied that the statements had been made voluntarily. The learned trial judge on the evidence before him was justified in coming to this conclusion. He had adequately satisfied himself that Goh`s statements had been made voluntarily, and, in our opinion, no prejudice had been occasioned to Goh.
Assuming that Goh`s statements ought to have been excluded as contended by his counsel, there was still overwhelming evidence against Goh which supported his conviction. First, there were the ss 122(6) and 121 statements of Ko which implicated Goh in clear terms. Secondly, there was the circumstantial evidence of (i) the CNB officers who saw the meetings he had with Tan in his car and the pink plastic bag taken by Tan on coming out of his car on 15 April 1994, and (ii) the keys to the house in Batam which were found in Goh`s possession. Lastly, even more cogent is the s 121 statement of Tan, which also implicated him.
The learned trial judge, however, did not take into account Tan`s s 121 statement. He held that Tan and Goh were not tried for the same offence, even though Goh was tried for abetting Tan in committing the offence, and that s 30 of the Evidence Act had no application. He said: 
 
The prosecutor submitted that under s 30 Tan`s confession was also admissible against Goh, although they were not facing the same charge. He relied on the explanation to the section that:
 
 
 
`""Offence"" as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.`
 
 
 
I was unable to agree with that. The explanation extends the definition of an offence to cover acts of abetment of and attempts to commit the offence, but it does not remove the requirement that the persons must be jointly tried for the 
 same offence
. Goh and Ko were within the section because they were jointly tried for the same offence of abetting the attempt to export the diamorphine. Tan and Goh were not tried for the same offence.
 
 
 
The learned trial judge drew support for his conclusion from the Malaysian case, 
 PP v Lai Pong Yuen & Ors 
, where the equivalent of s 30 of our Evidence Act was unsuccessfully invoked by the prosecution. Ismail Khan J said, at p 14: 
 
... An essential requirement for the application of s 30 is the joint trial of the respondents for the same offence. The expression `same offence` means identical offence. (See 
 Sarkar on Evidence
 (10th Ed), p 299). All the three respondents were charged for offences under s 9(ii) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. The offences alleged against the first and second respondents were on different dates. The cautioned statement implicates only the second respondent. Moreover, there were charges in the alternative under ss 161 and 165 of the Penal Code against the first two respondents. There was therefore no joint trial for the same offence, for the purpose of s 30 of the Evidence Ordinance.
 
 
 
It is quite evident even from this passage of the judgment that the case there was entirely different. The offences the three accused were charged with were separate, although they were offences under the same section, namely, s 9(ii) of the Malaysian Prevention of Corruption Act. Each of the accused committed the offence, with which he was charged, on a different date. As Ismail Khan J pointed out, all the three accused were not charged with the same offence; they were charged with different offences.
The learned trial judge relied on a couple of Indian cases and in particular 
 R v AmritÃ¡ GovindÃ¡ 
 where West J said that a person charged with murder and another charged with abetting the murder could not be considered to be tried for the same offence for the purposes of s 30 of the Indian Evidence Act. Those cases were decided prior to 1891 when s 30 of the Indian Evidence Act did not have the `explanation` to that section. The explanation to s 30 of the Indian Evidence Act was introduced by an amending Act No III of 1891, and the explanation was, and is, as follows: 
 
Explanation - `Offence` as used in this section includes the abetment of or attempt to commit the offence.
 
 
 
As is stated in Woodroffe and Amir Ali`s 
 Law of Evidence 
 (15th Ed) at p 1005: 
 
... Prior to the insertion of the explanation to this section, the commission of an offence and the commission of its abetment were held to be different offences. Thus, it had been held that, upon the trial of A for murder, and of B for abetment thereof, a confession by A implicating B could not be taken into consideration against B under this section. Act III of 1891 has, however, by the insertion of the explanation to this section, altered the law in this respect. But this explanation applies only to cases where one person is charged with an offence, and another is actually charged with and tried for, abetment of it, or attempt to commit it.
 
 
 
The explanation is, and has always been, part of our Evidence Act.
There was one further case referred to by the learned trial judge and that was 
 Kudan s/o Tillumal v Emperor 
. In that case, two accused were jointly tried on separate charges under the Indian Penal Code: one under ss 457/380 (ie house-trespass/housebreaking and theft in a building) and the other under s 411 (ie dishonestly receiving stolen property). It was held that s 30 of the Evidence Act could not apply to the confession of one implicating the other, as the offences they faced were not the same offence. That case again was different from the instant case.
With the deepest respect, what the learned trial judge had decided ignored the actual facts in 
 Chin Seow Noi & Ors v PP 
, the decision which first gave an extended construction to s 30 of the Evidence Act. In that case, the first accused was charged under s 109 read with s 302 of the Penal Code with abetting the murder of the deceased by conspiring with the second and third accused to commit the murder. The second and third accused were charged with the murder of the deceased under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code . This court held that on the basis of the first accused`s confession and the evidence emanating from the second accused`s confession, there was sufficient evidence against her, the first accused. Similarly, the court also held that on the basis of the second accused`s confession and the evidence emanating from the first accused`s confession there was sufficient evidence against the second accused. There can be no distinguishing principle between that situation and one, such as the present case, where the confession came from an accused charged with a particular offence and was sought to be used against a co-accused charged with abetment of that offence. In our opinion, the explanation to s 30 extends its operation to the confession of a co-accused charged with the particular offence where the other co-accused is charged with abetment of or attempt to commit that offence, or vice versa.
 Ko`s appeal
Ko also appealed on the basis that the statements made by him had not been voluntarily made and his defence should not have been rejected. He maintained that he was threatened and assaulted during the interrogations by a team of officers. These allegations of threats and assaults made by Ko were examined and were rejected by the learned trial judge. The learned trial judge did not believe his evidence of threat and assault and on the evidence he was justified in holding that the statements had been made voluntarily by Ko.
Turning to the defence proper, there was ample evidence to support Ko`s conviction. First, there were his own ss 121 and 122(6) statements. Secondly, there was Goh`s s 121 statement. All this evidence established his involvement in abetting Tan in the latter`s attempt to export the drugs. His evidence in defence was not accepted by the learned trial judge and, in our view, rightly. The learned trial judge said: 
 
In his defence he admitted that he had made the inscriptions on the three dodol boxes and had brought them to the Batam house but he claimed that he cannot remember why he made them, or what they signified. He admitted that he handed the keys to the Batam house to Goh, but against the unchallenged evidence of Goh, he claimed that he did not know what they were for, and that he was not aware he was in possession of two keys to the house recovered from his flat were for the house. His defence was unsatisfactory - there was too much that was not explained, eg his handwriting on the boxes and his possession of the keys. I did not believe him when he said that he made his cautioned and investigation statements because of the promise, threat and assault that he received and I was satisfied that his investigation statement was his own account of his involvement in the attempt to smuggle the heroin pellets to Spain.
 
 
 
There was, therefore, ample evidence against both the appellants. They had abetted Tan by conspiracy to export a large quantity of heroin to Spain, in consequence of which Tan attempted to do so but was arrested at the airport. Both the appeals were without merit and were dismissed.

This is an appeal against conviction and sentence of the four appellants, who were charged with the commission of gang robbery with murder in contravention of s 396 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), in the following terms: 
 
[that they] on or about 17 September 1993 at about 5am at the Lee Kim Tah & Woh Hup construction site at Tampines Ave 1, Singapore (the Tampines site) did, together with three unknown persons, conjointly commit gang robbery of worksite equipment and that in the commission of such gang robbery, the murders of one Vallaisamy Aryian and one Arumunga Chokalingam, were committed by one or more of their members and they have hereby committed an offence punishable under s 396 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
We heard their appeals on 10 July 1995 when we dismissed their appeals and confirmed the sentence of death passed on each of them. We now give our reasons.
 The prosecution`s case
On 17 September 1993, some persons were seen running away from the Tampines site, carrying items. The deceased were found on the ground floor of the two-storey site office at the construction site, with fatal injuries. A third person was also attacked and injured. Some surveying equipment and walkie talkies were stolen.
At trial, the only evidence adduced by the prosecution were the statements of the first, second and fourth appellants. Their cautioned statements were made in response to initial charges of offences under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code. The injured victim had returned to his home country, and did not participate in the trial. A pick-up truck believed to have been used in the robbery was recovered but it did not provide much evidence.
All the statements were objected to on the ground of their involuntariness and all the statements were admitted in evidence following voir dires.
 The first appellant
The first statement made by the first appellant was recorded in the premises of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC). It was read back to and signed by him. The second statement was recorded during a visit to the Tampines site. This statement was neither read back to nor signed by the first appellant, but this does not affect its admissibility (
 Vasavaan Sathiadew v PP 
).
These statements disclosed that the first appellant together with six others, including the other three appellants, had taken two taxis from Tanjong Rhu to the Tampines site. They had hidden themselves in some bushes and had entered by the perimeter fencing. The first appellant was armed with a hammer, while the rest were armed with various items, including hammers, wooden poles, and a screwdriver. The first appellant together with the fourth appellant and another had attacked the two deceased. He had also heard a commotion elsewhere in the site office but did not know anything about it. The gang then had stolen some equipment and escaped in a van stolen by the fourth appellant and driven by the third appellant.
The first appellant challenged the admissibility of these statements on the ground that they were involuntary, as he had been assaulted and threatened by the officers conducting the interrogation. The first appellant alleged that he had been assaulted before the statement under s 121 was recorded. That assault was said to have caused him to agree to whatever was wanted of him. It was also said that he had actually refused to sign the s 121 statement because he could not understand the police interpreter and the statement had not been read back to him. He was then supposedly assaulted by the police officers until he agreed to sign. He also alleged that he was told to say that the second and third appellants had committed the murder and that it was not done by him alone. He was further supposedly warned by another officer not to complain to a freelance interpreter of his treatment. He emphatically stated that a particular officer had followed him to the hospital for the medical check up. Finally, he claimed that on being taken to the Tampines site, he was told by one of the officers to keep to what had been said by him in the earlier statement, or he would be subject to heavier assault.
The learned trial judge held that there was no basis for the allegations made by the first appellant. In particular, no injuries were found on him during the medical examinations. There were also a number of contradictions in his evidence. He had testified that one of the officers followed him to the hospital but this was contradicted by the station diary. There was also some contradiction between what was put to the prosecution witnesses and what the first appellant had testified.
 The second appellant
The prosecution sought to adduce three statements made by the second appellant. These were a statement recorded in the CID premises under s 121(1), a cautioned statement recorded under s 122(6) and a site visit statement made under s 121(1) which was neither read back nor signed by the second appellant.
These statements disclosed that the second appellant had gone to the Tampines site with five others in two taxis from Tanjong Rhu. A pick-up was stolen near the Tampines site. The second appellant was armed with a pole picked up from the site, the first appellant had a hammer, the third appellant had a screwdriver, while the fourth appellant was also armed with a pole. The second appellant had acted as a look-out while some of the others, including the third and fourth appellants, had gone in. The second appellant was unsure of what was going on inside the site office, but had seen the first appellant chasing and assaulting a guard. The gang had subsequently stolen some goods and escaped in the pick-up. The third and fourth appellants sold the equipment.
The second appellant challenged the admissibility of the statements which he had made on the grounds that he was assaulted. The second appellant had been arrested in February. He alleged that he was assaulted on various dates in February and March 1994. On 27 May, he claimed to have been assaulted until he agreed to admit to the murders and repeat a narration taught to him, and was threatened with further assault if he did not agree. He claimed that on being taken to the recording of the s 121 statement, two sheets of paper were handed to the police interpreter. The second appellant alleged that he was hit whenever he forgot to say what he had been taught to say. The second appellant also alleged that he was threatened, during the trip to the hospital for a medical check-up with further assault before the recording of the cautioned statement. Further threats were made not to recant or complain to the freelance Thai interpreter who would be translating for him. He claimed that on 7 June before a visit to the place of the murders he was further threatened with assault if he did not cooperate. He was in fear during the interview at the site.
The learned trial judge found the evidence of one of the officers who the second appellant alleged had assaulted him on a particular day in February 1994 to be unsatisfactory because of glaring inconsistencies. The learned judge, however, accepted that some inconsistency in the statement of another police officer was satisfactorily explained as a genuine mistake. Despite the inconsistencies in the testimony of the officers, the learned judge found that the station diaries contradicted the testimony of the second appellant. He found that a number of the assaults could not have occurred because the station diaries either did not record that the second appellant had been taken out from the lockup for interrogation on those days, or that there was insufficient time for the assaults to have occurred. Though not all the assaults were thus ruled out, the learned judge felt that the credibility of the second appellant was severely affected. The evidence contained in the station diaries was not challenged. The learned judge also found that there was no evidence that the second appellant had complained of any pain. Furthermore, no injuries were found during the medical examinations before and after the recording of the cautioned statement.
 The third appellant
No statements from the third appellant were adduced in evidence. However, the third appellant had submitted that there was no case to answer as he claimed that he was not sufficiently identified by the other appellants in their statements. The learned trial judge had acquitted him but an appeal by the Public Prosecutor was allowed and his case was remitted to the trial judge for his defence to be called (
 PP v Manit Wangjaisuk 
).
 The fourth appellant
The fourth appellant made two statements under s 121(1) and one under s 122(6). These statements showed that the fourth appellant had gone with six others in two taxis to Pasir Ris where a pick-up was stolen. Using that pick-up, they had arrived at the Tampines site and had gone in through an entrance in the fence. The fourth appellant had acted as a look-out while some of the others, who were armed, had gone into the office. The third appellant had ordered the first appellant and another to attack the two deceased. Another guard, who had been awakened by the noise, had his escape blocked by two others in the gang, including the second appellant. He had subsequently seen the first appellant attacking this other guard. The fourth appellant had then assisted to carry away the equipment. The gang had gone to Punggol to hide the items, and subsequently abandoned the pick-up at Chander Road. The fourth appellant also disclosed that he had tried to break in earlier with a few of the others.
The fourth appellant challenged the voluntariness of his statements by alleging that he was assaulted. He claimed to have been taught to narrate a version of events and that the narration had been recorded on paper by the interrogators. He was also supposedly threatened and told to answer positively to any questions asked during the site visit. Further threats were said to have been made before the recording of another statement after his return from the site visit. He was also asked to sign a narration which had been prepared by one of the officers before being taken to the police officer who recorded statements. He also insisted that a particular officer, Cpl Yap, was present during a July interrogation.
The learned trial judge found that one of the officers alleged to have been involved in the interrogation was away during that time. Some of the fourth appellant`s evidence was contradicted by the entries in the station diary. Furthermore, that during the medical examination, no injuries were found on him contradicted his allegations of assault; neither was any reported by the fourth appellant except for a chest pain which he had had for four months previously.
 The decision below
 
 
 
 Admissibility
 
The learned trial judge admitted all the statements of the appellants. He found that the statements were made voluntarily.
 The defence
 
 
 
 The first appellant
 
The first appellant elected to remain silent and called no witnesses. No adverse inference was apparently drawn against him.
 The second appellant
The second appellant`s defence was that he could not have committed the crime as on 17 September, he had been mostly asleep, having had a drinking binge on the night of 16 September. He denied meeting any of the co-accused and of committing the crime. He had in fact gone along with a plan to rob from the same site on the night of 15 September, but the plan had fallen through. He denied being at the Tampines site on the day in question, or of having met the co-accused, or of committing the offence. He maintained that the statements tendered were untrue.
The denial of the second appellant that he was at the Tampines site at the material times was an alibi, but no notice had been given to the prosecution when it was adduced as was required by s 155(1), read with sub-s (5) of the CPC. Leave, however, was given by the learned judge subject to the prosecution being given the right to cross-examine or call rebuttal evidence. No such evidence was called. This defence was not believed by the learned judge.
 The third appellant
The learned judge found that the third appellant was identified by the second appellant in his cross-examination by the prosecution. The learned judge disbelieved the evidence that the third appellant was not in Singapore at the time of the commission of the offences, in view of the absence of proper endorsements on his passport for all of the third appellant`s entry and exit into the various countries he had been in and out of. The learned judge also noted that although the third appellant had claimed that he could not remember where he was, he had later testified that he was in Malaysia during that period. The third appellant was also inconsistent in the reasons he gave for re-entering Singapore illegally. He had testified that he could not re-enter Singapore for three months after his last departure, but when it was pointed out to him that by September 1993 more than three months had passed, he testified instead that he thought that his passport was endorsed such that he would not be allowed re-entry. In view of these inconsistencies, the learned judge disbelieved his testimony.
 The fourth appellant
The fourth appellant`s case was that he had come to Singapore to work. While working in Singapore, he was earning $20 per day, while his board cost him $25 per day. He could not remember where he was on the night preceding and the day of the robbery, though he admitted that he was in the country at that time. He denied making the statements voluntarily and maintained that he was assaulted and threatened. He also said that he had been tutored to say that he left the stolen pick-up at Chander Road.
The learned judge disbelieved his testimony about his activities as it would not have been worth his while to work for such wages. The testimony that he was tutored about the pick-up was also found to be incredible, given that police did not know of the pick-up until after the statement was recorded. The learned judge held that the testimony of the fourth appellant was thus seriously undermined.
Accordingly, the learned trial judge convicted all four appellants as charged and sentenced each of them to death.
 The appeal
The following issues were raised on appeal: 
 
 
(i) the admissibility of the statements; 
 
(ii) the right of cross-examination by the accused of the prosecution`s witnesses during the voir dire of a co-accused; 
 
(iii) the use of the confession of the accused against a co-accused; 
 
(iv) what constitutes alibi evidence; 
 
(v) the elements of the offence; and 
 
(vi) sentencing under s 396.
  
 
 
 
 (i) Admissibility of the statements
 
The burden of proving the voluntariness of a statement lies on the prosecution, which must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt (
 Koh Aik Siew v PP 
). Counsel for the fourth appellant made much of the use of the word `appears` in the proviso to s 122(5) of the CPC. The proviso reads: 
 
[The] court shall refuse to admit such statement or allow it to be used as aforesaid if the making of the statement appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or promise having reference to the charge against such person, proceeding from a person in authority and sufficient, in the opinion of the court, to give such person grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceedings against him.
 
 
 
The fourth appellant`s argument is that the use of the phrase `if the making of the statement appears to the court` imposes a higher than normal burden on the prosecution, such that the slightest doubt is sufficient to exclude the statement. For this proposition a number of cases, including 
 PP v Law Say Seck 
, were cited.
 
, a judgment of Sharma J, will be examined first, for it is an often quoted case in arguments concerning the voluntariness of statements. In particular, there is his dicta at p 201F, left column, which bears quoting: 
 
I am not for a moment saying that they should not have been detained or the law does not allow their detention. What I am saying is that if the police wanted to rely upon their confessions, they should have taken every step to remove the lurking shadow of their influence and all the remnants of fear which the accused might still be having in their minds before an attempt was made to have their confessions recorded. Again, I am not saying that they should not have been kept in police custody or should not have been subjected to interrogation. It is the duty of the police to procure evidence, to find out the truth and to find out the culprits and to keep the society secure. My only concern at the moment in the determination of this issue is whether in those circumstance I should hold these two confessions as made voluntarily and without any traits of inducement, fear or threat.
 
 
 
The standard espoused by Sharma J, with all due respect to him, is an unattainable one. The police work in difficult circumstances. If they were required to remove all doubt of influence or fear, they would never be able to achieve anything. What, in our view, is required of a trial judge in a voir dire is to decide whether the evidence of the accused alleging, inducements, threats, promises or assaults, taken together with the prosecution`s evidence has raised a reasonable doubt in his mind that the accused was thus influenced into making the statement, in much the same way as a jury would if they were faced with a similar question.
The argument that the use of the word `appears` imports some other standard of proof than the normal one of the prosecution having to prove beyond a reasonable doubt is without foundation. It makes too much of the use of a single word. Whatever cases elsewhere may have decided, it is settled in Singapore that the burden of proof as stated in 
 Koh Aik Siew 
stands.
The cases cited, namely, 
 Pyare Lal Bhargav v State of Rajasthan 
, 
 PP v Law Say Seck 
, 
 Teh Lye Tong v PP 
, 
 Mohamed Yusof bin Haji Ahmad 
 
 v PP 
 and 
 PP v Teoh Teo Leng 
 stand for no more than the proposition that as the word `appears` is used in the proviso, it does not require the accused to prove involuntariness to the degree required by s 3(3) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) which states that: 
 
A fact is said to be `proved` when, after considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists.
 
 
 
In the context of criminal trials, this has usually been taken that the accused when required to prove anything has to do so on the balance of probabilities. But with regard to involuntariness of confessions that has not in any event been the law. The accused need only cause reasonable doubt in the prosecution`s case. The fourth appellant, it seems to us, goes too far when he submits that the slightest suspicion of an inducement, threat or promise or of an assault is sufficient to rule out a statement under s 122(5) of the CPC.
Submissions were made by all the appellants on the question of the admissibility in evidence of the statements made by them. We do not find it necessary to rehearse all the evidence. Suffice it to quote for the learned trial judge`s grounds of judgment as he referred to the material evidence in holding that the statements were voluntarily made. The same submissions made to the learned trial judge were made to us.
Regarding the statements made by the first appellant he said: 
 
At the end of the voir dire, I reviewed the evidence. The first accused and his counsel had set up all the allegations of assault and intimidation which the police officers denied. There were clear flaws in the first accused`s evidence -
 
 
 
(i) he alleged that he was assaulted on the feet with a cane and on both cheeks with a shoe on 27 May, but no injuries were found when he was brought for two medical examinations;
(ii) he alleged that Cpl Yap had escorted him for the medical examination and travelled in the same car with him, but this was contradicted by the entries in the detectives` station diary; and 
(iii) his counsel put to Cpl Yap that he had threatened the first accused at the hospital, but he said that Cpl Yap did not threaten him. He said that it was Cpl Choo who did that, but it was not put to Cpl Choo.
 
 
 
The medical records, the detectives` diary and his counsel`s questions seriously undermined the credibility of the first accused`s claims that he was assaulted and threatened before and while he made his statements. I found that the prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the first accused`s investigation statement, cautioned statement and oral statements were voluntary statements, and I admitted the statements in evidence.
 
 
 
The learned trial judge dealt in great detail with the allegations made by the second appellant on why his statements should not be admitted in evidence. The learned judge said: 
 
At the end of the second accused`s evidence the prosecutor applied to recall Insp Lim to give rebuttal evidence on the allegations of assault on 23 February. Defence counsel did not object to the application.
 
 
 
When Insp Lim continued with his evidence he said that the second accused`s arrest report was lodged on 23 February at 9am, when he was charged with ten other Thais on immigration charges. After they were charged, they were taken to the holding area in the lockup at 9.05am. This was recorded in the lockup station diary and the charge room station diary. It was also recorded in the lockup diary that he was taken out of the lockup at 4.30pm and was only brought back at 12.35am the next morning.
The makers of those entries in the charge room station diary and the lockup station diary, namely, Cpl Mohamed Rashid bin Abu Talib, Cpl Mohd Tariami Salim, Cpl Ng Chong Kim, S/Sgt Yee Sim Teng and Cpl Loh Ah Ng were then called to confirm the entries.
At the close of the voir dire, I reviewed the evidence. The second accused had alleged that he was assaulted and threatened on 23, 24 February, 2, 3, 8, 10 March, 27 May and 7 June by Insp Lim, Sgt Han, Cpls Choo and Yap and other unnamed persons. Every allegation was denied by the police officers he identified.
Of the prosecution witnesses, I found Cpl Yap unsatisfactory. He said he was not at the CID on 23 February, then admitted that he was there in the early hours of the morning and in the compound from the afternoon till the next morning. He recorded in his diary: `In CID started interrogation Thai accused with Sgt 7723, Cpl 204, 2359,` but he said he only saw others interviewing them, then he said he assisted in the interviews. He said that from 2pm he went with his sources to a lot of places he could not remember, then said that he was with them at one place, a drink stall, from 1.15pm till the following morning. His evidence and the manner in which he gave it raised serious doubts over his veracity. It was well that the lockup diary provided a reliable basis for testing the allegations of assault of 23 February.
Insp Lim also had to correct his evidence. He said that Sgt Han and Cpl Choo interviewed the second accused on 2 March, then he said that in fact Cpl Choo had only escorted the second accused and Sgt Han was not involved at all. He explained that he had made a mistake. Having observed how he skimmed through his diary when he gave his answers on the first occasion, and having observed his general performance in the witness stand, I accepted his explanation.
The second accused`s evidence did not accord with contemporaneous records produced. He said that on 23 February he was taken to a room on the third floor of the CID and that he was taken out of the room and assaulted twice in the afternoon, first by Cpl Yap and another person and then by Sgt Han, Cpl Choo and another person. He said that he was taken to the lockup after the assaults. The lockup diary showed that he was in the lockup that day from 9.05am to 4.30pm when he was taken out, and was brought back the next morning. He could not have been assaulted in the afternoon before he was taken to the lockup.
On the allegation of assault by Sgt Han, Cpl Choo and another person on 2 March, the lockup diary showed that he was taken out of the lockup between 12.56pm and 2.05pm that day. He was taken to Insp Lim`s room where a cautioned statement was recorded between 1.05pm and 1.55pm. As he was with Sgt Han and Cpl Choo for no more than ten minutes on each occasion when he was taken to Insp Lim`s room and back, they could not have assaulted him for about an hour as he alleged.
He also alleged that he was assaulted again on 3 March for less than an hour. The lockup diary showed that he was taken out between 4.17pm and 7.15pm. Insp Lim recorded his statement between 4.25pm and 7.10pm. He was therefore in the company of his alleged assailants for eight minutes or less at a time while in transit between the lockup and Insp Lim`s room.
Although he claimed that Cpl Choo slapped him and hit the back of his head on 27 May, the doctor who examined him after the alleged assaults did not find any evidence of injury on him.
I was mindful that not every one of the many allegations was contradicted by contemporaneous records. Nevertheless, when it was shown that four alleged instances of assault (two on 23 February and one each on 2 and 3 March) cannot have taken place as alleged and one (on 27 May) was not supported by the medical evidence available, the second accused`s credibility as a whole was undermined. Having observed him when he make and defend (sic) the allegations, I did not believe them. The second accused failed to raise any reasonable doubt that he was threatened or assaulted, and I admitted his investigation, cautioned and oral statements in evidence.
Before us the third appellant contended that the learned trial judge had erred in rejecting the first, second and fourth appellants` evidence that their statements had been taught to them by the police through the use of force and intimidation. A similar submission was made to the trial judge and of this submission he said: 
 
After reviewing all the evidence, I rejected the first, second and fourth accused`s claims that their statements were taught to them by the police and obtained from them by the use of force and intimidation and their claims that they were not even at the scene of the crime.
 
 
 
On the fourth appellant`s submission as to why his statement should not be adduced in evidence, the learned judge said: 
 
At that close of the voir dire, all the police witnesses denied assaulting the fourth accused. There was some undisputed corroborative evidence. Cpl Yap produced his passport to show that on 22 July, he was on leave and was in Thailand. The lockup diary showed that the fourth accused was placed in the lockup at 3.55am that day and remained there till 1.55pm. This contradicted his evidence that he was taken out for an interview before lunch that day.
 
 
 
The fourth accused`s evidence that Cpl Choo wrote on two sheets of paper before taking him to Insp Lim`s office was confusing as he said it happened on 1 August as well as 2 August. To compound that, his counsel did not put to Cpl Choo that he had written during any interview what the fourth accused was to say.
He was medically examined on 2 August before and after the cautioned statement was recorded. He told the doctor of a pain in his right chest he had for four or five months, and made no other complaints. The doctor did not find other injuries on him that support his claim that he was beaten on that day.
On the evidence some of the allegations are proved to be wrong, and allegations were made that were not put to the prosecution witnesses, the credibility of his evidence was undermined. Having observed him as he gave his evidence, I was not impressed by him. After reviewing his evidence and evidence of the prosecution witnesses, I was satisfied that he did not make his statements as a result of any assault or threat. I therefore admitted the statements in evidence.
We entirely agree with the foregoing evaluation of the evidence given at the respective voir dire made by the learned trial judge.
 (ii) Cross-examination during the voir dire
The first appellant has argued that his counsel should have been invited to cross-examine the prosecution witnesses testifying in the voir dire for the admission of statements made by the second and fourth appellants as the admission of their statements would adversely affect the case against him.
No authority was cited in support of this proposition. Counsel cited ss 180(e) and 188 of the CPC, as legislation supporting his contention. The statutory provisions cited are concerned with cross-examination of the witnesses during the trial proper, and afford no assistance on the question raised.
In 
 Jasbir Singh & Anor v PP 
, it was held that the appellant in that case had suffered no prejudice in being refused the opportunity to cross-examine his co-accused, during the latter`s voir dire as the latter`s statement was only admitted after the prosecution had proved the voluntariness of the statement beyond reasonable doubt. In our judgment, the same would apply to the prosecution witness as a voir dire in respect of the voluntariness of a co-accused`s statement is a separate and distinct trial concerning only that co-accused. Only after the statement is admitted and becomes evidence will it concern the other accused and they can test this evidence in the same way as any other evidence given at the trial. In fact the statement is read into the evidence only after the trial judge has admitted it.
This contention was no doubt put forward as a result of the decision in 
 Chin Seow Noi v PP 
, which allows the confession of a co-accused to be used as evidence against the accused. The argument then is that the accused has an interest in ensuring that the statements of his co-accused are voluntary. This argument was canvassed in 
 Jasbir Singh 
, and was rejected. The rationale of a voir dire in the trial of a single accused is to allow the voluntariness of the statements made by him to be challenged. In a trial by jury, a separate trial to determine the voluntariness was necessary to ensure that the determiners of fact, the jury, were not influenced by evidence contained in statements which were eventually rejected as being involuntary. The accused should also be able to adduce evidence concerning admissibility which may be prejudicial to his own case if adduced during the trial proper. It is well established that evidence given at a voir dire cannot be relied on at the trial proper. Judges are trained to set his mind against inadmissible or prejudicial evidence.
 (iii) The use of the statements of the co-accused
 
 
 
 Use of the statements
 
Section 30 of the Evidence Act states that: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other of such persons is proved, the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
 
 
 
In 
 Chin Seow Noi v PP 
, it was held that the section allows the confessions of the accused to be used against the co-accused as evidence. There is no necessity for there to be other evidence before such confessions may be considered.
The question then is, whether the statements made by the appellants amount to confessions. Section 17(2) of the Evidence Act reads: 
 
A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.
 
 
 
In 
 Anandagoda 
 
 v The Queen 
, it was held that whether a statement amounts to a confession depends on whether: 
 
to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made, it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to look at other facts which may not be known at the time ... .
 
 
 
Each of the statements admitted must thus be examined in the light of the elements of the offence, in this case s 396 of the Penal Code which reads: 
 
If any one of 5 or more persons who are conjointly committing gang robbery, commits murder in so committing gang-robbery, every one of those persons shall be punished with death or imprisonment for life, and if he is not sentenced to death, shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes.
 
 
 
It is clear that under s 376 the murder is incidental to the gang robbery. All the statements admitted in evidence admit that the appellants and some others, certainly five or more, went together to the Tampines site. There, they stole equipment and in the process two security guards were killed and a third was injured. This by definition constitutes gang robbery (see ss 390 and 391 of the Penal Code). Since two security guards were killed s 396 of the Penal Code comes into operation. Common intention is not an issue. The law on this subject is well settled, see 
 Ang Eng Beng v PP 
 and the cases referred to therein. Conjointly committing gang robbery is the issue. The statements admit all the elements of s 396 of the Penal Code and hence they are confessions within the meaning of s 17(2) of the Evidence Act. We have no doubt that following the decision of this court in 
 Chin Seow Noi v PP 
 the statements of one appellant are evidence against the other of the appellants as confessions.
 Treatment of the confessions
It was argued that the confessions, even if they may be used against the other co-accused, ought to be treated with caution as they had been retracted by each of the appellants. This was said to be an important distinction between the instant case and 
 Chin Seow Noi 
.
The rationale of
 Chin Seow Noi 
 is that such confessions are evidence and therefore sufficient to be the basis of a conviction even in the absence of other evidence. The retraction of a confession of an accused does not prevent the confession being used to convict the accused himself (
 Ismail bin UK Abdul Rahman v PP 
). Similarly with respect to the confession of the accused when it is used against the co-accused. Neither ought it to diminish the sufficiency of the confession of the co-accused. At the most, it would be a matter of the weight to be given to that confession in the light of the retraction. However, this would be a matter for the trial judge to decide. There is nothing to indicate in the present case that the retraction had so affected the confessions that the learned judge was not entitled to rely upon them.
The fact that second and fourth appellants in this case had not elected to remain silent, but had given evidence in defence has been said to have weakened the force of the confessions. Again, this is a matter of weight. There is nothing on the facts which would require the learned judge not to prefer the evidence contained in the confessions and accept rather the evidence of the appellants.
No doubt such confessions ought to be treated with great caution as there is every incentive for the appellants to have reduced the significance of their involvement and lied about the activities of the others. In 
 Chin Seow Noi 
 it was stated that the courts would take into careful consideration the incentive of the co-accused to lie. In this present case, the learned trial judge, who in fact had used the confession of the second appellant against the third appellant, stated that he had taken care to determine if the second appellant had lied or erred. He found no such indication. What is most pertinent is that he noted that the second appellant had not attempted to lessen his involvement in his statements. As the learned trial judge has indicated that he was aware of the danger of the co-accused lying and had examined the evidence carefully, we are satisfied that the learned judge had not erred in using the second appellant`s confession to convict the third appellant.
 The identification of the third appellant
The case against the third appellant is founded only on the statements made by the other appellants. It is the third appellant`s case that there was insufficient identification of him in any of those statements.
In 
 Manit Wangjaisuk 
, it was held that there was sufficient identification evidence that the third appellant was involved in the offence for which he was charged to establish a prima facie case which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction. A number of grounds for identification were noted, but the trial judge eventually relied solely on the identification made by the second appellant in his statements and his testimony in court.
Counsel for the third appellant argued that the third appellant had not been sufficiently identified as a person involved in the gang robbery. This is on the ground that the other accused only referred to some person named Manit, or nicknamed Nit, and that this is not sufficient to implicate the third appellant. In particular, counsel has argued that the trial judge erred by accepting that the evidence of the second appellant identified the third appellant as the `Nit` referred to in his statements. The answers given by the second appellant indicate that he knew who the third appellant was, though he may not have known both his names before his arrest. This ignorance of the proper name of the third appellant is not fatal to the identification of the third appellant.
It was in effect argued that the second appellant only knew vaguely who the third appellant was and that references to `Nit` were not directed to the third appellant, and could have been to anyone. On this reasoning, there is no linkage between the `Nit` mentioned in the statements and the third appellant. This argument is seemingly bolstered by the fact that the second appellant testified that he only knew of the names at the CID. However, against this, when it is considered that the second appellant answered that he was referring to the third appellant when he referred to `Manit` in his statements to Inspector Lim, it is apparent that he could not have just learnt the name of third appellant at the CID. This is inconsistent with that claim. Thus, it was a matter for the learned judge to decide which is to be believed, and which is an attempt at evasion. His decision in our view was correct.
Even if the evidence of the second accused was not sufficient to identify the third appellant, there remains other evidence which may do the same. The fourth appellant had made his statement in reference to the charge which had included the name of the third appellant. In referring to Manit, in that context it is clear the fourth appellant must have been referring to the third appellant. There remains some slight ambiguity because unknown persons were also named in the charge, but as pointed out by this court in 
 PP v Manit Wangjaisuk 
, the statements given had included other names so that it is highly unlikely that the `Manit` referred to could be in reference to the unknown persons. Further, the fourth appellant also identified the third appellant as the `Manit` whom he had met in Haadyai during the visit to the Tampines site and in his site investigation statement. He did this by pointing to the third appellant who was standing some distance away at the material time.
 Inconsistencies between the statements
There are a number of inconsistencies between the various statements such that it may be argued that it is unsafe to rely on the statements at all. These relate to the transport used to reach the site, the weapons of the various participants and the role played by each.
The discrepancies as to the mode of transport used to reach Tampines, and where the van or pick-up was stolen is not particularly material. The inconsistencies could be explained by the passage of time. There is also inconsistency in what each of the appellants thought the others in their group were carrying but this also is not crucial. The injuries suffered by the security guards were consistent with the weapons said to have been used. The discrepancies in the roles played by each and in the number of persons who are alleged to have committed the offence do not detract from the fact that they all disclose the commission of the offence. The learned judge held that the main elements of the offence had been established. All of these statements indicate that an offence under s 396 of the Penal Code had been committed in that all were agreed that they had gone to the site to steal, that some of them had attacked three workers in all, and that they had actually taken items away from the site. The differences between the various statements are not sufficient to indicate that any of them ought not to be believed.
 (iv) Alibi
The next issue to be considered is the evidence of the third appellant that he was not in Singapore during the material times. There was some question whether this amounted to evidence in support of an alibi, or that it was simply a denial. If it was the former, leave of the court would have been required under s 155(1) of the CPC as no notice had been given to the prosecution within the prescribed period. At trial, it was held that the third appellant was simply saying that he was not in Singapore. He did not know where he was so this was not evidence in support of an alibi and thus did not require notice to be given under s 155(1) of the CPC. If this were all, then on the plain words of s 155(9) which defines the phrase `evidence in support of an alibi`, this holding was correct. Section 155(9) reads: 
 
`[E]vidence in support of an alibi` means evidence tending to show that by reason of the presence of the accused at a particular place or in a particular area at a particular time he was not, or was unlikely to have been, at the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed at the time of its alleged commission ... .
 
 
 
If an accused does not remember that he was at a particular place or in a particular area at a particular time, then that evidence would not be evidence in support of an alibi. The learned judge agreed with that distinction as drawn in 
 Vasan Singh v PP 
. He found that the third appellant`s claim, relying on his passport, that he was not in Singapore was a denial only.
Unfortunately for the third appellant his passport did not provide him with the evidence that on the date of the crime he was at a particular place which was not Singapore. His passport proved to be a most unreliable record of his movements. The learned trial judge summed it all up, with which we agree entirely. He said: 
 
His (third appellant`s) defence was that he was not in Singapore on 17 September 1993. He relied on his passport to show that there was no record of his presence in Singapore. The evidential value of that was negated when he admitted that his passport did not record all his travels. It did not record his return to Thailand after his visit to Malaysia on 7 August 1993, and it did not record his entry in (sic) Singapore before his arrest on 23 May 1994 because he had entered illegally.
 
 
 
A question was raised over his credibility when he said in cross-examination that, in August-October 1993, he was in Kuala Lumpur staying at the rented premises of his friend Ah Bang. This was inconsistent with the earlier claim that he could not remember where he was. When a person asserts that he was in Kuala Lumpur sharing the rented premises of a friend, it cannot be said that he cannot remember where he was just because he did not know the address of the premises.
He also changed his reason again and again for not using his passport to enter Singapore in May 1994. First, he said he was told in June 1993 not to come for two or three months, then he said that he was afraid that he will not be allowed to enter because Thais with `W2` endorsed in their passports are not allowed to enter, then he said he was afraid that if he used his passport, the authorities will make the endorsement in his passport.
The learned judge said in his grounds of judgement that having regard to the seriousness of the charge he would have given leave for the evidence of an alibi to be given. If this was the evidence of the alibi then, clearly, on any standard of proof, it was not proved.
 (vi) Sentencing
Section 396 of the Penal Code stipulates two alternative penalties: death or life imprisonment with caning of twelve strokes minimum. It is the only provision in the Penal Code to allow an alternative to the death penalty. The learned judge has a discretion on which punishment to award. Some assistance may be derived from 
 Sia Ah Kew & Ors v PP 
 in determining how that discretion should be exercised. That was a case under s 3 of the Kidnapping Act (Cap 151) which provides that whoever, with intent to hold any person for ransom, abducts or wrongly restrains or wrongly confines that person should be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction 
 to be punished with death or imprisonment for life and shall, if he is not sentenced to death, also be liable to caning. 
 The Court of Criminal Appeal laid down this guideline. Wee Chong Jin CJ at p 126B (first column) said: 
 
It is a long and well-established principle of sentencing that the legislature in fixing the maximum penalty for a criminal case intends it only for the worst cases. ... In our opinion, the maximum sentence prescribed by the legislature would be appropriate where the manner of ... or the acts or conduct ... are such as to outrage the feelings of the community.
 
 
 
The learned judge, although he did not refer to 
 Sia Ah Kew & Ors v PP 
, nevertheless was guided by the correct sentencing principle where the legislature prescribes alternative punishments, one being severer than the other. He addressed himself thus: 
 
The accused had participated in an operation in which three helpless and innocent persons were mercilessly attacked, and two lost their lives. None of them showed any remorse for what he had done. Taking all the circumstances into account, I felt that the higher sentence was called for, and sentenced each of them to suffer death.
 
 
 
When the appellants went to the Tampines site to steal valuable equipment, like surveying equipment, as was in fact stolen, armed with lethal weapons they must have intended to cause grievous bodily harm and even death to anyone who stood in their way. This is what they in fact did. Their acts of violence were mercilessly executed and gravely abhorrent in their execution. In our view, these acts of violence were amply sufficient to `outrage the feeling of the community`. Further in our judgment there was no reason to discriminate between them as they were all in it together and it cannot be said with any certainty which of them inflicted the fatal blows and which of them took a passive role. The learned judge had not erred.
It was for these reasons that we upheld the convictions and confirmed the sentences of death passed on all the appellants.

The two appellants were jointly tried in the High Court on five separate charges of trafficking in a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). At the close of the prosecution case, the trial judge amended all the charges. The first appellant was charged with trafficking by offering to deliver 39.04g of diamorphine under the first amended charge, and by transporting 7.11g of diamorphine under the second amended charge. He was also charged with abetting the second appellant by instigating the latter to traffic in 19.92g of diamorphine. The second appellant was charged with trafficking by delivering 39.04g of diamorphine under the first amended charge; he was also charged with trafficking by delivering 19.92g of diamorphine, (the act which the first appellant had been charged with abetting). Both the appellants were convicted on all the amended charges and they appealed against their convictions. We dismissed the appeals and now give our reasons.
On 24 April 1991, a team of eight narcotics officers spotted the first appellant walking towards the junction of Geylang Road and Lorong 39, Geylang. They stopped him and arrested him. A search on his person was carried out and he was found to have in his right trouser pocket a plastic bag containing 11 sachets of granular substance, and a cigarette packet containing three sachets of granular substance. These 14 sachets were seized and later marked `A4`. In his left pocket was a bunch of nine keys on a red key chain. When questioned, the first appellant stated that he had come from No 10A, Lorong 37, where he was living. The narcotics officers then took the first appellant to No 10A, which was a two-storey boarding house. One of the keys taken from the first appellant fitted the door of Room 3, which was on the upper floor of the building. Nothing incriminating was found in the room.
While the narcotics officers were at No 10A, the second appellant arrived at the house carrying a black clutch bag; he was detained and searched. He produced an identity card in the name of Chong Kwong Cher which was found to have been tampered with; when questioned he revealed his true name. In the black clutch bag which he was carrying, the officers found a pink plastic bag containing a big packet of granular substance, and a Cartier spectacle case and a dark red jewellery pouch which altogether contained four mini-packets of granular substance, one small packet of granular substance wrapped in paper, and two straws. The big packet, the four mini packets and the small wrapped packet were seized and later marked `A1`. The narcotics officers also found some keys in a black key pouch.
After the second appellant`s arrest, the narcotics officers interviewed the owner of the boarding house, Ding Sing Kwok, who stated that the second appellant had rented a room at the rear, Room 11 (the rear room), on the ground floor of the boarding house under the name of Chong Kwong Cher.
The officers then took the second appellant to the rear room. Although the room door was locked, the officers were able to open it from the inside by reaching the key in the lock through the louvres of a window that was beside the door. In the room, there was a cupboard with a locked top drawer, which was forced open by the officers. Inside the drawer were a red paper bag with the words `Merry Christmas` printed on it and a black plastic bag. Inside the red paper bag was a plastic bag of white substance (later marked `A3). Inside the black plastic bag was a box with the letters `GEC` on the cover; inside the box were 20 sachets of white substance, two digital weighing scales, a pair of metal tongs, a plastic spoon and some empty plastic bags. The 20 sachets was later marked `A2`. An imprint of the first appellant`s left middle finger was lifted from the metal tongs. There were no clothes or personal belongings in the room, either belonging to the first or the second appellant.
At the rear room, the keys from the bunch taken from the second appellant were tested on the lock of the rear room door and the lock on the top drawer of the cupboard. Two of those keys fitted the locks. The first appellant`s keys were later also tested on the top drawer of the cupboard drawer, and one of his keys fitted the drawer lock. The cupboard (with the top drawer) was seized by the narcotics officers. When questioned later at the Central Police Station, the first appellant admitted that he also had a key to the door of the rear room, and pointed out a key on his key chain.
The items seized from the first appellant when he was arrested, namely, the drug exhibit `A1` and the bunch of keys, were taken into custody by NO Lester Lim Hang Meng; these were subsequently handed over to NO Ong Peng Boon when he arrived at No 10A, who then passed them to SNO Chew at 9.50pm the same evening. The items seized from the second appellant when he was arrested, namely, the drug exhibit `A1` and the black key pouch, were handed by NO Sammi Sim to SNO Chew when the latter arrived at No 10A at 5.40pm. SNO Chew personally took custody of all the items found in the locked drawer in the rear room, the drug exhibits `A2` and `A3`, and the drug paraphernalia. On his return to his office, SNO Chew locked all the seized items in his cabinet.
The next day, he took out the various items suspected to contain drugs which he marked as `A1`, `A2`, `A3` and `A4`. He then sent the four items to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. Dr Lee Tong Kooi testified that he had analysed the four items and found the substance in `A1`, `A2`, `A3` and `A4` to contain not less than 40.35g, 9.51g, 39.04g and 7.11g of diamorphine respectively. With respect to `A1`, Dr Lee stated that he had analyzed the drug content of the substance in the big packet, the four mini-packets and the small wrapped packet together, and the 40.35g was the total quantity of diamorphine found in those six receptacles.
Ding Sing Kwok, owner of the boarding house, gave evidence to the effect that he had given the second appellant the room on 6 April 1991, and that he had also given the second appellant a key to the rear room and a key to the main gate, while he himself retained a spare key to the rear room. He agreed that all his tenants had the key to the main gate, and that strangers could well enter the house without permission. He also stated that he had never seen the first appellant going to or inside the rear room. He stated that the cupboard in the rear room was not placed there by him.
SNO Chew with the assistance of an interpreter, Wu Nan Yong, recorded two long statements made by the first appellant. The admissibility of these two statements was contested on the grounds that they were made as a result of inducements or promises offered to him by SNO Chew while he was suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms. The trial judge accordingly held a voir dire, and, at the conclusion of the voir dire, he held that, on the totality of the evidence, he had no doubt that, at the time when the appellant made the statements, he had recovered from drug withdrawal symptoms and was in no way suffering from any withdrawal such that he could not possibly have made the statements or that his will was so overborne that he did not make the statements voluntarily. He rejected the first appellant`s allegations of promises or inducements offered by SNO Chew and his allegations that the statements had not been properly interpreted to him. The trial judge accordingly admitted in evidence the two statements.
Two long statements were also recorded from the second appellant, and as the second appellant did not challenge the voluntariness of these statements they were admitted in evidence.
In the first appellant`s statements, he admitted that near the end of March 1991, he got in touch with the second appellant and asked him for a supply of heroin. He stated that his purpose was to sell heroin in order to sustain his drug addiction. A few days later, the second appellant delivered a pound of heroin to him at No 10A. The first appellant separated this quantity into 58 small packets, using the drug paraphernalia found in the drawer of the rear room; he then sold the packets for $180 to $200 each to his five or six regular buyers in the Geylang area who would page for him.
A few days after the second appellant`s supply of the heroin, the first appellant suggested that the second appellant should rent the rear room in No 10A on his behalf, as the first appellant wanted to use the rear room to keep his store of heroin but could not rent two rooms at the same time. The second appellant rented the rear room using his false identity card, and allowed the first appellant to duplicate the key to the rear room given to him by the landlord. The first appellant then bought the cupboard with the top drawer from a nearby furniture shop, and he installed it in the rear room, and gave the second appellant a duplicate set of keys to the cupboard and drawer, so that the second appellant could put the heroin supplied to the first appellant in the cupboard drawer for him when he was not around.
Some two weeks later, the first appellant called the second appellant and ordered another pound of heroin and told him to put it in the drawer of the cupboard in the rear room. On 22 April, at about 8pm, he received a telephone call from the second appellant who told him that he was in the rear room. He told the second appellant to put the pound of heroin inside the cupboard drawer and then come up to see him. The second appellant came and he paid him (the second appellant) $6,800. After the second appellant had left, he put the 34 packets (remaining from his original stash of 58 packets) and the drug paraphernalia into a `GEC` paper box, and put that into a black plastic bag, and went downstairs to the rear room to put the things in the locked drawer. Inside the drawer was a red paper bag with the pound of heroin inside, as supplied by the second appellant. He stated that this heroin was not for him but for his friend, `Pui Tee`, who had in fact paid him the $6,800 which he had given to the second appellant. He further stated that he had arranged for Pui Tee to collect the pound of heroin from No 10A on 24 April, but he was arrested before Pui Tee could do so.
The first appellant further stated that, on 23 April, he called the second appellant and ordered half a pound of heroin. He subsequently advanced to the second appellant $3,000 for the purchase. The second appellant told him that the heroin would be delivered at around 4.15pm to 4.30pm the next day. On 24 April, the first appellant returned to No 10A after having spent the night at Paramount Hotel. At 4.30pm, he went to the rear room and took out 14 packets of heroin from the `GEC` box in the locked drawer to sell to his two buyers at Lorong 39 Geylang; one was to buy 11 packets, the other three. On his way to meet his buyers he was arrested.
In his long statements, the second appellant admitted to the following facts. In early April 1991, the first appellant asked him to supply one pound of heroin. The second appellant then approached a Malaysian supplier known as Ah Sen, and obtained a pound for the first appellant at a price of $6,400. He delivered the heroin to the first appellant at No 10A. There, the first appellant asked him to use his false identity card to rent the rear room at No 10A on the first appellant`s behalf; the first appellant said that he wanted to rent an extra room to store the heroin, so that if he was arrested nothing incriminating would be found in his own room. The first appellant complied. When the owner gave him the rear room key, he gave it to the first appellant to duplicate it so that each of them had a key. Two days later, the second appellant found a cupboard in the rear room, which the first appellant said he had bought. The first appellant gave him two keys to the cupboard, saying that he (the second appellant) could place things in the cupboard if the first appellant did not happen to be around.
About ten days later, the first appellant telephoned him again to order a pound of heroin. Again, the second appellant got in touch with Ah Sen and asked him for another pound. The second appellant collected the heroin from Ah Sen some four days later and paid him $6,400. He then proceeded to No 10A, and contacted the first appellant from the rear room using his handphone to tell him that he was putting the heroin in the cupboard. In the drawer was a paper box and a red paper bag; the second appellant put the pound of heroin into the bag and locked the drawer. He then went upstairs to the first appellant`s room and was paid $6,800 of which $400 was his commission.
The next day, the first appellant telephoned him the third time and asked for half a pound of heroin. When the second appellant contacted Ah Sen, however, Ah Sen stated that he did not supply drugs in half pounds and that the second appellant would have to buy a full pound. As the first appellant said that he had only enough money for half a pound, the second appellant had no choice but to buy the full pound with the intention of keeping the other half for himself. As the second appellant himself had not enough money to buy the full pound, the first appellant paid him $3,000 in advance. The second appellant then arranged to meet Ah Sen at 4pm the next day, 24 April. Before leaving to meet Ah Sen, the second appellant telephoned the first appellant and said that he would be at No 10A at about 4.15pm. At the meeting, Ah Sen handed him the heroin which was wrapped in a red plastic bag. The second appellant paid Ah Sen $6,400 and put the pound of heroin into his black clutch bag. He then took a taxi to No 10A, where he was arrested by the narcotics officers.
Two other statements were recorded from the second appellant and they were admitted at the request of his counsel. One was his statement made under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code and the other made under s 121. In the s 122(6) statement, he stated that the heroin in the rear room as well as all the other things in the rear room belonged to the first appellant. In the other statement, he admitted that the other drug items in `A1` (apart from the big packet) which he was carrying at the time of his arrest, ie the four mini-packets and one small wrapped packet, were for his own consumption.
The trial judge, having considered the details revealed in the appellants` statements, amended the charges against them according to the weights of the quantities of heroin they trafficked in. Before he did that, he recalled Dr Lee to clarify his evidence on the drugs, exh `A1`, seized from the second appellant, which comprised the large packet of heroin, the four mini-packets and the small wrapped packet. Since the second appellant had admitted to only trafficking in the half pound of substance found in the large packet, and the first appellant had admitted to instigating the second appellant to traffic only in that amount, the problem which then arose was that Dr Lee`s earlier evidence only pertained to the diamorphine content (40.35g) of the entire quantity of the drugs, exh `A1`, and not only to that of half the large packet. Dr Lee was recalled to establish whether he did determine the weight and thus the diamorphine content of the substance in the large packet. Dr Lee stated that the substance in the large packet weighed 458.3g, that in the mini-packets weighed 5.528g and that in the wrapped packet weighed 0.222g, making a total of 464.05g; and that the diamorphine content of the large packet was 39.85g based on a purity content of the whole bulk of 464.05g at 8.696818%. The material half of the diamorphine content of the large packet was therefore 19.92g. This result proceeded on the presumption that the levels of purity in the large packet, the four mini-packets and the wrapper were uniform. However, even assuming the extreme position that the contents of the four mini-packets and the small wrapped packet were pure diamorphine, ie 5,528g in the former and 0.222g in the latter, the diamorphine content of the large packet would be 34.6g (40.35g - 5.52g - 0.222g).
Thus, as against the first appellant, the first amended charge was that of trafficking on 24 April 1991 by offering to sell or deliver the 39.04g of heroin found in the red paper bag (A3), which he admitted that he had bought for, and would deliver to, Pui Tee. The second amended charge was that of trafficking on 24 April 1991 by transporting the 7.11g of heroin in the 14 packets found on him when he was arrested (A4); he admitted that he was in the process of taking the packets to meet his buyers when he was arrested. The third charge was that of abetment of trafficking on 23 April by instigating the second appellant to deliver 19.92g of heroin - this was half the quantity of heroin found in the large packet, (A1), the drugs seized from the second appellant upon his arrest, since the first appellant admitted that he had ordered only half pound of heroin from the second appellant.
As regards the second appellant, the first amended charge against him was that of trafficking on 22 April by delivering the 39.04g of heroin (A3) to No 10A, as admitted by him in his statement; he also admitted that he had obtained the heroin on the same day from one Ah Sen, the dealer. The second amended charge was that of trafficking on 24 April by delivering 19.92g of heroin, which would be the heroin content of the half pound that the second appellant admitted he was in the process of delivering to the first appellant when arrested.
The second appellant admitted in his statement that the drugs in the four mini-packets and one small wrapped packet of `A1` were for his own consumption. Accordingly, neither he nor the first appellant was charged with trafficking in these quantities of drugs. As for the 20 packets in the GEC box, `A2`, the remains of the original supply of 58, no charge also was brought against either of them.
After the trial judge amended the charges, he called both the appellants to enter upon their defence on their respective amended charges. Both appellants remained silent and called no witness on their behalf. They were convicted on all the charges.
Before us, counsel for the first appellant contended that the trial judge had erred in finding that the long statements made by him had been made voluntarily; instead, the trial judge should have found that the first appellant had been suffering from drug withdrawal symptoms at the time he made the statements such that his will was sapped, and that the first appellant had been induced to make the statements by the promises from SNO Chew. Counsel urged us to find that the prosecution evidence at the voir dire was unreliable, and that the weight of the evidence was such that a reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of the statements had been raised. Counsel also argued that without the benefit of the statements there was nothing to connect the first appellant to the drugs which were the subjects of the first and the third amended charges. With respect to A3, the 39.04g of drugs found in the red paper bag in the cupboard drawer, the subject of the first charge, counsel submitted that the prosecution had not shown that the first appellant had had sole control over the drugs, since the second appellant had equally the same access to the rear room and the cupboard.
We were unable to accept these submissions; they were completely without merit. The trial judge having reviewed the evidence was satisfied that the statements had been made by the first appellant voluntarily. On the evidence before him, the trial judge was completely justified in holding that no inducements or promises had been made to the first appellant. There was no reason for us to disturb his finding. In the light of this, there was no question as to the sufficiency of the evidence that the first appellant did traffic in 39.04g of drugs; the first appellant did not even come forward to refute or retract what he had said.
Counsel for the second appellant took issue with the trial judge`s convictions of the second appellant on the amended charges. With respect to the first charge, he argued that there was nothing in the prosecution`s case to link the second appellant to A3, the drugs found in the printed paper bag in the cupboard drawer. Though the trial judge referred in particular to certain paragraphs of the second appellant`s first long statement to establish this nexus, counsel argued that in the relevant paragraphs the second appellant had merely admitted that on 22 April 1991 he placed the heroin acquired on behalf of the first appellant into `a red paper bag` which he had found in the locked drawer of the cupboard in the rear room, and then replaced the bag in the drawer. There was nothing in the prosecution case which indicated that this red paper bag was the same paper bag in which the 39.04g of diamorphine, the subject of the first charge against the second appellant, was discovered on 24 April.
With respect to the second charge, counsel contended, first, that there had been a break in the chain of evidence in respect of the drug exhibit A1. Second, he asserted that the trial judge in recalling Dr Lee under s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) acted improperly as it was prejudicial to the second appellant by unfairly loading the scales in favour of the prosecution. Third, he contended that the trial judge had erred in finding that the second appellant had trafficked in 19.92g of diamorphine, which was exactly half of the diamorphine content found in the large packet; since the contemplated division of the pound had not taken place, it would not be fair to the appellants by assuming that the pound would have been divided with equal purity of diamorphine.
In our judgment, these submissions were unsustainable. As regards the first charge, the inference that must be drawn from the second appellant`s statement was that the drugs in the red paper bag found in the cupboard drawer by the narcotics officers on 24 April were the same drugs placed in `a red paper bag` and then locked in the drawer by the second appellant on 22 April. This was supported by the first appellant`s admission that he had ordered the drugs from the second appellant that day, that the second appellant arrived later and told him that he, the second appellant, had already put the requested drugs in the cupboard drawer, and that the first appellant had later looked at the cupboard drawer and seen the drugs, which had been placed inside the red paper bag. Also, no person other than the two appellants had access to the rear room and the cupboard drawer, and the second appellant had not said anything in his defence.
On the second charge, the trial judge found as a fact that there had been no break in the chain of possession of A1 and the material large packet of diamorphine, and the second appellant did not give us any reason to conclude that this finding was not justified.
We were also of the view that counsel`s arguments on s 399 of the CPC had no merit whatsoever. While we agreed that the discretionary power to recall a witness under s 399 should be exercised with regard to the just decision of the case, we could not see how the trial judge`s recall of Dr Lee was in any way prejudicial to the appellants and caused an unfair loading of the scales in favour of the prosecution. The trial judge`s express purpose for calling Dr Lee was to clarify the evidence already adduced before the court. He was entitled to call Dr Lee for that purpose. There was no question that he had exercised his discretion properly. Similarly, counsel`s argument, that the trial judge should not have assumed that the half pounds of heroin, which the first appellant admitted to ordering and which the second appellant admitted to have been in the process of delivering to him, would have contained half the amount of diamorphine found in the whole pound, was misconceived. The second appellant was found in possession of the whole pound and was originally charged with trafficking, inter alia, in the entire amount of diamorphine found in it. The discount made by the trial judge was done to reflect the state of affairs as admitted by both the first and the second appellant.
Accordingly, the appeals had no merit and were dismissed.

Respondent convicted of six criminal offences

ss 83(1), 83(2)(a) & 94A Legal Profession Act (Cap 161)
 
The respondent was convicted of four charges of conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust and two charges of conspiracy to cheat. Pursuant to s 94A of the Legal Profession Act (the Act), the Law Society applied for and received an order calling upon him to show cause before a court of three judges why he should not be dealt with under s 83 of the Act.
The respondent`s convictions arose out of the following facts. A plot of land belonging to Ismail bin Mohd Ibrahim (Ismail) and his children stood adjacent to another piece of land belonging to Halimah bte Dahari (Halimah). A developer, Sallim bin Mohamed (Sallim), contracted with them to redevelop their property. The agreement between the parties provided that the property was not to be mortgaged and that the title deeds were to be left in the safekeeping of the respondent as the solicitor for the owners of the land. Contrary to the terms of the agreement, Sallim mortgaged the property to Asia Building Society Ltd (ABS) for $560,000. To achieve this, Sallim forged various documents and had the title deeds sent to ABS`s solicitors. Subsequently, Sallim again mortgaged the property, this time to United Overseas Finance (UOF) for $580,000. To facilitate this later transaction, Sallim forged two agreements. The first was a sale and purchase agreement (P33) whereby Ismail purportedly agreed to sell his property to Sallim. The second was a similar sale and purchase agreement (P46) whereby Halimah purportedly agreed to sell her property to Sallim. Sallim also managed to have copies of the title deeds sent to UOF`s solicitors. Eventually, Sallim was prosecuted in respect of these matters and he pleaded guilty to the charges against him. The respondent was prosecuted for conspiring with Sallim to commit the offences.
There were six charges against the respondent; four for conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust and two for conspiracy to cheat. The charges alleging criminal breach of trust related to Ismail`s and Halimah`s title deeds which were in the respondent`s possession and trust as their solicitor. DAC 10120/93 charged that the respondent had assisted Sallim in his scheme by sending Ismail`s title deeds to ABS in breach of trust and for the dishonest purpose of obtaining a mortgage of the land without the consent of the owners. DAC 10119/93 charged that the respondent had sent Halimah`s title deeds to ABS for the same dishonest purpose. In respect of the mortgage obtained from UOF, DAC 1625/93 charged that the respondent had, in breach of trust, made copies of Ismail`s title deeds and sent them to UOF so as to assist Sallim in his deception. DAC 1627/93 charged that the respondent had also, in breach of trust, made and sent copies of Halimah`s title deeds to UOF.
The charges alleging conspiracy to cheat asserted that the respondent had conspired with Sallim to cheat UOF by dishonestly inducing UOF to release moneys to Sallim. DAC 1624/93 related to the forged sale and purchase agreement whereby Ismail was alleged to have agreed to sell his land to Sallim. DAC 1626/93 related to the forged sale and purchase agreement whereby Halimah was alleged to have sold her land to Sallim. Ismail and Halimah had not in fact executed these agreement, their signatures having been forged. But the respondent had signed as a witness to their purported execution of these two forged contracts. It was therefore alleged that he had been an active party to the forgery of the sale and purchase agreements and he was thus charged with conspiring to cheat UOF.
The learned district judge convicted the respondent on all six charges. In respect of the charges of criminal breach of trust, the learned district judge found that the respondent had knowingly, and in breach of trust, sent the title deeds entrusted to him to ABS and copies thereof to UOF. In his grounds of decision, he said: 
 
Another undisputed fact was that (the respondent`s) firm had been entrusted with the title deeds of Ismail and Halimah, and those title deeds were forwarded to ABS and copies of those title deeds were forwarded to UOF without the knowledge or consent of either Ismail or Halimah in violation of the purpose for which his firm had been entrusted with those title deeds ...
 
 
 
... I could not believe therefore that he was so ignorant or inept in his work that he had not known what title deeds were when these were entrusted to him, or that he would sign letters forwarding title deeds or copies thereof without realising what were being forwarded.
In respect of the two charges of cheating, the learned district judge found that the respondent had participated in the creation of the two forged sale and purchase agreements by signing as a witness to the execution of the documents so as to help Sallim to cheat UOF. In his grounds of decision, the learned district judge said: 
 
One undisputed fact was that he had signed as witness to executions of exhs P33 and P46 which had been forged ...
 
 
 
... In the light of all the evidence placed before me in the course of the trial, I decided that ... the accused had full knowledge that the executions had been forged when he appended his signatures to those two documents.
Thus, the learned district judge found the respondent guilty of four charges of conspiracy to commit criminal breach of trust and the two charges of conspiracy to cheat. He sentenced the respondent to 18 months` imprisonment on each of the six charges, with two of these sentences being ordered to run consecutively. He was also ordered to pay prosecution costs amounting to $54,585.73. The respondent appealed against the decision and sentence of the learned district judge but this appeal was dismissed by the learned Chief Justice on 9 May 1994.
It is clear that these convictions are sufficient to constitute due cause so as to invoke the powers of the court under s 83 of the Act. In this regard, s 83(2)(a) should be read together with s 83(1). These provisions state that: 
 
 
83(1) All advocates and solicitors shall be subject to the control of the Supreme Court and shall be liable on due cause shown to be struck off the roll or suspended from practice for any period not exceeding 5 years or censured. 
 
(2) Such due cause may be shown by proof that an advocate and solicitor - 
 
(a) has been convicted of a criminal offence, implying a defect of character which makes him unfit for his profession;
  
 
 
It was clear to us that the convictions in this case were of such a nature as to imply a defect in the character of the respondent which makes him unfit for his profession. The six offences were all ones involving fraud and dishonesty. Moreover, they were committed in the course of his professional duties as an advocate and solicitor. The title deeds in question were entrusted to him as Ismail`s and Halimah`s solicitor and this trust was violated by his subsequent conduct. His actions in purportedly witnessing the execution of sale and purchase agreements by Ismail and Halimah were also of a dishonest and fraudulent nature.
At the hearing of this matter, the respondent argued that he had been wrongly convicted of the offences charged. He asserted, as he did at the trial, that it was his conveyancing clerk who had conspired with Sallim to commit the offences. However, we did not think that this line of argument was open to him because s 83(5) of the Legal Profession Act says clearly that the court cannot go behind the convictions at such proceedings. Section 83(5) provides that: 
 
In any proceedings instituted under this Part against an advocate and solicitor consequent upon his conviction for a criminal offence, an Inquiry Committee, a Disciplinary Committee appointed under section 90 and a court of 3 judges of the Supreme Court referred to in section 98 shall accept his conviction as final and conclusive.
 
 
 
Thus, it was quite clear to us that we could not entertain submissions in this vein. That being the case, the sole question before the court was what consequences should flow from the fact that the respondent had committed criminal breach of trust in respect of title deeds entrusted to him as a solicitor and that the respondent had assisted in the forgery of sale and purchase agreements with a view to cheat.
In answering this question, we again noted that the offences for which the respondent had been convicted were ones involving dishonesty and fraud. We also noted that they involved large sums of money. But what influenced us most was the fact that the acts of the respondent in respect of which he had been charged had been performed in his capacity as an advocate and solicitor. In committing criminal breach of trust, the respondent had violated the trust that lay persons had placed in him as their solicitor. Further, in purporting to witness forged sale and purchase agreements, he was also abusing his position as a member of a respected profession.
On the other hand, we also noted the respondent`s contention before us that he had not received any pecuniary benefit as a result of his actions. However, though no finding was made in the court below that the respondent had received any reward for his actions, such a finding was not an issue which the district court had to consider. Neither was it an element which the prosecution had to prove in respect of any of the offences.
Taking all this into account, we could find no reason why the respondent should be allowed to remain on the roll of advocates and solicitors. He had violated the trust and confidence that his clients in particular, and society in general, are entitled to expect of him as a member of an honourable profession. Thus, we ordered that the respondent be struck off the roll. We also ordered that the respondent pays the Law Society the costs of these proceedings.

In these disciplinary proceedings by the Law Society of Singapore pursuant to s 98(1) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161) (the Act), Glenn Jeyasingam Knight (the respondent) was called upon to show cause why he should not be dealt with under the provisions of s 83(1) of the Act. Having heard the submissions of his counsel as well as those of counsel for the Law Society, we were unanimously of the opinion that the respondent should be struck off the roll. Our reasons therefor are given below.
 The facts
The respondent was admitted as an advocate and solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore on 11 July 1973. He began his career in the Singapore legal service as a deputy public prosecutor and on 16 October 1984 was appointed the Director of the Commercial Affairs Department (`CAD`), a post he held until mid-1991.
On 20 May 1991 the respondent was charged in the subordinate courts with (inter alia) having committed an offence under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241). The charge against him read as follows: 
 
You, Knight Glenn Jeyasingam, NRIC No 0356370/E are charged that you, on or about 17 November 1989, in Singapore being an agent, to wit, the Director of the Commercial Affairs Department, Ministry of Finance, Singapore did knowingly use with intent to deceive your principal, to wit, one Jaspal Singh, the Director (Corporate & Regulatory Affairs), Ministry of Finance, a document, to wit, a vehicle invoice of Ching Dtien Co dated 9 November 1989, in respect of which the said Jaspal Singh was interested and which contained a statement which was false in a material particular, to wit, that Ching Dtien Co had sold to you a Subaru Legacy 1.8 GL motor car for a sum of $73,500 which to your knowledge was intended to mislead your principal into granting you a government vehicle loan of $65,000, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1990 Ed).
 
 
 
On 30 September 1991 the respondent pleaded guilty to the above charge. In pleading guilty he admitted without qualification the statement of facts tendered by the prosecution. He was convicted on his plea of guilt and sentenced to one month`s imprisonment, this being reduced on appeal to one day`s imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 or in default to imprisonment of four months [see 
 Knight v PP 
 
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 720
 .]
On 19 August 1993 and 20 January 1994, a disciplinary committee was appointed to hear and investigate certain complaints made against the respondent. The amended charge faced by the respondent in the disciplinary proceedings which followed read as follows: 
 
You, Knight Glenn Jeyasingam, are charged that on 30 September 1991 you were convicted on a charge that as an agent you used knowingly with intent to deceive your principal, one Jaspal Singh, the Director (Corporate & Regulatory Affairs) Ministry of Finance, a document, to wit, a vehicle invoice of Ching Dtien Co dated 9 November 1989, in respect of which the said Jaspal Singh was interested and which contained a statement which was false in a material particular, to wit, that Ching Dtien Co had sold to you a Subaru Legacy 1.8 GL motor car for a sum of $73,500, which to your knowledge was intended to mislead your principal into granting you a government vehicle loan of $65,000, an offence punishable under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) and that on appeal you were sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 1 day and a fine of $10,000 and in default of payment thereof, a term of imprisonment of four months and you are thereby guilty of conduct implying a defect of character which makes you unfit for your profession within the meaning of s 83(2)(a) of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1990 Ed).
 
 
 
 
 The respondent`s defence before the disciplinary committee
 
In the course of the disciplinary proceedings which took place on 7 and 8 February 1994 and 5 March 1994, counsel for the respondent resisted the amended charge on several grounds. It was contended, first of all, that although the respondent had been convicted of a charge under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PCA), the conviction was a `
 technical 
` one, as the offence in question did not involve any element of fraud or dishonesty. Indeed counsel claimed that the only `
 wrong 
` which the respondent had committed was to submit a wrong invoice. Counsel urged the disciplinary committee to examine the `
 facts and circumstances 
` in which the offence had occurred and further produced, in aid of this, four separate invoices which he claimed had not been available either to the district court or to the High Court which heard the respondent`s appeal against sentence. These were: Motor Image`s invoice addressed to Focal Finance for the sum of $61,000; Motor Image`s invoice addressed to `M/S Government Loan` for the sum of $60,000; Ching Dtien Co`s invoice addressed to the respondent himself for $74,879; and Ching Dtien Co`s invoice addressed again to the respondent for the sum of $65,000.
Counsel claimed that a scrutiny of these four invoices revealed the High Court to have erred in stating, in its judgment dated 6 March 1992, that an offence under s 6(c) of the PCA implied `
 an element of dishonesty 
`. The principal error made by the High Court (so counsel alleged) lay in its apparent belief that the actual purchase price of the car was the $60,000 shown in the Motor Image invoice headed `M/S Government Loan`; and that in submitting a Ching Dtien Co invoice which enabled him to obtain a government loan of $65,000, the respondent `
 obtained $5,000 more for the loan 
`. Counsel submitted that the above finding was wrong because the price of the Subaru Legacy car was always $73,500, 
 not 
 $60,000: in obtaining a government loan of $65,000, the respondent got no more and no less than what he was entitled to.
Secondly, counsel for the respondent also argued that there had been delay by the Law Society in commencing disciplinary proceedings against the respondent under [the then] s 89(b) of the Act. Counsel pointed out that under [the then] s 89(b), the words used by the legislature were: `the Council shall forthwith apply ...`. `Forthwith`, so counsel argued, must be construed as meaning `as soon as practicable`: see 
 Turquand, Young & Co v Yat Yuen Hong Co Ltd 
. The Law Society was obliged, therefore, to act with dispatch; which, in counsel`s submission, it had not. The respondent had pleaded guilty to the charge under s 6(c) of the PCA on 30 September 1991 and in view of the guilty plea there could have been no appeal against conviction. Yet it was only on 6 August 1993 that the President of the Law Society applied for a disciplinary committee to be appointed to hear the complaint against the respondent.
Counsel initially claimed the delay to have rendered the disciplinary hearing against the respondent null and void. Subsequently, he abandoned this contention but persisted with the argument that the delay had caused the respondent grave prejudice, and that consideration had to be accorded to this prejudice when the disciplinary committee came to determine whether any cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action existed under s 83 of the Act. The main form of prejudice which the respondent claimed to have suffered was that the two-year delay in the commencement of disciplinary proceedings meant that in a `worst-case` scenario, should he eventually be struck off the roll, an extra two years would in effect have to be added to the usual five-year period which must elapse before an application for reinstatement on to the roll can be made.
Lastly the various mitigating circumstances in the respondent`s case were canvassed before the disciplinary committee in an effort to persuade the committee that the respondent had been sufficiently punished for his crime and that a reprimand should suffice in his case. In particular, it was said that the criminal conviction had caused untold trauma and ignominy to the respondent and that he had suffered in consequence both material deprivation and physical illness.
 The Law Society`s submissions before the disciplinary committee
In reply counsel for the Law Society argued firstly that the disciplinary committee, in its deliberations, should have regard only to the nature of the offence of which the respondent had been convicted, because the adduction of the four invoices, which had not been available to either the district court or the High Court, amounted to a challenge to the statement of facts previously admitted by the respondent in pleading guilty. Counsel submitted that a conviction under s 6(c) of the PCA implied dishonest conduct rendering the respondent unfit for the legal profession. This submission relied in the main on the following remarks by the High Court in its 6 March 1992 judgment: 
 
The charge under s 6(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act does not imply any corruption at all. The word `corruptly` which is present in paras (a) and (b) of s 6 is absent in para (c). But the offence under s 6(c) does imply an element of dishonesty. In effect it is an offence of cheating under a different statutory provision. On the facts admitted by the appellant he could be charged for cheating under s 417 or 420 of the Penal Code. The prosecution, however, has brought this charge under s 6(c) of the Act and is fully entitled to do so. A charge under s 6(c) of the Act is more serious than that under s 417 of the Penal Code. This is clearly evident from the penalty provided in s 6 as compared to that provided in s 417. Under s 6 the maximum penalty is a fine of $100,000 or a term of imprisonment of five years or both, whereas under s 417 the maximum term of imprisonment is one year or a fine or both.
 
 
 
With regard to the argument that prejudice had been occasioned to the respondent by the Law Society`s delay, counsel for the Law Society proffered first of all the explanation that the Law Society had, rightly or wrongly, thought it prudent to await the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
 Law Society of Singapore v Ang Boon Kong Lawrence 
. This was a case which dealt, inter alia, with the jurisdiction exercised by the Law Society over advocates and solicitors without practising certificates, namely, legal officers. Judgment was delivered on 14 December 1992. The Law Society received the written judgment on 5 January 1993, following which it sought counsel`s opinion as to whether it could empanel a disciplinary committee to investigate a complaint against the respondent in respect of his conviction under the PCA. In any case, so counsel contended, the respondent could not be said to have suffered any prejudice because he should have been aware all along that an application by the Law Society under [the then] s 89(b) was mandatory (`the Council 
 shall 
 ...`): he could not claim, therefore, to have been labouring under the belief that the Law Society had decided not to take any action against him.
 The findings of the disciplinary committee
At the conclusion of its hearing the disciplinary committee rejected the respondent`s contention that his conviction under s 6(c) of the PCA did not imply dishonest conduct on his part. The committee pointed out that the charge to which he had pleaded guilty clearly alleged an intent to deceive and that, as an experienced former prosecutor, he would have been fully aware of what he was pleading guilty to. Moreover, they were of the opinion that even an examination of the facts and circumstances surrounding the offence could not assist the respondent any further. The committee noted that in fact the evidence showed him to have obtained two loans in respect of the same Subaru Legacy car, one a government loan and the other a loan of $61,000 from Focal Finance. The loan of $65,000 which he obtained from the government had been applied for by the respondent on the basis that it would be used to purchase a Subaru Legacy car from Ching Dtien Co. In reality it was not used for this stated purpose. Instead a major portion of the government loan (at least $51,000) was used to pay off the balance of moneys owed by the respondent to Ching Dtien Co in respect of a loan which Ching Dtien Co had previously given him when he purchased a BMW car from them. The committee was of the view that, even if it could be said that the High Court had erred in concluding that the respondent `
 obtained $5,000 more for the loan 
` by submitting the wrong invoice, that error was actually in his favour since it was clear to the committee, on the basis of the respondent`s own evidence, that he had `
 obtained a great deal more 
`. It should further be noted that having had the benefit of the respondent`s oral testimony before them, the committee articulated a negative finding as to his credibility. He was said to have been `
 plainly not ... truthful 
` and `
 evasive 
`; and there was an impression that he had `
 (rearranged) the facts to suit 
` himself.
The final determination of the disciplinary committee, therefore, was that the offence of which the respondent had been convicted implied a defect of character which made him unfit for his profession. They found that the charge against him had been proven and that accordingly cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action under s 83(1) of the Act. As to the issue of possible prejudice caused to the respondent by the time lag which elapsed before the commencement of disciplinary proceedings, the committee stated at p 9 of its report: 
 
(W)e do not find, on the facts before us, that there was any inordinate delay on the part of the Law Society to the prejudice of [the respondent].
 
 
 
 
 The hearing of the show cause action
 
At the hearing of the show cause action before this court, counsel for the respondent stated that he would not be contesting further the issue of whether the offence of which the respondent had been convicted carried an element of dishonesty. He conceded that no defence was being raised by the respondent against the charge which had been brought against him and that the only issue before this court, so far as the respondent himself was concerned, was one of the appropriate penalty to be applied to him. We were urged, therefore, to display leniency towards the respondent, bearing in mind the mitigating factors in his case as well as the prejudice allegedly caused by the time lag which elapsed before the commencement of disciplinary proceedings.
In expanding on the mitigating circumstances of the respondent`s case, counsel asserted that the offence in question had not involved the respondent acting in his professional capacity as an advocate and solicitor. We were of the opinion, however, that this in itself had no mitigating value whatsoever. The charge against the respondent required only that it be shown that he had been convicted of a criminal offence: there was no necessity that the offence be connected in any way with the discharge of the respondent`s professional duties. Thus, in 
 Re Weare 
, Lord Esher MR, responding to an argument that the court had no authority to strike a solicitor off the roll if the offence he had committed had not occurred in his capacity as solicitor, stated succinctly: 
 
That would seem to me to be a very strange doctrine if it were true - that a person convicted of a crime, however horrible, must, if it be not connected with his professional character, be allowed by the court still to be a member of a profession which ought to be free from all suspicion.
 
 
 
We had regard also to the other mitigating factors put forth by counsel, including the testimonials of character which counsel drew to our attention as well as the alleged prejudice occasioned by the delay in disciplinary proceedings being brought. In respect of the latter, however, we shared the view of the disciplinary committee that there had been no `
 inordinate 
` delay by the Law Society. The Law Society appears to us to have acted only with circumspection in seeking legal advice before bringing its disciplinary jurisdiction to bear on the respondent. We were further of the opinion that the allegation of prejudice was based at best on conjecture. Counsel submitted that the time lag constituted a setback in time for the respondent because, if he were struck off the roll, an extra two years would in effect have to be added on to the usual five-year period which a solicitor has to wait out before applying for restoration to the roll. In fact, however, as 
 Re Lim Cheng Peng 
 demonstrates, it is open to a solicitor who believes himself to have suffered serious detriment by reason of some delay in the disciplinary proceedings to make an application for restoration before the normal five-year period has passed; and it is open to the court hearing such an application to take account of the alleged delay.
More importantly, in our view, in any case where the court is bound to consider the appropriate order to be made in respect of an advocate and solicitor convicted of a criminal offence - particularly one involving dishonesty - the paramount considerations must be the protection of the public and the preservation of the good name of the profession. Certainly the court will give its consideration to the mitigating circumstances in each individual case but it can do so only so far as is consistent with the above two related objectives. As the Law Society of the United Kingdom noted in its 
 Guide to the Professional Conduct of Solicitors 
 (1990 Ed) at p 177: 
 
If the need to protect the good name of the profession ultimately causes hardship to an individual whose misconduct has led to his being struck off, it has to be accepted as the price of maintaining the reputation of the profession and the public confidence in it.
 
 
 
In the present case, it must be remembered that, at the time of the offence, the respondent was holding a position of not inconsiderable significance within the legal profession and one which frequently placed him in the public eye. As the director of the CAD, he was charged with the responsibility of overseeing the investigation and prosecution of various commercial crimes. That he should himself become the perpetrator of a crime of deceit, albeit one not within the purview of his own department, is inexcusable. It is no exaggeration to say, therefore, that the respondent`s conduct and his subsequent conviction produced in turn negative consequences so far as public confidence in the integrity of the legal profession was concerned.
In our judgment, therefore, on all the facts of the case, it would be contrary to the interests of the public as well as those of the profession if the respondent were not struck off the roll. We accordingly so ordered; and the Law Society having asked for its costs, we also ordered that the respondent should pay these costs.
 Order accordingly.",1994-08-31 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiffs are a company incorporated in Singapore on 14 June 1972. The first defendant was the managing director from the date of incorporation to 3 March 1978. The other directors at the material time were the third defendant and one Koh Chee Chong. The third defendant was the nominee of one Lok Bok Sim (LBS) who was at all material times in effective control of the plaintiffs.
The first defendant through his company, Hoe Huat Construction & Engineering (Pte) Ltd (Hoe Huat), was at all material times a contractor of the Housing & Development Board (HDB). He had known the late Mr Teh Cheang Wan since 1966 when the latter was the Chief Architect of HDB. LBS was at all material times the managing director of Singapore Finance Ltd. In or about 1970, the first defendant came to know LBS and thereafter they became business associates. Through his company, Hoe Huat, the first defendant assisted LBS in the latter`s housing development at Mandalay Road from around 1971 to 1973.
In 1972, through Mr Koh Chee Chong, LBS came to know that the piece of land at Kampong Chai Chee with an area of 186.7 acres comprised in lots 21-26, 4-4, 4-7, 120, 121, 122 and 123 and 221 of mukim 28 was available for sale. Having agreed on the price at $1.09m with the owners, the estate of Tan Chwee Boon, deceased, the plaintiff company was incorporated for the purchase of the land. The contract for the purchase was entered into in or about June 1972. Completion took place on 27 October 1972. Pending completion, on 20 July 1972 two of the lots, namely, 221 and 4-4 with a total area of 5.8 acres were acquired by the government. Some neighbouring lands were also acquired. The compensation paid was $228,000 or $0.89 per square foot.
On 23 January 1973, following negotiations between the first defendant on behalf of the plaintiffs and the second defendant on behalf of Collin Investment Pte Ltd (CIP), now known as Lee Kai Investment Pte Ltd, an agreement (the main agreement) was entered into by which the plaintiffs agreed to sell three of the lots (the three lots), namely, lots 21-26 (156 acres, 2 roods and 20 poles), 4-7 (19 acres, 1 rood and 6 poles), 123 (2 acres, 3 roods and 11 poles) to CIP for $2.05m. This worked out at about $0.25 per square foot irrespective of the zoning. The three lots were within four zones under the master plan, that is, about 50.13% were zoned `water catchment`, 20.02% `rural`, 7.84% `permanent residential` and 22.01% `temporary residential`. The main agreement was signed by the first defendant on behalf of the plaintiffs and by the second defendant on behalf of CIP.
Along side the main agreement, four side agreements (the side agreements) were entered into on the same day or some days later but backdated to 23 January 1973. They were: 
 
 
(i) An agreement (the sub-sale agreement) between CIP as vendor and Mdm SS Lim (Lim Siam Soi), the wife of the first defendant, and Miss Collin Tan (Collin Tan), daughter of the second defendant, as purchasers. The second defendant signed the sub-sale agreement on behalf of CIP and Collin Tan. The first defendant signed on behalf of Lim Siam Soi. By the sub-sale agreement, part of lot 21-26 zoned residential described in the schedule as `approximate area of 5 acres` and stated in the annexed plan as `[plusmn]5 acres` (the [plusmn]5 acres) was sold by CIP to Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan at the price of $50,000 or about $0.25 per square foot. 
 
(ii) An agreement (the Collden agreement) between Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan as vendors and Collden Realty Pte Ltd (Collden) as purchasers, by which the [plusmn]5 acres were agreed to be conveyed to Collden in consideration of which Collden would allot 22,500 shares of $1 each to Lim Siam Soi and 27,500 shares of $1 each to Collin Tan, the shares to be credited as fully paid in the books of Collden. This would give a shareholding of 45% to Lim Siam Soi and 55% to Collin Tan in Collden. The first defendant signed the Collden agreement on behalf of Lim Siam Soi. The second defendant signed on behalf of Collin Tan. No one signed on behalf of Collden presumably because it had not been incorporated at that time. 
 
(iii) An agreement (the pre-incorporation agreement) between Collin Tan and Lim Siam Soi, by which it was agreed that notwithstanding their respective proportion of shareholdings, that is, 55% and 45% respectively, Collin Tan would bear 80% whilst Lim Siam Soi would only bear 20% of the development costs of the [plusmn]5 acres. It was also agreed that should Lim Siam Soi fail to contribute her share of 20% of the development costs Collin Tan was to advance same with interest at 10.8% pa. The first defendant again signed on behalf of Lim Siam Soi and the second defendant similarly signed on behalf of Collin Tan. 
 
(iv) An agreement (the fall-back agreement) between CIP of the one part and Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan of the other part, by which it was agreed that if CIP failed under any circumstances to purchase the land under the main agreement from the plaintiffs, the sub-sale agreement would absolutely determine and become null and void and the sum of $50,000 paid under the sub-sale agreement would be `forfeited` and each party would have no claim against the other.
  
 
 
It transpired that Collin Tan was not aware of these transactions and neither had she authorized the second defendant to act on her behalf.
As there was no subdivisional approval for the excision of the [plusmn]5 acres, the three lots were conveyed on the instruction of CIP to Collin Development Pte Ltd on completion on 14 March 1973. Collin Development Pte Ltd is now known as Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd, that is, the fourth defendants. Both CIP and the fourth defendants were at all material times under the effective control of the second defendant.
On 23 July 1976, the three lots, except for 4.2 acres of the [plusmn]5 acres, were acquired by the government for public housing and infrastructure purposes. The compensation awarded was $2.5m or $0.33 per square foot. Following a title survey, the [plusmn]5 acres with an area of 4.2 acres or thereabouts is now comprised in lot 1606. Previously landlocked, it now enjoys access to the Pan Island Expressway and other public roads and is a resurveyed lot with development potential.
Due to disputes arising out of the side agreements relating to the sub-sale, Lim Siam Soi on 23 June 1984 commenced action in Suit 4149 of 1984 against Tan Geok Tee and Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd, being the second and fourth defendants herein, and Lee Kai Investment Pte Ltd (CIP). In that suit, Lim Siam Soi alleged that Tan Geok Tee orally agreed as principal or on behalf of Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd to purchase her share in the [plusmn]5 acres for $3.8m net of tax, of which she had received part payment of $1,368,420.90. The oral agreement was allegedly concluded on or about 22 April 1981 in Hong Kong following negotiations in Singapore and the part payment was received on 23 April 1981. Accordingly, she claimed specific performance of the oral agreement and the balance of the sale price upon completion. Lim Siam Soi also claimed a declaration that Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd holds the 4.2 acres on trust for her and Collin Tan in equal shares.
The plaintiffs, under the control of the nominees of LBS since the removal of the first and third defendants as directors on 3 March 1978, alleged that they became aware of the sub-sale agreement as a result of the proceedings in Suit No 4149 of 1984. Accordingly, they commenced the present proceedings on 25 May 1987. Paragraphs 6 to 8 alleging conspiracy to defraud on the part of the first, second and third defendants read: 
 
 
(6) By a conspiracy to defraud the plaintiffs which conspiracy was hatched between the first and the second defendants and of which conspiracy the third defendant was at all material times aware, the first defendant as the managing director or director of and on behalf of the plaintiffs conspired to sell and the second defendant on behalf of CIP conspired to purchase and to further this purpose entered into an agreement on or about 23 January 1973 for the sale of the lots 21-26, 4-7 and 123 comprising about 176 acres for an inordinately low price of $2.05m in spite of the large area involved. Subsequently, the sale was registered in the name of the fourth defendants. 
 
(7) In pursuance of the said conspiracy and on the same day, ie 23 January 1973, CIP in turn entered into an agreement with the said Madam Lim Siam Soi (wife of the first defendant), and the said Collin Tan (daughter of the second defendant) both of whom were at all material times directors of CIP for the sale or sub-sale of part of the said lot 21-26 which was later subdivided and is now known as lot no 1606 and comprising approximately 5 acres for the sum of $50,000 only, which is also the subject matter of Suit No 4149 of 1984 and the plaintiffs herein will make references to the affidavits and other records in that suit at the hearing of this suit. 
 
(8) The first, second and third defendants knew or must have known by reason of the fact that the said lot 1606 (of about 5 acres) would not be acquired by the government and, therefore, was without tenants of [sic] squatters, and was worth or would be worth several million dollars and hence the plaintiffs have been defrauded by the first, and second and third defendants or any one or more of them.
  
 
 
 
 Particulars of fraud of the first, second and third defendants or any one or more of them
 
 
 
(a) The first and third defendants agreed to sell the said lots 21-26, 4-7 and 123 of mukim XXVIII totalling approximately 176 acres for $2.05m only, and the second defendant agreed to buy on behalf of CIP when the first, second and third defendants well knew or must have known that the price was inordinately low by reason of the fact that they were equipped with the knowledge that the said 5 acres would not be acquired by the government. 
 
(b) Having entered into the said agreement for sale and purchase referred to in sub-para (a) above, all or some of the defendants were a party to CIP selling on the same day the said lot 1606 to Lim Siam Soi (wife of the first defendant) and the said Collin Tan (daughter of the second defendant) when all or some of the defendants had an interest in and/or were connected with CIP. 
 
(c) Entered into the said agreement in para 7 above at a price of only $50,000 when all or some of the defendants and the said Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan knew or must have known that the said lot 1606 was not likely to be acquired by reason of the fact that the first and second defendants signed the agreements for and on behalf of their nominees and from the documents it would appear that the first and second defendants wanted to retain the beneficial interest for themselves. Evidence will be adduced to show that the unacquired property was worth well over $1m. 
 
(d) Conspired with each other and their nominees, namely, the said Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan to sell through their said nominees one-half share of the said lot 1606 in or about the month of April 1981 to the second defendant at a price of $3.8m. 
 
(e) Causing the plaintiffs wrongful loss and giving themselves or making wrongful gain or unjust enrichment by the said sales and purchases.
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
Paragraph 9 alleged breach by the first and third defendants in conspiracy with the second defendant of their duties as directors under s 157(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) and their fiduciary duty relating to the alleged secret sub-sale under the sub-sale agreement.
Paragraph 9 read: 
 
For the reasons aforesaid, the first defendant and third defendants are additionally also in breach of their duties imposed on them as directors under s 157(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) and are also in breach of their fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiffs and are liable to the plaintiffs for the losses suffered by it the plaintiffs under s 157(3) thereof. The first and/or third defendants are also in breach of their duty to act bona fide in the interests of the plaintiff company and for breach of trust as trustees of the plaintiff company and the particulars are as follows:
 
 
 
 
 Particulars
 
 
 
(i) Having acquired the knowledge (through the first defendant) that the said 5 acres will not be acquired by the government failing to give the benefit thereof to the plaintiff company. 
 
(ii) Setting aside the said 5 acres for development by the first defendant or his nominees in conspiracy with the second defendant and or his nominee. 
 
(iii) Failure by the first defendant to disclose that he had on the 23 January 1973 entered into an agreement with the second defendant for the benefit of himself and/or his nominee relating to the sale of the said 5 acres.
  
 
 
...
 
 
 
Section 157(1) and (3) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) read: 
 
 
(1) A director shall at all times act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office. 
 
(3) An officer or agent who commits a breach of any of the provisions of this section shall be - 
 
(a) liable to the company for any profit made by him or for any damage suffered by the company as a result of the breach of any of those provisions; and 
 
(b) guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year.
  
 
 
The allegation of breach of duty as directors related also to dissipation of assets by the first and third defendants but these allegations were eventually not pursued.
Arising out of the pleadings, by an order of court, it was ordered that the issue whether the price of $2.05m at which the three lots were sold under the main agreement was inordinately low be tried before the trial of the other issues. This preliminary point came up for hearing before me. I found that: 
 
Bearing in mind that neighbouring lands had been acquired, and hence the strong likelihood of this land being acquired too, the sale price of $2.05m in January 1973 though low was not inordinately low between a willing buyer and a willing seller if both had no knowledge that part of lot 21-26 measuring 4.2 acres would not be acquired. However, for someone who is alleged to have known that these 4.2 acres part of lot 21-26, now lot 1606, would not be acquired and more so that after acquisition of the rest of the land, lot 1606 would have access to an expressway and other public roads, the price of $2.05m for the three lots was inordinately low.
 
 
 
It had in fact been deposed on behalf of the fourth defendants that the fourth defendants in July 1988 received an offer from one `Lay Kok Weng to buy lot 1606, mukim 28, for $14.25m.
The question therefore is whether the first and/or third defendant knew at the material time that the [plusmn]5 acres would not in due course be acquired or could be left out of acquisition and if the second defendant was privy to this knowledge when the main agreement and the side agreements were entered into.
According to the first defendant, some time in December 1972, a broker by the name of Koh Choon How brought the second defendant to his office at Macpherson Road and introduced the second defendant to him. Following the introduction, the first defendant showed the second defendant the site plan. After the second defendant had seen the site plan he asked the first defendant if the latter would like to go into joint venture with him. The first defendant then disclosed that the land belonged to the plaintiffs and he would consult the board. The matter was then discussed among LBS and the three directors, namely, the first and third defendants and Mr Koh Chee Chong. A sale of the land was decided on instead of a joint venture. But LBS and the other two directors allegedly said that if the first defendant was interested in a joint venture with the second defendant he could do so. The first defendant was then authorized to negotiate the sale at a minimum price of $0.25 per square foot. The first defendant then carried out the negotiations, shuttling back and forth between the second defendant`s office at ICB Building, Shenton Way, and LBS` office nearby at Robinson Road. Eventually the price was agreed at $2.05m for the three lots. During these negotiations the joint venture between the first and second defendants on the [plusmn]5 acres was also discussed and agreed to. The first defendant kept LBS informed and obtained his agreement to the price of $2.05m. He said LBS did not object to his proposed joint venture with the second defendant. Mr Low Siew Joon, a solicitor, was then instructed to act for the plaintiffs in the sale whilst the second defendant was represented by M/s Lee & Lee in his purchase.
This evidence is not consistent with the letter from the second defendant to M/s Lee & Lee dated 8 January 1973 which suggested that the terms were agreed to between the first and second defendants in Hong Kong if not whilst the second defendant was in Hong Kong. The letter read: 
 
Recently in Hong Kong I have conferred the matter with the owner, Mr Liu, eventually we reached to [sic] an agreement, as Mr Liu accepted verbally to sell the above property to me and he is now instructing his solicitors to draft out the agreement, therefore, please let me know by telephone on collect call, as soon as Liu`s solicitors approaching [sic] you.
 
 
 
On the four side agreements, it is to be noted that both parties were represented by another solicitor, Mr Ng Kong Yeam. Although the joint venture had been discussed and agreed to at the same time that the terms of the main agreement were discussed and agreed to, yet Mr Low Siew Joon was not instructed to prepare the side agreements as well and to do so for signature at the same time that the main agreement was to be signed. Be that as it may, this is the evidence of the first defendant: 
 
A: After the sale and purchase agreement for the land was signed Mr Tan telephoned me and asked me to sign the agreement for the joint venture as soon as possible.
 
 
 
Q: I see. To finalize the joint venture, is it?
 
 
 
A: The joint venture to develop the small plot of land.
 
 
 
Q: Hence, what did you do?
 
 
 
A: I then asked Lok Bok Sim which lawyer I should go to. Mr Lok then recommended Ng Kong Yeam as the most appropriate lawyer because he could speak Mandarin.
 
 
 
Q: And both you and Mr Tan communicated in Mandarin?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: And when did Mr Tan call you after the agreement was signed?
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
A: One or two days after the agreement was signed.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Q: So he would have contacted you sometime on 24, and no later than 25 January?
 
 
 
A: Approximately that time.
 
 
 
Q: And you say further that Mr Lok suggested Mr Ng Kong Yeam as the solicitor?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: And so what did you do?
 
 
 
A: I then made an appointment with Tan Geok Tee to meet Mr Ng Kong Yeam.
 
 
 
Q: At his office?
 
 
 
A: Yes, at Mr Ng`s office, to finalize the agreement.
 
 
 
Q: I see. So can you turn to p 98, please? Same bundle.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Q: Now, are you looking at p 98?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: Page 98. This is the agreement between Collin Investment and Madam SS Lim and Miss Collin Tan. Collin Investment are the vendors and Madam SS Lim and Miss Collin Tan are the purchasers. Can you confirm for his Honour that Madam SS Lim is your wife and Miss Collin Tan is the daughter of Mr Tan?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: And the agreement was made where Collin Tan would sell 5 acres. Collin Investment would sell approximately 5 acres to your wife and Miss Tan for the sum of $50,000?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: And it was an attempt to delineate these 5 acres and you see it at p 102 at the left hand corner somewhere near the bottom?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: And I see the sign `[plusmn]5 acres`, you see it?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: Can you explain to his Honour why plus and minus?
 
 
 
A: Because this was only an approximate area of 5 acres.
 
 
 
Q: Now, this agreement was signed by Mr Tan on behalf of Collin Investment?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: And it was signed by you on behalf of Madam SS Lim?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Wu: I`m told, your Honour, the right page to refer is p 115 where Mr Tan signed on behalf of Collin Investment and also on behalf of his daughter Miss Collin Tan.
 
 
 
Q: ... and you signed on behalf of your wife?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: Now, that wasn`t the only agreement signed on that day. You`ll see another agreement on p 118. Now, this is an agreement between Madam Lim and Miss Collin Tan. This time, they are described as the vendors and they are selling it to a company called Collden Realty Pte Ltd?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: This agreement tried to set out the respective shareholdings between you and Mr Tan?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: In other words you or your wife will take 45% and Miss Tan will take the other 55%?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
His Honour: `I or my wife`, isn`t it?
 
 
 
Woo: The wife is his nominee just as Miss Tan was Mr Tan`s nominee.
 
 
 
Q: Now, at p 121 is another agreement between Miss Collin Tan and Mdm Lim. This provides for the incorporation of the company called Collden Realty which was to have an authorized share capital of $2m and at para 8, the last paragraph at p 123, it says: [reads] `Notwithstanding the proportion of the share held by the parties hereto, 80% of the development costs of the property shall be borne by Mr Tan and 20% thereof by Mdm Lim. Provided that [if] she, Mdm Lim, fails to contribute her share of 20%, Miss Tan shall advance the same and shall charge Mdm Lim interest at the rate of 10.8% pa, for the advance made.`
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: [Reads] `Provided that Miss Tan shall not be required to contribute development costs exceeding the sum of $1.5m.` And again this agreement was signed by Mr Tan on behalf of his daughter and you on behalf of your wife?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: Now, I notice that these agreements were dated 23 January 1973. Were they in fact signed by the two of you on that day?
 
 
 
A: No, they were signed at a later date.
 
 
 
Q: But it was backdated to the 23 January?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: Well before I ask you why, now I would like you to turn to p 104, same bundle. Now, this is what you would call the fall-back agreement. It`s between Collin Investment as Vendor and Mdm Lim and Miss Tan.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Q: It is a very short agreement, so I`ll read it. It says in the recital: [reads] `Whereas this agreement is supplemental to the agreement dated the 23 January 1973 entered into between the parties hereto. Now it is hereby agreed as follows: In the event that the vendor in the said agreement fails under any circumstances to purchase the property described in the second schedule thereto from Peng Ann Realty Pte Ltd, a copy of an agreement between Peng Ann and the vendor is also annexed hereto and marked A.` And that`s why you will find A at p 91, the alphabet A at p 91: [reads] ` The said agreement marked B shall absolutely determine ....` This is the sale of the property to your wife and Miss Tan for $50,000: [reads] `shall absolutely determine and become null and void and the sum of $50,000 paid thereunder shall be deemed to be forfeited and each party shall have no claim against the other.`
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: Yes?
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: Now, this agreement is also dated 23 January 1973, was that in fact signed on that day?
 
 
 
A: It was also backdated. It was not signed on that day, it was backdated.
 
 
 
Q: Yes. When were these agreements signed?
 
 
 
A: This agreement was signed even later than the ....
 
 
 
Q: ... the other three agreements.
 
 
 
A: ... the earlier agreements.
 
 
 
Q: Yes. When were the other three agreements signed?
 
 
 
A: After the main agreement was signed then there was this joint venture agreement.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Q: You see, the main agreement was signed on the 23 January then there were the other three supplemental agreements, sorry, there were the other three agreements which were prepared by Ng Kong Yeam, when were these three agreements signed?
 
 
 
A: A few days after the main agreement was signed, I went with Tan Geok Tee to Ng Kong Yeam`s office to sign the agreements.
 
 
 
Q: A few days, would you say two days, three days?
 
 
 
A: Can`t recall the number of days.
 
 
 
Q: All right. Were these three agreements signed on the same day? I haven`t come to this agreement on p 104, the fall-back agreement, I refer to the other three agreements, were they signed on the same day?
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
A: Yes, signed on the same day.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
Q: Yes, what about the fall-back agreement at p 104? Was it signed on the same day as the other three agreements?
 
 
 
A: You are talking about the fifth agreement?
 
 
 
Q: Yes, 104, at p 104.
 
 
 
A: This was left out the last time.
 
 
 
Q: It was left out the last time?
 
 
 
A: It was prepared the following day.
 
 
 
It is the first defendant`s case that LBS, the man in effective control of the plaintiffs, was duly informed by the first defendant of his proposed joint venture with the second defendant. The first defendant is supported by the third defendant who confirmed that he, as the nominee of LBS, was aware of the proposed joint venture and so was LBS.
The issue however is not whether LBS was aware of the joint venture between the first and second defendants by themselves or their nominees. The issue is whether the first defendant knew that the [plusmn]5 acres would not be acquired or could be left out of acquisition and if the second defendant was privy to this knowledge.
The second defendant died before the hearing. But in his affidavit affirmed on 1 February 1989 and filed in Suit No 4149 of 1984, he stated in para 5: 
 
Sometime before the first agreement [the main agreement] was signed, Liu proposed to me that part of lot 21-26 of mukim 28 be set aside for joint development. Tempted by Liu`s claim that he had good connections with the relevant officers in the building authorities and that he could obtain favourable planning conditions not available to others, I accepted his proposal and accordingly, set aside an area of approximately 5 acres of lot 21-26, mukim 28 for the proposed joint development.
 
 
 
The first defendant in para 4 of his affidavit affirmed on 10 March 1989 and filed in Suit No 4149 of 1984 replied: 
 
I disagree with para 5 of Tan`s affidavit. Shortly after the first agreement was signed, Tan approached me and suggested that I entered into a joint development with him of the 5 acres or so referred to in para 5 of his affidavit ....
 
 
 
We discussed the question of finance and Tan said he would provide 80% of the development costs whereas I was to provide 20%. He insisted that he would maintain control of the company which it was contemplated would develop the land and it was eventually agreed that he would have 55% and I would have 45%.
This is not consistent with the first defendant`s evidence before me which was to the effect that the joint venture was brought up at the first meeting between him and the second defendant and the terms discussed before the signing of the main agreement.
In his said affidavit filed in Suit No 4149 of 1984 the second defendant also contended that under the sub-sale agreement it was a condition precedent that Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan would apply for subdivision of the [plusmn]5 acres. As this was not done, Lim Siam Soi had no interest in the [plusmn]5 acres. In answer to this contention, the first defendant stated in his said affidavit: 
 
... subdivision was not applied for in 1973/4 because of the agreement to which I have referred above. Thereafter it was likely (as in the event happened) that the land other than lot 1606 would be compulsorily acquired. When it was so acquired, approval for subdivision was automatically provided by reason of the fact that, firstly, everything except lot 1606 was compulsorily acquired and, therefore, de facto divided off, and secondly, the land was resurveyed and renumbered. I draw attention to the fact that what was carried out by the chief surveyor was a title survey. Everything has been done to enable LTD [the fourth defendants in present proceedings] to receive a fresh title to lot 1606 ... .
 
 
 
In the present proceedings the first defendant testified under cross-examination as follows: 
 
Q: But you then said to Tan Geok Tee sale be conditional upon a joint development, why?
 
 
 
A: If I did not go into joint development with him on the smaller plot of land [the [plusmn]5 acres] it would show I had no confidence because I had already told him the land would not be acquired; because Tan Geok Tee`s condition for the purchase is that the land would not be acquired.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
A: Tan Geok Tee wanted to see whether I had the confidence that the land would not be acquired.
 
 
 
Q: So Tan Geok Tee placed more reliance on your assurance that the land would not be acquired than on Lee & Lee`s letter of 12 February 1973 PB(1)42 and PB(4)14 warning of likely acquisition?
 
 
 
A: I disagree. I did not guarantee that the land would not be acquired. I only told him the land would not be acquired. When he suggested going into a joint venture with me on the 5 acres he was testing me.
 
 
 
The letter dated 12 February 1973 from M/s Lee & Lee to CIP read as follows: 
 
Our preliminary search at the Registry of Deeds shows that there is registered against lot 21-26 (the largest lot) a notice: `Part approximate area 112 acres likely to be needed for Food Production vide Government Notification No 1954 dated 9 August 1952`. We are trying to obtain a copy of this government gazette notification and will let you know if we can get any further information on this.
 
 
 
Since the plaintiffs` claim is based on conspiracy to defraud on the part of the first, second and third defendants and breach of the Companies Act (Cap 50) s 157(1) and breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the first and third defendants, the case of 
 Sumitomo Bank Ltd v Kartika Ratna Thahir 
. In that case, Pertamina, an Indonesian state enterprise whose principal business was the exploration, processing and marketing of oil and natural gas in 1970 undertook, at the behest of the Indonesian government, a project for the construction of infrastructure facilities for the steel works called Krakatau Steel at Cilegon, West Java. In furtherance thereof, another state enterprise, `PTKS` was incorporated. However, Pertamina remained financially responsible for the project and in or about June 1973, took over effective management and control of it.
General Thahir was general assistant to the president director of Pertamina from 14 October 1968 until his death on 23 July 1976. During that period, General Thahir also held various other influential offices in Pertamina. From sometime in 1972, he was authorized to sign vouchers and cash demands for all contracts signed by the president director. At no time did General Thahir`s salary from the plaintiffs exceed Rupiahs 3,782,500 per annum, the equivalent of S$22,250, or US$9,000 per annum.
In 1973 and 1974, Pertamina and PTKS entered into several contracts for the construction of the facilities. Two of the contractors were Klockner Industrie Analagen GMBH (Klockner) and Siemens AG (Siemens). Pertamina alleged that the two German contractors paid General Thahir bribes to ensure better contractual terms than they would have obtained if they had to tender for the work and preferential treatment where payments were concerned, in view of the reducing resources of Pertamina in 1974 and 1975. It was also alleged that General Thahir deposited the proceeds into 19 ACU accounts at the Sumitomo Bank (Sumitomo) in Singapore in the name of `Mr HA Thahir and/or Mrs KR Thahir`. DM53,972,374.12 was held in 17 accounts; the remaining two accounts were denominated in US dollars in the sums of US$593,249.31 and US$608,959.42.
Following the death of General Thahir, three different parties claimed to be entitled to the proceeds of the 19 ACU deposits and Sumitomo applied for interpleader relief under O 17 r 1(1)(a) of the Rules of Supreme Court 1970. The first party was Mrs Kartika Thahir (Mrs KR Thahir), who claimed to be the lawful widow of General Thahir and beneficially entitled to the 19 ACU deposit accounts; the second was the estate of the deceased which was represented by sons of an earlier marriage; and the third was Pertamina, who claimed the deposits on the ground that the moneys were bribes received by General Thahir whilst in their employ from contractors of or who were paid by Pertamina for projects of which Pertamina were in charge.
In allowing a substantial part of Pertamina`s claim, Lai Kew Chai J said at p 776: 
 
The legal and evidential burden of proof that Pertamina paid Siemens and Klockner rests on Pertamina, as Pertamina accept. However, the question whether Pertamina have discharged both the legal and evidential burden in respect of each of Pertamina`s alleged payments to Siemens and Klockner are very much in controversy. It is submitted on behalf of Mrs Kartika that a part of Pertamina`s allegations involve allegations of a fraudulent or criminal nature and that as a matter of the law of evidence it is necessary for Pertamina to prove their case to a high standard, which is higher than the standard in a non-fraud case: see 
 Hornal v Neuberger Products
 [1957] 1 QBD 247, [1956] 3 All ER 970, 
[1956] 3 WLR 1034
; 
 Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij NV (Nederlands Trading Society) v Koh Kim Guan
 
 
 [1959] MLJ 173 
, where Rose CJ said at p 175: `Whatever the precise formula adopted and whatever the theoretical position may be, it has long been the practice in countries where the English system of law operates for the courts, in civil cases, to require a high standard of proof in cases where fraud is alleged;` and 
 Tan Chye Chew & Anor v Eastern Mining and Metals Co Ltd
 
 
 
[1965] 1 MLJ 201
 . However it should be noted that it is not the law of evidence that every step in the allegation of fraud has to be proved by calling live and admissible evidence nor is it the law that fraud cannot be inferred in the appropriate case. In 
 Tan Chye Chew
, for instance, the court was not dealing with the standard of proof and it seems to me clear from a reading of that case that it is no authority for the proposition, which appears to be suggested on behalf of Mrs Kartika Thahir, that fraud cannot be inferred. This is not to say that inferences of this serious nature should be lightly made. The circumstantial evidence must be so compelling and convincing that, bearing in mind the high standard of proof, one is nevertheless satisfied that an inference of fraud is justified. It will therefore be necessary to consider the evidence, if any.
 
 
 
On the evidence adduced, I am unable to find any evidence from which inference may be drawn of conspiracy to defraud or breach of duty on the part of the third defendant. Accordingly, the plaintiffs` claim against him is dismissed with costs.
As against the first and second defendants, if the four side agreements were as open as they were contended to be, there was no reason for these agreements to be in the names of their wife and daughter as their nominees respectively when the same were to be signed on their behalf by the first and second defendants. In the case of Collin Tan she did not even know of these side transactions.
The subject matter of the sub-sale agreement described as `approximate area of 5 acres` in the schedule and as `[plusmn]5 acres` in the annexed plan had no legal access. In such case, it had no prospect of being a subdivided lot and therefore could not be conveyed. Nevertheless, the first defendant, although he was a purchaser under the sub-sale agreement undertook to obtain subdivision, an obligation normally undertaken by the vendor. But he did not submit any application for excision of the [plusmn]5 acres. He just waited and it was eventually left unacquired whilst the surrounding land was compulsorily acquired, leaving it with an area of 4.2 acres. This is close enough to the description of [plusmn]5 acres. It seems obvious that the area of the sub-sold land was not described more precisely because the exact area of that part of lot 21-26 to be acquired was not known at the time. But the impending acquisition must have been known to the first defendant and, through him, the second defendant, and did in fact factor in their minds otherwise the exact area to be sold would have been demarcated and ascertained by a private survey followed by an application for subdivision.
The fall-back agreement provided that if CIP failed under any circumstances to purchase the three lots under the main agreement, the sub-sale agreement would determine and become null and void and the sum of $50,000 paid by Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan would be forfeited. It is to be noted that the event aborting the sub-sale is the failure on the part of CIP to purchase the three lots under the main agreement. But, instead of a refund, the $50,000 was to be forfeited. This suggests that no payment of the purported consideration was intended. As it transpired, it was alleged in Suit 4149 of 1984 that Lim Siam Soi and Collin Tan `
 did not pay the price of $50,000 or any other price 
` for the sub-sold land. The first defendant disputed this. He said he paid up his share in cash. Before me, he said: 
 
Q: Did you tell your wife anything about the sub-purchase?
 
 
 
A: I told her about it.
 
 
 
Q: Why did you pay $25,000 in cash?
 
 
 
A: I could not get a bank draft.
 
 
 
Q: With the cash you get a bank draft very fast.
 
 
 
A: No. It would take a long time.
 
 
 
This explanation is difficult to accept. The first defendant could have paid by his own cheque.
Further, under the pre-incorporation agreement, the first defendant through his wife was to contribute only 20% of the development costs. But his share would be 45%. The first defendant was thus entitled to 25% of the development without payment. In addition, if need be the second defendant through Collin Tan was to finance the first defendant in respect of his contribution of the development costs.
There is also the admission by the first defendant that he had assured the second defendant that the [plusmn]5 acres would not be acquired. His explanation for his failure to apply for subdivision shows that he knew the surrounding land would be acquired or had procured the leaving out from acquisition of the [plusmn]5 acres: `Everything has been done to enable LTD to receive a fresh title to Lot 1606`.
On these facts, notwithstanding the high standard of proof required, the inference is sufficiently compelling for me to hold that the first defendant knew that the [plusmn]5 acres would not be acquired or could be left out of the acquisition of the surrounding land. Due to this, the value of the three lots sold to CIP was considerably more than the purchase price of $2.05m. The second defendant was privy to this knowledge and for this reason the second defendant agreed to the first defendant`s 45% share in the proposed development of the [plusmn]5 acres when his contribution was to be 20% only, plus financial assistance to pay for the 20% contribution.
The defendants, besides denying the allegation of conspiracy to defraud, also raised the issue of limitation. They relied on a note of discussion of 6 May 1980 on possible settlement between Lai Ying Hon, who was said to be representing LBS, and the first defendant. Lai Ying Hon was the secretary to LBS when LBS was the managing director of Singapore Finance Ltd. Paragraph 1 of this note made reference to the sub-sale transaction. It read: 
 
On Collin`s land Liu will agree to paying L`s [LBS`] side as shareholders of Hoe Huat [Hoe Huat Realty Pte Ltd, in which LBS had a two-third interest] two-thirds x 45% [first defendant`s share under the pre-incorporation agreement] x market price of Collin`s land ... .
 
 
 
The note went on to give the value of Collin`s land at $800,000.
It is said that from this note, at the latest by 6 May 1980 if not earlier, LBS who controlled the plaintiff company would have known of the sub-sale. The claim is therefore statute barred as more than six years had elapsed from the date of this note before this action was commenced. The defendants relied on s 22(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163) which reads: 
 
Subject as aforesaid, an action by a beneficiary to recover trust property or in respect of any breach of trust, not being an action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by any other provision of this Act, shall not be brought after the expiration of 6 years from the date on which the right of action accrued:
 
 
 
Provided that the right of action shall not be deemed to have accrued to any beneficiary entitled to a future interest in the trust property, until the interest fell into possession.
LBS denied having received a copy of this note. In any case s 22(2) is subject to s 22(1) which reads: 
 
No period of limitation prescribed by this Act shall apply to an action by a beneficiary under a trust, being an action - 
(a) in respect of any fraud or fraudulent breach of trust to which the trustee was a party or privy; or 
(b) to recover from the trustee trust property or the proceeds thereof in the possession of the trustee, or previously received by the trustee and converted to his use.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs` claim is that of a beneficiary against the first defendant as trustee and is for conspiracy to defraud. The claim is not based on the sub-sale of the [plusmn]5 acres of which the third defendant as the nominee of LBS was aware but on the knowledge on the part of the first defendant that the [plusmn]5 acres would not be acquired or could be left out of acquisition. Therefore the first defendant, as a director, and the second defendant, who was privy to such knowledge, should not profit thereby. This knowledge surfaced only in Suit No 4149 of 1984. Therefore, the claim is not statute barred.
Accordingly, I allow the plaintiffs` claim. The fourth defendants are directed to reconvey to the plaintiffs the land comprised in lot 1606, the plaintiffs are to refund to the fourth defendants the purchase price paid in respect thereof plus costs incurred in obtaining vacant possession and other improvements, if any, such costs to be ascertained by the registrar. I also award plaintiffs costs of this action against the first, second and fourth defendants.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This appeal arose from an action in libel instituted by the appellants against the respondents for damages in respect of a letter dated 29 July 1988 written by the first respondent to the Official Receiver as well as The Hongkong And Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd. The appellants` claim in the court below was dismissed by the learned trial judge.
 The facts
The appellants are a trust company incorporated in Singapore and undertake in the course of their business assignments as receivers and managers of companies or firms; they also undertake assignments as trustees of estates. The first, second and third respondents are the partners of a firm of advocates and solicitors practising in Malaysia under the name and style of `Wee Choo Keong & Fazir` (the firm). The fourth to the ninth respondents were at the material time clients of the firm.
On 26 August 1987, The Hongkong And Shanghai Banking Corp Ltd (the bank) appointed the appellants as receivers and managers of a company, Quality Oil Pte Ltd (Quality Oil), pursuant to the terms of a debenture and a further debenture dated 17 March 1983 and 29 June 1985 respectively executed by that company in favour of the bank. Subsequently, the company was wound up by an order of court on 4 December 1987, with the Official Receiver being appointed liquidator. The winding up of the company did not affect the appellants` role as receivers and managers and they continued with their task of realizing the assets of the company which then consisted principally of: (i) a leasehold property, and (ii) a lube oil recycling plant, miscellaneous equipment and furniture. All these assets were sold to Pioneer Refinery Pte Ltd (Pioneer) on 25 February 1988 for the following sums: $560,000 for the leasehold property and $1.24m for the plant, miscellaneous equipment and furniture.
On 29 July 1988, the firm sent a letter to the Official Receiver with a copy to the bank and also to their clients. The letter was written by the first respondent and stated as follows: 
 
Dear Sir
 
 
 
Quality Oil Pte Ltd, Singapore (In Receivership)
 
 
 
Lube Oil Recycling Plant on Plot A 7640
 
 
 
Mk 7 at No 10 Tuas Ave 13, Singapore
 
 
 
We act for Mr Chua Teng Chok, Mdm Lee Kheng Leong, Mr Lou Chi Tong, Mr Woo Yin Khee, Mr Vincent Khoo and Encik Abdul Wahab Abdul Aziz who are shareholders of a company called Concrete Engineering Products Sdn Bhd (CEPCO).
 
 
 
We are informed that CEPCO has a subsidiary company called Quality Oil (M) Sdn Bhd holding 1,739,300 shares in Quality Oil Pte Ltd, Singapore.
We have been informed by Price Waterhouse Intrust Limited that the abovecaptioned company is in liquidation and, therefore, you are taking charge of the same.
We are informed that the abovecaptioned company`s Lube Oil Recycling Plant on Plot A 7640 Mk 7 at No 10 Tuas Ave 13, Singapore, has been sold to Pioneer Refinery Pte Ltd (Pioneer) for less than $1m when the same was worth much more.
According to the registered particulars of Pioneer in the Registry of Companies and Businesses (Singapore), it transpired that out of these 700,001 paid-up share capital of $1.00 each, 699,999 shares are owned by Mdm Leong Oi Kwan, who is the wife of Mr Wong Kon Nam. For your easy reference, we enclose a photocopy of the search on the said company. You will note from your records that Mr Wong Kon Nam is the chairman of Quality Oil (M) Sdn Bhd, Malaysia, and Quality Oil Pte Ltd, Singapore, and the managing director of CEPCO.
It appears from the above that the purchase of the said plan by Pioneer was not in good faith and the personalities involved in the sale and purchase of the said property were tainted with conflict of interest, to say the least, for Pioneer appears on record to be a nominee company of Mr Wong Kon Nam.
Our clients instruct us to seek your opinion as to whether the sale and purchase of the said plant, under such circumstances, has violated the Singapore Companies Act. We are copying this letter to Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp, the debenture holder so as to keep them informed.
We look forward to hearing from you in due course. 
 
Yours faithfully,
 
 
 
The appellants were sent copies of the letter by both the Official Receiver and the bank. Subsequently, the appellants themselves also received a letter dated 2 August 1988 from the firm. This letter was expressed to be written on behalf of a company, Jurutera Konsultants (SEA) Sdn Bhd (Jurutera), a creditor of Quality Oil, although it contained the same allegations as those set out in the letter dated 29 July 1988.
On 5 August 1988, the appellants wrote to the firm denying that there had been any bad faith or conflict of interest involved in the sale of the plant to Pioneer and demanding the publication of an apology. The firm responded by their letter dated 8 August 1988, the content of which was as follows: 
 
We refer to your letter of 5 August 1988 and are very surprised to learn that you are offended by our letter of 29 July 1988 to the Official Receiver, which was written in good faith.
 
 
 
We very much regret to note that you have misconstrued the contents of our said letter to mean that you have acted in bad faith and conflict of interest. If you were to read our said letter carefully, you will, no doubt, come to one conclusion, that is, fair comments made based on the facts stated in our said letter. You will also agree with us that it will not be unreasonable for our clients to arrive at that conclusion under the circumstances.
Please be assured that our letters of 29 July and 2 August 1988 were not intended to mean the way that you have interpreted it to be. Therefore, the apology demanded by you will not be necessary as the content of our said letters were fair comment made based on the available facts before our clients and us.
Please let us know the relevant details together with the exact purchase price of all the properties of Quality Oil Pte Ltd which was purchased by Pioneer Refinery Pte Ltd so as to enable us to advise our clients accordingly.
 Proceedings below
On the same day the appellants, through their solicitors, reiterated to the firm their demand for an apology. No apology being forthcoming, the appellants commenced proceedings against all the partners of the firm as well as their clients on whose behalf the letter was written. The appellants claimed damages for the libel contained in the letter dated 29 July 1988 (the letter). In their statement of claim, the appellants, having set out the entire letter, pleaded the following defamatory meaning the letter conveyed: 
 
5 In their natural and ordinary meaning, the said words [ie words in the letter] meant and were understood to mean that in so far as the receivership of Quality Oil Pte Ltd and/or the sale of Lube Oil Recycling Plant was concerned, the plaintiffs: 
(i) had acted in bad faith; and/or 
(ii) were guilty of a conspiracy; and/or 
(iii) were guilty of a professional and/or fiduciary conflict of interest; and/or 
(iv) violated the law of Singapore; and/or 
(v) were negligent; and/or 
(vi) had acted in a manner which justified and called for an investigation by the Official Receiver and/or the Hongkong & Shanghai Banking Corp.
 
 
 
6 By reason of the publication of the said words referred to in para 4 above, the plaintiffs have been gravely injured in their reputation in their profession and/or business.
 
 
 
In their defence, the respondents denied that the letter was meant and was understood to refer to the conduct of the appellants. They averred that the words complained of concerned the position of one Wong Kon Nam (Wong) in Quality Oil and Pioneer, and his role in the sale and purchase of the plant and equipment of Quality Oil; that if the words were of and concerning the appellants, the words did not bear and were not understood to bear or were not capable of bearing any of the meanings alleged by the appellants; and that if the words were of and concerning the appellants, they meant and were understood to mean that the appellants might have failed to recognize that the parties to the sale and purchase were not at arm`s length and consequently failed in their duty to make such proper and necessary enquiries to ensure that the selling price was the best possible price that could have been obtained in the open market. The respondents further averred that if the words were defamatory of the appellants, they were published on an occasion of qualified privilege, and that in the further alternative, that the words contained in paras 5 and 6 of the letter were fair comment made in good faith and without malice upon a matter of public interest. In their reply, the appellants joined issue with the respondents in their defence and went on to aver that the first, second and third respondents published the words complained of with actual malice.
From these pleadings there arose the following issues for trial:
 
 
(i) whether the words complained of were published of and concerning the appellants; 
 
(ii) whether the words were defamatory of the appellants as alleged or at all; 
 
(iii) whether the words were published on an occasion of qualified privilege; 
 
(iv) whether the words in paras 5 and 6 of the letter were fair comment made in good faith on a matter of public interest; and 
 
(v) whether the first three respondents were actuated by malice in publishing the letter to the Official Receiver and the bank.
  
 
 
Before the action came on for trial, on 3 April 1992, the appellants made an application for an order that the defence of the respondents be struck out and interlocutory judgment be entered for the appellants, on the ground that the respondents had failed or refused to give inspection of documents on 8 September 1989 and to make proper discovery pursuant to the directions of the High Court made on 2 August 1991. The application was allowed as against the second to the ninth respondents, and interlocutory judgment was entered against them. Subsequently, on application by the second to the fifth respondents, the interlocutory judgment was set aside as against them; however, surprisingly, no similar application was made by the sixth to the ninth respondents and the interlocutory judgment against them therefore remained in effect. When the action came on for hearing, these four defendants did not appear.
At the trial, the appellants called as witnesses Mrs Emily Wilfred, the then Assistant Official Receiver who was in charge of the liquidation of Quality Oil, and Chan Yik Kwan, the bank`s credit control manager who at all material times was in charge of the account of Quality Oil. Mrs Wilfred testified that when she first read the letter, she realized that it concerned the appellants` role in the sale of the plant to Pioneer. This, she explained, was because, at the material time, Quality Oil was in receivership and the appellants were the receivers and managers in charge of selling the plant. Mrs Wilfred admitted that she had `jumped to the conclusion` that the letter constituted a complaint against Quality Oil and that since there had been a sale of Quality Oil`s plant by the appellants, the matter involved the appellants as well. Mrs Wilfred proceeded to emphasize that although the main complaint might have been against Wong, as the Assistant Official Receiver, she was essentially concerned about whether the appellants, as receivers and managers, had exercised due care in the sale of Quality Oil`s assets. She understood that the `conflict of interest` referred to the fact that Wong`s wife held 699,999 shares out of the 700,001 shares in Pioneer and that Wong was chairman of Quality Oil, and that all the assets of the latter were purchased by Pioneer.
Chan Yik Kwan (Chan) testified that upon reading the letter, he too assumed that the reference to `the personalities involved in the sale and purchase` of the plant was to the appellants as well as Wong. He understood the letter to mean that the appellants as receivers and managers had not done a proper job, in that they had sold assets below market value and that they had in some way conspired with the purchasers of those assets. In consequence he had asked the appellants` managing director, Hong Pian Tee, to deal with the allegations made in the letter.
The first respondent was the only witness for the defence. His evidence was that the letter was directed at Wong`s conduct only; that he did not intend to call into question the appellants` conduct; that his clients suspected that there was a conflict of interests on the part of Wong having regard to the role he played; and that he forwarded the letter to the Official Receiver as well as the bank on the instructions of his clients. He admitted that he had dealt only with one Eddie Lee who acted as his clients` representative and who, coincidentally, was the managing director of Jurutera. It was in fact Eddie Lee who had informed him that Wong had been `wheeling and dealing` in the affairs of Quality Oil and Quality Oil Sdn Bhd. Wong, on 20 August 1987, presented a report on Quality Oil to Concrete Engineering Products Sdn Bhd and Quality Oil Sdn Bhd to the effect that Quality Oil was having financial problems and yet Wong through his wife had purchased the plant of Quality Oil. His clients had told him that the plant had been sold for less than $1 million and he had no reason to doubt their word, and hence he did not verify their information.
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial judge dismissed the appellants` claim with costs and also set aside the interlocutory judgment entered against the sixth to the ninth respondents. She held that the appellants had failed to prove that the words complained of referred to the appellants. In her opinion, the evidence given by witnesses called by the appellants could not be accepted for the purpose of showing that the letter referred to the appellants. She said: 
 
As the plaintiffs` case is that in their natural and ordinary meaning the words in para 6 of the letter refer to them, the question is whether an ordinary reader reading the letter and that paragraph would reasonably come to that conclusion. No evidence is admissible of their meaning on the sense in which they were understood or of facts giving rise to any inferences to be drawn from the words used: 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander
 (8th Ed). Further, the ordinary reader must have rational grounds for his belief that the words refer to the plaintiffs. In considering this question, para 6 cannot be looked at in isolation but must be read in context. An ordinary reader would note that the other paragraphs do not refer specifically to the plaintiffs. Indeed, a reading of the preceding para 5 would negative that possibility. I cannot therefore agree with the plaintiffs` contention that their conduct was the subject of the defendants` complaint as Wong and his wife were the persons identified in para 5 of the letter and the main thrust of the complaint, namely, the conflict of interest issue was directed at them and not at the plaintiffs. This is clear from the concluding words in para 6: `... 
 for Pioneer appears on record to be a nominee company of Mr Wong Hon Nam.
`
 
 
 
In the view of the learned trial judge, the appellants` complaint that the letter was defamatory of them was based mainly on the exception they took to the inclusion of the word `sale` in para 6 of the letter, for, as Quality Oil`s receivers and managers, they were the ones responsible for the sale of its assets. The trial judge, however, held that even assuming that the appellants were the party referred to obliquely by the word `sale`, she did not accept that the words in the letter were defamatory of them in any of the senses particularized in their statement of claim. The reaction of Mrs Wilfred and Chan was irrelevant and consequently their views of the sense in which the words were in fact understood by them had to be disregarded. She did not, however, proceed further to determine whether the words complained of were defamatory of the appellants in any other sense.
 The present appeal
Against her decision, this appeal has been brought. Before us, the same issues have been raised as were raised below.
 First issue: identification of the appellants
The first issue is one of identification of the appellants in the letter. Although in para 3 of the letter it was stated that the respondents had been informed by the appellants that Quality Oil was in liquidation and that the Official Receiver was in charge of the matter, the actual words complained of which appeared in the subsequent paragraphs of the letter made no express or specific reference to the appellants. It is settled law that in these circumstances it is for the appellants - the plaintiffs in the action - to prove that the words complained of were published of and concerning them, and if they fail to do so they have no cause of action. In 
 Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd 
, the plaintiff complained that a newspaper article, which made no specific reference to him, was defamatory of him. At the trial, four witnesses, who were acquainted with the plaintiff, were called and they testified that the article referred to the plaintiff. The trial judge held that the words of libel referred to the plaintiff and awarded him damages. On appeal, the Court of Appeal held that the words could not be regarded as referring to him and set aside the judgment. On appeal by the plaintiff, the House of Lords dismissed it. It was held that the defamatory article referred to a group or a body of persons and could not be understood to refer to the plaintiff. Viscount Simon LC in his speech said, at pp 118-119: 
 
My Lords, it is an essential element of the cause of action for defamation that the words complained of should be published `of the plaintiff.` If the words are not so published, the plaintiff is not defamed and cannot have any right to ask that the defendant should be held responsible to him in respect of them.
 
 
 
In the words complained of in this case there is no specific mention of the appellant from beginning to end, and the only countries in which it is stated that this group of 
 emigrÃ©s 
 is established are France and the United States.
These facts, standing alone, however, do not justify the conclusion that the words complained of are capable of being read as a defamation of the appellant. The words make allegations of a defamatory character about a body of persons - some thousands in number - who belong to a society whose members are to be found in many countries.
His Lordship then went on to lay down the test to be applied in determining whether the words complained of referred to the plaintiff. He said, at p 119: 
 
Where the plaintiff is not named, the test which decides whether the words used refer to him is the question whether the words are such as would reasonably lead persons acquainted with the plaintiff to believe that he was the person referred to.
 
 
 
He then referred to various authorities and came to the following conclusion, at p 121: 
 
In the present case the statement complained of is not made concerning a particular individual, whether named or unnamed, but concerning a group of people spread over several countries and including considerable numbers. No facts were proved in evidence which could identify the appellant as the person individually referred to. Witnesses called for the appellant were asked the carefully framed question: `To whom did your mind go when you read that article?` and they not unnaturally replied by pointing to the appellant himself, but that is because they happened to know the appellant as the leading member of the society in this country and not because there is anything in the article itself which ought to suggest even to his friends that he is referred to as an individual.
 
 
 
In the case at hand, the letter was not published to the public at large. It was published to the Official Receiver and the bank, and they each had knowledge of the following facts, namely, (i) that at the material time, Quality Oil was in receivership and the appellants were the managers and receivers, (ii) while the company was in receivership its entire assets were sold to Pioneer, and (iii) that the appellants, as receivers and managers, were the persons who had negotiated, concluded and completed the sale. Accordingly, the evidence of Mrs Wilfred and Chan was not irrelevant. They were the persons who had knowledge of the relevant facts, and both of them on reading the letter found that the letter referred to the appellants. True it is that both Mrs Wilfred and Chan might have overreacted on the inference they each drew from the content of the letter; in particular Mrs Wilfred said she `jumped to the conclusion` that the letter referred to the appellants as well as Wong. That, in our view, was not an unreasonable or unnatural reaction on the ground that she was aware of the relevant facts at the time. It all depends on the way they read the letter. In this connection, we find extremely apt the following extract from the speech of Lord Reid in 
 Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd 
 at p 1246: 
 
... in the end, it all depends on the way in which one is required to assume that a sensible reader will react on reading this kind of article in a daily newspaper. If one must assume that he thinks and acts cautiously as a lawyer would do in his professional capacity then I have no doubt that he would say that that inference is not justified in this case. But if one is entitled to be more realistic and take account of the way in which ordinary sensible people do in fact read their newspapers and draw inferences then equally I have no doubt such people would quite probably draw this inference.
 
 
 
In our opinion, having regard to the positions Mrs Wilfred and Chan occupied respectively and their knowledge of the relevant facts it cannot be said that the view each of them took of the letter was one which no reasonable reader equipped with the knowledge of those facts would come to.
In 
 Morgan v Odhams Press Ltd 
, there was a publication of a defamatory article without any specific reference to the plaintiff. However, six witnesses who were acquainted with the relevant circumstances were called and they testified that on reading the offending article, they understood the article to refer to the plaintiff. It was held by the House of Lords, inter alia, that the trial judge was right in referring to the jury the question whether, on the evidence, the article was capable of referring to the plaintiffs. Lord Reid in his speech said, at p 1246: 
 
What has to be decided is whether it would have been unreasonable for a hypothetical sensible reader who knew the special facts proved to infer that this article referred to the appellant.
 
 
 
Similarly, Lord Pearson in his speech said, at p 1270: 
 
I think it is right to say that, in order to be defamatory 
 of the plaintiff
, the article must contain something which, to the mind of a reader with knowledge of the relevant circumstances, contains defamatory imputations and points to the plaintiff as the person defamed.
 
 
 
Reverting to the case at hand, it is true that the test to apply is an objective one, as the trial judge has held, and that is whether an ordinary sensible person reading the letter would reasonably come to the conclusion that the letter referred to the appellants. But it must be an ordinary sensible person who at the time was aware of the relevant circumstances or the special facts of which Mrs Wilfred and Chan were aware. It seems to us that such a person being aware of those facts on reading the letter would reasonably come to the conclusion that the words complained of referred to the appellants. It is true that they referred to other persons as well, namely, Wong and his wife, Madam Leong Oi Kwan. That is immaterial; the words complained of need not refer exclusively to the appellants. In 
 Knupffer v London Express Newspaper Ltd 
, Lord Atkin said, at p 121: 
 
The only relevant rule is that, in order to be actionable, the defamatory words must be understood to be published of and concerning the plaintiff. It is irrelevant that the words are published of two or more persons if they are proved to be published of him ... .
 
 
 
 
 Second issue: whether the letter was defamatory of the appellants
 
The next issue is whether the words complained of were defamatory of the appellants. Here again, it is necessary to bear in mind the circumstances in which the letter was written. It was written to the Official Receiver with a copy to the bank. It complained of the sale of certain assets of Quality Oil to an interested party at a value less than what they were worth and suggested an absence of good faith in the sale and purchase of those assets and the involvement of personalities `tainted with conflict of interest`. Here again, the proper test to be applied is what an ordinary sensible reader being aware of those facts, ie the facts of which the Official Receiver and the bank had knowledge, would understand to be the natural and ordinary meaning of the letter. Such a meaning is not confined to a strict and literal meaning of the words used in the letter but also the inferences that could reasonably be drawn by such reader. Lord Reid in 
 Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd 
, at p 258, said: 
 
The ordinary man does not live in an ivory tower and he is not inhibited by a knowledge of the rules of construction. So he can and does read between the lines in the light of his general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs. ...
 
 
 
What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning.
The reader, ie one who was aware of the relevant facts and circumstances, would understand from the letter that the appellants had sold the Lube oil recycling plant of Quality Oil to Pioneer at an undervalue; that Pioneer was a nominee company of Wong who was at the material time the chairman of Pioneer and of Quality Oil; that there was a conflict of interests involved in the transaction and the sale was not made in good faith; and finally that there was a question whether the sale was in breach of the Companies Act (Cap 50). The inferences that the reader would draw were that the appellants, who were the persons responsible for the sale, had entered into a very questionable transaction; that their conduct in the sale was not quite above board, and that they had not properly discharged their duty as receivers and managers in the sale of the assets of Quality Oil. There was clearly an imputation of a lack of professional standards and integrity on the part of the appellants in carrying out their duties as receivers in the realization of the assets of Quality Oil. In our opinion, such an imputation was clearly defamatory of the appellants.
 Third issue: fair comment
We now turn to the defences raised by the respondents. We propose to deal first with the defence of fair comment, as it can be disposed of briefly. There is an insurmountable difficulty in the way of this defence. An essential requirement which the respondents must satisfy in this defence is that the facts on which the comment was made must be truly stated: 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies & Ors 
 at p 407. Reverting to the letter, we find that para 4 thereof stated that Quality Oil`s Lube oil recycling plant was `sold to Pioneer Refinery Pte Ltd (Pioneer) for less than $1m when the same was worth much more.` This was one of the essential statements of facts on which were pivoted the allegations of absence of `good faith` in the sale of the plant and the involvement of personalities `tainted with conflict of interest`. This fact as stated was not true. The plant (which in the context of the letter must include the miscellaneous equipment) and the furniture were sold for $1.24 million. The respondents themselves conceded before us that the plant had been sold for more than $1 million. Indeed, the combined sale price of the leasehold property, the plant and furniture came to some $1.8 million. The first respondent had stated or suggested a wrong or incorrect basic fact and had then gone on to comment on the question of lack of good faith in the sale and interested parties being involved in the sale. In 
 JB Jeyaretnam v Goh Chok Tong 
 at p 3, Lord Ackner said: 
 
It is of course well established that a writer may not suggest or invent facts and then comment upon them, on the assumption that they are true. If the facts upon which the comment purports to be made do not exist, the defence of fair comment must fail. The commentator must get his basic facts right.
 
 
 
His Lordship then quoted the following passage of the judgment of Lord Denning MR in 
 London Artists Ltd v Littler 
 at pp 418-419: 
 
The basic facts are those which go to the pith and substance of the matter: see 
 Cunningham-Howie v Dimbleby
 
[1951] 1 KB 360
, at p 364. They are the facts on which the comments are based or from which the inferences are drawn - as distinct from the comments or inferences themselves. The commentator need not set out in his original article all the basic facts: see 
 Kemsley v Foot
 
[1952] AC 345
; but he must get them right and be ready to prove them to be true.
 
 
 
In this case, the respondents had not got their basic facts right in the letter, nor had they proved them to be true. In the result, the defence of fair comment fails.
 The fourth issue: qualified privilege
The defence of qualified privilege in this case turns essentially on the question whether the fourth to the ninth respondents had any interest in the affairs of Quality Oil, such that the occasion in which the letter was written was privileged. They had no direct interest in that company: they were not directors, nor were they shareholders. But, they were shareholders of a company called Concrete Engineering Products Sdn Bhd (CEPCO) which through its subsidiary, Quality Oil Sdn Bhd, held 1,739,500 shares in Quality Oil. In that sense, they had an interest, albeit an indirect interest, in Quality Oil and thus in the disposal of the assets of that company by the appellants as receivers and managers. Their interest might not be very substantial, but it was by no means so minuscule as the appellants sought to make it out. In any case, it is not the law that for an occasion to be privileged the interest in question must be substantial. The Official Receiver and the bank each also had an interest in the affairs of Quality Oil and in particular in the disposal of its assets by the appellants as receivers and managers. Accordingly, the letter was written on behalf of the fourth to the ninth respondents for the protection or in furtherance of their interest and communicated to the Official Receiver and the bank information in which both of them had an interest in receiving it. There was therefore a reciprocity of interest which was essential to found the privilege. In 
 Howe & Anor v Lees 
 (a decision of the High Court of Australia on the question of qualified privilege), Griffith CJ said, at p 369: 
 
With regard to the privilege founded upon what is called interest, it is contended that the person who makes the communication and the person to whom it is made must have a common interest. `Community of interest` is, I think, a more accurate term. ...
 
 
 
The term `community of interest` does not connote a joint pecuniary interest in property. Any legitimate object for the exercise of human faculties pursued by several persons in association with one another may be sufficient to establish community of interest. Again, `interest` does not mean an interest in the particular subject matter as to which the communication is made, but an interest in knowing the fact communicated, in other words, an interest in the subject matter to which the communication is relevant ... .
In 
 Harrison v Bush 
 at p 348 [p 512 in ER], Lord Campbell CJ stated: 
 
A communication made bona fide upon any subject matter in which the party communicating has an interest or in reference to which he has a duty, is privileged, if made to a person having a corresponding interest or duty, although it contain a criminatory matter, which, without this privilege, would be slanderous and actionable ... .
 
 
 
Similar pronouncement was made by Lord Esher MR in 
 Hunt v Great Northern Railway Co 
 at p 191: 
 
The occasion [ie the privileged occasion] had arisen if the communication was of such a nature that it could be fairly said that those who made it had an interest in making such a communication, and those to whom it was made had a corresponding interest in having it made to them. When those two things coexist, the occasion is a privileged one, and the question whether it was or was not misused is an entirely different one.
 
 
 
A more authoritative statement on the same issue came from Lord Atkinson in the celebrated case of 
 Adam v Ward 
 at p 334: 
 
... a privileged occasion is, in reference to qualified privilege, an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest or a duty, legal, social, or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential.
 
 
 
In our judgment, the letter was written on an occasion which was privileged, and the defence of qualified privilege is therefore available to the fourth to the ninth respondents.
It is not in dispute that the first respondent wrote the letter on behalf of the fourth to the ninth respondents: he wrote it as their solicitors. The second and the third defendants were partners of the first respondent in their practice as advocates and solicitors. The second and third respondents, as his partners, were accordingly bound in all respects by what the first respondent wrote. The first, second and third respondents therefore stand in the same position with regard to privilege as that of the fourth to the ninth respondents. Thus, the defence of qualified privilege is also available to the first three respondents: they stand or fall with the fourth to the ninth respondents on this issue.
In 
 Baker v Carrick 
, a solicitor acting for his client, wrote to an auctioneer not to part with the proceeds of sale of certain goods entrusted to him as the owner of the goods had committed an act of bankruptcy. In an action by the owner against the solicitor for libel, it was held that the occasion was privileged, since the solicitor wrote the letter on behalf of his clients and the occasion would have been privileged had the letter been written by the clients themselves. Lord Esher MR said, at p 841: 
 
... if the occasion was one to which privilege would have attached had the clients themselves done that which the defendant did, it is also privileged in the case of a solicitor acting for his clients.
 
 
 
Lopes LJ dealt with the issue more comprehensively as follows, at p 841: 
 
Looking at the decision in 
 Blackham v Pugh
 2 CB 611; 15 LJ (CP) 290, it is clear that if the statements in the alleged libel had been made by the clients the occasion would have been privileged, and the question arises whether the privilege attaches where the solicitor is sued in respect of statements made by him on behalf of his client. It is the duty of a solicitor to do all that he can to protect the interests of his client, and in my opinion he stands in the same position with regard to privilege as that in which his client would stand in the case of a similar action against him.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellants contended that the first respondent`s testimony had defeated any attempt by him to rely on the defence of qualified privilege. This contention was premised on the fact that the first respondent stated in his testimony that his instructions from the fourth to the ninth respondents were given to him through one Eddie Lee, and that these instructions were to call into question Wong`s `wheeling and dealing` in the purchase of Quality Oil`s plant. According to counsel, this meant that in introducing the allegation of sale of Quality Oil`s assets at an undervalue by the appellants, the first respondent was acting outside the ambit of the instructions given to him and therefore he could not claim to be acting in the discharge of his duty as solicitor to them. We are unable to accept this contention. In our view, the evidence relied upon by counsel was somewhat ambiguous. Our examination of the evidence of the first respondent revealed that the letter was written by him on instructions from his clients. On the totality of the evidence, it is tolerably clear to us that the allegation of sale of the oil recycling plant at an undervalue, in fact, emanated from the fourth to the ninth respondents` instructions to the first respondent through Eddie Lee.
In our judgment, the defence of qualified privilege succeeds.
 Malice
We now turn to the last issue: whether the defence of qualified privilege is defeated by any express malice on the part of the respondents or any of them. The appellants in their reply pleaded in para 4 as follows: 
 
4 The first, second and third defendants published the words set out in para 4 of the statement of claim with actual malice.
 
 
 
It was not, however, pleaded that the fourth to the ninth respondents were also actuated by malice. Hence, the only question is whether in writing the offending letter, the first respondent was actuated by malice. We need not be concerned additionally with the question whether the fourth to the ninth defendants in instructing the first respondent to write the letter were actuated by malice. The burden of proving malice is on the appellants. Malice in defamation means `any ill-will, spite or some wrong or improper motive`.
The issue of malice was discussed at length by Lord Diplock in his speech in 
 Horrocks v Lowe 
. His Lordship first discussed the concept of malice and the onus of proof. He said, at pp 149-150: 
 
So, the motive with which the defendant on a privileged occasion made a statement defamatory of the plaintiff becomes crucial. The protection might, however, be illusory if the onus lay on him to prove that he was actuated solely by a sense of the relevant duty or a desire to protect the relevant interest. So he is entitled to be protected by the privilege unless some other dominant and improper motive on his part is proved. `Express malice` is the term of art descriptive of such a motive. Broadly speaking, it means malice in the popular sense of a desire to injure the person who is defamed and this is generally the motive which the plaintiff sets out to prove. But to destroy the privilege the desire to injure must be the dominant motive for the defamatory publication; knowledge that it will have that effect is not enough if the defendant is nevertheless acting in accordance with a sense of duty or in bona fide protection of his own legitimate interests.
 
 
 
The motive with which a person published a defamatory matter can only be inferred from what he did or said or knew. If it be proved that he did not believe that what he published was true this is generally conclusive evidence of express malice, for no sense of duty or desire to protect his own legitimate interests can justify a man in telling deliberate and injurious falsehoods about another, save in the exceptional case where a person may be under a duty to pass on, without endorsing, defamatory reports made by some other person.
His Lordship next turned to the basis on which a defamer may be said to believe in the truth of the defamatory statement. He said at p 150: 
 
Apart from those exceptional cases, what is required on the part of the defamer to entitle him to the protection of the privilege is positive belief in the truth of what he published or, as it is generally though tautologously termed, `honest belief`. If he publishes untrue defamatory matter recklessly, without considering or caring whether it be true or not, he is in this, as in other branches of the law, treated as if he knew it to be false. But indifference to the truth of what he publishes is not to be equated with carelessness, impulsiveness or irrationality in arriving at a positive belief that it is true. The freedom of speech protected by the law of qualified privilege may be availed by all sorts and conditions of men. In affording them immunity from suit if they have acted in good faith in compliance with a legal or moral duty or in protection of a legitimate interest the law must take them as it finds them. In ordinary life it is rare indeed for people to form their beliefs by a process of logical deduction from facts ascertained by a rigorous search for all available evidence and a judicious assessment of its probative value. In greater or in less degree according to their temperaments, their training, their intelligence, they are swayed by prejudice, rely on intuition instead of reasoning, leap to conclusions on inadequate evidence and fail to recognize the cogency of material which might cast doubt on the validity of the conclusions they reach. But despite the imperfections of the mental process by which the belief is arrived at it may still be `honest`, that is, a positive belief that the conclusions they have reached are true. The law demands no more.
 
 
 
We now turn to the evidence before us. The letter itself did not show the presence of any malice against the appellants. From the content of the letter, it is quite clear to us that the letter was directed at Wong rather than the appellants. The first respondent said so in his testimony. Our view is reinforced by the respondents` reply to the appellants dated 8 August 1988. Although the respondents refused to give an apology as demanded by the appellants, they assured the latter that their `letters of 29 July and of 2 August 1988 were not intended to mean` the way interpreted by the appellants.
The first respondent maintained that he believed his clients when their representative, Eddie Lee, told him that the sale price of the plant was below $1m. Counsel for the appellants argued that the first respondent should have been more `prudent` and made specific enquiries of his own to verify the sale price. There are two difficulties in the way of accepting this argument. First, a failure to obtain independent verification of the sale price could not amount to evidence of any malice on the part of the first respondent, for, as Lord Diplock said, whilst such failure might suggest a certain amount of carelessness or imprudence, it did not in itself demonstrate a lack of honest belief by the first respondent in the information acquired from his clients. Nor should any inference of malice be drawn. Lord Diplock said at p 150: 
 
Judges and juries should, however, be very slow to draw the inference that a defendant was so far actuated by improper motives as to deprive him of the protection of the privilege unless they are satisfied that he did not believe that what he said or wrote was true or that he was indifferent to its truth or falsity. The motives with which human beings act are mixed.
 
 
 
Secondly, we do not see how the first respondent or his clients could possibly verify the true price at which the oil recycling plant of Quality Oil was sold by the appellants. The sale was made by the appellants by private treaty. It seems hardly likely that the first respondent or his clients could have obtained the information from the appellants. It is true that the first respondent did not make specific enquiry with the appellants as to the sale price of the plant. Although he wrote no less than three letters to the appellants, in each case he wrote on behalf of Jurutera, a creditor of Quality Oil, and sought a meeting with the appellants `to discuss and settle` the matter. He did not seek or ask for information relating to the sale of the assets of Quality Oil. After the third letter, the appellants replied stating that they would not deal with `unsecured creditors`. Even if the first respondent had written on behalf of the fourth to the ninth respondents, it is extremely likely that the appellants would reply in similar vein; indeed, they would probably say that the fourth to the ninth respondents were not entitled to the information.
The appellants also relied on a report on Quality Oil dated 20 August 1987. It was urged on us that at the time the first respondent wrote the letter, he had the report with him, and that he should have checked and examined the report before writing the letter, and that if he had checked it, he would not have written that letter in the way he did. In writing the letter in that way, it showed that the first respondent had not really checked the accuracy of what he wrote and from this it could be inferred that he was reckless in writing the letter, without caring whether it be true or false. We find it difficult to accept this argument. The material part of the report was as follows: 
 
Revaluation of property
 
 
 
7.1 A revaluation of the assets of the company was carried out in July 1987 and the market and forced sale values were given as follows: 
7.1.1 Market value $2,426,000 
7.1.2 Forced sale value $1,706,000
 
 
 
The report was clearly unhelpful in this respect and could not constitute sufficient evidence on which the first respondent could have reasonably concluded that the oil recycling plant could not have been sold for less than $1m.
In our judgment, the appellants have not succeeded in proving that the first respondent was actuated by malice in writing the letter. As for the second and the third respondents, their only involvement was that they were partners of the first respondent and were bound by the letter he wrote. Equally, there was no malice on their part.
 Conclusion
In the result, the claim of the appellants fails, and the appeal is dismissed.
Before we conclude, there is one matter on which we need to say a word. As we have related, before the case came on for trial, interlocutory judgment was entered against all the respondents except the first respondent. Subsequently, on application by the second to the fifth respondents, the interlocutory judgment was set aside. However, no application was made by the sixth to the ninth respondents and consequently the interlocutory judgment against them remained in effect and these respondents did not appear at the trial. In dismissing the claim of the appellants, the trial judge set aside the interlocutory judgment against the sixth to the ninth respondents. Presumably, she did so on the ground that these respondents would stand or fall with the fourth and fifth respondents, and as the claim against the fourth and fifth defendants had been dismissed, the interlocutory judgment could not stand and remain in effect. This seems a common sense approach to take, although we entertain some doubt as to whether she should have done it in the circumstances. Before us, no serious argument has been advanced on this point, and in the circumstances and having regard to what we have decided, we are not disposed to disturb the order made by the trial judge.
We now come to the question of costs. The respondents have not succeeded on all the issues before us; in fact they succeeded only on two issues. In the circumstances, they should not be entitled to the whole of the costs here and below. We therefore make an order as follows. First, no costs here and below are to be awarded to the sixth to the ninth respondents, having regard to what had transpired below. Secondly, only one-third of the costs here and below is to be awarded to the first to the fifth respondents. Finally, only two sets of such costs are to be allowed: one to the first, second and third respondents, and the other to the fourth and the fifth respondents. To the extent of the order we have made as to costs, the judgment below is varied. There will be the usual consequential order for payment to the respondents or their solicitors to account of costs the deposit in court as security for costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 17 November 1987 a news item appeared on the front page of the 
 Business Times 
 (BT) entitled `OCBC plans to recruit four top-ranking bankers.` BT is an English daily newspaper which is widely read by the business community in Singapore. The item was written by Mr Alvin Tay (Tay), its banking correspondent. The pertinent portions of that article for our present action are the following: 
 
The Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation is eyeing four top-ranking bankers, including former central banker Mrs Elizabeth Sam, in what promises to be the biggest recruitment drive of high calibre staff in the bank`s history.
 
 
 
Besides Mrs Sam, the other names reported to be on OCBC`s `wanted list` are Mr Ng Tat Pun, Mr Lai Teck Poh and Mr Goh Chee Hiong. Mr Ng is the general manager of the International Bank of Singapore. Mr Lai is the managing director of Citicorp Investment Bank (Singapore) while Mr Goh is a former general manager (credit and marketing division) of United Overseas Bank. He now operates his own business.
Official confirmation from OCBC was not available yesterday but BT understands that Mr Ng is receptive to the bank`s offer. The status of the other individuals is not clear.
Assuming all four decide to join OCBC, they are likely to do so around the same time - possibly at the beginning of next year.
... Sources said if Mrs Sam accepts an offer from OCBC, she is likely to take charge of OCBC`s investment banking department.
... Banking sources speculate that Mr Lai is the leading candidate to take over as head of the corporate banking department, a job vacated by Mrs Theresa Foo earlier this month. She left to join Standard Chartered as its corporate banking manager.
On 23 November 1987, BT published a feature article entitled `Tracking down the best head for the job` written by one Tong Suit Chee, which was first published in the November 1987 issue of the journal 
 Singapore Business 
. The article dealt with the services rendered by executive search consultants, who are colloquially called `headhunters`.
The first defendant, Mr Norman Wright (Wright), is a senior executive with the third defendants, who are executive search consultants. Wright first read Tong`s article in 
 Singapore Business 
. On 19 November 1987, he wrote a letter commenting on the article to the editor of the journal. By the time Tong`s article appeared again in BThe realized that his letter to 
 Singapore Business 
 might probably not be published as he thought it did not have a readers` column. So he decided to write to BTthe very day in response to the publication of Tong`s article in BT. The letter was published in the weekend issue of BT of 28-29 November 1987. It was written on the letterhead of Egon Zehnder International South East Asia, the second defendant. It was a fairly long letter, more than three-quarters of which were comments of Wright on Tong`s article. Nothing in those portions are relevant to this action. However, the last three paragraphs thereof are the subject of this action which OCBC complains contain a libel by Wright. The paragraphs read: 
 
A case of how not to go about attracting top executives was demonstrated in the front page article which appeared in your November 17 issue regarding OCBC`s reported plans to hire four, named, senior banking officials. Professional executive search firms would recoil in horror at such publicity.
 
 
 
Your reporter has met his professional duty to `find and report the news`, but there is a prima facie case of rank amateurism or carelessness at OCBC to have allowed such a breach of confidentiality to happen. I doubt that a professional executive search firm would have been involved.
It shows clearly how difficult it is for an organization to maintain confidentiality when it conducts its own search. The leakage is potentially damaging to those named, at the very least embarrassing, and the effect on the morale of their present staff and, indeed, on that of the staff at OCBC, must be unfortunate.
For ease of reference, I shall hereinafter refer to these paragraphs collectively as `the three paragraphs` or separately as para `A`, `B` or `C` respectively.
On the day this letter was published in BT, Mr David Cheam (Cheam), the vice-president in charge of public relations at OCBC, spoke to Tay to complain that the three paragraphs were offensive. Cheam followed up on that conversation with a letter, which stated, inter alia: 
 
You have confirmed that your source of information relating to your article ... dated 17 November 1987 was not obtained from OCBC ...
 
 
 
It would be appreciated if you could immediately look into this matter as promised and let us know what action 
 Business Times 
 intends to take to rectify this situation.
On 30 November 1987 the acting editor of BT, Ms Margaret Thomas, replied to Cheam confirming that Tay `did not get any information from (Cheam) when he spoke to (Cheam) about the matter the day before (Tay`s) article was published.` Ms Thomas referred to the fact that in the story itself it was clearly stated that official confirmation from OCBC was not available. Ms Thomas ended her letter by inviting OCBC to write a letter to refute Wright`s points, which BT would publish in the letters to the editor`s column which appeared every Saturday.
OCBC did not take up this offer and instead instructed its solicitors, M/s Shook Lin & Bok (SLB), to write to Wright and BTdemanding, among others, an apology be published `in as prominent a position as the letter complained of` and in a form approved by OCBC. The letters from SLB were issued on 3 December 1987 and Wright and BTwere each given until 12 noon on 5 December 1987 to respond. Wright received the letter on the day itself when he returned home from the office.
The next day, 4 December 1987, Wright through his solicitors, M/s Arthur Loke & Partners (ALP), responded to SLB stating that the comments in the letter could not constitute a libel upon OCBC and that those comments were fair and made without malice. ALP further stated that `no aspersions were cast on [OCBC`s] integrity or ability as bankers.`
On the same day, the solicitors of BT, M/s Drew & Napier, forwarded a draft apology to SLB which BTproposed be published in the weekend issue of 5-6 December 1987. OCBC found that draft inadequate and, through its solicitors, stated that it would be agreeable to abandoning its claim for compensation against BTif BTwould publish a revised draft apology, which SLB forwarded therewith. BTaccepted the revised draft and had it published in the letters column of the weekend issue BTof 5-6 December 1987. The apology reads: 
 
Unreserved apology
 
 
 
In the 28 November 1987 issue of the 
 Business Times
 we published a letter of Mr Norman Wright, managing partner of Egon Zehnder International South-East Asia, titled `Searching for Executives` and subtitled `Need to Maintain Confidentiality`.
 
 
 
 
 
 Business Times 
 
 is satisfied and accepts that the statements concerning the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd in the said letter were and are wholly unfounded. We know of no carelessness or failing on the part of Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd to have allowed any breach of confidentiality to happen and we accept that we know of no basis or foundation whatsoever for the statements.
 Business Times 
 is glad to take this earliest opportunity of expressing to the Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd its unreserved regrets for any distress, inconvenience or embarrassment caused to them by the said statements.
On 10 December 1987, ALP wrote on behalf of Wright to the editor of BTcomplaining that the apology constituted a libel on Wright. ALP sought information on whether the terms of the apology were provided by OCBC while reserving the rights of their client. On 21 December 1987, ALP sent a reminder to the editor of BTand asked the newspaper to publish an unreserved apology in terms to be approved by ALP and giving the newspaper until 4pm on 22 December 1987 to reply. However, on 19 December 1987, BTreplied to ALP (which letter crossed that of the ALP of 21 December 1987), denying that there was any libel in the apology published. And in response to the specific query, BTstated that `the apology was demanded and drafted by OCBC`. On 24 December 1987, M/s Drew & Napier, acting for BT, replied to ALP to say that they had instructions to accept service of process.
In the meantime, on 12 December 1987, OCBC filed a writ, Suit No 3190/87, against Mr Wright, Egon Zehnder International South East Asia (sued as a firm) and Egon Zehnder International Pte Ltd. On 14 December 1987, ALP informed SLB that they had instructions to accept service on behalf of Wright and Egon Zehnder International Pte Ltd (the company). The writ was served on Wright and the company on 16 December 1987. I should mention here that the firm is not an entity in existence in Singapore. So for the purpose of the present action there are effectively only two defendants, Wright and the company.
Wright did not take issue with OCBC on the apology until 29 December 1987 when ALP wrote to SLB alleging that OCBC `had caused or conspired with BTto publish statements ... that are defamatory of our client` and demanded that OCBC publish an unreserved apology in BT. On 31 December 1987, SLB replied denying that the apology published was defamatory of Wright and rejected the request for an apology.
On 16 January 1988, Wright filed a writ for libel in Suit No 98/88 against BT (first defendant) and OCBC (second defendant).
Both the actions came before me for trial and I have heard them one following the other. It was also the understanding of the parties that in order not to repeat the evidence, the evidence adduced for the 1987 action may also be treated as evidence adduced for the 1988 action. I shall now turn to deal first with the 1987 action.
 1987 action - the pleadings
OCBC allege in para 5 of their statement of claim that the three offensive paragraphs in their natural and ordinary meaning meant and were intended to mean: 
 
(a) that the plaintiffs have caused or permitted a breach of confidence to take place in relation to their intended hiring of the four senior bankers, whereby certain embarrassment and potential damage have been caused to those concerned; and/or
(b) that the plaintiffs had either deliberately or through ignorance or carelessness broken an express or implied promise of confidentiality to the four bankers they were seeking to hire and so subject them to difficulties vis-Ã -vis their present employers; and/or 
(c) that the plaintiffs were not able to keep confidential matters or information which by their nature should be kept confidential.
 
 
 
The defendants in their defence filed deny that the words complained of `bore or were understood or intended to bear any of the meanings` alleged in the statement of claim. In the alternative they aver that the words are `fair comment on a matter of public interest, namely, the methods of recruitment of senior executive officers by a major banking corporation and the public disclosure of their names prior to their appointments.` In the further alternative the defendants plead justification in this form: 
 
... if and in so far as the words complained of meant or were understood to mean in their natural and ordinary meaning that disclosure of the names of the four bankers in 
 Business Times
 on 17 November 1987 was disclosure of matters which were or should have been kept confidential, and was potentially damaging and embarrassing to the named bankers, and there were reasonable grounds for believing or concluding that such disclosure was the result of ineptitude or carelessness by someone at the plaintiffs` bank for which the plaintiffs were ultimately responsible, the said words are true in substance and in fact.
 
 
 
 
 Meaning of the alleged offensive words
 
There cannot be any dispute that the alleged offensive words were spoken in respect of OCBC. No point is taken on that.
At the commencement of the trial Mr Milmo for the defendants conceded that the words were defamatory of OCBC. However, he did not agree with the defamatory meanings placed on those words by OCBC, in particular that meaning set out in sub-para 5(c) of the statement of claim, quoted above. Mr Milmo contended that the three paragraphs meant:
 
 
(1) The identities of top executives which a large organization, such as the OCBC, is intending to recruit to fill senior positions is information which should be kept confidential; and the disclosure in a newspaper of the names of four senior bankers whom OCBC was intending to recruit was undesirable and unfortunate publicity likely to deter top executives from seeking positions within the bank. 
 
(2) Such disclosure demonstrated how difficult it was for a large organization undertaking its own search and recruitment to prevent confidential information from getting into the public domain. 
 
(3) Such disclosure would be unlikely to have occurred if an executive search firm had been retained by OCBC. 
 
(4) Such disclosure was ostensibly indicative of amateurism or carelessness of someone at OCBC. 
 
(5) Such disclosure was likely to be harmful and embarrassing to the persons named and others.
  
 
 
In the alternative, Mr Milmo contended that they meant that what was disclosed in Tay`s article was disclosure of matters which were or should have been kept confidential and was potentially damaging and embarrassing to the four named bankers, and there were reasonable grounds for believing or concluding that such disclosure was the result of ineptitude or carelessness by someone at OCBC for which OCBC were ultimately responsible.
Mr Milmo agreed that the difference between the meanings he contended for the three paragraphs and the meanings which OCBC contended that they bear (other than on para 5(c)) is one of emphasis.
The rule is that words are normally to be construed in their natural and ordinary meaning, ie the meaning in which the reasonable man of ordinary intelligence with the ordinary man`s general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs, would be likely to understand them: 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) at para 93. In what sense the writer intended the words to be understood is irrelevant in determining the actual meaning though relevant on the question of damages: 
 Cassidy v Daily Mirror Newspapers 
 and 
 Slim v Daily Telegraph Ltd 
.
In 
 Jones v Skelton 
, a decision of the Privy Council on an appeal from New South Wales, Australia, Lord Morris, explained that the ordinary and natural meaning of words (at p 1370): 
 
may be either the literal meaning or it may be an implied or inferred or an indirect meaning: any meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge but is a meaning which is capable of being detected in the language used can be a part of the ordinary and natural meaning of words ... The ordinary and natural meaning may therefore include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader guided not by any special but only by general knowledge and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction would draw from the words.
 
 
 
Applying these principles, I find that the three paragraphs bear the meaning contended by OCBC in para 5(a) and (b) (quoted above) of the statement of claim. I accept the submission of Mr Gray that the essential sting of the libel is that `OCBC ... allowed a breach of confidentiality to happen.` However, I do not accept that the plain and ordinary meaning of the three paragraphs could reasonably be construed to mean that OCBC were not able in a general sense to keep confidential matters or information which by their nature should be kept confidential. The three paragraphs do not attack OCBC in their general ability to maintain confidentiality in the business of banking but on the way in which it recruited the four individuals. The overall theme of the letter must be borne in mind. I would accept the meaning set out in para 5(c) of the statement of claim if it is confined to matters of recruitment of staff. I think it would be stretching the plain meaning of the words to construe them to also mean that OCBC was in general incapable of maintaining any confidential information.
 Fair comment
I now turn to consider the defences and, first, fair comment. The burden of proving fair comment rests on the defendants. To succeed on this defence, the defendants must establish these four elements:
 
 
(1) the words complained of are comments, though it may consist of or include inference of facts; 
 
(2) the comment is on a matter of public interest; 
 
(3) the comment is based on facts; and 
 
(4) the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved - see 
 JB Jeyaretnam v Goh Chok Tong 
.
  
 
 
Of the four elements, counsel for OCBC conceded that for the purpose of this action, the three paragraphs touched on a matter of public interest.
I will now consider the question whether the three paragraphs contain exclusively statements of opinion or do they also contain statements of fact. This distinction is important because if the three paragraphs included defamatory statements of fact, then the plaintiff must succeed in this action for defamation unless the statements of fact are proved to be true. Of course it is not always easy to distinguish between an expression of opinion and an assertion of fact. The same set of words could be one or the other depending on the context.
Paragraph A, in my view, consists of comments. While para B commences with the words `your reporter has met his professional duty to find and report the news,` I accept that it is really also a statement of opinion. Then we come to that part of the sentence which is at the heart of this action `but there is a prima facie case of rank amateurism or carelessness at OCBC to have allowed such a breach of confidentiality to happen.` Admittedly the expression `prima facie` could be suggestive that what was said was an expression of opinion. But it is not necessarily so and could in the context be a statement of fact. I will return to this point shortly.
Mr Milmo next submitted that even the phrase `to have allowed such a breach of confidentiality to happen` is not a statement of fact but opinion. He said that it was truly an inference of fact drawn by Wright. This in turn raises one other point and possibly two: (i) Must the facts on which such an inference is drawn be set out in the same document or article? In other words, to determine whether a statement is one of fact or opinion do you look only at the document itself or do you also look at the earlier article to which reference was made in the document? In the context of the present case, the point is whether one should look only at the letter or should one also look at Tay`s article. (ii) If the words were in fact comments, have the defendants proven that the facts, on which Wright relied upon to make the inference, are in fact true?
On point (i), until the recent case of 
 Telnikoff v Matusevitch 
, a decision of the House of Lords, there was no direct authority on the issue. There, the plaintiff sued for libel in respect of a letter written by the defendant and published in a newspaper which was in response to an article written earlier by the plaintiff and published in that same newspaper. The only defence pleaded was fair comment on a matter of public interest, to which the plaintiff averred there was express malice. At the end of the plaintiff`s case, the trial judge accepted the defendant`s submission that there was no case to go to the jury because (a) any reasonable jury properly directed would be bound to uphold the defence of fair comment and (b) there was no evidence of express malice. He held that the letter contained pure comments and dismissed the plaintiff`s action. An appeal to the Court of Appeal also failed. On further appeal, the House of Lords held (with Lord Ackner dissenting) that in deciding whether the offending letter contained pure comments, one should look at the letter by itself and not in conjunction with the article. Accordingly, the House held that the judge was wrong in failing to leave to the jury the question whether the defendant`s letter contained statements of fact and ordered a new trial on that issue. Lord Keith explained in this way why the letter must be read on its own without reference to the earlier article (at p 352): 
 
The readers of the letter must have included a substantial number of persons who had not read the article or who, if they had read it, did not have its terms fully in mind. If to such persons the letter appeared in paras 6 and 7 to contain statements of fact about what the plaintiff had written in his article, which as I have already indicated might well be the case, then in the eyes of those persons the plaintiff would clearly be defamed. The matter cannot turn on the likelihood or otherwise of readers of the letter having read the article. In some cases many readers of a criticism of some subject matter may be familiar with that subject matter but in other cases very few may be, for example where that subject matter is a speech delivered to a limited audience. The principle must be the same in either case.
 
 
 
Lord Keith went on to deal with the criticism that such an approach would mean that every time a writer wishes to make comments he would have to set out the whole text of the article. He said that the writer of a letter to a newspaper had a duty to take reasonable care to make clear that he was writing comments. There should be no difficulty about using suitable words to make clear that what he was writing was pure comment and did not contain misrepresentations about what he was commenting on.
However, Lord Ackner felt that if the court were not entitled to look at the material on which it was alleged that the words complained of were commenting, it would unduly restrict the defence of fair comment. He said (at p 361): 
 
... it would diminish and impair this vitally important right, by whittling it down by a wholly unjustified legal refinement. If the criticism of an article published in a newspaper on a subject matter of public importance is to be confined to passages actually set out in the criticism, then the freedom to comment on a matter of public importance becomes, from a practical point of view, illusory or non-existent. The ability of a defendant to comment should not depend on whether or not the reader is aware of the material which is the subject of the comment. As pointed out in terms by Woolf LJ, the defence of fair comment is based on the principle that a citizen should be entitled to comment on a matter of public interest and the fact that the publication is limited does not affect the public interest.
 
 
 
In my judgment, the defence of fair comment is not based on the proposition that every person who reads a criticism should be in a position to judge for himself. It would be absurd to suggest that a critic may not say what he thinks of a play performed only once because the public cannot go and see it to judge for themselves. The defence of fair comment is available to a defendant who has done no more than express his honest opinion on publications put before the public. It is sufficient for him to have identified the publication on which he is commenting, without having set out such extracts therefrom as would enable his readers to judge for themselves whether they agreed with his opinion or not.
While I can appreciate Lord Ackner`s argument, I think he has focused more on the right of the commentator and has not given sufficient consideration to the interests of the defamed party. It is really a question of seeking the right balance. It is true that a person who writes an article in the media must expect comments from others. That is not in dispute. The law allows fair comment to be a defence even though the comments contain defamatory elements. The rationale for this defence is public interest and the promotion of open discussion. But if a commentator should choose to make a defamatory remark in the course of his comments, I do not think it is too much to expect him to ensure that it is apparent on the face of it to be a comment by the use of appropriate words. He does not have to quote everything that was written before. He doesn`t have to quote anything at all, if he does not want to. But the public should not be misled into thinking that what are really comments are facts. Whether the reader would agree with those comments would be quite immaterial. As Lord Keith pointed out, the subsequent article/letter might very well be read by someone who had not read the earlier article or by someone who had read it but did not have it in mind. The ruling of the majority of the House would ensure that a commentator would have to exercise greater care if he should wish to make defamatory remarks in his response. In my view, this approach is to be preferred. I repeat, a proper balance must be struck between the right to comment and the interest of the person who is being adversely commented upon. At the end of the day the law must reflect fairness.
In my view it behoves a commentator to indicate clearly what are facts and what are comments. As pointed out by Fletcher-Moulton LJ in 
 Hunt v `Star` Newspaper Co Ltd 
6 at p 319: 
 
[C]omments in order to be justifiable as fair comment must appear as comment and must not be so mixed up with the facts that the reader cannot distinguish between what is report and what is comment ... [A]ny matter ... which does not indicate with a reasonable clearness that it purports to be comment, and not statement of fact, cannot be protected by the plea of fair comment.
 
 
 
Accordingly, I would respectfully adopt the views of the majority of the House and rule that in determining whether the offensive para B contains statements of fact or of opinion, no reference should be made to Tay`s article of 17 November 1987. It would have to stand on its own.
In my judgment it is clear that the phrase `OCBC to have allowed such a breach of confidentiality to happen` is a statement of fact. As regards the earlier phrase `but there is a prima facie case of rank amateurism or carelessness at OCBC,` I also find that it is a statement of fact, notwithstanding the use of the expression `prima facie`. We must bear in mind that the ordinary reasonable reader is not a lawyer. Reading the entire three paragraphs I find that Wright was asserting that there was a breach of confidentiality at OCBC due to rank amateurism or carelessness and that was what a reasonable member of the public would have understood those words. The defence of fair comment does not extend to cover misstatements of fact.
The case 
 London Artists Ltd v Littler 
 illustrates the point that the use of such words as `it appears` or `prima facie` are not necessarily conclusive that what are stated are comments. There the defendant wrote a letter to the plaintiffs, who were organizers in the entertainment industry and which letter was released to the media, suggesting that the plaintiffs had taken part in what appeared to be a plot to force the end of the run of a successful play produced by the defendant by arranging for four leading players in the cast simultaneously to give identical notices to quit. The exact words used by the defendant were these: 
 
We have been friends for years and I am hurt that you did not see me before being a party to what, 
 on the face of it appears
 to be a plan to close the run of ... . A great part of the success of `The Right Honourable Gentleman` has been the casting of this show and the combined effort of withdrawing suddenly the three Grade stars and another Grade artiste on a given date ... . [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The defendant initially pleaded justification, fair comment and qualified privilege. The plea of justification was withdrawn. The trial judge held that the plea of fair comment failed because the matter was not one of public interest and there was no basis of fact to support the plea. The court also rejected the plea that the publication to the press was privileged. On appeal, while the Court of Appeal disagreed with the trial judge on the question of public interest, it held that the allegation of a plot was of a basic fact, defamatory of the plaintiffs and not reasonably capable of being considered as comment, which the defendant had failed to substantiate. The Court of Appeal held that the allegation of a plot was a statement of fact notwithstanding the use of the words `it appears`. Lord Denning stated: 
 
The first paragraph runs in guarded language `it appears`; and the fifth paragraph says `in other words`; but the last paragraph speaks of `the combined effort`. Reading the letter as a whole, I have no doubt that it stated as a fact that there was a plot between ... .
 
 
 
The English Court of Appeal further held that even if one assumed the contrary view, that the words were comments, it agreed with the trial judge that there was no sufficient factual foundation to support that comment.
Reverting to the instant case and for the reasons aforesaid the plea of fair comment must fail. However, even if it were permissible to read the letter of Wright together with the article of Tay, and even if one were to hold that the allegation of rank amateurism or carelessness, is a comment, I do not think there is sufficient factual foundation to support that comment. In my opinion what was written by Tay does not per se warrant the making of the defamatory remarks. Neither can s 9 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75) be of assistance to Wright. As stated by Fletcher-Moulton LJ in 
 Hunt v `Star` Newspaper 
 at p 320, `if the facts upon which the comment purports to be made do not exist, the foundation of the plea fails.` At the highest, Tay`s article raised a suspicion that the leak could have occurred at OCBC. But it did not warrant a comment that there was carelessness and breach of confidence on the part of OCBC. This will appear clear from the discussion that follows on the defence of justification to which I now turn. Again, as stated by Fletcher-Moulton LJ in the same case, `any other interpretation would amount to saying that, where the facts were only sufficient to raise a suspicion of a criminal or disgraceful motive, a writer might allege such motive as a fact and protect himself under the plea of fair comment.` All the more so, a fair-minded person (as described by Diplock J in 
 Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd 
 at p 749) in possession of all the facts, which will be set out when I deal next with the defence of justification, would not allege that there was amateurism and/or carelessness on the part of OCBC.
During the course of the submissions, considerable arguments were made on the question of malice, which would negative the defence of fair comment even though in all other respects, the comment fulfils the qualifications which the law stipulates. Since I have held that this defence is not available to the defendants, I shall say no more.
 Justification
On this plea what Mr Wright relies upon is what was written in Tay`s article of 17 November 1987. He placed emphasis on the following matters/statements in the article:
 
 
(1) The specific mention of the four bankers. 
 
(2) That Mr Ng Tat Pun was receptive to OCBC`s offer. 
 
(3) The dates on which the four were likely to join OCBC. 
 
(4) The statement that Mrs Sam was likely to take charge of OCBC`s investment banking department. 
 
(5) Mr Lai Teck Poh was the leading candidate to take over as head of the corporate banking department. 
 
(6) That the four were likely to assume office the same time - early in 1988.
  
 
 
The defendants averred that all these statements in Tay`s article were proven correct by the subsequent official announcements issued by OCBC which were carried in the media on 12 December and 30 December 1987. Thus, they argued that the leak to Tay must have originated from someone in OCBC.
The then chairman of OCBC, Mr Yong Pung How, testified for the bank and explained to the court how he went about engaging the four persons. He dealt with the recruitment personally and kept the matter strictly confidential. He knew precisely whom he wished to approach. No one who need not know was involved. Even the board of directors of OCBC was not told. The only person with whom Mr Yong discussed with was Mr Teo Cheng Guan, the general manager. But the decision to hire was entirely Mr Yong`s. Mr Teo took no part in the decision. The executive committee of the board was only notified on 24 November 1987. Mr Eric Lee, a senior vice-president and the head of the human resources department of OCBC sat in at some meetings with the candidates.
Mr Yong told the court that at end August and early September 1987 it was public knowledge that an executive vice-president, Mrs Theresa Foo, was leaving OCBC. Then, it was generally speculated that OCBC would get at least one person to replace Mrs Foo. Mr Yong said that bankers from other banks had often come to see him at his office; no reason to suggest that just because the four persons had come to see him that they had come for possible employment. Furthermore, because of the special layout of his office at OCBC, he did not think people would know the four bankers had come to see him unless a `special operation was mounted.` Mr Yong said the three paragraphs were defamatory because they accused OCBC of not being able to maintain confidentiality. He stated that when all four bankers had accepted his offers, he reported it to the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) towards the end of October 1987.
Eric Lee told the court that following the resignation of Theresa Foo at the end of August 1987, Mr Yong discussed with him the question of finding replacements. They identified the four bankers in question. After end August 1987, the resignation of Mrs Foo was no longer a secret. Eric Lee said he knew both Ng and Lai. He lunched with Ng regularly. It was at a lunch meet that he asked Ng whether he was interested to join OCBC. Later he arranged for Ng to meet Mr Yong. In the case of Lai, Eric Lee called him direct and had a lunch with him to inquire if he was interested to join OCBC. Later, arrangement was made for him to meet Mr Yong. Eric Lee remembers that he sat in at the meetings between the Mr Yong and Ng and possibly also at the meeting which Mr Yong had with Lai. Eric Lee did not approach Mrs Sam or Goh. But he was involved in a meeting between Mr Yong and Goh.
Eric Lee said he personally handed the letters of offer to Ng and Lai after Mr Yong had decided to offer them employment. The letters of offers were prepared by one Mrs Lim Ai Ling of Management Services Pte Ltd, a subsidiary of OCBC. Mrs Lim received instructions directly from Mr Yong. Eric Lee arranged all meetings the four bankers had with Mr Yong.
Eric Lee did inform Mr Wong Nan Jang, an executive vice-president of OCBC, on a confidential basis that Ng and Lai would be joining the bank as executive vice-presidents. Eric Lee explained that he did this because both Ng and Lai were earlier in their career subordinates of Wong Nan Jang at another bank. Eric Lee said that no one who need not know was informed of the engagement of the four bankers. He did not even tell David Cheam, his immediate subordinate who was in charge of public relations. It was only on 16 November 1987 when Tay contacted Cheam to confirm the story that Cheam knew of the possible recruitment and asked Eric Lee about it. It was then that Eric Lee told Cheam but he instructed Cheam not to confirm the proposed BT story. He said the bank considered every recruitment confidential until announced.
Mrs Lim told the court that one of the functions of Management Service Pte Ltd was to engage senior staff for OCBC. The reason for this set-up was to maintain confidentiality. She would only be called in by Mr Yong to do the paper work after the latter had decided to make an offer. In the present case Mr Yong spoke to her directly. After the letters of offer were prepared she handed them to Mr Yong.
Mr Yong had two secretaries. Eric Lee and Mrs Lim each also had a secretary. All the three persons expressed absolute faith in their secretaries in maintaining confidentiality.
The next witness called by OCBC was Cheam. He related how Tay contacted him and wanted him to confirm a story Tay intended to write about the four bankers. At the time Cheam knew nothing about it. Cheam said he would check and get back to Tay. Cheam spoke to Eric Lee and it was then that Cheam learnt for the first time of the recruitment. But Cheam was told by Eric Lee to keep the information confidential. Cheam in turn told Tay that he was unable to confirm Tay`s proposed story. Cheam did not ask Tay as to his sources of the information. Mr Milmo accepted that Cheam did not give the story to Tay.
I now turn to consider the evidence of Mr Wright. He gave an account of how an executive search firm would go about its task. Everything would be kept confidential - both of client and potential candidates until the client is prepared to make an offer of employment to the right candidate where a meeting could be set at the client`s office. The letter of offer would be typed by client though some clients even ask them to type on letterheads provided by clients.
In early November when he saw Tong`s article in the 
 Singapore Business 
 he wrote a letter to 
 Singapore Business 
commenting on the article. Later he realized that 
 Singapore Business 
 had no letters page. He thought his letter would not be published. In fact it was published late in the January 1988 issue. On 17 November 1987, he saw Tay`s article in the BT. He could not believe what he saw because it was so detailed. He felt sorry for the four persons for being put up in this manner. He asked: `Where would it leave them in terms of negotiating with the potential employer and their existing customers and employers?` It happened that the founder of the firm, Dr Zehnder, was in town that day to attend a presentation which the company was organizing for bankers and senior businessmen on the services rendered by executive search firms. Dr Zehnder was reported to have remarked that such developments would be something which companies would want to avoid.
On 23 November 1987, the same article by Tong appeared in BT. Thinking that his earlier letter to the 
 Singapore Business 
 would not be published and bearing in mind Tay`s article six days earlier, Wright decided to write to BT to emphasize the need for confidentiality. He also noted that since Tay`s story there was no announcement by OCBC. Neither was there any correction made by BT. It did not occur to him to check with OCBC. But Wright said he did not think there would be any purpose in doing that since OCBC had earlier refused to confirm or deny Tay`s story. From his experience he thought Tay`s story was correct. He felt the leak could only come from within OCBC. In his view, OCBC did not go about the recruitment in the right way. He did not intend to make adverse comments on OCBC`s integrity or ability as bankers. He said OCBC were and still are his bankers. He asserted that the comments were reasonable. He did not act maliciously. He had nothing to apologize for.
The defendants also subpoenaed the four bankers concerned to testify. Their evidence (which confirms that of Mr Yong) shows that, by end October 1987, they had all accepted the offers of OCBC and, except in the case of Mrs Sam, their acceptance had already been communicated in writing to OCBC. At the time none of them knew that the other three were joining OCBC.
Mrs Sam did not then indicate her acceptance in writing because she wished to sort out certain matters with her then employer, London-based Mercantile House Holdings. Indeed, Mrs Sam told this court that she did not send in her formal acceptance until she had already commenced work at OCBC. In so far as she was concerned, by the time Tay`s article appeared in BT she had accepted the offer of OCBC, though only orally. Indeed a few days before, she was in London and had informed the chairman and a director of Mercantile House Holdings that she was leaving and joining a bank. She also told the court that well before then there were speculations that she was leaving Mercantile House, whose far east operations were soon to be taken over by another company. Mrs Sam`s secretary knew she was seeing Mr Yong. She also told her family. Mrs Sam also said she could have told the buyer of Mercantile House.
In his evidence, Goh said that he was then doing his own business. He told his wife that he was joining OCBC. He said the way the bank went about recruiting him showed that OCBC was concerned to protect confidentiality. He could not recall having any discussion with Mr Yong as to the date or how his appointment would be announced.
Lai at the relevant time was the managing director of Citicorp Investments Bank. He informed Citicorp in early October of his intention of leaving and joining OCBC. His immediate superior had, in turn, notified his superiors. Lai had also informed his wife. He could not recall any discussion on the question of the official announcement by OCBC. He felt that his recruitment by OCBC was done discreetly.
Ng was then the general manager of International Bank of Singapore, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Overseas Union Bank (OUB). He said he gave notice of resignation on 2 November 1987 to the managing director of OUB. The next day he told seven to eight key officers of his leaving for OCBC. His secretary knew. He had also informed his wife.
All the four bankers also informed the court that they were not embarrassed by Tay`s article. None of them said that the article caused any damage or embarrassment to their then employers. Of course, their then employers could not have been embarrassed when they had already been notified.
In the light of all the evidence I do not see how Mr Wright could assert that the leak occurred at OCBC. At best what he alleged against OCBC was pure speculation. From the evidence of Mr Yong, whose evidence was not challenged at all by Mr Milmo, it was clear that all necessary steps were taken to ensure that the recruitment was carried out discreetly. Beside him and his secretaries, only Teo Cheng Guan, Eric Lee and his secretary, and Mrs Lim and her secretary, knew of the exercise. Wong Nam Jang was asked to contact Lai and Mrs Margaret Koh, a senior vice-president at OCBC, was asked to contact Goh. These two persons had no other involvement in the matter.
Wright has not tendered any proof to show that the leak probably occurred at OCBC. His case is purely this: since there was a leak and OCBC could not explain it, the blame must be placed on OCBC. Of course, the person who could really tell us how he got his story was Tay yet the defendants chose not to call him to testify even though he was subpoenaed and was waiting outside the courtroom. Wright said the fact that Tay got all the four persons` names correct and that the other facts stated are also correct necessarily suggest that Tay must have obtained the information from someone inside OCBC. In his closing submission, Mr Milmo faintly suggested that the position here was analogous to that where the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur could apply. I did not think he was serious in making that suggestion.
In my opinion, Mr Wright does not seem to give sufficient credit to Alvin Tay, a person whom Wright admitted is an experienced and competent journalist whose area of specialization is in the banking industry. More importantly, he did not know that at the time the four bankers had accepted the offers and had also told their then employers and spouses about it. He had simply jumped to his conclusion. Wright`s view seems to suggest that unless everything was given to Tay on a silver platter he would not be able to investigate and make the necessary inference based on information obtained within the industry, which is, after all, the hallmark of investigative journalism. Plainly he underrated the ability of Tay.
It is really unnecessary for me to speculate how the information got out. I repeat, we have clear evidence that all four bankers told their spouses that they would be joining OCBC. With the exception of Goh, who was then self-employed, the other three had also informed their then employers. It is not impossible, and I would say most probable, that the top managements and/or boards of their employers would have been informed. They would have to look for replacements. MAS had also been informed. The banking community in Singapore is a small one. There is an Association of Banks where members meet. I do not see how one could say that it is any less probable that the story by Tay was pieced together from various sources.
I have no doubt in my mind that one of the aims of the letter of Wright was to explain the role and promote the interests of executive search firms. There is nothing wrong in all that except for the last three paragraphs where an attack was made on OCBC. In my opinion Wright wanted to use Tay`s article as an illustration to promote the services which his firm and similar firms render. But he had pointed an accusing finger at OCBC without ascertaining the facts. He made no inquiry and spoke to nobody. He did not pause to think from what other sources the leak could have come from. He said it would have been pointless to refer to OCBC as OCBC had earlier refused to confirm the proposed story of Tay. I do not think the two situations are quite the same. I very much doubt that OCBC would not have answered him or cautioned him if he had told OCBC of what was the purport of the three paragraphs.
In his desire to drive home his point, Wright thought that this story by Tay vividly illustrated why employers should engage executive search firms. Unfortunately, he had no idea how Tay got his story. Yet he took the story as complete truth: that at the time OCBC was only `eyeing` the four bankers and things were still in the negotiating stage between the four and OCBC. Little did he know that OCBC had firmed up everything with them. This is clear from his answer when he was asked if the four bankers had notified their existing employers `very debatable having regard to the article`. OCBC was just waiting for the appropriate time, after it had completed some internal reorganization, to make the announcement. I can see no reason why OCBC should bring forward its announcement just becauseBTcarried Tay`s story. True, the story might indicate a leak or that some person or persons had been talking. But I cannot see how, in the light of the evidence before me, one could say that the blame must or should be placed at the door of OCBC. In my opinion, he was being hasty. The plea of justification must fail.
It is pertinent to note that when Mr Wright was asked if he would still have written the three offensive paragraphs if he had known that the four bankers had accepted the offer of employment, he said he would because the article by Tay did not say that the four bankers had accepted offers or that all matters had been settled. I am afraid he has completely misunderstood the law here. It was clear that Tay`s article is not entirely accurate even as at 17 November 1987. It is only a story pieced together. A person cannot rely on such an article to make defamatory remarks against another and plead fair comment or justification without first ascertaining that the facts stated therein are true or substantially true and in the case of fair comment those facts proved to be true warrant the making of the defamatory remarks.
In passing I would add that even if an executive search firm had been engaged by OCBC, it would not necessarily have precluded a similar story from emerging if the recruitment exercise had reached the same stage. On Wright`s own evidence, the employer would see the potential candidates in the office when an offer was being contemplated. Mr Yong saw the persons he had in mind. So I really cannot see what difference it would have made if an executive search firm had been engaged. Of course, in this case OCBC`s stand is that it did not require a search be carried out as they had already known the persons to whom they wished to make offers.
One final point before I leave the subject of justification. I have quoted above the way in which this plea is formulated. The defendants seem to say that where `there were reasonable grounds for believing or concluding that such disclosure was the result of ineptitude or carelessness by someone` at OCBC that would be sufficient to prove justification. In other words, Wright is saying that any person on reading the story would assume it to be true and could reasonably form the view that there was a leak at OCBC. I do not think there is such a kind of defence of justification known in law. A defendant either proves the defamatory imputation or he does not. Section 8 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75) provides that in an action for defamation in respect of words containing two or more distinct charges against the plaintiff, a defence of justification shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every charge is not proved if the words not proved to be true do not materially injure the plaintiff`s reputation having regard to the truth of the remaining charges. In other words, it is sufficient if the main charge or charges be justified. Here, the sting of the three paragraphs is carelessness and breach of confidentiality on the part of OCBC and that has not been proved. Section 8 can have no application.
 Damages
In the premises, I hold that OCBC must succeed in the action. As for damages, Mr Gray did not ask for aggravated damages but he submitted that the amount awarded must be fair and adequate to vindicate the reputation of OCBC. Mr Milmo submitted that it should be modest. Neither Mr Gray nor Mr Milmo offered any suggestion as to the correct quantum. In determining the appropriate sum I bear in mind the fact that the attack was only in relation to the ability of OCBC in maintaining confidentiality in staff recruitment and not in relation to its banking business. If it were in relation to the latter matter, the amount would have to be very much more than I am prepared to award here. However, I also bear in mind that the defamatory remarks appeared in a newspaper for the business community and no apology was tendered and a plea of justification was added and that the defamatory remarks were made with the object of promoting generally the commercial interests of executive search firms, and that of the defendants in particular. I also note that OCBC is one of the leading local banks in Singapore or, in the words of its 1987 report, `a premier banking group in Singapore.` In this connection, I have also noted what Windeyer J said in 
 Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd 
 at p 150 `... compensation by damages operates in two ways - as a vindication of the plaintiff to the public and as consolation to him for a wrong done.` Considering all that, I would award the sum of $50,000. There shall be judgment in favour of OCBC in that sum.
 1988 action
I now turn to consider the 1988 suit instituted by Mr Wright against BT and OCBC. Wright claims that the apology meant that he `had recklessly, irresponsibly and mischievously written a letter for publication` which contained `wholly unfounded and indefensible libellous statement about a major banking corporation` and that Wright had `shown himself to be unreliable, unsound, lacking in judgment and unfit to occupy a senior executive position in an executive search or any other firm.` The sting was that Wright was reckless, irresponsible and mischievous when he wrote the letter to BT.
BTdenies that the words in the apology bear the meaning alleged by Wright. In the alternative, BTsays that the words were fair comment on a matter of public interest, namely, the administrative policies and procedures of OCBC. In the further alternative BTpleads justification or that the occasion of the publication of the apology was an occasion of qualified privilege.
The defences raised by OCBC are (i) the words were not defamatory; (ii) OCBC was exercising its legitimate right of reply to an attack made by Wright on 28 November 1987 and thus the publication was on an occasion of qualified privilege (BT would enjoy a derivative privilege on this basis) and (iii) justification.
 Was the apology defamatory?
On the facts before me it cannot seriously be disputed that OCBC caused the publication of the apology. Mr Gray did not pursue the point; in fact he accepted it.
What is the correct meaning to be placed on the word `unfounded`? As I have stated above in relation to the 1987 action, the test is the understanding of the ordinary reasonable man. Such a person is entitled to take into account all the circumstances surrounding the publication and to draw inferences therefrom. I accept that the ordinary and natural meaning may include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader guided not by any special but only by general knowledge and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction would draw from the words. The word `unfounded` could mean `not true`, `groundless`, `without foundation`, `baseless`. It is certainly not defamatory to say that a person got his facts wrong or that what he said was not true or unfounded.
Mr Milmo accepted that ordinarily there is nothing defamatory to say that a person has made an unfounded statement. He argued that it depends on the context, how it was made and the surrounding circumstances. He submitted that as the context of the apology relates to Wright`s business, he being a senior executive of an executive search firm, what was stated clearly attacked his knowledge and integrity, that he had been reckless in writing the letter of 28 November 1987.
Mr Milmo relied on the case 
 Tracy v Kemsley Newspaper 
, where the plaintiff, a journalist, succeeded in obtaining damages in respect of an apology published by the defendant arising out of an article written by the plaintiff and published in the 
 Sunday Times 
 allegedly defamatory of Canon Maurice O`Connell. The article criticized the Canon for making the desperately poor parishioners `pay, pay and pay` so that the priests might enjoy a standard of living beyond that in the parish. The apology admitted that the article of the plaintiff constituted an `unjustifiable attack on the character and position of the Canon`. It went on to say `the defendants are completely satisfied that any imputation against (the Canon) are wholly unfounded and are unreservedly withdrawn.` The judge directed the jury that those words were capable of bearing a meaning defamatory of the plaintiff for they said that `as a journalist she had done bad work.` There was evidence that she was not able to obtain any offers of employment since the publication of the apology. The jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff.
In our present case, there is nothing in the apology which accused Mr Wright of having `recklessly, irresponsibly and mischievously` written the letter. The apology even went on to explain why BT was satisfied that the statements in the letter concerning OCBC were wholly unfounded: `we know of no carelessness or failing on the part of OCBC in having allowed any breach of confidentiality to happen and we accept that we know of no basis or foundation whatsoever for the statements.` The words of the apology clearly meant that the allegation against OCBC for being careless was wrong and without foundation.
I do not think that 
 Tracy 
 is authority for any general proposition that readers cannot reply to an article by a journalist to say that what the journalist wrote is quite wrong without thereby defaming the journalist, namely, that he was slipshod in his work as a journalist. The report on the case was simply too brief. But I cannot see any justification why a reader may not say that what a journalist wrote is wrong or not correct without at the same time being construed as having attacked his integrity or competence. For example, judgments of court are being criticized all the time, particularly by academics, and nobody has ever suggested that it is defamatory to say that a judge has gone completely wrong or has failed to take into account this factor or that factor. How could it be defamatory to merely say that a person has erred or made a mistake?
In any event, Mr Wright is not a journalist. The present apology must be read in its true context. It meant that Wright drew the wrong inference or reached a wrong conclusion. Nothing therein sought to attack him in relation to his business or profession. The only reason why his designation was mentioned in the apology was because Wright mentioned it in his offending letter of 28 November 1987. It had to be stated in the apology for correct identification. In my view, it would be straining the language to suggest that implicit in the words is the allegation that Wright wrote the three paragraphs recklessly or mischievously. To the ordinary fair-minded reader, not avid to scandal, the apology meant that BT admitted that the allegations made by Wright against OCBC were not correct and that BT had published something which was wrong and which it should not have published; it therefore apologized to OCBC for that.
 Justification
The above should suffice for me to dismiss this action. Nevertheless, I think I should deal briefly with the defences of justification and qualified privilege. I do not propose to touch on the question of fair comment. OCBC`s evidence has already been set out above. No additional evidence was adduced. BT called Ms Margaret Thomas, its deputy editor and who was the acting editor when the apology was published, to testify.
Ms Thomas told the court that upon Tay bringing Cheam`s letter of 28 November 1987 to her attention, she discussed it with Tay. She wrote the reply on 30 November 1987 confirming that Tay did not get the information from Cheam after discussing with Tay. On the advice of solicitors she took the responsibility to make the apology demanded by OCBC. She said it was quite clear that BT ought not have published the last three paragraphs of Wright`s letter. It was a mistake on the part of the feature editor in letting the three paragraphs slip past. She felt like `kicking ourselves`. She felt that the feature editor was probably concentrating on the main points made in the letter, and even made some editorial changes to earlier parts and thought that the last three paragraphs related to something that happened to highlight the theme that Wright was trying to make in his letter. She also added that even if OCBC had really been careless, ideally BT ought to have toned down the language in the three paragraphs a little.
Ms Thomas stated that the apology was something BT owed to OCBC in view of the mistake made in publishing Wright`s letter. It was to correct that mistake. She had investigated. It was not defamatory of Wright nor was it intended to be defamatory of Wright. She explained that there was no need to check with Wright before the apology was issued because the offensive paragraphs of Wright were based solely on Tay`s article of 17 November 1987. If consulted, Wright could not have shed any further light. On that she is quite right. Wright told this court that he based his comments solely on Tay`s article. Tay had told Ms Thomas of his sources: 15-20 senior bankers, both local and foreign. They told him that the four persons would join OCBC.
Mr Milmo submitted that BT meekly succumbed to the pressure of OCBC in accepting the draft apology put up by OCBC. They did so to `save their own skin`. This runs quite counter to the plain evidence of Ms Thomas. She accepted that it was a mistake after clarifying with Tay. The draft apology was accepted after consultation with solicitors.
As I have stated above, Mr Wright wrote the three offensive paragraphs based entirely on the story by Tay. He kept repeating in court that from his experience this kind of story, involving four top executives and with those details, would necessarily suggest that the leak must have occurred at OCBC. As I have pointed out above, in the circumstances of this case, this hardly follows. He assumed that Tay`s article was absolutely accurate in all respects. He made the defamatory remarks without ascertaining the true or full facts. On the evidence now before the court we know that while the story in Tay`s article may be considered to be fairly correct there were other important facts which Tay did not know and which were not reflected in the article. Mr Wright should have exercised a bit more care before uttering the defamatory remarks.
On a balance of probabilities, I have no hesitation in holding that the defence of justification is made out. All that the defendants need to show is that OCBC did not breach any confidentiality. On the evidence I am satisfied that OCBC had taken all the necessary precautions to maintain confidentiality. There is no evidence that OCBC breached the obligation to maintain confidentiality. There were clearly other sources from whom Tay could have got the information and pieced his story together. It is true that neither OCBC nor BT called Tay to testify. But they do not have to show where was the source of the leak.
 Qualified privilege
Turning to the defence of qualified privilege, first from the point of view of OCBC. If the defence is made out, then BT would enjoy a derivative privilege based on that. Next, I will consider whether BT has a separate and independent privilege in its own right.
OCBC has put its case in this way. Mr Wright`s letter of 28 November 1987 contained a libellous or false attack upon the reputation of OCBC. The apology published in the BT of 5 December 1987 constituted a legitimate answer to the said attack. Thus the apology was published on an occasion protected by qualified privilege.
In 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
 (8th Ed) at para 514, it is stated that: 
 
... a person whose character or conduct has been attacked is entitled to answer such attack, and any defamatory statements he may make about the person who attacked him will be privileged, provided they are published bona fide and are fairly relevant to the accusations made. The law justifies a man in repelling a libellous charge by a denial or an explanation. He has a qualified privilege to answer the charge; and if he does so in good faith, and what he published is fairly an answer, and is published for the purpose of repelling the charge, and not with malice, it is privileged, though it be false.
 
 
 
In 
 Turner v MGM Pictures 
, at pp 470-471, Lord Oaksey enunciated the principle as follows: 
 
There is an analogy between the criminal law of self-defence and a man`s right to defend himself against written or verbal attacks. In both cases he is entitled, if he can, to defend himself effectively, and he only loses the protection of the law if he goes beyond defence and proceeds to offence. That is to say, the circumstances in which he defends himself, either by acts or by words, negative the malice which the law draws from violent acts or defamatory words.
 
 
 
If OCBC had replied to the attack and stated that the allegation of amateurism and carelessness in the letter of 28 November 1987 was entirely without foundation, that would have been an occasion of qualified privilege and no action could be brought in respect of that reply unless malice be shown. Here, while OCBC did demand that the apology be published, and caused it to be published, the apology was not strictly a reply by OCBC. I do not think one can truly view this as a reply by OCBC to Wright. It was a statement by BT though at the insistence of OCBC.
I come next to the question whether BT`s publication of the apology was on an occasion of qualified privilege. The criterion as to whether a publication was made on an occasion of privilege was stated by Parke B in 
 Toogood v Spyring 
, at p 193, to be: 
 
... fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned ... if fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society; and the law has not restricted the right to make them within any narrow limits.
 
 
 
In 
 Stuart v Bell 
, Lopes LJ stated the rule as follows: 
 
The rule, I think, is this - that when the circumstances are such as to cast on the defendant the duty of making the communication to a third party, the occasion is privilege ... . The duty may be legal, social or moral ... .
 
 
 
A case relied upon by BT to contend that the defence of qualified privilege applies is 
 Adam v Ward 
. There the plaintiff, a Member of Parliament in an address to the House of Commons charged that a certain General had sent confidential reports on officers under his command to Headquarters which contained wilful and deliberate misstatements. The General referred the matter to the Army Council. The Council, after investigating, directed its secretary, the defendant, to reply to the General. In the letter the Council vindicated the General of the charges made by the plaintiff. However, the reply, which contained defamatory statement about the plaintiff, was sent to the press for publication. The House of Lords held that the occasion was privileged. Lord Atkinson enunciated a privileged occasion to be one (at p 334): 
 
... where the person who makes a communication has an interest, or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it.
 
 
 
It is clear that the circumstances in 
 Adam v Ward 
 were not exactly the same as the present case. There, under the King`s Regulations, the General could not take up the matter on his own and defend himself in the public press. He was bound to refer the matter to the Army Council and await their verdict. But I do not think the nature of the occasion would be altered even if the General could have taken up the matter himself but nevertheless chose to refer the matter to the Council to investigate. As Lord Shaw said in 
 Adam v Ward 
 (at p 347): 
 
It may be said in general terms that whenever the character of one person is made the subject of a false charge communicated to another in a public manner, that other has the right to overtake the charge wherever it may have reached, and if possible to eradicate the falsehood by the reputation. In the case of an employer generously anxious to undo a wrong to a falsely accused servant the exercise of this right appeals to the former as a duty.
 
 
 
I am afraid there are very few cases which have arisen on account of an apology having been published. Besides 
 Tracy 
, counsel for BT was only able to uncover a case from South Australia, 
 Perry v The Advertiser Newspaper Ltd 
 which has been reported rather briefly in the 
 Australian Media Law Reports 
 of April 1994. The apology in that case reads: 
 
In a series of articles which appeared in our newspaper (and a similar series which appeared in 
 The News
) in 1986, we published a series of statements made by Mrs Emily Perry concerning William Thomas Cook and David Eugene Florance.
 
 
 
Detectives Cook and Florance are members of the criminal investigation branch of the SA Police Force. In the articles we published a number of statements by Mrs Perry alleging that Detectives Cook and Florance had wrongly concealed certain evidence relating to the death of a former husband of Mrs Perry, Otto Haag, and relating to allegations concerning the alleged administration to Mrs Perry`s present husband of certain poison.
The effect of the allegations by Mrs Perry was that Detectives Cook and Florance had been guilty of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. 
 The Advertiser 
 accepts that these allegations were false and totally unfounded and hereby unreservedly withdraws any such allegation.
 The Advertiser 
 apologises to Detectives Cook and Florance for any distress or embarrassment the publication of these allegations may have caused.
Perry brought proceedings for defamation on account of the publication of the apology. She alleged that the apology conveyed the defamatory imputation that she had made an allegation to the effect that the two detectives concerned had conspired to pervert the course of justice and that she had done so without any factual foundation or basis. The newspaper did not challenge the imputation alleged. But it raised the defences of justification and qualified privilege. Hume J of the District Court of South Australia held that the defence of justification was made out. The learned judge also held that had it been necessary for him to rule on the defence of qualified privilege he would have held that defence would have been available. The report did not contain any more elaboration on that.
In the circumstances of the present case, having regard to the letter of Mr Wright which was published in BT on 17 November 1987, there was clearly a duty, at least moral if not legal, for BT to make the statement in the apology to correct what it felt was an unwarranted attack by Wright on OCBC. Applying the criteria I have set out above, I am of the opinion that the publication of the apology was on an occasion of qualified privilege. The readers have read the attack on OCBC and they certainly have an interest to read the correction. Of course, the defence of qualified privilege could be negatived by malice. But by no stretch of the imagination can one seriously allege that there was any malice in OCBC causing the publication of or in BT having published the apology.
I agree that the position might be different if BT having entirely on its own volition published a libel on OCBC then sought to make a correction wherein it defamed a third party. I can see that in such a situation the court should perhaps be slow to recognize that there is such a duty as to create an occasion of qualified privilege.
 Costs
In view of my judgments above, costs must follow the event. Accordingly, OCBC shall be entitled to the costs for the 1987 action. Similarly costs for the 1988 action should go to BT and OCBC. However, BTshall not have the costs for the amendments in respect of which leave was given to BTon 1 July 1994.
At the conclusion of the two hearings, all the counsel have asked me, whatever the outcome, to issue a certificate for two counsel, which I now do under O 59 r 19.
There is one other matter which requires consideration. Mr Tan for BTwas present throughout the hearing of the 1987 action. Though he did, at the commencement, say that he was present on a watching brief on behalf of BT, he has at the conclusion of the trial of the 1988 action asked for costs for the 1987 action. I see the link between the two actions. I think in fairness BTshould at least be given costs for counsel`s attendance at the hearing of the 1987 action.
Order accordingly.",1994-06-27 00:00:00,SG High Court

The accused and one Sanusi bin Shariff (Sanusi) were arrested at 10.40am on 6 July 1994 at the Karachi Restaurant in Changi Road as a result of a routine check by Cpl B Rajandran and two other police officers from Geylang Police Station. Cpl Rajandran testified that both the accused and Sanusi appeared to him to be drug addicts. He told the court that the accused`s face was pale and his gait was unsteady. After obtaining their particulars he checked with the operations room and ascertained that the accused was wanted for failing to report for a urine test. He arrested both of them and took them to Geylang Police Station.
A short while after arrival at Geylang Police Station, Cpl Rajandran was informed of a telephone call from the owner of Karachi Restaurant that a bag belonging to one of the two Malays was still at the restaurant. Cpl Rajandran returned to Karachi Restaurant and recovered a grey clutch bag from the table at which he had earlier seen the accused. Cpl Rajandran told the court that he had in fact seen the accused holding this clutch bag when he first saw the accused but had overlooked the clutch bag at the time of the arrest.
Back in his patrol car Cpl Rajandran opened the clutch bag and saw therein a yellow envelope and a handphone. In the envelope there were several sachets of granular substance that he suspected to be heroin. At the station Cpl Rajandran examined the contents of the clutch bag more thoroughly. He mentioned that when he took the sachets out from the envelope some paper clips dropped out. When asked for details he said that when he emptied the clutch bag `paper clips, scraps, small pieces of paper fell out`. Cpl Rajandran said that he did not bother to pick these up.
Cpl Rajandran then proceeded, with the clutch bag and its contents, to the lock-up where, in the presence of the accused, he counted the 24 sachets of powder that were in the yellow envelope. He then reported the recovery of the clutch bag containing the 24 sachets and the arrest of the accused and Sanusi to Sgt Lai Thong Fock (Sgt Lai). Sgt Lai relayed this information to ASP Lim Chei Yoo (ASP Lim) of the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) and asked if CNB would want to take over the case. He was told to interview the two persons first. It appeared from the evidence of Sgt Lai that CNB would take over the case only if the accused was trafficking in the 24 sachets.
In compliance with the direction of ASP Lim, Sgt Lai interviewed the accused from 2.15pm to 2.30pm that day and interviewed Sanusi immediately thereafter. Later at about 6.20pm just before leaving office he noted what the accused told him in his pocket book. The prosecution sought to adduce in evidence the conversation between the accused and Sgt Lai and the extract from the pocket book. The defence objected to this conversation or the extract from the pocket book being admitted in evidence and a trial-within-a-trial was held to determine admissibility.
Before the commencement of the trial-within-a-trial Sanusi was called to testify for the prosecution. All that the prosecution sought to adduce from Sanusi was that the clutch bag belonged to the accused and Sanusi did not know that there was heroin therein. The defence, however, sought to adduce evidence from Sanusi that he and the accused had been consuming heroin together at the Pasir Ris site.
It was obvious when defence counsel began questioning Sanusi that Sanusi was a very frightened man. He claimed to have known the accused for only one or two months prior to arrest. Sanusi, however, agreed that at a construction site at Pasir Ris he and the accused had consumed heroin together. He denied that he worked at that site and said that he did not know if the accused worked there. He also denied having been arrested for drug activities at any time prior to 6 July 1994. As the questioning progressed it became progressively more apparent that Sanusi was very uneasy about answering questions. He was on several occasions not even speaking out his answers. Counsel for the defence pointed out that at the preliminary inquiry Sanusi, when questioned, had denied knowing the accused at all. When I asked Sanusi to speak up Sanusi claimed that he had a sore throat. At that stage I decided that it would be best that the cross-examination of Sanusi be stood down until a later date.
 First trial-within-a-trial 
Sgt Lai told the court that he interviewed the accused in English. He said that the accused could understand English and so he did not ask the accused whether he wished to speak in Malay. Before interviewing the accused he laid out the 24 sachets on the table in front of the accused and counted the 24 sachets. He then questioned the accused. Sgt Lai said that he jotted down what the accused said in note form on a piece of paper. At about 6.20pm that evening just before he left the station, Sgt Lai wrote out in his pocket book an expanded account of what he had noted on the paper. He then destroyed the piece of paper. At that time he also recorded on his pocket book other events that had taken place in the day such as what Cpl Rajandran told him about the arrest, his telephone call to ASP Lim and his interview with Sanusi. He agreed with counsel that he was in a hurry when he made the entries in his pocket book as he had to take a bus and get to a management class scheduled to begin at 7pm at Paterson Road.
Sgt Lai agreed that the assignment by ASP Lim to interview the accused was an important assignment. He was aware that if the accused was trafficking in the heroin the accused would face the death penalty. When asked why, in spite of this knowledge, he did not record a proper statement from the accused, have it read back to the accused and get the accused to sign it or at least have his pocket book with him and note what the accused said in the pocket book, Sgt Lai responded that as he was in the vicinity just prior to the interview and he did not take the trouble to go up to his office and take his pocket book. Sgt Lai told the court that as a plainclothes officer he was not expected to carry his pocket book with him and it was his practice to leave his pocket book in the drawer in his office and make entries therein only when he was free.
I found it difficult to believe Sgt Lai`s claims as to how pocket books were to be entered. It might be acceptable not to take notes at all or to jot notes on a piece of paper where an officer was on surveillance duty but to suggest that it was accepted practice, in the context of a formal interview with an accused person, to make notes on a piece of paper and then destroy the notes after transcribing the contents into his pocket book was an assertion that I found very surprising. If that was so, it would defeat the whole purpose of having pocket books. I therefore asked the learned DPP to produce in court the directions, if any, issued by the Police Force in respect of the maintenance of pocket books. Through Sgt Lai, the Police General Orders (PGO) on the subject was produced. What the PGO said was quite contrary to the claim made by Sgt Lai.
The PGO made it obligatory for police officers (uniformed or not) to keep pocket books with them at all times and it contained very clear and eminently sensible directions on how pocket books were to be maintained. It was provided for instance, in O 4, that entries `shall be made in the pocket book whenever possible at the time of occurrence`. An officer in plainclothes in order to prevent disclosure of his identity was permitted under O 4 to make notes on a piece of paper but such notes had to be copied into the pocket book as soon as possible and the original retained as an exhibit in case of need. Order 6 provided that entries should be clearly written in indelible ink, that entries should be recorded chronologically on serially numbered pages, that no erasures should be made, that if any correction was to be made the erroneous entry was to be crossed out in such a way that it was still legible, that there should be no space left blank between entries and leaves should not, for any purpose, be torn out of pocket books. Order 6 also stated that to ensure reliability of the pocket book the provisions therein should be `strictly complied with`. Order 7 provided that where occurrences recorded in pocket books were likely to become the subject of legal proceedings they should be recorded in the fullest possible detail including `actual words of relevant statements`. To ensure that police officers kept their pocket books properly, it was even provided that pocket books were to be checked weekly by supervising officers and it was provided (in O 8) that where a pocket book is used to record a statement, the statement shall be recorded in compliance with s 121(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC).
When confronted with the provisions of the PGO and asked if he knew of those provisions, Sgt Lai admitted that he did. When asked why he had not followed them, Sgt Lai claimed that he had forgotten about them.
Sgt Lai told the court that when he interviewed the accused, the accused looked normal and, except for looking tired, did not appear to be suffering from drug withdrawal. It would appear, however, that Sgt Lai knew that the accused was in fact a drug addict. In the extract from the pocket book that the prosecution was seeking to admit in evidence Sgt Lai had noted that, at 11.30am that morning, Cpl Rajandran had informed him that the accused was arrested for the possession of 24 sachets of heroin, for suspicion of consuming drugs and for failing to report for urine test.
Sgt Lai agreed that in drug withdrawal there were a number of symptoms like chill, vomiting and diarrhoea that would not be apparent to him when he interviewed the accused. He agreed that he did not ask the accused if he was all right. He said that as the accused appeared normal it did not occur to him that it would be preferable to send the accused for a medical examination of his drug condition prior to recording any statement from him.
In his pocket book Sgt Lai had recorded the accused as having said that he `
 intended 
` to sell the `
 sachets of powdery substance 
` for $150 a sachet. When it was put to Sgt Lai that the accused could not have used the word `intended` as the accused would not know the meaning of that word, Sgt Lai disagreed. There was at that stage a pause in the questioning in order to locate the extract from the pocket book to see the actual words recorded therein. During this pause Sgt Lai changed his testimony. He said that although in the pocket book he had put down the word `intended` the accused had in fact said he `wanted` to sell the drugs. When asked why he used the word `intended` when the accused had used the word `wanted`, Sgt Lai replied that to him `intended` and `wanted` had the same meaning and so he wrote down `intended`. When pressed why he did so he replied that he was not careful when he recorded into the pocket book. When I commented that it appeared to me that Sgt Lai had changed his testimony because he probably realized that the accused`s command of English would not be high enough to have used a word like `intended`, Sgt Lai agreed that that was so.
Cpl Rajandran told the court that when he went to the accused`s cell that afternoon to fetch the accused for interview by Sgt Lai, he found the accused asleep. He had to wake the accused up before he could escort the accused to the interview room. Cpl Rajandran confirmed that during the interview the accused looked sleepy. Cpl Rajandran also told the court, both in examination-in-chief and in cross-examination, that during the interview he saw Sgt Lai write down the questions asked and the answers given on a piece of paper. In re-examination, the prosecution tried to establish that as Cpl Rajandran did not actually read what Sgt Lai wrote he would not be able to say whether he was writing down the questions as well as the answers. Cpl Rajandran confirmed that he did not actually read what Sgt Lai wrote.
At the request of the defence the prosecution called Sanusi and offered Sanusi for cross-examination for the purposes of the trial-within-a-trial. Counsel for the defence sought a ruling from the court that Sanusi should not be a prosecution witness but should be a defence witness. Counsel complained that what the prosecution was seeking to do by making Sanusi a prosecution witness was to deny to the defence the opportunity of interviewing Sanusi and preparing its defence with the benefit of such an interview. I refused this application. If the prosecution chose to call as a witness a person who should obviously be a defence witness, the prosecution ran the risk of their witness turning hostile. But that was a matter for the prosecution to decide. Clearly, it was not the province of the court to decide for the prosecution whom they should or should not call as their witness.
In view of the impression I had formed earlier about Sanusi`s reluctance to testify about his association with the accused, I explained to Sanusi that it was important that he told the truth as the accused was facing a capital charge and assured him that whatever he said could not be used as evidence against him in any proceedings against him. This assurance appeared to have given some comfort to Sanusi. His testimony thereafter was somewhat more enthusiastic although he still appeared somewhat frightened and furtive.
Sanusi told the court that at the time of his arrest he was a casual labourer working at a construction site in the Pasir Ris area. He was a heroin addict. For about four to five months prior to his arrest he had been consuming heroin regularly with the accused at that construction site. They consumed heroin by the intravenous method. Whenever erimin was available they would mix erimin with the heroin before injecting. In addition, they would at times also take erimin orally.
Sanusi said that, on the morning of 6 July 1994, he and the accused had, as usual, injected themselves with heroin. He could not recall how many straws of heroin had been used but agreed that it could be two straws. Subsequently at the request of the accused, Sanusi accompanied the accused to a pawnshop along Changi Road where the accused bought some jewellery. After that he and the accused were going into the Karachi Restaurant next door when they were both arrested.
The accused told the court that he was very poor in his studies and had failed his Primary 6 examinations. He then gave up going to school and started work as a cleaner. He began to consume heroin in 1992 when he was 16 years of age. At the time of his arrest he was an intravenous user of heroin. He would use one two-and-three-quarter inch straw of heroin every two hours or so. When erimin was available he would also consume erimin. He told the court that that morning he had mixed two erimin tablets with the heroin which he and Sanusi had injected intravenously. In addition, he had also taken four erimin tablets orally. He said that because of the drugs he was sleepy and he could remember very little of what happened at the police station. When asked by his counsel if he could recall `even vaguely` that he told Sgt Lai that he intended to sell the drugs, the accused replied that he recalled having said that the heroin was his when the clutch bag and the sachets of heroin were shown to him but beyond that he could not recall what transpired at the station. When the DPP asked whether he knew what he was doing that morning he replied that he could recall going to the goldsmith shop with Sanusi and buying jewellery and he could also remember being arrested at the restaurant next door.
An allegation had been made in the cross-examination of prosecution witnesses that the accused had not been given any drinks or any lunch prior to the interview with Sgt Lai. There was patently no merit in this suggestion. The accused himself, when giving evidence, made no claim that he had not been given lunch. To the contrary, his evidence was that because he had, since the morning, not injected himself again he had withdrawal symptoms in the lock-up, and was not interested in lunch. He said that he could not take lunch. If he did, he would vomit.
Counsel, in his submission at the close of the trial-within-a-trial, did not seek to pursue the suggestion that the accused had not been given food. He conceded that there was no evidence of any inducement, threat or promise but submitted that the court should nevertheless in the exercise of its discretion refuse to admit the conversation between Sgt Lai and the accused as recorded in the pocket book of Sgt Lai.
In support of his submission that the court had such a discretion, counsel relied on the case of 
PP v Vasavan Sathiadew & Ors
 
 [1990] 1 MLJ 150 
 . There the trial judges had refused to admit two statements made to the police, one under s 122(6) and one under s 121 because the interpreter used was not sufficiently familiar with the Thai dialect used by that accused. There was in that case no suggestion that there had been any inducement, threat or promise in connection with the two statements. In declining to admit the statements the trial judges had specifically said that they were so doing in the exercise of their discretion.
The DPP submitted that there were only three categories of cases where the court could exclude a statement made by an accused person to a police officer of or above the rank of sergeant. These were where there was (1) inducement; (2) threat; or (3) promise emanating from a person in authority in the circumstances described in the proviso to s 122(5). He submitted that other categories such as where there was assault or oppressive conduct were no more than instances of inducement. In such cases the officer by assaulting the accused or by depriving the accused of food or by subjecting the accused to prolonged interrogation was attempting to induce the person to confess. The DPP submitted that outside of the three categories stated in the proviso there was only one situation where the court could exclude a statement. This was where the purported statement was not made by the accused at all. He submitted that 
 PP v Vasavan Sathiadew & Ors 
 was such an instance since a statement recorded without proper interpretation could not be said to be a statement made by the accused.
I was inclined to agree with the learned DPP that categories such as assault and oppression were no more than instances of inducements or threats. I could not, however, agree with his submission that outside of inducement, threat and promise the only instance when the court could exclude a statement was when the statement was not the statement of the accused. That submission would not sit well with the words used in s 122(5). It is clear from the proviso to s 122(5) that where it appeared that there was inducement, threat or promise the court was obliged to reject and had no discretion to admit the statement. It was only in situations not covered by the proviso that a discretion could be said to exist. The relevant part of s 122(5) reads: 
 
... any statement made by an accused person ... 
 shall be admissible
 in his trial as evidence ... . [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The words used are `shall be admissible` not `shall be admitted`. On a plain construction of s 122(5) it appeared to me that, where the proviso did not apply, the court was vested with a discretion to admit or reject such statements. The trial judges in 
 PP v Vasavan Sathiadew & Ors 
 were doing no more than exercising that discretion.
The question that then arose was whether I should, in the circumstances under which the interview between Sgt Lai and the accused was conducted, in the exercise of my discretion, decline to admit the entries in the pocket book made by Sgt Lai and Sgt Lai`s evidence as to what the accused said at the interview.
There was a conflict between the evidence of Cpl Rajandran and the evidence of Sgt Lai as to how Sgt Lai had recorded the interview. The conflict may have been resolved if Sgt Lai had kept that piece of paper, but in direct violation of the provisions of the PGO, Sgt Lai had destroyed it. The accuracy with which Sgt Lai transferred what was on the paper to the pocket book, the casual manner in which Sgt Lai undertook this very serious assignment from ASP Lim and the complete disregard that Sgt Lai had for the provisions of s 121 of the CPC and for the very meticulous and carefully drawn up provisions of the PGO all troubled me. I was also troubled by the fact that in seeking to record a statement from an accused person in a capital case Sgt Lai had, in respect of a person whose command of English could not have been good, not taken the elementary precaution of having an interpreter. In view of these irregularities, I felt that it would be prudent to defer a ruling till the end of the case for the prosecution.
 Sanusi 
When the submissions for the trial-within-a-trial ended, Sanusi was recalled for continued cross-examination in the main trial. Sanusi told the court that he started consuming heroin in 1988. At that time he consumed by `chasing the dragon`. He was arrested soon after and placed in the drug rehabilitation centre (DRC) for 21 days. In 1990, he was again arrested and on this occasion detained for 12 months. When released he resumed consuming heroin. As time went by he found that `chasing the dragon` did not give him a sufficient `high` and so he began to take heroin intravenously.
Sanusi said that he first met the accused in mid-1993 and they had consumed heroin together intravenously. Thereafter, he met the accused again in early 1994 at the Pasir Ris site where he worked as a labourer. They became good friends and for about four to five months prior to his arrest he consumed heroin together with the accused for four or five days in a week. The heroin was provided by the accused. He also had other sources of supply. He said that when erimin tablets were available, they would mix erimin with the heroin before injection. He would at times also take erimin orally. He told the court that on the morning of 6 July 1994 he had, with the accused, injected a mixture of heroin and erimin. He had also consumed two tablets of erimin orally.
Sanusi told the court that he paid the accused for the heroin he consumed. There was no fixed pattern of payment. Sometimes he would pay $10 to $20 each time he consumed, at times he would pay $45 for a 1/2 sachet, at times he would hand to the accused larger sums of money to assist in the purchase of heroin and at times he would not pay immediately but would pay the accused when he had money available. He told the court that as a casual labourer he earned $60 per day most of which he used for the consumption of heroin.
Sanusi agreed that there was no security at the construction site where he and the accused stayed. There were many workers living there. There was no cupboard or locker available to either of them to keep their valuables secure. Sanusi said that he was himself not aware that on the morning of 6 July 1994 the accused had 24 sachets of heroin in his clutch bag but he agreed that it would be unsafe for the accused to leave the heroin at the site when leaving the site.
Sanusi told the court that after his arrest on 6 July 1994 he was sent to Sembawang DRC. He has been in detention at the DRC since then. When shown his DRC clinical sheet (D7), Sanusi agreed that at the DRC he had denied being an intravenous user. He said that no one at the DRC had examined his arms or legs. If anyone had, they would have seen the intravenous scars.
 Handphone, pager and other items 
When the accused was arrested, besides the 24 sachets of heroin, he had $3,026.28 in cash, a handphone and a pager and he was wearing various gold ornaments. He also had with him a diary cover in which there were several documents. Amongst the documents was an invoice dated 10 June 1994 from the firm that had sold the handphone found in the clutch bag. The invoice showed the purchaser to be one Marhaffis bin Mohamad (Marhaffis). Marhaffis testified that he had on 10 June 1994 bought the handphone on behalf of the accused as the accused did not have his identity card. Apparently to purchase a handphone the purchaser has to produce his identity card. Also in the diary was a licence in respect of handphone No 8269776. The licence was valid for one year and was effective from 13 June 1994.
Sanusi testified that the pager found on the accused belonged to his brother. As his brother was not using the pager, he (Sanusi) had about one week prior to their arrest lent the pager to the accused. There were arrears of Telecom charges on the pager. These were paid by the accused. A Telecom bill dated 27 May 1994 for an overdue amount of $164 found in the `diary` of the accused showed that this overdue amount was paid on 5 July 1994.
 The s 122(6) statement 
Insp Chow told the court that he was not told, when the accused was handed to him by Cpl Rajandran, that the accused was an addict. He also did not see the accused suffering from any withdrawal symptoms. To him the accused looked normal. The same evening he referred the accused for a medical examination. He said that he did so as a matter of routine prior to recording a s 122(6) statement, to ensure that there was no injury on the accused and in order to ensure that the accused was not high on drugs or suffering from drug withdrawal.
Insp Chow agreed that to refer the accused for a medical examination he had to fill up a form. When asked to produce a copy of that form, Insp Chow protested that it was a confidential document and that he did not know if he was allowed to produce it. I overruled this protest and ordered that the form be produced. Insp Chow`s evidence thereafter was a little flustered. He said that in the form he would not specify those things (meaning whether the accused was high on drugs) and that if it were a withdrawal case the hospital would as a matter of routine refer the prisoner straight to Changi Prison Hospital. He then looked at the form, which he had with him, and told the court that in the form he had asked (only) for a pre-statement medical check-up. The form was then produced (D3). In the form, there were a number of columns describing the type of medical examination required. One of these columns was `Drug Intoxication`. This column had not been ticked. Insp Chow was asked why he had told the court that he had requested the doctor to examine the accused for drug withdrawal when the form did not indicate so. He said he made a mistake. When asked why he claimed the form was confidential, he said that the form said so. There was no such statement on the form.
At about 7.30pm Insp Chow, with the assistance of a Malay interpreter, recorded a statement from the accused under the provisions of s 122(6) of the CPC. In the statement the accused in answer to the charge that he had that morning at the Karachi Restaurant been trafficking in diamorphine had said: `All the heroin are mine.` The prosecution did not want this statement to be admitted but at the request of the defence it was admitted in evidence as a defence exhibit.
 Raid on the accused`s residence 
Insp Chow confirmed that that evening, at his request, the accused had led Insp Chow and a party of CNB officers to his mother`s house where a search was conducted. Insp Chow had not, on the day of the arrest or at any other time, gone to the Pasir Ris construction site. When asked why he had not done so, Insp Chow said that the accused had refused to take him there. There was no mention of such a refusal in the long statement recorded from the accused, nor was Insp Chow`s pocket book produced to show that he had made an entry noting the accused`s refusal. Insp Chow was asked why, if the accused had refused, he had not asked Sanusi to take him to the Pasir Ris site. Insp Chow replied that he first saw Sanusi only on 15 August 1994. He saw Sanusi again only when he accompanied the DPP to see Sanusi at the DRC about a week before this hearing started.
 Second trial-within-a-trial 
Insp Chow had on 8 and 9 July 1994, with the assistance of a Malay interpreter, recorded a statement from the accused (long statement). The DPP told the court that he had deleted from this long statement matters that were prejudicial or irrelevant to this trial and was seeking to admit this edited statement in evidence. Defence counsel objected. Counsel was of the view that there was material in the edited statement that was still irrelevant and highly prejudicial and drew the attention of the court to the comments of Yong Pung How CJ in 
Wong Kim Poh v PP
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 289
  that prosecutors should ensure that irrelevant and prejudicial evidence contained in police statements are not admitted in evidence. In the course of the trial-within-a-trial the DPP made further deletions to the long statement whereupon the defence withdrew its objections and the re-edited long statement (P31A and P31B) was admitted in evidence.
In the long statement the accused gave a history of how he became a drug addict in mid-1992, how he graduated to consuming heroin by the intravenous method in mid-1993, of his arrest and detention at the DRC in end-1992 (sic), of his release on a supervision order, of his failure to report for tests thereafter as required, of his stay at Pasir Ris construction site where he worked as a labourer, of his consuming six to seven straws of heroin a day by that time, of his proceeding with his friend `Ochi` after having consumed a straw of heroin to a pawnshop to buy gold and of their arrest at the Karachi Restaurant next door. In this statement the accused mentioned that besides the heroin he had two slabs of erimin tablets in the clutch bag that he had with him that day.
 Accused`s drug history 
Insp Chow had with him the CNB record of the accused. The defence called for its production. The record revealed that prior to 6 July 1994 the accused had been arrested on two previous occasions and sent to the DRC. The first occasion was on 12 March 1992 and the second time was 4 January 1994. The record showed that on the second occasion he was after one week placed on a supervision order for 24 months. This meant he had to report regularly for urine tests.
Although Insp Chow knew that the accused was on record as a drug addict, he had not, as part of his investigations, verified with the DRC the extent of the accused`s past addiction to drugs. He did so only in the course of the hearing on the instructions of the DPP. When asked by the defence to produce the medical reports on the accused that he had obtained from the DRC, Insp Chow produced a report by one Dr Abdul Malik of the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre dated 6 January 1994. In the report Dr Malik stated: 
 
I detected sufficient clinical evidence of drug withdrawal syndrome consistent with addiction to opiates.
 
 
 
In my opinion he is presently mildly addicted to heroin.
Insp Chow had not obtained the medical report on Sanusi when Sanusi was admitted to the DRC on 7 July 1994.
 DSS analysis 
The 24 sachets suspected to be heroin were sent to the Department of Scientific Services (DSS) for analysis. They were found to contain no less than 28.36g of diamorphine. A sample of the accused`s urine had also been obtained on 6 July 1994. That was also sent for analysis. It was found to contain 572 micrograms of morphine per 5ml of urine. Both the chemists who testified agreed that that was a very high quantity of morphine to be found in a person`s urine. A sample of Sanusi`s urine had also been sent for analysis. It was found to contain 1,167 micrograms of morphine per 5ml of urine.
 Dr Abdul Malik 
Dr Malik had not been called as a witness at the preliminary inquiry. The learned DPP decided to call him since the history of the accused`s drug consumption was a material issue in this trial.
Dr Malik told the court that the accused was first admitted to the DRC on 12 March 1992. He had been admitted again on 4 January 1993. Dr Malik had not examined the accused in March 1992 but in January 1993 he had examined the accused on three successive days after admission. Based on the withdrawal symptoms he noted on those three days and the accused`s statement to the staff nurse as noted in the case sheet (P33) that the accused consumed two to three straws of heroin per day, he put up the medical report referred to earlier. Dr Malik agreed that there was a tendency amongst patients to understate the amount of heroin they consumed in order to try and avoid being detained at the DRC.
The classification used by the DRC to describe addiction was mild/moderate/severe in ascending order of severity. Dr Malik told the court that the classification was based on the number and severity of withdrawal symptoms detected on the first three days after the patient is admitted. Dr Malik was of the view that there was a co-relation between the quantity of heroin consumed and the severity of the withdrawal symptoms. In his view less than two straws per day would cause mild withdrawal symptoms, three to five straws per day would cause moderate withdrawal symptoms and more than five straws per day would cause severe withdrawal symptoms. He said that the symptoms would disappear in a few days so that classification would depend on how soon after consumption of heroin the patient was examined. In view of this, he could not be certain that the accused was only a mild addict, he could well be a moderate addict.
Dr Malik told the court that urine analysis was a more objective test than looking for physical manifestations of withdrawal symptoms. Dr Malik was then told that the accused`s urine was found to contain 572.7 micrograms of morphine per 5ml of urine and was asked for his comments on the accused`s state of addiction. Dr Malik declined comment saying this was not within his field of expertise.
Dr Malik, led by the learned DPP, told the court that when he examined the accused in January 1994 he did not see any signs of intravenous injection marks on the accused`s arms. He said that he could say this because there was no note in his clinical records to indicate he had seen such marks. In cross-examination, Dr Malik agreed that the absence of a note did not necessarily mean that he had examined the arms and found no intravenous marks. In re-examination, the DPP sought to establish from Dr Malik that he had examined the accused again on 8 January 1994 for asthma and that in the course of that examination, if there were needle marks on the arms, he would have seen them and noted them in his clinical notes. The DPP sought to seek Dr Malik`s confirmation that as there was no such note it meant that there was no such marks. In my view this line of questioning by the DPP was somewhat too robust and I made my displeasure known. Dr Malik perhaps picked up the cue from that. He said that in examining for asthma he does not need to look at the arms and so even if there were intravenous marks on the arms he may not have noticed them.
Dr Malik was also the doctor who examined Sanusi when Sanusi was admitted to the DRC on 7 July 1994. After examining Sanusi on 7, 8 and 9 July 1994, Dr Malik certified that he detected sufficient clinical evidence of drug withdrawal consistent with addiction to opiates and he opined that Sanusi was mildly addicted to heroin.
From his records, Dr Malik confirmed that Sanusi was first admitted to DRC on 9 July 1988 and released on 30 July 1988. He was admitted again on 20 February 1990 and released on 13 February 1991. He told the court that three relapses indicated that there was a very high chance that Sanusi will not be able to give up drugs. Sanusi, he agreed, was a bad case of drug addiction. When asked why, if that was so, he had described Sanusi in his report as `mildly addicted`, he said that that was based on the physical signs of withdrawal seen on Sanusi when Sanusi was examined. If he had found more signs he would have put `moderate`. When told that the urine sample taken from Sanusi showed the presence of 1,167 micrograms of morphine per 5ml of urine, Dr Malik said that taking that into account, he would categorize Sanusi as a moderate addict.
Dr Malik agreed that classification of drug addiction by reference to withdrawal symptoms was a very subjective method of evaluating the degree of addiction. He agreed that the existence of symptoms would depend on when the doctor sees the patient and also on the doctor`s subjective view of the intensity of the symptoms. To illustrate this Dr Malik told the court that in July 1994 when Sanusi was admitted, another doctor, Dr Richard Wee, had concurrently examined Sanusi on the first three days. Dr Wee had reported that he did not detect sufficient signs of drug withdrawal symptoms and that Sanusi was not an addict.
It was never in dispute that Sanusi was an intravenous abuser and that up to 6 July 1994 when he was arrested he had been injecting himself intravenously. Sanusi`s evidence was that there were intravenous scars on his arms and leg. The scars were still visible when Sanusi was examined in court. There was, however, no note in the admission records of Sanusi of any intravenous scars. Dr Malik, when asked if he saw any needle marks on Sanusi`s arms, said that he could not be sure. He said that if he found any positive sign he would record it, but no conclusion could be drawn from the absence of such an entry. This was obviously the correct position.
 Wong Soon Ann 
Wong Soon Ann (Wong) was a staff nurse who had interviewed the accused on 4 January 1994 when the accused was taken to the DRC. Like Dr Malik, Wong was not called as a witness at the preliminary inquiry and was a last minute witness. The DPP called Wong in order to have the contents in the case sheet (P33) referred to by Dr Malik admitted in evidence and to establish that when he examined the accused in January 1994 there were no intravenous scars on the accused`s arms.
Wong told the court that as a rule he was the person who took the drug history of a patient before Dr Malik saw the patient. He confirmed that most of the entries on the case sheet (P33) of the accused were made by him. He said that the accused admitted to him that he consumed two to three straws of heroin per day for eight to nine months. The accused denied intravenous abuse. Wong said that he had under `Withdrawal Symptoms` written `cool sensation` because when asked the patient told him that he was feeling chilly. He said that he does not specifically ask a patient if the patient was having nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or other symptoms of drug withdrawal but if the patient tells him he would note it.
With Wong the DPP followed the same line of questioning as he had with Dr Malik. In P33 there is a pre-stamped section which reads: I/V Abuse: Yes/Denies. Wong told the court that he would ask the patient if he was an intravenous abuser and note his response accordingly in that column. He said that if he sees signs of intravenous abuse on the patient he would also note that on the form. In answer to the DPP, Wong told the court that since in this case he had not made a note of any intravenous mark it meant that there was no such mark.
Wong was invited, in the course of cross-examination, to have a look at the accused`s arms to see for himself whether intravenous marks were present. Wong did so. He was then asked if he would agree that there were four tracks of needle marks. After some hesitation and after having, on invitation, looked at the accused`s arms again, Wong confirmed that that was so. When asked whether such marks were present when he examined the accused on 4 January 1994, Wong said that at that time he did not see the marks. If he did, he would have made a note on P33. Wong went on to say that if the patient denied intravenous use he would look at the patient`s arms. Wong was questioned at length on this aspect of his evidence but he maintained that the absence of a note to the contrary in the case sheet meant that the accused had no needle marks on his arms. Later in his evidence, Wong went even further. He said that he would examine the arms as well as the legs of every patient to see if there are needle marks. He considered this important because intravenous abusers are a high risk group for HIV.
 First trial-within-a-trial 
At the first trial-within-a-trial no expert evidence had been called to testify on the effect of heroin and erimin on a person. At the close of the prosecution case counsel sought leave to call Dr Lim Yun Chin (Dr Lim) to testify as an expert in that trial-within-a-trial.
Dr Lim was a consultant psychiatrist in private practice. He had read the accused`s long statement. He had been told that the accused started taking heroin intravenously from mid-1993 and that by March 1994 he required six to seven straws of heroin per day to sustain his craving and was also adding erimin to the heroin before injection and taking erimin orally. Dr Lim also examined the accused and Sanusi in court.
Dr Lim told the court that there were intravenous scars on both arms of the accused around the elbow regions as well as on his lower left forearm. He said the scars were visible because of granulations caused by impurities present in street heroin. The granulations could also be caused by erimin mixed with the heroin as erimin is not easily soluble in water. He found a similar amount of scars on the arms of Sanusi. Sanusi also had scars on his right calf muscles. The scars on Sanusi and on the accused were all old scars and Dr Lim said that he would not venture any opinion as to when or over what period of time the scars had occurred. He said that if he had seen the scars at about the time the accused and Sanusi were arrested he would have been able to say whether they were fresh at that time but even then, except for noting the fresh scars, he would not, in respect of scars that had healed, have been able to say over what period of time the scars were caused.
Dr Lim told the court that the degree of a person`s addiction to drugs could not be measured by reference to the withdrawal symptoms he suffers from. He said that most general practitioners would use the physical withdrawal symptoms as a guide to the severity of addiction but it was not a reliable guide.
Dr Lim told the court that erimin was a potent hypnotic drug and was indicated for persons suffering from insomnia. Erimin in excess of the usual dosage of one tablet per night can cause amnesia. It would also induce excessive drowsiness and clouding of consciousness. This would result in judgment being impaired and the patient having a degree of disorientation. Dr Lim said that when erimin and heroin are combined the effects would not only be additive but would be potentiating.
Dr Lim opined that the fact that the accused, in spite of facing so severe a charge, had fallen asleep and had to be awakened at 2pm to give a statement to Sgt Lai suggested that both his mental and physical states, at that stage, were totally under the influence of the drugs he had consumed. He also pointed out that when a person is awakened from sleep he would not become alert immediately. There is a lag period of drowsiness and this would be more severe for a person on drugs especially erimin where the drug activity was still going on. Dr Lim told the court that, given the accused`s drug history, at the time the police awoke the accused in the lock-up, he would have been experiencing the full effects of the erimin. This would mean that at that time he would have been excessively drowsy, his judgment and awareness would be impaired and he could suffer from memory loss.
Dr Lim was asked how, if the accused was in fact suffering from cloudiness of the mind as a result of the erimin, he could have taken a taxi to the goldsmith shop, bought some gold jewellery and then gone to the coffeeshop next door. Dr Lim responded that after consuming an excessive dose of erimin the person can be coherent and know what he is doing but if the activity occurs during the peak period of the drug then his alertness would be impaired and there will be difficulty in remembering what happened. Dr Lim was of the view that a person who has not developed tolerance to erimin would feel the effect of the erimin within about 1/2 hour. But where a person has developed tolerance the onset of drowsiness may not occur for some hours.
At the stage when the first trial-within-a-trial closed, the only evidence that the accused was a drug addict was the accused`s own evidence and Cpl Rajandran`s evidence that he suspected that the accused was an addict because his gait was unsteady. As against this there was the evidence of Sgt Lai that the accused was normal. At the close of the prosecution case there was considerably more material before me on this issue. The accused`s claim that he was addicted to drugs from 1992 was supported by the fact that in 1992 and in 1994 he had been arrested and sent to the DRC. His claim that he was mixing heroin and erimin and taking the mixture intravenously was supported by the evidence of Sanusi. In addition, the accused in his long statement, recorded only two days after his arrest, had said that there were erimin tablets in the clutch bag he had with him. No tablets were produced in court but that may well be because the erimin tablets had fallen out of the clutch bag together with the paper clips and bits of paper when Cpl Rajandran emptied the clutch bag.
Dr Lim`s testimony on the effects of erimin, the effects of heroin and erimin combined and his testimony that erimin causes amnesia was unchallenged but the DPP urged that I reject Dr Lim`s evidence that the accused was suffering from these effects as Dr Lim`s evidence was merely hypothetical - he not having examined the accused at the relevant time. The DPP urged that I accept the evidence of Sgt Lai and Insp Chow that the accused was normal.
On the totality of the evidence for the trial-within-a-trial, I accepted the accused`s evidence that he was a drug addict and that on the morning of the 6th he had taken erimin orally and injected himself intravenously with a mixture of heroin and erimin. I accepted Dr Lim`s evidence that if the accused had consumed the heroin and erimin as claimed he would suffer from disorientation, drowsiness and a clouding of consciousness which would have impaired his judgment. Although Dr Lim said that the severity of these effects at any particular point of time could vary and would lie on a continuum between normal alertness and being in a coma, I accepted his evidence that bearing in mind the accused`s drug history, the time at which he injected himself with the mixture and the fact that he was awakened from sleep just prior to the interview, all suggested that the accused would be on the higher end of the continuum rather than the lower end at that time. In the light of Dr Lim`s evidence and my finding that the accused was a drug addict and had in fact consumed heroin and erimin that morning, I accepted the accused`s evidence that he had little or no recall of what transpired between him and Sgt Lai.
The learned DPP had submitted that even if the court found that the accused, at the time of the interview with Sgt Lai, was suffering from the effect of heroin and erimin, the court should nevertheless admit the statement in evidence as matters such as the state of his mind at the time he gave the statement and even whether he was sufficiently competent in the English language, bearing in mind the brevity of the statement as it appears in the pocket book, were matters that went toward weight and not admissibility.
The DPP drew the attention of the court to the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Garnam Singh v PP
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 243
  and referred the court in particular to the following passage in the judgment delivered by Karthigesu JA: 
 
With due respect to Prof Lee, his evidence fell far short of demonstrating how the effects of withdrawal from drugs affected the appellant`s medical and psychological condition. We would conceive that, in order for the effects of withdrawal from drugs to affect the drug user`s medical and psychological condition to render any statement he makes to be involuntary, 
 he must be in a state of near delirium
, that is to say, that 
 his mind did not go with the statements he was making
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
On the strength of that passage the learned DPP submitted that the court should refuse to admit the statement only if the accused was at the relevant time in near delirium. The DPP again highlighted the evidence of Sgt Lai that the accused appeared normal and pointed out that the accused himself had not given evidence of his being in any way delirious but had only said that he had no recollection of what transpired at the interview with Sgt Lai. He also drew attention to the fact that, far from being delirious, the accused that morning had his wits sufficiently around him to take a taxi and go shopping for gold ornaments with Sanusi.
Learned counsel for the defence, in his submissions, had referred to a note in 
 Blackstone on Criminal Practice 
where the learned authors under the heading `Exclusion (of Confessions) for Unreliability` had in reference to the case of 
 R v Miller 
 
[1986] 1 WLR 1191
 said that there the Court of Appeal had acknowledged the existence of a discretion to refuse to admit a confession which came from a mind which at the time was possibly irrational and what was said may have been the product of delusions and hallucinations. The DPP submitted that 
 Miller 
`s case referred to in 
 Blackstone 
 went no further than 
 Garnam Singh 
`s case. He pointed out that although in 
 Miller 
 the statement was made by a person who at that time was possibly in so irrational a state of mind that what he said might have been the product of delusion and hallucination, the court, nevertheless, admitted the statement. He submitted that 
 Miller 
`s case in fact supported his submission that the statement made to Sgt Lai should be admitted.
It is true that in 
 Garnam Singh 
 the issue before the Court of Appeal was whether the appellant, being a heavy user of drugs, was so affected by the withdrawal from the drugs after arrest that the statement given by him would not have been given voluntarily and was, therefore, inadmissible. But a detailed consideration of that case will show that the appellant had been hospitalized immediately after arrest and had remained in hospital for some five days. It was only after his discharge from hospital that the statement was recorded. The trial judge in admitting the statement had found that when the accused was discharged from hospital he had recovered from the effects of withdrawal. The Court of Appeal accepted that finding of fact and it was in that context that Karthigesu JA made the statement relied on by the DPP. 
 Garnam Singh 
 was, therefore, a very different situation from the present where on the evidence I accept that the statement was recorded at a time when the effect of the erimin was at peak. On the test referred to by Karthigesu JA that `his mind did not go with the statements he was making` there was in my mind more than a reasonable doubt that that would describe the situation of the accused when he was interviewed by Sgt Lai.
In 
 R v Miller 
, the trial judge had admitted the confession of the accused who was known to be a paranoid schizophrenic. The Court of Appeal recognized that the trial judge had a discretion in the matter and the trial judge having admitted the confession the Court of Appeal saw no reason to interfere with that exercise of discretion. This is clear from the commentary in 
 Blackstone 
 quoted by counsel. It is also clear from the headnotes in the 
 Weekly Law Report 
 which reads: 
 
On appeal against conviction:
 
 
 
 
 
 Held 
 
, dismissing the appeal, that a trial judge had a discretion to refuse or to admit to evidence a confession which he had been satisfied was a voluntary one but had been made by a person who was possibly in an irrational state of mind and in which what was said might have been the product of delusion and hallucinations (post, p 1200D-E); that, accordingly, where a judge had carefully considered the exercise of that discretion it could not be said that he had erred in admitting such confessions to evidence (post, p 1200F).
 Garnam Singh`s case 
 and 
 Miller`s case 
, in my view did not support the learned DPP`s submissions that the statement allegedly made by the accused should be admitted. Both these cases go no further than to establish that where there is no inducement, threat or promise the court has a discretion whether to admit the statement or not. It did not follow from the fact that the statements in those cases had been admitted that the statement in this case should also be admitted.
My finding that the accused, at the time that Sgt Lai interviewed him, was not in a fit state to be interviewed, was by itself sufficient for me to rule the statement inadmissible. But there were a number of other factors each of which, in my view, also made it undesirable to admit the statement. I turn to consider these other factors.
The accused is a Malay boy who had, some years before his arrest, failed Primary 6, left school and started work as a cleaner. Sgt Lai interviewed him in English without offering him the services of a Malay interpreter. In this Sgt Lai was the odd man out. All other statements by the accused were recorded with the services of a Malay interpreter. Sgt Lai of course maintained that the accused was sufficiently proficient in English but when asked why he had said that the accused had used the word `wanted` and not used the word `intended` as recorded in his pocket book he agreed that the accused`s command of English was not sufficient for him to have used the word `intended`. I was satisfied that although the accused could speak a little bit of English it was of such a low standard that, whilst for the purposes of investigation there can be little objection to Sgt Lai speaking to the accused in English, if the prosecution desired to use the accused`s answers to Sgt Lai as evidence against the accused, a Malay interpreter should have been used. It would, in my view, be unsafe to admit as evidence a statement, short though it is, recorded without proper interpretation. In the courts we are particular that the evidence of a witness should be adduced in a language in which the witness is comfortable in. The same care should be exercised by the police in taking statements from accused persons where those statements are to be used as evidence against the accused.
In interviewing the accused, Sgt Lai had made notes on a piece of paper and some four hours later, in writing up his pocket book, had `expanded` the notes and entered them into his pocket book. Sgt Lai had ample time to comply with the provision of s 121 of the CPC and record a proper statement from the accused. He had ample time to read the statement back to the accused, ask the accused to confirm its accuracy and get the accused to sign it. Sgt Lai did nothing of this sort. He flagrantly disregarded the provisions of s 121 of the CPC and the provisions of the PGO. It is also to be noted that in `expanding` what was said by the accused Sgt Lai used words that were not uttered by the accused. I referred to the word `intended` above. It is obvious, looking at the entries in the pocket book, that the accused could also not have used words like `sachets of powdery substance`.
The DPP submitted that disregard of the PGO and s 121 of the CPC were irrelevant considerations and that the court should admit the statement regardless. In support of this proposition he quoted the judgment of Yong Pung How CJ, in 
Fung Yuk Shing v PP
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 421
  at p 425 where the learned Chief Justice in rejecting a submission that an entry in the pocket book transcribed thereon the next day from notes made on a piece of paper should not be admitted in evidence said: 
 
There was no real purpose which the production of the original piece of paper could have served. That piece of paper was never shown to the appellant, nor was it signed by him. Koh was the only person who ever saw that piece of paper. He was the person who made the original notes and who then transcribed them into the pocket book: and he was present in court to testify to this. We did not see how the omission to produce the original piece of paper could have prejudiced the appellant in any way, while Koh was available for cross-examination especially since the appellant himself took the stand to give evidence as to the whole interrogation which contradicted that of Koh`s. Indeed, counsel for the appellant in the court below cross-examined Koh as to his questioning of the appellant and the making of the pocket book entries. At the close of the rather detailed cross-examination, counsel put it to Koh that in fact the questioning session (or `interrogation`) had not taken place as described in the pocket book entries; that in fact Koh had only asked the appellant three questions and that the appellant had not at any stage related to Koh the version of events set down in Koh`s pocket book. All this was denied by Koh and it is clear that the learned judicial commissioner, having had the opportunity to observe both Koh and the appellant in the witness stand, was satisfied as to the veracity and credibility of Koh`s testimony, for (as we noted earlier) he stated: `I accepted his evidence on the interrogation and the pocket book entries to be honest and accurate, if not perfect accounts of the interrogation.`
 
 
 
It is clear from what the Chief Justice said that he was not advocating a carte blanche for police officers and narcotics officers to ignore s 121 and the directions so carefully spelt out in the PGO on the keeping of pocket books. All that the Chief Justice was saying was that on the facts of that case the trial judge could not be faulted for having admitted the statement in evidence as the trial judge was satisfied, in spite of the irregularities that were present, that Koh was a credible witness and the entries in his pocket book were honest and accurate.
In the present case, I was not so sanguine about the professionalism of Sgt Lai or the accuracy of his memory or record. His confident assertions in court that he was not required to have a pocket book with him and that it was accepted practice to make entries on pieces of paper and transcribe the entries later into the pocket book were, in my view, untruths. It is beyond belief that a staff sergeant with 16 years experience in the Force would be unaware of the importance of maintaining pocket books properly. In any event, when confronted with the PGO he admitted that he was aware of their contents. There were also glaring differences in Sgt Lai`s evidence and Cpl Rajandran`s evidence. Sgt Lai insisted that the accused was normal and did not show signs of being a drug addict. Cpl Rajandran on the other hand had noted, when he first apprehended the accused, that the accused`s gait was unsteady and he suspected that the accused was a drug addict. Cpl Rajandran also noted that when Sgt Lai interviewed the accused, the accused looked sleepy. Sgt Lai`s evidence was that he had only jotted down points on the piece of paper but Cpl Rajandran`s evidence was that Sgt Lai wrote down the questions asked as well as the answers given. Between the testimony of these two officers, I accepted the evidence of Cpl Rajandran. If Sgt Lai had recorded a statement from the accused on that piece of paper in the form of questions and answers, the question arose why he destroyed the paper. What Sgt Lai should have done in compliance with s 121(2) was to have read back to the accused what he had written and asked the accused to sign on the paper. There was no need to transcribe what was on the paper to his pocket book and destroy the paper. The least Sgt Lai should have done was preserve that piece of paper as an exhibit as required by the PGO.
I would here refer to the case of 
Kong Weng Chong & Ors v PP
 
 
[1994] 1 SLR 34
  . In that case the trial judge had admitted in evidence the oral statement of the appellant as recorded in the pocket books of two narcotics officers some time after the statements were made. The attention of the trial judge had not been drawn to that and other irregularities in the manner in which the statement was made and the trial judge in admitting the statement had not considered these irregularities. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the manner in which the statement had been taken was unsatisfactory and the statements should not have been admitted. I would note here that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not reject the oral statement because of any inducement, threat or promise but rejected the statement in the exercise of the discretion the court had to exclude a statement even when there was no inducement, threat or promise.
An oral statement of an accused person would not be rendered inadmissible merely because of non-compliance with the mandatory provisions of s 121. This is now settled law (see: 
PP v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor
 
 
[1993] 1 SLR 512
  ). There is however good reason why the legislature has in s 121 spelt out the manner in which statements are to be recorded. Similarly, there is good reason why the Commissioner of Police under powers given to him under s 55 of the Police Force Act issued General Orders specifying in lucid detail the manner in which pocket books are to be kept. The fact that s 122(5) provides that oral statements are admissible in evidence should not be treated as licence for police officers to ignore the PGO and the provisions of s 121 and render these safeguards meaningless.
Where, as in this case, the violation of these provisions was flagrant, it was incumbent on the prosecution to either offer some reasonable explanation for such violation or desist from attempting to adduce statements taken in disregard of these provisions as evidence before the court. In this context, in fairness to Sgt Lai, it is entirely possible that Sgt Lai did not appreciate, when he interviewed the accused, that the prosecution, at the trial, was going to seek to adduce evidence of his, rather casual, interview. It is important that in conducting a prosecution, the prosecutor should consider carefully the circumstances under which a statement oral or written was made and seek to adduce evidence of that statement only if the circumstances warrant. Failure to observe this principle results in very considerable time being unproductively taken up in conducting trials-within-trials. It would be far better if these energies were directed into a more thorough investigation of the case against the accused.
In the light of the effect of the erimin and heroin on the accused, the absence of a Malay interpreter and the irregularities in the way Sgt Lai kept a record of what the accused said, I was of the view that it would be unsafe to admit in evidence what the accused had allegedly told Sgt Lai. In the exercise of my discretion therefore I declined to admit that alleged statement.
At the end of the prosecution case the undisputed evidence before the court was that the accused was in possession of the 24 sachets of heroin. The provisions of s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) were therefore triggered and a presumption arose that the accused had the heroin in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. There was in addition the unchallenged evidence of Sanusi that he regularly obtained heroin from the accused. There was clearly a prima facie case against the accused and I therefore called on his defence. The accused elected to give evidence.
 The defence 
The accused was born in November 1974. Soon after he was born his parents separated and he was brought up by his maternal grandparents. Subsequently, his grandmother with whom he was very close died. The accused attended primary school but he was a weak student and left school at the age of 12 when he failed his Primary 6. He then worked as a cleaner until the age of 17 earning about $550 per month. In 1992, he left his cleaning job and began working as a daily paid casual labourer for one Abang Man who had sub-contract work in a number of construction sites.
The accused said that he began to consume drugs after he started work as a construction labourer. The accused`s testimony as to how he progressed in the consumption of heroin was more or less what he had told Insp Chow in his long statement except that in the statement he had said that he commenced consuming heroin in mid-1992 but in court when told that the CNB record showed that he was first arrested by the CNB in March 1992 for suspected consumption of heroin, he said that he started consuming drugs a few months before that arrest.
The accused said that at the early stage he and a group of friends would share two to three straws of heroin in a day but towards the end of the year he was consuming two to three straws by himself. At that time he was consuming by `chasing the dragon`. By mid-1993 he no longer found satisfaction in chasing the dragon and started consuming heroin by injecting himself intravenously. In referring to his intravenous use of heroin, the accused in para 5 of the long statement had said that he continued to consume heroin intravenously until `end of 1992` when he was arrested by the police for consuming heroin. The accused was arrested by the CNB in January 1994. Quite obviously the reference to `end of 1992` was an error. It should read `end of 1993` and the accused so testified. The DPP however, after consulting with Insp Chow, refused to concede that it was an error.
The accused accepted that he was arrested by the CNB on 4 January 1994 for consuming heroin as shown in the CNB records. He was detained for a week and released on condition that he reported regularly at Central Police Station for urine test. He told the court that his craving for heroin was so strong that he was unable to give up taking heroin. He therefore did not report even once for his urine test. He said that about that time he was consuming a minimum of six straws per day. He told the court that he began to mix erimin in the heroin before injecting himself from about February 1994. He did so because the addition of erimin gave a better `kick`.
After he was released from the DRC, the accused said he worked for one Abang Man, a sub-contractor, at the Pasir Ris construction site. He also lived at the site. There he met Sanusi. They became good friends and began to consume heroin together. Sanusi lived at the site for four to five days in a week. At weekends Sanusi would not be there. The accused told the court that sometime after starting work at the Pasir Ris site he began to buy heroin by the sachets. He said he found this cheaper and more convenient. Sanusi would contribute money for the purchase. If Sanusi had no money the accused would pay from his own funds first and Sanusi would reimburse the accused for the amounts Sanusi consumed.
The accused told the court that when consuming heroin from the sachets he would use straws as a measure. In each straw he would fill an amount that would be between one and two `suku` straws. From one sachet he could get about 12 to 13 such straws. The accused said that he himself consumed about six to seven such straws of heroin per day. He would inject himself every two hours or so and he would consume heroin about six or seven times a day. Sanusi would consume heroin with him three times a day.
The accused told the court that the 24 sachets he had with him when he was arrested were for the consumption of Sanusi and himself. He said that he would consume slightly less than one sachet of heroin per day. Their combined consumption he said was about 11/4 to 11/2 sachets per day. The accused said that he and Sanusi would consume all the 24 sachets found on him (22 full and two half sachets) within 14 days. By himself he would consume about 14 to 15 of the sachets in two weeks.
The accused told the court that his supplier saw him once in about two to three weeks. The amount supplied by the supplier at each delivery was not fixed. It was normally about 20 sachets. The supplier would arrange the time of delivery. The accused said that he had paged the supplier a few times to get earlier delivery but the supplier had ignored his pager calls and made deliveries only at his (the supplier`s) convenience. The supplier delivered the 24 sachets he had with him on the evening of 5 July 1994.
The accused said that on the morning of 6 July 1994 he had taken out two straws of heroin from one of the half packets and after mixing the heroin with erimin had injected himself with the mix. After that he had sealed that half packet by placing the cut end between a pair of chopsticks and burning the ends together. The investigating officer had not weighed each packet individually or required the DSS to do so. There was therefore no evidence before the court as to the weight of the two half packets. If they had been weighed individually, the weights may have been useful in assessing whether the accused`s claim to have consumed some of the heroin from one of the half sachets was true or not. The learned DPP tried to establish that the seals on the two half sachets were identical and the accused`s claim that he resealed the half packet was untenable. Looking at the two half sachets, I was not able to accept that the sachet could not have been resealed by the accused in the manner demonstrated by the accused.
The accused confirmed that Marhaffis bought the handphone for him on 10 June 1994. He said that he had no identity card and so was unable to buy the handphone himself. He obtained the handphone because at the Pasir Ris site there was no telephone service and he found it a chore to go out to use a phone. The accused confirmed that he had borrowed the pager from Sanusi about one week prior to his arrest. He said it would be easier for the supplier to contact him to arrange delivery if he had a pager. He told the court that when he borrowed the pager the Telecom bill on the pager had not been paid for a while. On 5 July 1994, the day before his arrest, he settled the outstanding bill to make the pager useable.
The accused had $3,026 in cash when he was arrested. He also had about $1,300 worth of jewellery on his person including a bangle and two rings that he had purchased that morning at the Lian Thye Pawnshop. When asked to explain how he had so much cash and jewellery on him he stated that on 5 July 1994 he and the other workers were paid their salary. This was between $1,100 and $1,300. The workers had gambled that night and he won $1,000 plus in the gambling. The rest of the money was his savings. He said that he buys gold as an investment. When short of money he would pawn the gold.
The accused told the court that at the Pasir Ris site he had no secure place in which to store his valuables. It was therefore his practice to always carry with him all cash and other valuables wherever he went. That was why, on the morning of 6 July 1994, when he went to the Lian Thye Pawnshop to buy jewellery he had with him the 24 sachets of heroin, the cash, the handphone and the pager. The accused denied that he had the 24 sachets with him in order to deliver the 24 sachets or any part of them to anyone.
In cross-examination, the learned DPP spent considerable time trying to establish that the accused was not working at the construction site. The only basis for the DPP`s cross-examination was the initial testimony of Sanusi when Sanusi started to give evidence that he did not know if the accused worked at the construction site. As noted earlier, Sanusi at that early stage appeared nervous and frightened. Not only did he at that time say that he did not know if the accused worked at the Pasir Ris construction site, he also said that he himself was not working at that site. In his subsequent evidence, however, he freely affirmed that he was himself a casual labourer at that site and although he may not have expressly said so, the tenor of his evidence was that the accused was also working at the said site.
The DPP also spent a number of days cross-examining the accused with a view to establishing that the accused was only a mild and not a severe addict. The accused had not been medically examined for drug addiction at any time after his arrest. There was therefore no medical evidence of the extent of the accused`s drug addiction at the time of his arrest. For the purposes of cross-examination, the DPP only had the evidence of Sgt Lai and Insp Chow that the accused appeared normal to them when they interviewed him and the evidence of Dr Malik and nurse Wong that he was only a mild/moderate addict seven months prior to 6 July 1994.
In the light of the evidence given by Dr Lim Yun Chin and the prosecution`s own expert Dr Leow Kee Fong that I will hereafter refer to, I do not need to try and summarize this lengthy cross-examination. It will suffice to say that throughout the cross-examination the accused maintained what he had told Insp Chow in the long statement and what he had said in evidence-in-chief. The accused agreed that he told the nurse at the DRC in January 1994 that he was not an intravenous user and that he was consuming only three to four straws a day but added that he said that in order to avoid a detention order. In the event the accused was in fact not detained. The accused also told the court that he did not recall anyone at the DRC examining his arms for needle marks.
Towards the end of his cross-examination the learned DPP wanted a description from the accused of the withdrawal symptoms the accused suffered from in the days following his arrest on 6 July 1994. The DPP told the court that he wanted to know this because, based on the withdrawal symptoms, an expert witness whom the DPP had on standby, would in rebuttal be able to say what kind of addict the accused was. I told the DPP that if it was possible to say from the withdrawal symptoms what the extent of addiction was, the accused should have been medically examined for such symptoms at the time of arrest. To ask the accused now to state from memory what his medical symptoms then were did not appear to be the right way of doing things. The DPP, however, persisted. The accused, on being prodded for answers, said that in the days following the arrest he suffered from diarrhoea, vomiting, running nose, chill, ache, tears in his eyes, weakness, frequent yawning, sleepiness and the craving for heroin.
 Dr Lim Yun Chin 
Dr Lim, who had testified earlier in the first trial-within-a-trial was again called by the defence to give evidence as an expert on drug addiction. His credentials were impressive. Besides his basic degree in medicine obtained in 1976, Dr Lim had a Diploma in Psychological Medicine in 1982 awarded by the Royal College of Physicians in England, a Master of Medicine in Psychiatry awarded in Singapore in 1986 and was admitted as a Fellow of the Academy of Medicine, Singapore, in 1988. From 1980 to 1982 he had worked at two specialist hospitals in England where he had `hands on` experience in the field of drug and alcohol addiction. From 1983 to 1989 he was psychiatrist to various Drug Rehabilitation Centres in Singapore where he had contact with drug addicts at different stages of their addiction including acute withdrawal as well as post-withdrawal states. From 1988 to 1989 he was the Prison (Forensic) Psychiatrist in Changi Prison Hospital where he also had clinical experience with drug addicts. From 1989 to 1990, he was attached to the University of Minnesota Drug Dependency Department as an International Fellow. There he had clinical experience in alcohol and drug addiction including the assessment and treatment of heroin withdrawal. He has lectured on drug addiction to candidates sitting for their Master of Medicine degree in Psychiatry exams as well as the Master of Science degree in Public Health, both organized by the School of Post-Graduate Medical Studies in Singapore. In private practice he now deals with patients having drug and alcohol problems. He is a voluntary worker in Siloam Centre, a halfway house for drug addicts, where he interacts with addicts in different stages of their recovery.
I have set out the credentials of Dr Lim in fair detail because the DPP, in his cross-examination, questioned the sufficiency of Dr Lim`s expertise with drug addicts undergoing withdrawal and disputed a number of his professional views.
Dr Lim told the court that when defence counsel consulted him on this case in late February 1995 he was given a copy of the accused`s long statement to the police. In addition, counsel kept him informed of evidence adduced at the trial relevant to the question of the accused`s addiction to drugs. Dr Lim gave his opinion in a written report which read as follows: 
 
Based on the information available to me, I am of the opinion that Dahlan bin Ladaewa suffered from a severe form of drug addiction at the time of his arrest. The extent of his severity was reflected in his evolving pattern of heroin consumption, namely, graduating from `chasing the dragon` to that of 
 intravenous
 injection. The severity of his addiction is of such magnitude that he needed the sudden effect (rush) of heroin, that could effectively be obtained from IV injection, plus the potentiating effect of 
 Erimin
, a very potent 
 hypnotic
 drug to produce the desired effect.
 
 
 
Being severely addicted meant that he required increasing quantity of heroin to produce the desired effect. This is due to a physiological phenomenon known as 
 tolerance 
. I was informed by the defence that from March 1994 onwards the accused was taking between six to ten straws of heroin mixed with Erimin pills every day. The 24 sachets found on him on 6 July 1994 was meant for his and Sanusi`s consumption. Sanusi would be with Dahalan four to five days in a week to consume drugs. Dahalan would consume about one to two straws per session up to six sessions per day. In the case of Sanusi he consumes about three times a day in the company of Dahalan. Two to three straws were used when they consumed together. Based on the pattern of consumption described aforesaid, it is conceivable that the accused would have no difficulty consuming the 24 packets in 14 days.
... I had the opportunity of examining the accused Dahalan bin Ladaewa [and Sanusi] in the High Court on the 23 March 1995 and confirmed the existence of four `tracks` in his arms. This `tracks` would be compatible with old scars produced by IV injections of heroin or heroin mixed with fine particles of Erimin pills.
...
Dr Lim, at the trial-within-a-trial, had testified that, based on the accused`s drug history, the accused was a severe addict. He had also testified that there was no necessary co-relation between the severity of the withdrawal symptoms and the degree of addiction. Dr Lim repeated that evidence in the main trial. He added that to his knowledge no research had been conducted and no scientific papers published that established a link between the severity of addiction and the severity of withdrawal. His own experience he said was that there was no such link. He told the court that even with people with similar drug histories the severity of each individual`s withdrawal symptoms could vary. He has also personally come across one case where the same patient taking the same amount of drugs had different degrees of withdrawal on the two occasions that he examined the patient. He told the court that a host of variable factors such as health, physical constitution, mental state and tolerance to the withdrawal symptoms itself contribute to the nature of withdrawal symptoms of an addict. Age, Dr Lim said, was also a factor. Older people would find withdrawal more distressing than younger people. He told the court that a patient can even be suffering from severe withdrawal without overtly appearing to be in agony. Dr Lim told the court that, in his view, at the DRC when a patient was assessed as mild, moderate or severe what was really being assessed was not the degree of his addiction but the degree of the withdrawal symptoms that was noticed on the patient when examined.
Dr Malik had testified that the amount of morphine found in the urine of a patient was a more objective test of the severity of addiction than observation of withdrawal symptoms. Dr Lim would not endorse that view. He told the court that it had not been established by scientific study that there was any co-relation between the amount of heroin consumed and the amount of morphine in the urine. He said that a person may take a very small amount of heroin and yet have a large amount of morphine in his urine and vice versa. The amount of morphine in the urine, he said, would depend on the patient`s individual metabolism and other factors.
Dr Lim told the court that the fact that a heroin abuser begins to take heroin intravenously is in itself evidence that he had become a severe addict. In his view, an addict who graduates to the intravenous method does so because he has developed so great a tolerance to heroin that consuming heroin by `chasing the dragon` was no longer sufficient for him. The learned DPP suggested to Dr Lim that taking heroin intravenously was no more than a method of consuming heroin. Dr Lim disagreed. He told the court that an addict would switch to intravenous consumption of heroin because his tolerance for heroin had grown to such an extent that ordinary consumption was not enough. He needed the extra `kick` of the intravenous method. Such a switch, in Dr Lim`s view, indicated an exponential increase in the tolerance to heroin of the addict. He told the court that there were very few cases in Singapore where addicts had switched to intravenous consumption. Dr Lim also disagreed with a further suggestion by the DPP that when an addict switches to intravenous use he would in fact consume less heroin.
The DPP asked Dr Lim whether he had found that heroin addicts have a tendency not to allow their addictions to increase too rapidly. Dr Lim replied that addicts were unable to control their need for the heroin. They cannot also control their need for more and more heroin as their tolerance to heroin grew. That was why they are termed `addicts`.
Dr Lim said that scars caused by intravenous injections would, with time, fade. As the scars on the accused`s arms were old he was not able to say, by now looking at the scars, for how long or how frequently the accused had been injecting himself at the time of his arrest. He was however prepared to say from the remnants of the scars that the accused had a history of injecting himself fairly regularly.
The total amount of diamorphine in the 24 sachets was 28.36g. Each sachet had not been weighed or analysed separately but taking it on average each full sachet in this case would contain about 1.2g of diamorphine. Dr Lim testified that intravenous abusers would have developed a high tolerance to heroin and it is possible that they can inject themselves even with 1g of heroin in a single dose without serious effects. Dr Lim was of the view that given the accused`s profile, the accused`s claim that he was consuming between half and one sachet in a day was believable.
 Evidence in rebuttal - Dr Leow Kee Fong 
After Dr Lim had testified, the prosecution applied for leave to call Dr Leow Kee Fong, the Registrar of Changi Prison Hospital, as an expert witness to rebut the evidence of Dr Lim. In making this application, the DPP informed the court that through Dr Leow he would rebut the evidence of Dr Lim that:
 
 
(a) there was no co-relation between the degree of severity of drug withdrawal and the degree of severity of drug addiction; 
 
(b) when an addict switches to intravenous injection it indicates an exponential increase in rate of consumption; 
 
(c) addicts are not able to exercise control over their consumption rate; and through Dr Leow he would establish that the accused was not as severe an addict as the defence had claimed. I granted leave for Dr Leow to be called.
  
 
 
Dr Leow obtained his medical qualification (MBBS) from the University of Singapore in 1979. He joined government service and has been in service since. From 1988, he has been attached to Drug Rehabilitation Centres in Singapore. In 1992, he was appointed Registrar of Changi Prison Hospital but continued to work with drug addicts at the drug rehabilitation centre at Jalan Awan. Prior to 1988, he had worked at a drug rehabilitation centre for a year in 1981. Dr Leow was the immediate supervisor of Dr Malik.
On (a), Dr Leow agreed with Dr Lim that there was no necessary co-relation between the amount of drugs consumed and withdrawal symptoms seen in an addict. He agreed that the severity of withdrawal symptoms could vary amongst persons consuming the same amount of heroin. Dr Leow, however, told the court that his experience was that as the same person consumed more and more heroin that person`s withdrawal symptoms progressively became more and more severe.
Dr Leow told the court that whether withdrawal symptoms are detected and when detected the assessment of their severity would depend on the astuteness of the doctor examining the addict for signs and on how accurately the addict describes his symptoms to the doctor. He said that at the DRC there were no facilities for monitoring an addict on a continuing basis and so the doctors rely mainly on the signs they detect and on the addict`s description of his symptoms. Dr Leow agreed that categorization of drug addicts in terms of the severity of their withdrawal symptoms was a difficult exercise that depended very much on the subjective view of the doctor on the signs he sees on the patient and the accuracy with which the patient describes his symptoms to the doctor. Dr Leow said that except in very severe cases of withdrawal, it was possible for different doctors to classify an addict differently.
On (b), whilst Dr Leow did not say that switching to intravenous injection indicates an exponential increase in the rate of consumption, he did say that an addict who switches from chasing the dragon to intravenous injection may not immediately increase the amount of heroin he uses, but, thereafter, as tolerance continues to grow, he will gradually increase his consumption of heroin. He said that there can be no hard and fast rules as to the rate at which tolerance grows.
On (c), Dr Leow told the court that if drugs were available the addict would consume what he needs. He agreed with Dr Lim that if the supply was available, an addict will not be able to exercise control over his consumption rate.
The DPP did not proceed to adduce any evidence from Dr Leow that the accused was not as severe an addict as the accused claimed. To the contrary, Dr Leow told the court that he would classify a consistent intravenous user of heroin as a severe addict. When Dr Leow said that, I suggested to Dr Leow that he should have a look at the accused`s arms. Dr Leow did so. He then told the court that from the remaining scars that he saw on the accused`s arms he would say that the accused had not been an occasional intravenous user but had been taking drugs intravenously for some time. He said that the marks still remaining on the accused`s arms indicated that the accused was a chronic intravenous abuser. Dr Leow further told the court that there were very few cases of chronic intravenous abuse in Singapore. Throughout his career he had come across only about 10 to 20 such cases.
Dr Leow agreed that it was possible for a severe addict to consume one sachet of heroin daily. He added that he would expect a person consuming such a large amount of heroin to develop severe withdrawal symptoms such as diarrhoea, vomiting, chill, running nose and tearing of the eyes. He added that given the history of the accused he would have expected severe withdrawal symptoms after his arrest. Such a person, he said, should have been admitted to hospital. In cross-examination, Dr Leow was asked to read Dr Lim`s report. He did so in court and said that he agreed with the report.
 Findings 
Having heard the evidence of Dr Lim and Dr Leow, I had no doubt that the accused was a very severe addict. I accepted Dr Lim`s evidence that when an addict becomes a regular intravenous user it indicates that his tolerance levels were so high that he could no longer get satisfaction from chasing the dragon. In this case, I was satisfied that the accused was not only an intravenous abuser but a chronic intravenous abuser. Notwithstanding the evidence of nurse Wong (which in any event I disbelieved) I found that the accused had been an intravenous abuser from mid-1993.
The evidence of Dr Lim and Dr Leow was that even after an addict switches to intravenous consumption his tolerance will continue to grow. That being so, by July 1994 the accused`s tolerance to heroin and therefore his consumption of heroin would have been substantial. The accused`s evidence that he was consuming nearly one sachet of heroin per day was therefore entirely plausible and I accepted that evidence. I also accepted the evidence of Dr Leow that given the accused`s history of addiction he would, after his arrest, have suffered severe withdrawal. This was exactly what the accused claimed. I rejected Insp Chow`s claim that the accused, after his arrest, was normal and not suffering from withdrawal.
This trial had taken more than 20 days. The reason it was so protracted was because the prosecution, relying on the evidence of Insp Chow, Dr Malik and nurse Wong, had doggedly tried to demonstrate that the accused was only a mild addict and hence liable for the death sentence as the amount of diamorphine contained in the 24 sachets that he was trafficking in, would exceed 15g. Dr Leow was the prosecution`s own witness. In the light of his testimony, it was a complete waste of time for the prosecution to have tried to show that the accused was only a mild addict. If the investigating officer had, immediately after the arrest, referred the accused to a hospital, and a doctor with the competence of Dr Leow had examined the accused, it would have been established right from the start that the accused was a chronic intravenous abuser.
It is simply not enough, in respect of a drug addict, for the prosecution to rely on the evidence of an investigating officer that an accused person appeared normal as evidence that the accused was not a severe addict. An the investigating officer is not a medical officer and cannot be relied upon to assess the medical condition of an accused. It is very important, especially when drug addicts in possession of relatively small quantities of heroin are charged with trafficking, that a full medical examination for drug addiction is conducted as soon as possible after arrest. This is all the more important where the prosecution takes the view that the severity of drug addiction can be measured by the severity of withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal symptoms last for a relatively short time. If the symptoms are not immediately monitored, then that evidence is lost and this could be highly prejudicial to the defence. There is also the danger of intravenous scars disappearing with time. In the present case, it was fortuitous for the accused that at the time of his trial there were still sufficient scars visible on his arms for Dr Lim and Dr Leow to say that he had been a chronic intravenous abuser. It was also fortuitous that the DPP called Dr Leow as a `rebuttal` witness!
The difficulty in trying to equate severity of addiction with the severity of withdrawal symptoms was vividly illustrated in this case in connection with the medical examination of Sanusi at the DRC soon after Sanusi was arrested. On the basis of the withdrawal symptoms he noted, Dr Malik certified Sanusi to be a mild addict and in court added that Sanusi could be a moderate addict. Dr Wee, who examined Sanusi at about the same time, found that Sanusi was not an addict at all. To make matters more complicated, on Dr Leow`s evidence, in view of the intravenous marks on Sanusi`s arms being as severe as those on the accused`s, Sanusi would be a severe addict!
The prosecution had sought to establish, through Dr Malik and through Dr Leow, that the severity of drug addiction can be measured by the severity of the drug withdrawal symptoms. Dr Lim rejected this proposition summarily. Dr Leow also did not quite support that proposition. In the light of their evidence, and in the light of the conflicting views on the severity of Sanusi`s addiction when it was indisputable that Sanusi was a severe addict, there is considerable doubt in my mind whether the position adopted by the prosecution that the severity of drug addiction can be determined by reference to the severity of the withdrawal is a sound one. It seems to me, that the categorization at the DRC is no more than a categorization of the withdrawal symptoms noted.
In spite of the very clear evidence of Dr Lim and Dr Leow that the accused was a severe addict and hence quite capable of consuming about one sachet of heroin per day, the learned DPP, in his lengthy closing submissions, nevertheless proceeded to explore all the evidence adduced in the greatest of detail in an effort to show that the accused could not be consuming the amounts of heroin he said he was. It was only with difficulty and even then only towards the close of his submissions that I managed to get him to see that in the light of the evidence of his own expert, he would have to approach the case not on the basis of the evidence of Dr Malik, nurse Wong, Sgt Lai and Insp Chow but on the basis that the accused was in fact a severe addict who could well have been consuming about a sachet of heroin per day. Once the DPP abandoned the limited approach that he had for so long pursued, his submissions became very much more effective. I need here to deal only with that part of his submission.
The DPP submitted that accepting that the accused was a severe addict consuming between half and one sachet per day of heroin, the court had to consider two points:
 
 
(a) how that consumption rate related to the rate at which the accused was purchasing drugs; and 
 
(b) how the accused was able to afford such an expensive habit based on his evidence of his income and savings.
  
 
 
On (a), the learned DPP submitted that if, for example, the accused had been purchasing drugs once every three to four days but the quantity he purchased on each occasion was sufficient to last him (say) 20 days, the accused would have to give a satisfactory explanation as to what he was doing with the excess drugs that he was purchasing. The consumption rate had, therefore, to be looked at in relation to the purchasing rate. The DPP pointed out that although the accused had claimed that the supplier made deliveries once in two to three weeks, the accused had also said that if he wanted supplies earlier he would page the supplier. The DPP submitted that this indicated that two to three weeks was not necessarily a fixed time-frame for the delivery of supplies.
On (b), the learned DPP submitted that accepting that the accused was consuming one sachet a day the cost per month of heroin that he was personally consuming (based on the accused`s evidence that he paid about $90 per sachet) would be about $2,500. On the accused`s evidence, his income from his work would at most be $1,700 per month. How, asked the DPP, could the accused afford this expensive lifestyle? And not only that, when he was arrested he had about $3,000 in cash and $2,000 worth of jewellery. Besides, why would the accused need a handphone and a pager? All this, in the DPP`s submission, led to the conclusion that the accused was not a mere consumer of the heroin found on him: he was a trafficker.
I will deal first with the question whether the accused was trafficking in heroin before going into the next question whether in respect of the 24 sachets found on him he was trafficking in more than 15g of diamorphine.
The amount of cash found on the accused (not to mention the jewellery) suggested that the accused had a source of income over and above his earnings as a casual labourer. The purchase of the handphone on 10 June 1994 and the fact that the accused on the day before his arrest had paid up the arrears on the pager belonging to Sanusi`s brother in order to be able to make use of that pager were also matters that aroused suspicion. It does not seem very likely that a casual labourer with the background of the accused would have purchased a handphone and obtained a pager if he was a mere consumer of heroin. It was, therefore, likely that besides supplying Sanusi the accused had been trafficking in heroin. That would explain the cash and the jewellery found on him and provide an explanation as to how, on his income as a casual labourer, he was able to finance his need for heroin.
But the charge that the accused faced before me was not whether prior to 6 July 1994 the accused had been trafficking in heroin and, if so, in what amounts but whether the accused was trafficking in respect of the 24 sachets of heroin he had with him at the Karachi Restaurant on the morning of 6 July 1994. In deciding this issue, any previous criminal conduct of the accused would be irrelevant and I obviously could not allow my mind to be influenced by such conduct. As learned counsel for the accused pointed out, if the prosecution sought to prove that the accused had been a trafficker in drugs during the period he was staying at the Pasir Ris construction site, it was open to the prosecution to have framed such a charge.
The accused admitted that from the 24 sachets he would be supplying heroin to Sanusi. It was in evidence that Sanusi would pay the accused for the heroin he consumed. The presumption that the accused was trafficking in the heroin found in his possession that morning was clearly not rebutted. I therefore turn to address the question whether, in view of the accused himself being an addict, the accused was trafficking in more than 15g out of the 28.36g of diamorphine contained in the 24 sachets. It was not disputed that the burden again was on the accused to show, on the balance of probabilities, that he was trafficking in 15g or less of the diamorphine contained in the 24 sachets and that the rest was for his personal consumption.
I accepted the DPP`s submission that the amount of diamorphine that would be consumed by the accused from the 24 sachets should be looked at in connection with the frequency of supply. The DPP highlighted the fact that the accused had said that when he wanted supplies earlier than the two to three weeks he had paged the supplier. That statement by the accused, however, was only one aspect of what the accused said. Having said that he went on to say that it was the supplier who determined when the supply was to be delivered and he was not successful in trying to influence the supplier into making earlier delivery. A supplier of a commodity like heroin is likely to be most cautious in making deliveries and would want to limit deliveries to as few occasions as possible. I accepted the evidence that the supplier would make deliveries to the accused once in about two weeks.
The next question that arose was whether the last occasion that the supplier effected delivery was in fact on 5 July 1994. The supplier could conceivably have effected delivery long before that. If that be so, the next delivery might be imminent and only an insignificant part of the 24 sachets would have been for the accused`s own consumption. The only evidence before the court on this issue was the evidence of the accused. It would be unrealistic to expect corroboration of the time of delivery. Such deliveries are, by their very nature, secretive. On balance, I accepted the evidence of the accused that the 24 sachets were delivered on 5 July 1994.
For any addict, the amount of heroin consumed in a day would depend on factors such as availability, company, mood and opportunity. No addict would keep exact records of his consumption. The figures can therefore only be estimates. As the Court of Criminal Appeal pointed out in 
Ong Lee Koon & Anor v PP
 
 
[1995] 2 SLR 750
  , the amount consumed will also depend on the purity of the heroin in each supply. One cannot therefore assess the daily consumption with precision. Nevertheless an assessment must be made; if indeed part of the drugs found in the possession of an addict was for his personal consumption then the accused would not be trafficking in such part (see: 
Ong Ah Chuan v PP
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 64
  ).
The accused`s evidence was that the 24 sachets with him on 6 July 1994 were the entire amount of heroin he had. He said he carried all the heroin he had on his person because at the construction site where he was staying there was no secure place where he could store his valuables. It was in evidence that the CNB had raided the accused`s mother`s house and found nothing incriminating. They had, however, not raided the Pasir Ris site. In the absence of such a raid, we would not know for sure whether the accused`s claim that he had no other stock of heroin was true. It was, however, a plausible claim and the accused`s evidence that it was necessary to carry all valuables with him as there was no secure place at the Pasir Ris site to store valuables was supported by the evidence of Sanusi. I accepted the claim as true.
The total amount of diamorphine in the 24 sachets (including the two half sachets) was 28.36g. Each sachet would therefore contain about 1.2g of diamorphine (28.36 [divide] 23). From the 24 sachets the accused would, in two weeks, consume between 14g of diamorphine (if he consumed 1g per day) and 16.8g (if he consumed one sachet) per day. On these figures the amount of diamorphine that he was trafficking in would be between 14.36g and 11.56g.
To avoid the death penalty it is not necessary that the accused must satisfy me beyond reasonable doubt that the amount he was trafficking in was 15g or less. It is sufficient that he does so on the balance of probabilities. This he has succeeded in doing. I find that in respect of the 24 sachets the accused was trafficking in less than 15g but more than 10g of diamorphine. Accordingly, I amend the charge against him by deleting the words `24 packets of substance containing not less than 28.36g` and substituting therefor the words `not less than 10g and not more than 15g` and convicted him on the amended charge. For trafficking in that amount the penalty prescribed in the Misuse of Drugs Act is a minimum of 20 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and a maximum of 30 years and 15 strokes. Bearing in mind the accused`s age and his personal circumstances, I sentenced him to 23 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.
At the commencement of the hearing a charge against the accused that he had consumed heroin was stood down. Upon being convicted on the amended charge, the accused pleaded guilty to the charge of consuming heroin.

 The facts 
 
 
 
Liu Cho Chit (Liu) was at the material time one of the contractors of the Housing and Development Board (HDB). He conducted his contracting business through his company, Hoe Huat Construction & Engineering Pte Ltd (Hoe Huat). One Lok Bok Sim (Lok) was at all material times the managing director of Singapore Finance Ltd. In or about 1970, Liu met Lok and thenceforth they became business associates. Together, they were involved in several transactions pertaining to land speculation as well as property development through various companies, namely, Hoe Huat Realty Pte Ltd, Taman Kolam Ayer Sdn Bhd and Perdana Properties Sdn Bhd. In particular, through his company Hoe Huat, Liu assisted Lok in the latter`s housing development at Mandalay Road during the period approximately between 1971 and 1973.
In 1972, through one Koh Chee Chong, Lok came to know that a large parcel of land situate at Kampong Chai Chee comprising lots 21-26, 4-4, 407, 120, 121, 122, 123 and 221 of mukim 28, having an area of 186.7 acres, was for sale. Negotiations were conducted and a price of $1.09m was agreed with the owners, who were the personal representatives of the estate of Tan Chwee Boon, deceased. A company, Peng Ann Realty Pte Ltd (Peng Ann), the respondents in these appeals, was thereupon incorporated to purchase the property. Liu was the managing director of the company and held that position until 3 March 1978; the other directors at the material time were Yip Ho Meng (Yip) and Koh Chee Cheong (Koh). All three of them were also the only shareholders, each holding one share with a par value of $1. Yip was in fact the nominee of Lok who was at all material times in effective control of Peng Ann.
The agreement for the purchase of the property was made on 18 July 1972 and under the agreement completion was to take place on 27 October 1972. The purchase was financed entirely by a loan of $1.5m from Singapore Finance Ltd, which was secured by a legal mortgage of the property and personal guarantees of the three directors. No doubt Lok was instrumental in approving the loan to Peng Ann. It was obvious that but for him such a loan could not have been granted to a company with only three dollars as its capital even with the securities that were provided. Little wonder there was that being only a one-third owner of the company Lok was in effective control of it.
Two days after the sale and purchase agreement was made, that is, on 20 July 1972, two of the lots, namely, lots 221 and 4-4 with a total area of about 5.8 acres, were gazetted by the Government for acquisition; some neighbouring lands and other lands were also included in the gazette notification. In due course, these two lots were compulsorily acquired and a compensation of $228,000 based on $0.89 psf was eventually paid to Peng Ann. Soon after the gazette notification, the directors of Peng Ann decided to sell the remaining six lots, and accordingly a directors` resolution was passed on 9 October 1972 whereby the directors unanimously authorized Liu to sell the entire six lots at a price of not less than $0.25 psf.
In December 1972, Liu was introduced to one Tan Geok Tee (Tan), and following the negotiations between the two of them, a sale and purchase agreement was made on 23 January 1973 between Peng Ann and Collin Investment Pte Ltd (CIP) (the main agreement), whereby Peng Ann agreed to sell to CIP three of the lots, namely, lots 21-26, 4-7 and 123 (the three lots), having a total area of about 178 acres at the price of $2.05m based on $0.263 psf. CIP is one of Tan`s family companies and is now known as Lee Kai Investment Pte Ltd. The three lots were within four zones under the master plan, that is, about 50.13% was zoned `water catchment`, 20.02% `rural`, 7.84% `permanent residential` and 22.01% `temporary residential`. The main agreement was signed by Liu on behalf of Peng Ann and by Tan on behalf of CIP.
During the negotiations leading to the main agreement, Liu and Tan orally agreed to develop jointly about five acres of lot 21-26. The proposed joint venture (the joint venture) was subsequently reduced into writing and was made in the names of Liu`s wife, Lim Siam Soi (Mdm Lim) and Tan`s daughter, Collin Tan, and the terms of the joint venture were embodied in four documents (collectively called `the side agreements`), all of which were backdated to 23 January 1973. Briefly these side agreements were as follows:
 
 
(i) First, there was the sub-sale agreement whereby a part of lot 21-26 zoned residential and described as an `approximate area of five acres` (joint venture site) was sold by CIP to Mdm Lim and Collin Tan at the price of $50,000 based on $0.25 psf. This agreement was signed by Tan on behalf of CIP and also on behalf of Collin Tan and by Liu on behalf of Mdm Lim. Special condition 1 of the sub-sale agreement provided that the purchasers would apply for subdivision of lot 21-26 on behalf of the vendor, and the costs and expenses in respect thereof would be borne by the purchasers. Further, by special condition 4, if the purchasers should fail to obtain approval for the subdivision, the joint venture site would be developed in the name of the vendor, and the purchasers would be entitled to the benefit of the development and would be responsible for all liabilities incurred thereby. 
 
(ii) Next, there was an agreement expressed to be made between Madam Lim and Collin Tan on the one hand and a company, Collden Realty Pte Ltd (Collden), on the other (Collden agreement), under which Mdm Lim and Collin Tan were to convey the joint venture site to Collden in return for 50,000 shares of $1 each credited as fully paid to be issued and allotted to Madam Lim and Collin Tan in the following proportions: 22,500 shares (representing 45% thereof) to Mdm Lim and 27,500 shares (representing 55% thereof) to Collin Tan. Liu signed this agreement on behalf of Mdm Lim and Tan signed it on behalf of Collin Tan. 
 
(iii) Thirdly, there was the pre-incorporation agreement signed by Liu and Tan on behalf of Mdm Lim and Collin Tan respectively, under which it was agreed that notwithstanding their respective proportions of shareholding in Collden, Collin Tan would bear 80% and Mdm Lim 20% of the development costs of the joint venture site. However, it was further provided that should Mdm Lim fail to contribute her share of the 20%, Collin Tan would advance the amount with interest at a rate of 10.8% pa, provided that she should not be required to contribute such development costs in excess of $1.5m. 
 
(iv) Lastly, there was the fall-back agreement which provided that if CIP should fail under any circumstances to purchase the three lots under the main agreement from the respondents, the sub-sale agreement would become null and void, and the sum of $50,000 paid would be forfeited and each party would have no claim against the other.
  
 
 
The sale under the main agreement was completed on 14 March 1973, and all the three lots were conveyed on the direction of CIP to Collin Development Pte Ltd, another family company of Tan, which is now known as Lee Tat Development Pte Ltd (Lee Tat). At that time no application for subdivision approval had been made to excise the joint venture site from the lot 21-26.
Soon after the completion of the purchase, on 20 December 1973, Lee Tat through their architects, Lim Chew Kuan & Associates, applied to the competent authority for planning permission for a proposed condominium development and a golf course on `lots 21-26 pt and 123`. The application was refused and a notice of refusal of written permission dated 21 September 1974 was issued. Two reasons were given for the refusal, namely: (i) there was no proper access to the site, and (ii) the site would be affected by a `Public Scheme`. An appeal was immediately made to the Minister for National Development and was heard on 21 January 1975. The appeal was unsuccessful, and on 31 March 1975, Lee Tat were informed that the appeal had been disallowed.
About a year later, on 23 July 1976 the three lots, except a portion of about five acres, were acquired by the government, and compensation in the sum of $2.5m based on the rate of $0.33 psf was awarded. The unacquired land comprised 4.1 acres of the joint venture site and a portion, also part of lot 21-26, which was immediately outside and adjoining the contemplated boundary of the joint venture site. The unacquired land was subsequently resurveyed and the resurvey lot number is 1606. The Pan Island Expressway now runs along the northern boundary of lot 1606.
As it transpired, the joint venture did not materialize: neither Liu nor Tan (nor their respective nominees) took any step to implement the terms of the sub-sale agreement or any of the other joint venture agreements. It appears that there were subsequent negotiations between Liu and Tan for the latter to acquire Liu`s interest or share in the joint venture site. Arising from this, disputes arose between Liu and Tan. In June 1984, Mdm Lim commenced an action in the High Court in Suit No 4149 of 1984 (S 4149/84) against Lee Tat, Tan and CIP. In that suit, Madam Lim claimed specific performance of an agreement alleged to have been made whereby Lee Tat and/or Tan agreed to purchase her share in lot 1606 for $3.8m. The claim was resisted by the defendants and the suit is still pending. In 1987 or thereabout, as a result of the cause papers filed in that suit, Lok who was still in control of Peng Ann claimed that he then became aware of the sub-sale agreement. On 25 May 1987, Peng Ann commenced an action against Liu and Tan. Peng Ann averred, inter alia, that Liu as a director of Peng Ann conspired with Tan to sell to CIP the three lots at an inordinately low price of $2.05m in spite of the large area involved, and that at the time the sub-sale agreement was entered into, Liu and Tan knew or must have known that the joint venture site, which is now part of lot 1606, would not be acquired by the government and `was worth or would be worth several million dollars.` Subsequently, Yip and Lee Tat were added as third and fourth defendants in the action. Tan passed away on 27 May 1993 before the action came on for hearing, and by an order made subsequently, Ching Mun Fong (Ching), his widow, was appointed to represent his estate in these proceedings.
 The decision below
Before the High Court, there was a hearing first of a preliminary issue whether the price of $2.05m paid for the three lots under the main agreement was inordinately low. Goh Joon Seng J who tried that issue determined it as follows: 
 
... bearing in mind that neighbouring lands had been acquired and hence strong likelihood of this land being acquired too, the sale price of $2,050,000 in January 1973 though low was not inordinately low between a willing buyer and a willing seller if both had no knowledge that part of lot 21-26 measuring 4.2 acres would not be acquired. However, for someone who is alleged to have known that these 4.2 acres part of lot 21-26 and now being lot 1606 would not be acquired and more so that after acquisition of the rest of the land, lot 1606 would have access to an expressway and other public roads, then the price of $2.05m for the three lots was inordinately low.
 
 
 
Against this determination, there was no appeal.
The action subsequently came on for trial before Goh Joon Seng J. On the evidence before him the learned judge found that Yip, who was the nominee of Lok, was aware of the joint venture and so was Lok. The issue before him was not whether Lok was aware of the joint venture between Liu and Tan, but whether Liu knew that the joint venture site would not be acquired or could be left out of the acquisition, and whether Tan was privy to that knowledge. On the evidence before him, the learned judge was not able to find any evidence from which an inference could be drawn of a conspiracy to defraud Peng Ann or any breach of duty on the part of Yip. Accordingly, he dismissed the claim against Yip with costs.
As against Liu and Tan, the learned judge made the following findings. First, he found that the side agreements were not as open as Liu and Tan had contended; if the agreements were so, there would be no reason for them to be made in the names of Liu`s and Tan`s nominees. In fact, Tan`s daughter, Collin Tan, was not even aware of the agreements. Secondly, he found that the joint venture site at that time had no legal access and thus no prospect of being a subdivided lot which could be conveyed. Notwithstanding that, the purchasers under the sub-sale agreement undertook to obtain subdivision, although such an obligation would normally fall on the vendor. However, eventually Liu did not submit an application for subdivision of the joint venture site but `just waited and it was eventually left unacquired whilst the surrounding land was compulsorily acquired leaving it with an area of 4.2 acres`. It seemed to the learned judge obvious that the joint venture site was not described (in the sub-sale agreement) more precisely because the exact area of that part of lot 21-26 to be acquired was not known. He, therefore, concluded that the impending acquisition must have been known to Liu and thus through him to Tan, otherwise the exact area to be sold would have been demarcated and ascertained by a private survey followed by an application for subdivision approval.
Turning to the fall-back agreement, the learned judge found that no payment of the purported consideration was intended and no payment was made. In reaching this finding he relied on Tan`s affidavit in S 4149/84 in which it was alleged that Madam Lim and Collin Tan did not pay any sum of money. Further, the learned judge found that Liu would be entitled to 25% of the development in the joint venture site without any payment, as the pre-incorporation agreement provided for Liu, through his wife, to contribute only 20% of the development costs, although under the Collden Agreement he would be entitled to a 45% share in Collden, the proposed company, and that in addition, if the need arose, Tan would finance Liu in respect of his contribution of the development costs.
The learned judge also found that Liu had made an admission under cross-examination in which he had assured Tan that the joint venture site would not be acquired and that Liu`s explanation of his failure to apply for subdivision approval showed that he knew that the surrounding land would be acquired or that he had procured the leaving out of the joint venture site from acquisition. The learned judge came to the conclusion relying partly on the affidavit of Liu in S 4149/84.
On those facts, notwithstanding the high standard of proof required, the learned judge found the inferences sufficiently compelling to hold that Liu knew that the joint venture site would not be acquired or could be left out of the acquisition of the surrounding land. On the basis of this knowledge the value of the three lots sold to CIP would be considerably more than the purchase price of $2.05m. He further found that Tan was privy to this knowledge, as he had agreed to give to Liu a 45% share in the proposed development of the joint venture site when the latter`s contribution was to be only 20% and had also agreed to provide financial assistance to pay for the 20% contribution.
Before the learned judge, Liu and Tan also raised the defence that Peng Ann`s claim had been time barred under the Limitation Act. On this issue, the learned judge held that the plaintiff`s claim was that of a beneficiary against Liu and Tan as trustees and it was a claim for conspiracy to defraud Peng Ann. The claim was not based on the sub-sale of the joint venture site of which Yip as the nominee of LBS was aware, but on Liu`s knowledge that the land would not be acquired or could be left out of the acquisition. The learned judge held that this knowledge to Peng Ann only surfaced in S 4149/84 and thus the claim was not statute-barred. [See 576.]
 The appeal
Against the decision of the learned judge, two appeals have been brought: one by Ching Mun Fong and Lee Tat in CA 106/94 and the other by Liu in CA 107/94. Both the appeals were heard together and will be dealt with jointly in this judgment.
It is not in dispute that at the time the main agreement was made, Lok was aware of the joint venture then proposed to be entered into between Liu and Tan. Thus, the sub-sale by CIP to Madam Lim and Collin Tan was not a secret so far as Peng Ann was concerned. The gravamen of Peng Ann`s complaint was that Liu, at the time when the main agreement was made, knew that the joint venture site would not be compulsorily acquired by the Government and Tan was privy to this knowledge, and that Liu as a director of Peng Ann had conspired with Tan to cause and procure Peng Ann to sell the three lots to CIP at an `inordinately low price`. The claim of Peng Ann was based essentially on this knowledge. There was no direct evidence adduced by the respondents to establish their claim; they relied solely on inferences to be drawn from the primary facts.
The first contention advanced on behalf of all the appellants was that the affidavits of Tan and Liu filed in S 4149/84 were wrongly admitted in evidence. In that suit, there was an application taken out by the defendants to strike out the claim made by Madam Lim. An affidavit was filed by Tan in support, and in response an affidavit was filed by Liu. These affidavits were referred to by counsel for Peng Ann and were admitted in evidence against the objection of counsel for the appellants. Before us, counsel for the appellants contended against the admissibility of these affidavits. In so far as the affidavit of Tan is concerned, Tan (who had died) was not available to prove the content of what he had said in the affidavit and the affidavit is not admissible in evidence. Nor is it admissible under s 33 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) which, so far as relevant, provides: 
 
Evidence given by a witness in a judicial proceeding, or before any person authorised by law to take it, is relevant for the purpose of proving in a subsequent judicial proceeding, or in a later stage of the same judicial proceedings, the truth of the facts which it states, when the witness is dead or cannot be found or ...
 
 
 
Provided that - 
 
(a) the proceeding was between the same parties or their representatives in interest;
(b) the adverse party in the first proceeding had the right and opportunity to cross-examine; 
(c) the questions in issue were substantially the same in the first as in the second proceeding.
 
 
 
It was submitted that the affidavit of Tan does not satisfy the requirements of this section. Peng Ann was not a party in S 4149/84 and Tan was not cross-examined by the adverse party in that suit on the affidavit, as the issue involved in that application was whether the action should be struck out on the ground that it was frivolous, vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court and the actual case had not been tried. Lastly, the question in issue in that suit and that in the case at hand are not substantially the same. As the requirements have not been satisfied, Tan`s affidavit is therefore not admissible in evidence. In our opinion, on the basis of s 33 this argument is unanswerable, and we agree with it.
However, counsel for the respondents relied on s 10 of the Evidence Act which provides: 
 
Where there is a reasonable ground to believe that two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or an actionable wrong, anything said, done or written by any one of such persons, in reference to their common intention after the time when such intention was first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant fact as against each of the persons believed to be so conspiring, as well for the purpose of proving the existence of the conspiracy as for the purpose of showing that any such person was a party to it.
 
 
 
On a plain reading of this provision, it is clear to us that it is not applicable. It is instructive to refer to the decision of the Privy Council in in which s 10 of the Indian Evidence Act (which was in pari materia with s 10 of our Evidence Act) was considered. Lord Wright said, at p 180: 
 
The word relied upon in s 10 Evidence Act, are `in reference to their common intention.` These words may have been chosen as having the same significance as the word `related` used by Williams and Coledridge JJ. Where the evidence is admissible it is in their Lordships` judgment on the principle that the thing done, written or spoken, was something done in carrying out the conspiracy and was receivable as a step in the proof of the conspiracy. The words written or spoken may be a declaration accompanying an act and indicating the quality of the act as being an act in the course of the conspiracy : or the word written or spoken may in themselves be acts done in the course of the conspiracy. This being the principle, their Lordships think the words of s 10 must be construed in accordance with it and are not capable of being widely construed so as to include a statement made by one conspirator in the absence of the other with reference to past acts done in the actual course of carrying out the conspiracy, after it has been completed. The common intention is in the past. In their Lordships` judgment, the words `common intention` signify a common intention existing at the time when the thing was said, done or written by the one of them. Things said, done or written whilst the conspiracy was at foot are relevant as evidence of the common intention, once reasonable ground has been shown to believe in its existence. But it would be a very different matter to hold that any narrative or statement or confession made to a third party after the common intention or conspiracy was no longer operating and had ceased to exist is admissible against the other party. There is then no common intention of the conspirators to which the statement can have reference. In their Lordships` judgment s 10 embodies this principle.
 
 
 
We respectfully adopt this pronouncement on the construction of s 10 of the Evidence Act. In our opinion, s 10 does not apply with reference to any statement made by Tan and Liu in their respective affidavits, which were made some 15 years after the common intention was alleged to have been formed.
Turning to the affidavit of Liu, the question is one of relevance. If he has made any statement or admission in his affidavit which is relevant in the present proceedings, such statement or admission is admissible against him. We do not find in that affidavit any matter deposed to by Liu which is of any relevance here. For this reason, we are of the opinion that the affidavit of Liu is not relevant and admissible in evidence.
The next question is whether these affidavits could be used by the respondents to cross-examine Liu to impeach his credit under s 157 by showing that he had previously made inconsistent statement. The difficulty in the way of using Tan`s affidavit for that purpose is that the content of that affidavit has not been proved: it has not been proved that Liu had made any statement to Tan as alleged by the latter which was inconsistent with or contradictory to what he had testified in Court. Tan`s affidavit therefore could not really be used to cross-examine Liu to impeach his credit.
Liu`s affidavit may, of course, be used to cross-examine Liu to impeach his credit. The learned judge found that Liu`s evidence before him was inconsistent with the stance taken by Liu in his affidavit. He relied on the following part of Liu`s affidavit: 
 
... subdivision was not applied for in 1973-1974 because of the agreement to which I have referred above. Thereafter it was likely (as in the event happened) that the land other than lot 1606 would be compulsorily acquired. When it was so acquired approval for subdivision was automatically provided by reason of the fact that, firstly, everything except lot 1606 was compulsorily acquired and, therefore, de facto divided off, and secondly, the land was resurveyed and renumbered. I draw attention to the fact that what was carried out by the Chief Surveyor was a title survey. Everything has been done to enable LTD [the fourth defendants in present proceedings] to receive a fresh title to lot 1606 ...
 
 
 
This part of Liu`s affidavit should be read in the proper context. He had said earlier in his affidavit that soon after the completion of the purchase for the three lots he and Tan agreed that no steps would be taken for subdivision until the outcome of Lee Tat`s application for planning permission (which had been submitted) was known. That was the agreement referred to by Liu in this part of his affidavit. The application by Lee Tat was refused in September 1974, and the three lots, except the part now known as lot 1606, were subsequently compulsorily acquired. After the acquisition the unacquired land was resurveyed and given a new lot number, ie lot 1606, and everything was ready for Lee Tat to receive a fresh title to lot 1606. We do not find that Liu`s evidence was indicative of any inconsistent stance on his part. Further, we do not find that this part of the affidavit lends support to the inference that Liu was, at the time of the main agreement or immediately prior to it, aware that the three lots, except the joint venture site, would be acquired. In our judgment, both the affidavit of Tan and that of Liu ought not to be used or relied upon as evidence for drawing an inference that Liu was seised of the knowledge, at the time the main agreement was made, that the joint venture site would not be subject to compulsory acquisition.
We now turn to the other evidence relied upon by the respondents to found their claim of conspiracy on the part of Liu and Tan to defraud Peng Ann. Principally, as found below, they are the following. First, the side agreements. These were expressed to be made in the names of Madam Lim and Collin Tan, the respective nominees of Liu and Tan, and were prepared by another solicitor, Ng Kong Yeam and not by the solicitor acting for the respondents at that time, Low Siew Joon. It may be that these agreements were not as open as the appellants had contended. Tan had passed away and no evidence was adduced by his counsel to show why Collin Tan`s name was used. Liu gave an explanation, namely, that Tan explained that as a company of his would be financing the development, it would be inappropriate for his name to appear on the agreements. As such, he proposed to use his daughter`s name and he told Liu that since his daughter would be the shareholder in the proposed company, he felt that Liu`s wife and not Liu himself, should be the co-shareholder. That seems a plausible explanation, but it did not appear to have been accepted below. Be that as it may, the fact remained that Lok and his nominee, Yip, knew of the joint venture then proposed to be entered between Liu and Tan, although they might not know the detailed terms of the joint venture and how it was to be structured. That we think is immaterial. At any rate, as Liu signed on behalf of Madam Lim and Tan on behalf of Collin Tan, it is rather difficult to see how they could effectively conceal their interests in the side agreements.
Next, the terms of the joint venture. Under the sub-sale agreement, the purchaser rather than the vendor was obliged to obtain the subdivision approval for the joint venture site. However, we find nothing unusual or peculiar about this obligation being undertaken by the purchasers. At any rate, it seems to us that this provision was of no significance. Lee Tat was then holding the bulk of the property conveyed to it and would be involved in the development and the application for subdivision approval. Lee Tat was a family company of Tan, and the purchasers of the joint venture site were merely the nominees of Liu and Tan respectively.
Thirdly, it was the case of the respondents that the joint venture site had no access and as such, had no prospect of being a subdivided lot which could be conveyed. Furthermore, it was said that the exact area to be sold was not demarcated. As to the absence of access, the position was far from clear. From our perusal of the site plans, we found that the joint venture site could have access via Jalan Senang and Jalan Lengkong Tujoh. Even if there had been no `proper` access then, it would not be possible to conclude that Liu could have known in early 1973 that many years later the Pan Island Expressway would be running along the northern boundary of the unacquired site. As regards the area to be sold, it had been demarcated to the extent then possible in cl 5 of the sub-sale agreement which provided as follows: 
 
The area of the property sold as mentioned in the first schedule hereto shall be deemed to be correct, final and conclusive and no adjustment in the purchase price herein will be made if on completion of resurvey by the Government such area shall be found to be more or less than that mentioned in the first schedule hereto.
 
 
 
The first schedule was as follows: 
 
All that the land containing an approximate area of five acres as shown and edged red in the plan annexed hereto ...
 
 
 
In effect, the land was delineated although the exact area sold was not precisely defined. At any rate, we find it difficult to accept that the way the land was defined could give rise to any suspicion of a fraudulent conduct.
The learned judge found that Liu had not paid the sum of $25,000 as part of his contribution to the purchase price for the joint venture site under the sub-sale agreement. We are inclined to agree with the learned judge. We also agree with his criticism of the fall-back agreement which allowed the sum of $50,000 (said to have been paid) to be forfeited in the event that the sub-sale agreement should become null and void. Such a provision is extremely odd. However, these facts as they stand, do not raise an inference of fraud; at most, they merely point to some suspicious and inexplicable conduct on the part of Liu and Tan.
In relation to the apportionment of costs under the pre-incorporation agreement, we agree with the learned judge`s finding that Liu would be entitled to 25% of the development without any payment, and that substantial financial contribution would come from Tan. However, we do not find this strange or uncommon in joint ventures. It should be borne in mind that Liu was an HDB contractor and his experience and expertise would have been of some value to Tan in their joint venture; he would probably be expected to devote a substantial amount of his time to overseeing the development based on his expertise. We do not think that this piece of evidence lends support to an inference of fraud on the part of Liu and Tan.
Another aspect which was relied on by the respondent was Liu`s evidence in cross-examination to the effect that he told Tan that the land to be sold to Tan would not be compulsorily acquired. It is necessary to set out this part of his evidence verbatim: 
 
Q: But you then said to Tan Geok Tee sale be conditional upon a joint development, why?
A: If I did not go into joint development with him on the smaller plot of land it would show I had no confidence because I had already told him the land would not be acquired: because Tan Geok Tee`s condition for the purchase is that the land would not be acquired. 
Q: So you told him the land would not be acquired and this was referred to in Tan Geok Tee`s affidavit? 
A: I did not say to Tan Geok Tee that the land would not be acquired. But his condition for the purchase of the land was that the land was not to be acquired. 
A: Tan Geok Tee wanted to see whether I had the confidence that the land would not be acquired. 
Q: So Tan Geok Tee placed more reliance on your assurance that the land would not be acquired than on Lee & Lee`s letter of 12 February 1973 warning of likely acquisition? 
A: I disagree. I did not guarantee that the land would not be acquired. I only told him the land would not be acquired. When he suggested going into a joint venture with me on the five acres he was testing me.
 
 
 
We have two observations on this part of Liu`s evidence. First, the evidence was not confined only to the joint venture site but to the three lots which were sold by Peng Ann to CIP, and this was confirmed by Liu`s clarification in evidence subsequently given to the learned judge. Secondly, this evidence again must be looked at in the proper context; it was not meant as an informed assurance by Liu that the land in question would not be compulsorily acquired. It was a representation to Tan that the land (ie the three lots) would not be acquired, and was obviously made so as to persuade or induce Tan to proceed with the purchase of the land (through CIP) from Peng Ann. This was merely part of a stratagem employed by Liu in marketing or selling the property.
We now turn to Liu`s relationship with the late Teh Cheang Wan relied on heavily by the respondents. Liu was at all material times an HDB contractor and had known Teh since 1966 when the latter was the chief architect of HDB. Liu admitted knowing Teh well when the latter became the Member of Parliament for Geylang East in 1979, as he had helped in community work in Teh`s constituency. But there was no sufficient evidence to show that he was so well-connected with Teh in early 1973 that he came to know some `inside` information pertaining to the compulsory acquisition of the three lots which took place some three years later. We find it difficult to accept that their relationship at that time could afford any valid ground for drawing an inference of this special knowledge alleged to be known to Liu alone. It is pertinent to note that Teh became the Minister for National Development only in early 1979.
There are, in our view, material facts which lead to the conclusion that Liu in all probabilities did not have the special knowledge alleged by Peng Ann. The main agreement and the sub-sale agreement were made in early 1973, and the purchase under the main agreement was completed on 14 March 1973. On 20 December 1973, Lee Tat applied for planning permission for a condominium development and golf course of lots 21-26 pt and 123, and the application was refused on 21 September 1974. One of the reasons for such refusal was that the site would be affected by a public scheme. Lee Tat`s subsequent appeal to the Minister for National Development was rejected on 31 March 1975. Throughout this period, Liu still had an interest in the joint venture site. The gazette notifications for the compulsory acquisition of the bulk of the three lots were made on 19 April and 23 July 1976: the first notification was for the acquisition of lots 21-26 pt and 4-7 pt, and the second for the acquisition of lots 21-26 pt, 4-7 pt and 123. That was more than three years after the purchase. In these circumstances, it is highly unlikely that Liu in early 1973 was aware that the joint venture site would be excluded from the compulsory acquisition. The fact that most of the joint venture site turned out to be unacquired in 1976 was either purely fortuitous or the result of some intervention of a third party in which Liu might or might not be involved at that time. But neither of these circumstances is a matter with which we are concerned; nor should we speculate.
Lastly, it should be borne in mind that Liu and Lok had been involved in various transactions before the sale of the three lots to CIP, and at the time of the sale they were still on good terms. If Liu had had any secret knowledge that any part of the three lots would not be compulsorily acquired, it would be extremely odd that he should prefer to share it with Tan with whom he had had no business dealings instead of with Lok, his old business associate.
It seems to us that all the shareholders, who were also directors, of Peng Ann had known about the joint venture but were not interested in involving Peng Ann. Two days after Peng Ann had entered into a binding agreement to purchase the eight lots of land in July 1972, three of the lots were gazetted by the Government for compulsory acquisition. That must have been very unsettling news to the shareholders of Peng Ann and in particular to Lok. Lok was at the time the managing director of Singapore Finance Ltd and had approved a loan to Peng Ann, then a three-dollar-company, which far exceeded the purchase price of the property. He was obviously accountable to the finance company should the loan or any part thereof become irrecoverable. The three shareholders and directors, Liu, Yip and Koh, were personally liable as guarantors. It is only obvious that there was some anxiety on the part of all those involved in Peng Ann`s affairs to sell and dispose of the remaining property. By a stroke of good fortune, Peng Ann succeeded in selling the three lots to CIP and made a considerable profit of more than a million dollars in less than three months. All this was substantially borne out by the evidence of Yip, who at the material time was a nominee of Lok. The learned judge made no adverse finding against Yip and we can find no reason for not accepting his evidence.
Looking at the cumulative effect of all the evidence, we find no more than a suspicion but nothing which, in our opinion, can lead to proof of the fraudulent conduct on the part of Liu and Tan that was alleged, bearing in mind that the onus is on Peng Ann to establish this allegation to a standard which commensurates with the seriousness of the charge. All in all, we are not persuaded that the circumstantial evidence established on a balance of probabilities that when the three lots were sold by Peng Ann to CIP, Liu at that time knew that the joint venture site would not be acquired. Hence, there could not be passing of any such knowledge to Tan. Devoid of such knowledge, the sale of the three lots negotiated by Liu on behalf of Peng Ann appeared to be a bargain at arms` length and as the learned judge found the sale price was not inordinately low. In the result, the claim in conspiracy must fail.
For all these reasons, we allow the two appeals with costs here and below and set aside the judgment of the court below, save and except that part thereof dismissing the claim against Yip with costs, and we dismiss the claim of Peng Ann against Liu, Tan and Lee Tat. There will be the usual consequential order for repayment to the respective appellants the deposits in Court as security for costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The question is whether the court has the necessary jurisdiction and power to grant to the plaintiff, co-owner of a flat:
 
 
(i) mesne profits;
  
 
 
 
(ii) aggravated damages; or alternatively 
 
(iii) exemplary damages;
  
 
 
and make an order for the delivery up and sale of the property pursuant to a consent order of court made by the Syariah Court on 23 July 1991.
 Background
The plaintiff and the defendant are Indian Muslims. The parties contracted their marriage under the Syariah law on 29 September 1985. They subsequently became the joint owners of Blk 354 Clementi Ave 2 #03-225, Singapore 0512 (the property) which was purchased for $17,300. The defendant`s mother lived with them. Problems with the marriage began in 1986 when the defendant was in hospital for three months. The plaintiff was asked to be obedient to the defendant`s mother. The defendant was told that the plaintiff was seeing her boyfriend. The plaintiff denies the allegation absolutely and blames the defendant`s mother and relatives.
The plaintiff was confronted with the allegation by the defendant. She denied it but the defendant did not believe her. It was a difficult three-month period for the plaintiff. On one occasion when the plaintiff complained about demands for money made by his relatives, she was beaten up by the defendant.
The marriage was dissolved by the Syariah Court on 23 July 1991. The Syariah Court`s order is in the following terms: 
 
1 The probationary period maintenance of $300 shall be paid by the husband today.
2 The wife waives the payment of divorce compensation. 
3 Regarding the household goods, the wife will take one bedroom set and kitchen utensils. 
4 No children. 
5 The flat at Blk 354, Clementi Ave 2 #03-225 (0512) was purchased in two names using the CPF contributions of both parties. The flat shall be sold at market price. After deduction for both parties` CPF moneys with interest and whatever expenses for the sale transaction the profit shall be divided between both of them. 
6 The divorce registration fee of $59 shall be paid by the husband.
 
 
 
 
 Enforcement
 
The plaintiff has remarried and has had considerable difficulty enforcing the order and agreement. The defendant cannot say `I must be fined or sent to jail`. The question is whether he can be ordered to pay damages for trespass for having ousted and dispossessed the plaintiff of her property. The plaintiff has approached the court not as a Muslim seeking to enforce a Syariah Court order but as a co-owner of land entitled to damages for trespass under the common law that is applicable to the circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants and subject to such modifications as those circumstances may require. (See s 3 of the Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Ed).)
The ex parte application was made under the Rules of the Supreme Court 1990 (RSC). I was anxious to give the defendant an opportunity to state his case and argue, if necessary, that the president of the Syariah Court must deal with the matter.
I therefore made orders on 6 January 1995 to make it plain to the defendant that he had as a co-owner to stick to his agreement and respect the plaintiff`s rights as a co-owner. The defendant was ordered to deliver up the property to the plaintiff for having committed trespass by ousting and dispossessing her after having agreed to sell the property.
The prayers for mesne profits, aggravated and exemplary damages were adjourned together with the prayers for costs and interest. The plaintiff was ordered not to extract the orders and the defendant was given time to respond and make any objection, if any, to the orders made which were sent to him so that the jurisdiction and the power of the court to give relief to Muslims who are co-owners seeking damages is not questioned at a later date. The defendant has not responded.
 Rules
Rules 12 and 22(2) of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Rules of the Administration of Muslim Law Act (Cap 3) (AMLA) provide: 
 
Rule 12
 
 
 
(1) Whenever any persons desire to have their divorce by mutual consent registered by a Kadi, they shall apply in writing to the Kadi.
(2) The application shall be made in Form 7 in the Schedule and shall be made by the husband and by the wife. 
(3) Every application shall be verified by a statutory declaration.
 
 
 
Rule 22
 
 
 
(2) A judgment may declare the rights of the parties or may order a party to do any act including the payment of money and the transfer of property.
 
 
 
Rule 23 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Rules provides: 
 
(1) On the neglect or failure of any person to comply with an order of the Court made under section 52 of the Act, the Court may issue a warrant to levy the amount of the value of the property by distress and sale. The warrant shall be in Form 12 in the Schedule.
(2) Where the Court sentences a person to imprisonment for failure or neglect to comply with an order made under section 52 of the Act, the Court shall issue a warrant of commitment in Form 13 in the Schedule.
 
 
 
The defendant has not complied with the agreement made final by the order of court. The plaintiff`s attempts to negotiate a settlement have not been successful. The plaintiff does not wish to enforce the order under r 23 but she is anxious to get some money and get on with her separate life. The plaintiff`s reluctance to enforce the order of the Syariah Court is being exploited by the defendant.
The Syariah Court is vested with powers to secure compliance with orders made by it but is not vested with powers to order payment of damages in civil proceedings for trespass.
 Ousted
The plaintiff`s case is that she has been forcibly ousted from the property because:
 
 
(a) they are joint tenants of the property which was their matrimonial home; 
 
(b) they subsequently filed for divorce in the Syariah Court which was registered on 23 July 1991; 
 
(c) she, prior to the divorce, left the property on 25 August 1989 having tolerated approximately three years of ill treatment by the defendant and his family members; 
 
(d) they submitted an agreement of the Syariah Court, the terms of which have been embodied in the Syariah Court order; 
 
(e) the defendant refused to sell the property the very next day; 
 
(f) despite numerous attempts by the plaintiff to get the defendant to sell the property in accordance with their agreement and the Syariah Court order, the defendant has continued, and is continuing, to resist all such attempts; and 
 
(g) the plaintiff has been denied the use of the premises.
  
 
 
The defendant has committed trespass and the plaintiff is entitled on the facts to:
 
 
(1) mesne profits; 
 
(2) aggravated damages; and 
 
(3) exemplary damages.
  
 
 
 
 Rights of co-owners
 
The law on the transfer by co-owners is well settled. In , Lord Westbury said (p 478): 
 
It is undoubtedly settled law that he cannot maintain trespass unless there is a case of ouster, and, as I have already observed, no facts amounting to a case of ouster are stated in the special case. But then it follows clearly he is not entitled to trover for the entirety of the growing crops. All that he could allege would be, that he was entitled in some form or other, either in law or in equity, to have one-half of the value of the growing crops. But the form of action that he has adopted is not consistent with that claim.
 
 
 
In , Hepworth J said (p 98): 
 
One co-owner of land can only bring an action of trespass against the other if he has been actually ousted or dispossessed of the land. Each co-owner is entitled to possession of the whole land, so that if one turns the other off the land or part of it, it is a trespass ( 137 ER 175). In it was held that putting a lock on a gate (not kept locked) is not enough. In his judgment Lord Hatherley, the Lord Chancellor, said that even if there had been a finding that the gate was locked, that would not have been sufficient unless it had been shown that the plaintiff was excluded by that locking, or that on some occasion when he applied to have it opened it was not opened. Nothing passed between the parties which showed that the intention of putting the lock there was to exclude the co-tenant in common. There was nothing in the circumstances from which the inference of exclusion was to be drawn.
 
 
 
The question is whether the plaintiff, a co-owner, is entitled to the reliefs prayed for on the ground that she has been ousted or dispossessed. The plaintiff has approached the court as a co-owner and not as a person seeking to enforce the Syariah Court order.
The plaintiff remarried on 12 April 1992 and as a co-owner is being kept out of enjoying her share of the property in the face of her rights as co-owner and an order of the Syariah Court.
 Rule 31
Rule 31 of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Rules further provides that the Syariah Court may: 
 
In matters of practice and procedure not expressly provided for in these Rules, the Court may adopt the practice and procedure in civil proceedings for the time being in force in the District Courts.
 
 
 
The question is whether the jurisdiction of the High Court is excluded. The tort of trespass is part of the English common law as it existed in 1826 which was received into Singapore by the Second Charter of Justice. Section 3 of the Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Ed) preserves the English common law in so far as it was part of the law of Singapore before the commencement of the Act immediately before 12 November 1993 and in so far as it is applicable to the circumstances of Singapore and its inhabitants and subject to such modifications as those circumstances may require.
Section 16(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (SCJA) confers the jurisdiction to hear the present action in trespass. The High Court`s jurisdiction is not excluded under s 16(2) SCJA because the Syariah Court has no jurisdiction to hear and try the plaintiff`s action. It provides: 
 
Notwithstanding subsection (1), the High Court shall have no jurisdiction to hear and try any civil proceeding which comes within the jurisdiction of the Syariah Court constituted under the Administration of Muslim Law Act.
 
 
 
Chan Sek Keong J in at p 281H held that s 35(2) AMLA has conferred jurisdiction on the Syariah Court to exercise judicial power only in respect of the subject matters enumerated thereunder. The Syariah Court has no jurisdiction to hear and try the plaintiff`s action because an action in tort for trespass to land is not enumerated in s 35(2) AMLA and does not come within the meaning of civil proceedings in s 16(2) SCJA.
The reliefs sought in this originating summons are different from the reliefs in OS 984/94, , where the plaintiff applied, inter alia, for an order under s 14 SCJA to empower the Registrar of the Supreme Court to execute all documents as are necessary on behalf of and in the name of the defendant to effect the transfer of the property to the plaintiff. I was of the view that the president of the Syariah Court had the necessary powers to enforce the orders made by him.
 Conveyancing and Law of Property Act
Section 73A of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61, 1994 Ed) (CLPA) reads: 
 
A joint tenant or tenant in common shall be liable to account to his co-owner for receiving more than his share or proportion of any rents or profits arising from the property.
 
 
 
The question is whether the right to an action for trespass to land against a co-owner has been removed or whether s 73A CLPA provides the plaintiff with an alternative cause of action. In my opinion, s 73A CLPA does not remove the plaintiff`s right to an action in tort for trespass.
Megaw LJ in said (p 242): 
 
... the plaintiff, when he has established that the defendant has remained on as a trespasser in residential property, is entitled, to damages without bringing evidence that he could or would have let the property to someone else in the absence of the trespassing defendant, to have as damages for the trespass the value of the property as it would fairly be calculated; and, in the absence of anything special in the particular case it would be the ordinary letting value of the property that would determine the amount of damages.
 
 
 
The plaintiff has proved that the defendant is a trespasser. The plaintiff is awarded mesne profits and the only question is the quantum. I find the plaintiff was ousted on 24 July 1991 and I accept the valuation report of Century 99 Pte Ltd which gave the estimated furnished rent of property. The award is for $18,116.71 ($36,233.42 [divide] 2) computed as follows:
Where a husband or wife parts company and one of them is forced to leave the matrimonial home, it is only in very exceptional cases that aggravated damages will be ordered. The solicitor for the plaintiff has argued that the plaintiff`s proper feelings of pride and dignity have been hurt. Section 47(1) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap 129, 1990 Ed) prohibits the plaintiff from owning a second flat, her money is tied up and that therefore aggravated damages should be ordered. The short answer to that is that whenever a marriage breaks down, there are hurt feelings and bruised pride suffered.
The arguments for exemplary damages to teach the defendant that `tort does not pay` and to deter others from similar conduct (see at p 1073, per Lord Hailsham LC) is achieved in the circumstances of this case by the award of net proceeds from the sale of the property having regard to the estimated amounts the parties will receive and demonstrating to the defendant that the law deals with wrongdoers in more ways than one:
The plaintiff is given conduct of the sale of the property by private treaty provided the property is not sold for less than $110,000. The plaintiff`s solicitors will pay the defendant`s share of at least $25,600.70 to him. In the event the defendant refuses to accept his share of the proceeds within 14 days after notice has been given to him, the money will be paid into court. I accordingly order:
 
 
(1) Order in terms of prayer 1 to read that the property be sold in the open market at a price of not less than $110,000 and for the defendant to receive a sum of not less than $25,600.70 from the proceeds of sale of the property referred to in prayer 1. 
 
(2) Order in terms of prayer 2 for $18,116.71. 
 
(3) No order on prayers 3, 4 and 7. 
 
(4) 
 Costs 
: Costs fixed at $5,000. 
 
(5) Leave to extract order of court. 
 
(6) 
 Interest 
: There will be no order for interest on any of the sums awarded to the plaintiff except for the CPF contributions.

 Background
 
 
Cur Adv Vult
 
 
This action for defamation and the counterclaim on the basis of an alleged passing off both arise out of Singapore`s competitive market in respect of automotive batteries. All the parties in the case are active players in that market.
Each of the plaintiffs is a company incorporated in Singapore. The plaintiffs share a common chairman and director (one Mr Ong Choon Lin), have the same business address and are in the same business: they deal in automotive batteries, tyres and other motor vehicle accessories. The first plaintiff has been in business since August 1976 and the second plaintiff since May 1985.
The defendant company was incorporated in Singapore in 1971 as a subsidiary of Yuasa Battery Co Ltd of Japan which is now known as Yuasa Corp (Yuasa Japan). Since its establishment, the defendant has carried on business as a manufacturer and supplier of automotive batteries for vehicles such as cars, buses and cranes. These batteries are sold in Singapore and abroad under a get-up bearing the names `Yuasa Pafecta` by virtue of a licence from Yuasa Japan which provides technical assistance to the defendant in the manufacture of the batteries.
In April 1990, Mr Ong Choon Lin attended a trade fair in Guangzhou, China. There he saw a stall at which automotive batteries bearing the name `Yuasa` were displayed. Mr Ong made enquiries and discovered that the batteries had been manufactured by an organization called Xinjiang Comprehensive Electric Motor Plant (Xinjiang Electric) which had a factory manufacturing batteries in Xinjiang Province, China. He was also shown a catalogue of Xinjiang Electric`s products which indicated that its factory had been the only one assigned to manufacture batteries with the Yuasa trade mark. He was told that Xinjiang Electric had a contract with Yuasa Japan under which it had been licensed to manufacture Yuasa batteries and that it used Yuasa Japan`s technical know-how.
On 26 April 1990, the second plaintiff entered into a contract with China National Machinery & Equipment Import & Export Corp, Xinjiang Co Ltd (Xinjiang Co) for the purchase of 1,400 pieces of dry charged Yuasa brand batteries made by Xinjiang Electric. The purchase was effected in this way as Mr Ong was told that he could not buy the batteries directly from Xinjiang Electric but had to place his order with Xinjiang Co. Subsequently, the first plaintiff caused a letter of credit to be established in favour of Xinjiang Co in payment of the purchase price. Thereafter it was the first plaintiff who was indicated in all documentation as the importer of the goods.
The goods were shipped by Xinjiang Company in mid August 1990 and among the shipping documents sent to the plaintiffs was a certificate from the Xinjiang Import & Export Commodity Inspection Bureau of the People`s Republic of China certifying that the 1,400 pieces of Yuasa brand batteries so shipped had been manufactured in the People`s Republic of China. The ship carrying the goods arrived in Singapore on 17 September 1990 and the goods were cleared by the first plaintiff from the customs on 20 September 1990.
In the meantime, in late August, the defendant had received information that Yuasa batteries manufactured in China were going to be imported into Singapore and sold here. Later, its managing director, Mr Yoshiharu Jibu, learnt from the defendant`s authorized battery dealers that the first plaintiff was selling such batteries to the public. Mr Jibu made enquiries with Yuasa Japan and was informed that it did not have a subsidiary nor any manufacturing facility in China. From the information he obtained, Mr Jibu concluded that the batteries sold by the plaintiffs were not authentic Yuasa batteries but imitation ones.
On 27 September 1990, the defendant issued the following circular to all its dealers: 
 
27 September 1990
 
 
 
Dear Yuasa authorised dealers:
 
 
 
Subject: Beware of imitation!
 
 
 
Recently, unauthorized `Yuasa` brand automotive batteries purporting to be manufactured in the People`s Republic of China have appeared in the Singapore market.
 
 
 
We categorically state herein that Yuasa Battery Co Ltd Japan do not have a manufacturing facility in the People`s Republic of China. Such `Yuasa` brand batteries are therefore illegal imitation of our registered brand.
We, Yuasa Battery Singapore, hereby stress that we will not hold any responsibility on the quality or whatsoever of these imitation batteries. Buyers of these batteries will not enjoy our services and warranty coverage.
We further clarify that Yuasa Battery Singapore Co Pte Ltd have no relation with the following companies for their imitation `Yuasa` brand battery: 
 
Sin Heak Hin Tyre Pte. Ltd.
 
 
 
Gateway Riken Tyres Pte. Ltd.
 
 
 
We would like to remind again that Yuasa Battery Singapore Co Pte Ltd is the only one authorized agent for all the Yuasa branded products marketing in Singapore for Yuasa Battery Co Ltd Japan and Yuasa group companies all over the world.

 Advocates and Solicitors
 
 
 
The plaintiffs learnt about this circular sometime after it was issued, the exact date is a matter of dispute. They took exception to it on the basis that it was defamatory and, on 16 May 1991, their solicitors wrote to the defendant stating that, by reason of the circular, the plaintiffs had been greatly injured in their credit and reputation and had been brought into scandal, odium and contempt and had suffered damage. The plaintiffs demanded an apology and damages.
The defendant`s solicitors issued a letter of response on 24 May 1991. This letter did not contain any apology. It simply stated three things. First, that Yuasa Japan had given Xinjiang Electric a licence `to use the trade mark ""Yuasa"" with no other distinguishing mark.` Secondly, that that licence was for usage and sale within China. Thirdly, it was said that export from China was subject to the approval of Yuasa Japan and that such approval had not been granted for export to Singapore. Apparently, there had been a breach of the licence agreement. The letter ended by giving the plaintiffs notice that any further attempts to deal in the Chinese Yuasa batteries would be resisted by legal proceedings.
 The action
The plaintiffs commenced this action for damages on 10 January 1992. Their cause of action was in defamation. In para 6 of the statement of claim endorsed on the writ of summons, the plaintiffs set out the full text of the circular. By para 7 they pleaded as follows: 
 
The said words [ie the whole of the circular] in their natural and ordinary meaning meant and 
 (sic)
 understood to mean:
 
 
 
(a) The batteries of `Yuasa` brand imported by the first plaintiff from the said motor plant in the People`s Republic of China for the sale and distribution by both the first and second plaintiffs in Singapore were imitated 
 (sic)
 products to that of the batteries of the same brand name sold or being sold by the defendants to all their dealers.
(b) That both the first and second plaintiffs were unscrupulous and/or deceptive in misleading the public into believing that the `Yuasa` brand batteries imported by the first plaintiffs from the said motor plant in the People`s Republic of China for sale and distribution of the same were not approved or recognized and/or licensed by Yuasa Battery Co Ltd of Japan.
 
 
 
In May 1994, the plaintiffs amended the statement of claim to add an additional cause of action. They alleged that the defendant had in the circular maliciously written and published or caused to be written and published of, and in relation to the quality of, the Yuasa batteries sold by the plaintiffs, certain false statements, to wit the following: 
 
We categorically state herein that `Yuasa` Battery Co Ltd of Japan do not have a manufacturing facility in the People`s Republic of China. Such `Yuasa` brand batteries are therefore illegal imitation of our registered brand.
 
 
 
We, Yuasa Battery Singapore hereby stress that we will not hold any responsibility on the quality or whatsoever of these imitation batteries.
The plaintiffs` complaint was that the said words were false in that the plaintiffs` Yuasa batteries were not imitation Yuasa batteries nor were they unfit for the purpose for which they were sold. They further alleged that by reason of the publication of the said words, a total of 235 units of Yuasa batteries that the plaintiffs had sold to dealers had been returned and the balance of the plaintiffs` stock became unsaleable. The plaintiffs therefore made an alternative claim for damages for slander of goods.
The defendant first filed its defence and counterclaim in August 1992. This was amended in December 1994. At the beginning of the trial, the defendant`s defence in relation to the allegations of defamation and slander of goods was as follows:
 
 
(1) that the Yuasa dry charged batteries purportedly imported by the plaintiffs from China were not the products of Xinjiang Electric; 
 
(2) the defendant denied that the wording of the circular bore or was understood to bear any of the meanings set out in para 7 of the statement of claim or any meaning defamatory of the plaintiffs; 
 
(3) the said words were true in substance and in fact; 
 
(4) alternatively, the said words were fair comment made without malice upon a matter of public interest, namely, the acts and conduct of the plaintiffs as traders and dealers in batteries; 
 
(5) alternatively, each of the occasions on which the allegedly defamatory material was published was an occasion of qualified privilege; 
 
(6) with regard to the assertion of a slander on goods, the defendant denied that the words were published in relation to the quality of the Yuasa batteries sold by the plaintiffs and put the latter to proof that the words were false, that the publication was malicious and that it was calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiffs in respect of their businesses; 
 
(7) the plaintiffs were put to strict proof of their damages.
  
 
 
The counterclaim stated that the defendant had since June 1971 carried on and still carried on the business of manufacturing and selling automobile batteries under the name `Yuasa` and had in the course of the said business made extensive use of the name. Accordingly, the name had become known in the trade and to the general public as signifying the defendant`s batteries exclusively and the defendant had acquired a substantial reputation in and by the use of the name. It alleged that the plaintiffs had since August 1990 passed off batteries not the batteries of the defendant as and for the batteries of the defendant. The plaintiffs` act had led to the defendant`s batteries being confused with the plaintiffs` batteries and to members of the public acquiring the plaintiffs` batteries in the belief that they were acquiring the batteries and aftersales service of the defendant. The defendant therefore claimed an injunction to restrain the plaintiffs from doing such acts, an inquiry as to damages and an order for the destruction of all infringing batteries.
In their reply and defence to counterclaim, the plaintiffs alleged that in publishing the circular, the defendant had been actuated by express malice and was not entitled to the defence of qualified privilege. Particulars of this allegation were given. They also denied the allegation of passing off. They averred that the Yuasa batteries they had distributed here were products of Xinjiang Electric and had been manufactured with the approval and licence of Yuasa Japan and that the name `Yuasa` had been used thereon in accordance with a licence agreement dated 2 February 1987 between Yuasa Japan and Xinjiang Electric. They therefore contended that since the use of the name had been approved by Yuasa Japan, the defendant as a subsidiary of Yuasa Japan was estopped from alleging that there was any confusion between the defendant`s batteries and the plaintiffs` batteries.
The issues that confront me as a result of the above pleadings are as follows:
 
 
(1) whether the wording in the circular complained about is defamatory either to the degree alleged by the plaintiffs in their statement of claim or to some lesser degree; 
 
(2) if the answer to the above issue is in the affirmative, whether the defendant has been able to make out a defence of justification and in this regard, the important sub-issues are whether the batteries imported by the plaintiffs were manufactured by Xinjiang Electric and whether Xinjiang Electric was authorized to manufacture Yuasa brand batteries; 
 
(3) if justification fails, whether the defendant has been able to establish a defence of fair comment or qualified privilege; 
 
(4) if the only defence made out is that of qualified privilege, whether the plaintiffs have been able to establish the express malice necessary to destroy that privilege; 
 
(5) whether the defendant slandered the plaintiffs` goods; 
 
(6) if a finding in favour of the plaintiffs is made on either defamation or slander of goods, the quantum of damages which should be awarded to the plaintiffs; 
 
(7) whether the defendant has been able to establish a case in passing off and if so the damages payable in respect of such passing off.
  
 
 
 
 Issue (1): Did the defendant defame the plaintiffs?
 
It is not disputed that for defamation to be established, the words complained about must be defamatory of the plaintiffs in that the natural and ordinary meaning of such words would tend to lower the plaintiffs in the estimation of right thinking members of society generally or would convey an imputation on them which disparages them in their trade or business. It is also not disputed that it is the judge who determines whether the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained about is that which is alleged in the statement of claim or if not, what, if any, less injurious defamatory meaning the words bear.
Looking at the circular here what does it say? It is headed `Subject: Beware of Imitation` which wording immediately indicates that it is a warning about fake goods. The first paragraph reads: `Recently, unauthorized `Yuasa` brand automotive batteries purporting to be manufactured in the People`s Republic of China have appeared in the Singapore market.` In my view, this means that at about the time the circular was issued, certain batteries which were supposed to have been manufactured in China were being offered for sale in Singapore and these batteries bore the `Yuasa` brand without the authority of the owner of the brand.
The second paragraph states `We categorically state herein that Yuasa Battery Co Ltd Japan do 
 (sic) 
 not have a manufacturing facility in the People`s Republic of China. Such `Yuasa` brand batteries are therefore illegal imitation of our registered brand.` This means that Yuasa Japan has no factory in China which manufactures batteries and therefore that any batteries made in China and marked with the Yuasa brand are illegal imitations of a registered brand belonging to the defendant and Yuasa Japan.
The third paragraph states `We Yuasa Battery Singapore hereby stress that we will not hold any responsibility on the quality or whatsoever of these imitation batteries. Buyers of these batteries will not enjoy our services and warranty coverage.` The first sentence of this paragraph means that the batteries manufactured in China and which are illegal imitations, are of poor quality and poor manufacture or, at least, that their quality is poorer than the quality of the defendant`s batteries. In any case the defendant has no responsibility for defects in these Chinese batteries.
The fourth paragraph reading `We further clarify that Yuasa Battery Singapore Co Pte Ltd have 
 (sic) 
 no relation with the following companies for their imitation Yuasa brand battery: Sin Heak Hin Tyre Pte Ltd; Gateway Riken Tyres Pte Ltd` means, in the light of the previous paragraphs, that the plaintiffs are the companies that have brought the imitation batteries from China into Singapore and offered them for sale here and that they have done this without the consent or prior knowledge of the defendant with whom they have no connection at all. The penultimate paragraph of the circular asserts that the defendant is the only authorized agent for products bearing the Yuasa brand which are sold in Singapore. This assertion implies that any sale in Singapore by anyone else of Yuasa brand products would be unauthorized.
From the above analysis it is clear that the circular, taken as a whole, does mean that the batteries bearing the Yuasa brand imported by the plaintiffs from a factory in China into Singapore for sale and distribution in Singapore were imitations of the batteries bearing the same brand sold by the defendant in Singapore. This, more or less, is the meaning alleged by para 7(a) of the statement of claim. Thus, if the pleadings had remained in their original form, the plaintiffs would have had no difficulty in establishing that the circular bore the meaning complained about.
In July 1994, however, the plaintiffs delivered further and better particulars of both para 7(a) and para 7(b) of the statement of claim in response to a court order. They had been ordered to identify those words in the circular which they relied on to support the meaning stated in those two paragraphs. In their response, they identified the following sentences as the relevant ones: 
 
We categorically state herein that Yuasa Battery Co Ltd Japan do [sic] not have a manufacturing facility in the People`s Republic of China. Such `Yuasa` brand batteries are therefore illegal imitation of our registered brand. [
 Paragraph 2 of the circular.
]
 
 
 
[And] 
 
We Yuasa Battery Singapore hereby stress that we will not hold any responsibility on the quality or whatsoever of these imitation batteries. Buyers of these batteries will not enjoy our services and warranty coverage. [
 Paragraph 4 of the circular
.]
 
 
 
Counsel for the defendant, Mr Tok, contended that the quoted words do not say or it cannot be inferred from these words that it was the first plaintiff who imported batteries from a Chinese manufacturer. He pointed out that Mr Ong himself had admitted that he could not find any such meaning in these two paragraphs. Counsel went on to say that the whole letter does not have the meaning which the plaintiffs contended it did. I cannot accept Mr Tok`s arguments. First, Mr Ong`s view of the paragraphs in question is irrelevant. Secondly, whilst I think that if the plaintiffs had said in their further and better particulars that they also relied on para 4 of the circular, there would have been absolutely no room for the argument which Mr Tok made, in my view, in the factual matrix that existed at the time the circular was sent out, para 2 of the document as it stands does bear the meaning attributed to it by the plaintiffs in para 7(a).
It was apparent from the evidence that in August and September 1990 dealers in the Singapore battery market were aware that the plaintiffs were in the process of importing Yuasa brand batteries from China for sale here. This evidence came from Mr Teh Kim Pat, a manager working for the defendant. He was told by the some of the defendant`s dealers as early as August 1990 that they had been approached by salesmen employed by the plaintiffs (which plaintiff was not specified) with offers to supply them with Yuasa batteries which the plaintiffs were importing from China. The circular, it would be recalled, was addressed to all the defendant`s dealers. Some at least of the recipients when reading para 2 of the circular would have realized that it was directed at the Yuasa batteries imported by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the natural and ordinary meaning of para 2 was that the Yuasa brand batteries imported by the plaintiffs from China for sale in Singapore were imitations of the defendant`s Yuasa batteries. In this context the fact that the paragraph does not specifically identify the first plaintiff as the importer is, I think, immaterial.
By para 7(b) of the statement of claim read with the further and better particulars, it is alleged that the two paragraphs quoted also mean that the plaintiffs were unscrupulous and/or deceitful in misleading the public into believing that the Yuasa brand batteries imported by the first plaintiff from China were not approved or recognized and/or licensed by Yuasa Japan. The grammatical construction of this sub-paragraph leaves a lot to be desired. It appears to mean that the circular contains an allegation that both the plaintiffs had acted unscrupulously and/or deceptively by causing the Singapore public to believe that the Chinese Yuasa brand batteries imported by them were batteries which were 
 not 
 approved or recognised or licensed by Yuasa Japan. Such an allegation does not make sense. If it is one of the things which the plaintiffs thought the circular meant then they cannot complain about it.
On the other hand, what the plaintiffs probably meant by para 7(b) of the statement of claim is that the allegation in the circular was that they acted unscrupulously and/or deceptively in leading the public to believe that their Chinese Yuasa batteries were in fact approved or recognized or licensed by Yuasa Japan. I agree that the cited paragraphs of the circular do mean that the Chinese Yuasa batteries were not recognized, licensed or approved by Yuasa Japan. They also imply that the importers of those batteries (whom the recipients of the circular would have identified as the plaintiffs) were wrongfully holding them out to the Singapore public as being authentic Yuasa batteries and entitled to the services and warranty coverage provided by the defendant.
I therefore conclude that the words complained about in paras 2 and 4 of the circular are in their natural and ordinary meaning defamatory of the plaintiffs. It would lower the reputation of any business in Singapore if it was accused of dealing in imitation goods and of holding out such goods as being authentic goods. Such statements are also defamatory in the sense that they disparage the plaintiffs in the way that they conduct their business.
I must therefore turn to consider whether the defendant has any defence excusing it from liability to the plaintiffs.
 Issue (2): Were the words complained of true?
In order to establish the defence of justification, a defendant must prove that the defamatory imputation is true and he must prove the truth of the very imputation complained of. He must also prove the truth of all the material statements in the libel, ie he must justify everything that the libel contains which is injurious to the plaintiff. See: 
 Gatley 
 paras 352, 354 and 356.
In the present case, the imputations that have to be proved true are that the Yuasa batteries dealt in by the plaintiffs were imitations and that they were not licensed, approved or recognized by Yuasa Japan. The defendant endeavoured to establish these imputations in two ways. First, it contended that the batteries had not been made by Xinjiang Electric. Secondly, it said that even if these batteries were Xinjiang Electric`s products, they were still unauthorized and infringing batteries as Yuasa Japan had not given Xinjiang Electric permission to export them for sale in Singapore. Implicit in these contentions was that Xinjiang Electric had in fact been granted some rights to the use of the brand name `Yuasa` by reason of the 1987 licence agreement between it and Yuasa Japan. It is the extent of those rights that came into issue.
The defendant supported its contention that the batteries imported by the plaintiffs could not possibly have been manufactured by Xinjiang Electric as follows. First, Mr Tok said that these batteries bore only the words `Yuasa Dry Charged` on their cases whereas batteries actually made by Xinjiang Electric bore, in addition, the words `Xinjiang Comprehensive Electric Motor Plant Xinjiang China`. Secondly, he said that the plaintiffs` witnesses from China had not been able to establish that the batteries sold to the plaintiffs were actually Xinjiang Electric`s products.
Mr K Okamoto, a manager in the International Operations Division of Yuasa Japan, gave evidence in support of the assertion relating to the markings on the batteries. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he deposed that under the licence agreement, Xinjiang Electric was allowed to use the Yuasa trade mark but only on batteries manufactured for sale within China. Xinjiang Electric was not permitted to export such batteries without Yuasa Japan`s prior approval and, whilst the licence agreement was in force between February 1987 and August 1992, such permission was never given.
He also stated that by a letter dated 28 April 1988, Yuasa Japan required Xinjiang Electric to comply with its obligations under the licence agreement and to have its full name and the country of origin of its batteries printed on its batteries. Yuasa Japan also sent a silkscreen to Xinjiang Electric containing the wording to be printed on its batteries. An examination of the letter reveals that it did not state precisely what Mr Okamoto had deposed to. First of all, it reminds Xinjiang Electric that under the licence agreement, only the trade mark `Yuasa` had been assigned to them. The trademark `Pafecta` had not been so assigned. Secondly, it states that the products manufactured should have the words `Made in China` on them in accordance with international law. The letter went on to say: 
 
With the two points in view, you are hereby officially advised, upon receipt of this letter, to stop manufacturing batteries bearing the `PAFECTA` trade mark and using labels with the words `Made in Japan` as well as selling the said products within the country and abroad.
 
 
 
Obviously, Yuasa Japan was concerned that Xinjiang Electric was passing off the batteries it had made as having been made by Yuasa Japan itself.
Mr Tok submitted that the defendant`s position is that Xinjiang Electric would have honoured the licence agreement and complied with the April 1988 letter. They would have printed the name of the company and the true country of origin on all batteries made by them. He did not, however, produce any evidence in support of that submission apart from a document attached to Mr Okamoto`s affidavit which Mr Okamoto identified (though only in re-examination) as being a copy of the silkscreen sent to Xinjiang Electric in 1988. This document indicates that the Yuasa Japan wanted the markings on the Xinjiang Electric batteries to contain Xinjiang Electric`s full name followed by the words `Xinjiang China`. There was no direct evidence from the defendant to show that Xinjiang Electric had followed Yuasa Japan`s directive. Mr Okamoto does not appear to have followed up on his letter by visiting the Chinese factory and ensuring that proper markings were put onto the batteries and no one else from Japan who carried out the regular inspections which Mr Tok submitted must have taken place was called to give evidence as to what markings he found on the Chinese batteries.
The only smidgen of evidence that Xinjiang Electric had heeded Yuasa Japan came in the form of a document identified in court as D1. This is a photocopy of a photograph of a battery. That battery bore the words `Yuasa Dry Charged Xinjiang Comprehensive Electric Motor Plant Xinjiang China`. Neither the original photograph nor any evidence from the photographer was adduced. According to Mr Jibu, D1 was a photocopy of a facsimile sent to him some time in 1991 by a Mr Hiroka from Yuasa Japan. The original of the photograph was in Japan. Subsequently, under cross-examination, he confirmed that he had received D1 after January 1991. It was pointed out to him that this was inconsistent with the date appearing on D1 just above the photograph. That date was written as ` 30 July 1991`. Mr Jibu was unable to explain the inconsistency. He also said that he did not know the location of the original facsimile from which D1 had been copied. Further, he said that he was sure that the photograph had been accompanied by `some sort of letter` but exactly what type of letter it was, he was unable to recall. Mr Jibu`s evidence on D1 was unsatisfactory, and it appears to me that the defendant was not entirely forthright with the court on the matter.
In my judgment, D1 does not establish that all the batteries manufactured by Xinjiang Electric bore the wording indicating the manufacturer and place of manufacture which Yuasa Japan required. It shows that some batteries bore that wording but even in respect of such batteries, there is no way of knowing from D1 itself whether those batteries were being produced at the time that the plaintiffs placed their order with Xinjiang Co. The date on D1 appears to show that the photograph was sent to Mr Jibu on or after 30 July 1991 and there is no evidence at all when the battery in it had itself been made.
In fact, there is some evidence that Xinjiang Electric had disregarded the Japanese strictures to some extent at least. This comes from a pamphlet which Mr Ong identified in evidence as having been given to him when he went to the Guangzhou trade fair. This pamphlet was produced by Xinjiang Electric itself. It contains an introduction to the company, photographs of its factory and meetings with foreign businessmen, including officials from Yuasa Japan, and technical data of the batteries the company produces. It also has a photograph of seven of its products placed together. Among the models shown, three bear the wording `Xinxu Dry Charged Made in China`, one bears the wording `Yuasa Dry Charged` and another the wording `Yuasa Pafecta Yuasa Battery Co Ltd Made in Japan`. In other photographs, batteries marked with the words `Yuasa Dry Charged` and no others appear as part of the background scenery. It would be remembered that this pamphlet was given to Mr Ong in July 1990, two years after Yuasa Japan had told Xinjiang Electric not to use the word `Pafecta`, its name and `Made in Japan` on the Chinese batteries. It would appear that Xinjiang Electric had not obeyed Yuasa Japan entirely and was still producing batteries which could be passed off as Yuasa Japan`s as well as batteries on which the name of the purported place of manufacture and the name of the manufacturer were completely omitted.
The defendant had the onus of establishing, on the balance of probabilities, that the batteries imported by the plaintiffs were not made by Xinjiang Electric. Not only was the evidence they adduced inadequate for this purpose but their contention was also contradicted by two witnesses who appeared for the plaintiffs. Mr Wu Dexiang, an employee of Xinjiang Electric for 29 years, gave evidence first. In 1990, he was an assistant manager at the factory and was in charge of the supervision of the manufacture of Yuasa batteries by Xinjiang Electric. He stated that Xinjiang Electric was the only dry charged battery manufacturer in Xinjiang. He confirmed that Xinjiang Electric had sold 1,400 Yuasa batteries to Xinjiang Co although he agreed that he did not know whether Xinjiang Co had in turn supplied those batteries to the plaintiffs.
As regards the markings on the batteries, in his declaration, Mr Wu deposed that the Yuasa batteries manufactured by his company bore a red round mark on the right and reverse sides with the word `Yuasa` in white on the top right corner, the word `Yuasa` in bold red characters in the centre and beneath that the words `Dry Charged` in red. Other than that, the batteries had no distinguishing marks. The batteries which the plaintiffs produced in court and identified as being part of the consignment they acquired from Xinjiang Company bore markings identical to those described by Mr Wu. In court, Mr Wu also identified these two sample batteries as having been produced by his factory.
Under cross-examination, Mr Wu stated at first that the Yuasa batteries made by Xinjiang Electric did not bear its full name. He maintained that as far as he could remember in 1990 and the years before that, there was no such marking. He could not remember whether this had also been the position after 1990. Towards the end of his cross-examination, however, Mr Wu changed his evidence somewhat and said that there could have been such a marking on the batteries but he could not be sure. Then he clarified that what he was not sure about was whether there was such a marking in 1990 or before that in 1989.
The other Chinese witness, Mr Wang Lanhou, was the general manager of Xinjiang Company. According to his declaration, his duty was to handle the export of batteries and other machinery and equipment from factories in Xinjiang province as Xinjiang Co has the task of exporting these items. The records kept by Xinjiang Co and managed by Mr Wang confirmed that the 1,400 Yuasa batteries shipped by Xinjiang Co on 16 August 1990 were sold by them to the first plaintiff who had paid by way of letter of credit. These batteries had come from Xinjiang Electric.
Under cross-examination, Mr Wang recalled buying 1,400 Yuasa batteries from Xinjiang Electric. He produced a receipt showing that on 2 September 1990, his company had made payment to Xinjiang Electric in respect of these batteries. He said that these batteries had been on-sold to the second plaintiff. He admitted that he had not inspected the goods exported to Singapore personally but, as proof that the batteries sent were those manufactured by Xinjiang Electric, he produced the original certificate of origin issued by the Xinjiang Import & Export Commodity Inspection Bureau. His view was that that Bureau, having inspected the goods, would not have issued the certificate of origin as it stood if the goods had not been manufactured by Xinjiang Electric.
Mr Tok submitted that the Chinese witnesses did not help the plaintiffs. He contended that Mr Wu could not remember anything about the markings so his statement in the declaration that there were no markings could not be correct. Mr Wang had not examined the goods personally and therefore his evidence carried no weight. Whilst it appears to me from Mr Wu`s hesitation and changes in position that probably Xinjiang Electric did produce some batteries with the markings required by Yuasa Japan, this, in my view, does not prove that the batteries supplied to the plaintiffs were not made by Xinjiang Electric. I am satisfied from the evidence of Mr Wu and Mr Wang (which in this respect I do not think was shaken at all on cross-examination) that Xinjiang Electric had supplied 1,400 Yuasa brand batteries to Xinjiang Co and that Xinjiang Co had in turn sold and shipped the very same batteries to the plaintiffs.
The defendant, in my judgment, has therefore failed in the first limb of its attempt to prove that the Yuasa batteries dealt in by the plaintiffs were imitations. The second way in which the defendant tried to establish this contention was by the argument that even if these batteries had been made by Xinjiang Electric, they were still infringing and unauthorized batteries as they had been exported to Singapore without the authority of Yuasa Japan. I accept that under the licence agreement, Xinjiang Electric is granted permission to affix the Yuasa trade mark only to batteries which are to be sold within China. This, however, does not mean that a battery bearing the Yuasa brand changes its character radically from being an authorized bearer of that brand to becoming an imitation immediately upon leaving Chinese shores. I cannot accept that the Yuasa batteries which the plaintiffs sold in Singapore were unauthorized Yuasa batteries simply because Xinjiang Electric had probably breached the licence agreement by selling them to Xinjiang Co which, as the former must have known, is a company which deals in the export of Chinese goods and would, therefore, in all probability, export the Yuasa brand batteries. Such breach may have given the right to Yuasa Japan to initiate legal proceedings against Xinjiang Electric. It did not affect the nature of the batteries themselves.
In the result, I find that the defendant has not been able to justify its defamatory remarks.
 Issue (3)(i): Were the defamatory remarks fair comment?
This issue may be disposed of fairly expeditiously. It is a complete answer to a charge of defamation if the defendant can show that the defamatory words were fair comment on a matter of public interest. To do this, he must show that the words are his opinion or conclusion from a statement of fact rather than being a statement of fact in themselves. In this case, the words that have to be shown as being a comment are the words `Such ""Yuasa"" brand batteries are therefore illegal imitations of our registered brand` which appear in para 2 of the circular.
In my judgment, the defendant cannot substantiate its claim that that sentence was a comment rather than a statement of fact. For that sentence to have been a comment, it would have had to be a conclusion from a previously stated fact. That fact must have been a true statement of fact and not a misstatement of fact (see 
 Gatley 
 para 698). There is a statement of fact just before the words in question. The statement of fact is `Yuasa Battery Co Ltd Japan do not have a manufacturing facility in the People`s Republic of China`. At the date it was written, that sentence was true only in its most literal sense. It was false in that it gave the impression that no Yuasa brand batteries were allowed to be manufactured in China. In fact, because of the existence of the licence agreement, of which Mr Jibu was well aware in 1990, there was a manufacturing facility in China which was allowed to manufacture Yuasa batteries. When Mr Jibu stated that because of the absence of a Yuasa Japan factory in China, the batteries imported by the plaintiffs were imitations, he was not coming to a conclusion based on all the facts of which he was aware. Instead he was making an assertion of fact. The essentials of the defence of fair comment are therefore absent.
 Issue (3)(ii): Were the defamatory words published on an occasion of qualified privilege?
The law on the defence of qualified privilege is succinctly set out in the following passage from the judgment of Yong Pung How CJ in 
 Maidstone Pte Ltd v Takenaka Corp 
 at p 782: 
 
The law treats the publication of statements that are false in fact and injurious to the character of another as malicious, unless it is fairly made by a person in a discharge of some public or private duty, whether legal, social or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned. It is also essential that the recipient of the publication shares a common interest with the publisher or has a corresponding legitimate interest or duty to receive the publication. These occasions are referred to in the law as occasions of qualified privilege and the rationale for the protection is the common convenience and welfare of society: see generally 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander
 (8th Ed) at para 443. Such being the case, the occasions when the law offers the protection of qualified privilege are not fixed and necessarily vary with the changes in social conditions and values. The determination of whether an occasion is one of qualified privilege is one of law. The requirements stated above were set out by Scrutton LJ in 
 Watt v Longsdon
 at p 290 in the following terms:
 
 
 
`With slight modifications in particular circumstances, this appears to me to be well-established law, but, except in the case of communications based on common interest, the principle is that there must be either interest in the recipient, and a duty to communicate in the speaker, or an interest to be protected in the speaker and the duty to protect it in the recipient. Except in the case of common interest justifying intercommunication, the correspondence must be between duty and interest; there may, in the common interest cases, be also a common or reciprocal duty.`
 
 
 
It is for the defendant to a libel action to prove that the defamatory publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege. Where, as in the present case, the defendant relies on the existence of a common interest, he has to show that the publication was for the fair and reasonable protection or furtherance of his own interests and that the receiving party had a legitimate interest in the subject matter of the publication: 
 Stuart v Bell
 and 
 Watt v Longsdon.
 
 
 
Mr Tok submitted that the defendant had a common interest with the recipients of its circular in that the defendant was the manufacturer and supplier of Yuasa batteries in Singapore and the persons they sent the letter to were their authorized dealers in such batteries. The common interest which the parties shared was in protecting the name of the product in which they dealt. Counsel for the plaintiffs, Mr Ponniah, contended on the other hand that the dealers had no interest in the contents of the circular in that they knew that the Chinese batteries had not been manufactured by the defendant and the circular was not telling them anything new. It was, therefore, otiose.
In my judgment, there was a common interest between the defendant and its dealers. The success of their respective businesses, in the case of the defendant`s, solely, and in the case of the dealers`, probably in large part, depended upon the level of sales of the Yuasa batteries made by the defendant. They would have all been concerned over the prospect of the defendant`s Yuasa batteries having to compete in the Singapore market with the lower priced Yuasa batteries imported from China. It would, at the least, be of interest to the Yuasa dealers to know that they could tell their customers that it was worth paying a higher price for the Singapore-made products because they would carry the guarantee and servicing ability of the defendant whereas there would be no such back-up for the Chinese products. Of course it would also be helpful to the businesses of the defendant and their dealers if they could assert that the Chinese batteries were imitations. I, therefore, find that the circular was sent out by the defendant in relation to a matter in which its interest was concerned and that the recipients of that circular had a corresponding legitimate interest in receiving it.
The above finding does not dispose of this issue because the privilege which would otherwise protect a defendant falls away if the plaintiff concerned is able to prove the existence of express malice at the time the defamatory statements were made. The law on malice was set out at length by Lord Diplock in 
 Horrocks v Lowe 
 in a passage which was cited by the learned Chief Justice in 
 Maidstone`s 
 case. After quoting the passage, the Chief Justice went on to say (at p 789): 
 
It is, therefore, for the plaintiffs to show that the publication was made with the dominant intention of injuring them. The fact that the defendants might have known that the publication would injure the plaintiffs is not sufficient. Such a dominant and improper motive can be proven if it is shown that the defendants knew that the statement was false. This is usually conclusive and it is no excuse that the publication was made carelessly such that it did not reflect the defendants` true belief even though there was no intention to publish the false statement: 
 Leverman v Campbell Sharp Ltd
.
 
 
 
Following Lord Diplock, a defendant would also be held to have made the statement with malice if he made it recklessly as to its truth. A defendant is not reckless, for the purposes of proving malice, if he did so believing it was true, even if he was careless, impulsive or irrational in coming to that belief. The law does not require him to be logical. In order for him to be held reckless, he must be shown to have not cared or considered if the statement was true.
... Personal ill-will or spite is also evidence of malice ... .
Ill-will or spite may also be found in the defamatory publication itself if it contains defamatory matter not really necessary to the fulfilment of the particular duty or interest upon which the privilege is founded. It should be borne in mind that the test of relevance is not one of logical analysis in that the inclusion of irrelevant defamatory material is to be treated as one of the factors to be taken into account in deciding whether, in all the circumstances, an inference of malice can be drawn against the defendant. Again a court should be slow to draw such an inference.
Mr Ponniah contended strenuously that there was evidence in this case of express malice on the part of the defendant. He cited first the defendant`s solicitors` letter of 24 May 1991 which was sent in reply to the plaintiffs` solicitors` letter demanding an apology for the defamation. That letter contained no apology. Instead it stated that under Xinjiang Electric`s licence agreement with Yuasa Japan, they could use the trade mark `Yuasa` with no other distinguishing mark on their batteries for sale within China. As Yuasa Japan had not authorized any export of the Chinese batteries there would appear to have been a breach of the licence agreement. The plaintiffs were given notice that any further attempts to deal in or market products in full knowledge of the above breach would be resisted by legal proceedings which would include an injunction.
Mr Ponniah`s interpretation was that it was clear from this letter that very early on the defendant was aware that the batteries the plaintiffs were dealing in, far from being illegal imitations, had been manufactured under licence of Yuasa Japan. In spite of that, the defendant went on in its defence filed in August 1992 to plead justification. He argued that the defendant knew very well that it had no evidence to support that plea and yet maintained it throughout the proceedings right up to the end of the trial and to submissions.
Next, Mr Ponniah stated that the language used in the circular was excessive and that this indicated the presence of malice on the part of the defendant. The defendant had expressly set out in para 4 the names of both plaintiffs in the circular in conjunction with their assertion that they had no relation with the plaintiffs for the plaintiffs` imitation Yuasa batteries. Mr Ponniah cited the case of 
 Adam v Ward 
 as authority for the proposition that express malice may be proved from the words of the document in that if in the document you find parts which are not really necessary to the fulfilment of the particular duty or right which is the foundation of the privilege on the occasion, then these parts may be used as evidence of express malice (per Lord Dunedin at p 326). His submission in this regard was that the defendant having already said in the previous paragraph of the circular that it would not be responsible for the imitation batteries and that its services and warranty coverage would not extend to such batteries, it really had no interest in naming the plaintiffs as the dealers in such batteries in the next paragraph. It was a matter of overkill.
Thirdly, he alleged that the express malice was shown by the sending of the circular as, before it was sent out, the defendant`s agents already knew that the batteries being promoted by the plaintiffs` salesmen were from China. They also knew that these batteries would not be covered by the defendant`s warranty. Further, the defendant`s dealers had not complained about the quality of the Chinese batteries before the circular was sent out and therefore there was no reason to repeat that the defendant would not be responsible for them. All in all, Mr Ponniah concluded, the circular was a completely unnecessary document and the act of sending it itself manifested express malice on the part of the defendant.
He also submitted that the falsity of the defamatory statement can be regarded as evidence of malice. He said para 2 of the circular was false and it was made with reckless disregard of the true facts. In his submission, Mr Jibu had not made any enquiries or proper investigations with Japan before reacting to the competition posed by the plaintiffs` batteries by sending out the circular. He felt Mr Jibu`s intention was to issue a pre-emptive strike before the plaintiffs` batteries could establish a toehold in the Singapore market.
Mr Tok submitted that there was no evidence of express malice. He stated that before Mr Jibu sent out the circular, he had asked his salesmen to find out about the Chinese batteries in the circular. Mr Teh obtained two batteries from his dealers and these were then photographed by Mr Jibu and the photographs were sent to Japan for clarification. The information he received in return was that Xinjiang Electric did not export such batteries to Singapore and, secondly, the Xinjiang Electric batteries had to have the name of the manufacturer and their country of origin printed on them. Relying on the Japanese feedback, Mr Jibu published the information in the circular. At the time he truly believed in this information. He wanted to inform his authorized dealers about the situation and was not acting maliciously.
As regards the pleading that the express citing of the plaintiffs` names exceeded the bounds of privilege and was evidence of malice, Mr Tok pointed out that in cases like 
 Maidstone 
, the plaintiff had been named in the defamatory statement and yet qualified privilege was held to protect the defendant. Therefore, the mere citation of the names could not amount to malice. The defendant believed that the statements in the circular were true and were willing to stand by them. The defendant harboured no ill-will against the plaintiffs.
In his submission, the circular itself was merely dissemination of information to the authorised dealers. The contents of the circular specifically referred to the Chinese batteries and the position in respect of these batteries. The intention was to protect the interest of the defendant and the dealers and it was not the predominant intention of the circular to cause injury to the plaintiffs. Whilst the plaintiffs may say that what Mr Jibu did in the way of checking was insufficient, the law did not require him to go all out to establish the facts before sending the circular. Under the law, he would not be reckless if he believed what he said was true although he was irrational or careless in coming to that belief and the law did not require him to act logically. The defence relied on 
 Maidstone 
`s case1 in support of these submissions.
The evidence disclosed the following. The defendant first received some complaints about the poor quality of Yuasa batteries in August 1990. The actual batteries were not, however, seen by anyone in the defendant`s organization. Mr Teh`s evidence was that he talked on the telephone with two dissatisfied consumers and found out that they had bought their batteries from persons who were not authorized dealers appointed by the defendant. Mr Teh then advised the consumers to refer the complaints to their own supplier. Under cross-examination, Mr Teh agreed that since he had not seen the batteries complained about, he did not know whether these batteries had been produced by the defendant or by any other factory.
It was also in August 1990 that the defendant first received information that the plaintiffs were importing Chinese Yuasa batteries for sale in the Singapore market. They did not see what they thought were the actual batteries being distributed by the plaintiffs until some time later. Mr Teh acquired two of these batteries some time in September 1990. Initially, he could not recall the precise date but said that he got them some time in early September. Later in his testimony, it was put to him that in fact he obtained the batteries in January 1991. His response was that he did not know when they were given to him. Subsequently, he changed his story again and said that he received the two batteries on 19 September 1990 and gave them to Mr Jibu the same day. He then said that he could remember the date very precisely because he had a visit schedule.
Mr Jibu`s account was that as soon as he received the batteries from Mr Teh he photographed them and sent copies of the photographs to Yuasa Japan. He wanted to know whether these batteries could have been manufactured by Xinjiang Electric as he was at that time aware of the licensing agreement which that company had with Yuasa Japan. He was not aware, however, of the get-up of the Chinese Yuasa batteries. He told me that Yuasa Japan confirmed that the batteries in the defendant`s possession had not been manufactured by Xinjiang Electric. They gave him two reasons for this: first, that the batteries did not bear the manufacturer`s name and secondly that they had checked with Xinjiang Electric and had been told that no export to Singapore had been made. The defendant did not, however, produce copies of any of its correspondence with Yuasa Japan, neither its queries to them nor the latter`s replies. Neither was any evidence produced to indicate that Yuasa Japan had asked Xinjiang Electric about the export to Singapore. It was not even put to Mr Wu that such a query had been made and a negative response given to Yuasa Japan in September 1990.
In my mind there is a considerable amount of doubt that in September 1990 the defendant actually possessed any samples of the batteries in which the plaintiffs were dealing. First, there is the inconsistency in Mr Teh`s evidence as to when he got those batteries. Secondly, there is the indisputable fact that the consignment from China only cleared the customs here on 20 September 1990. Thus any batteries which Mr Teh got hold of before that date could not have come from this shipment and there is no evidence at all of prior import by the plaintiffs nor was this even suggested to Mr Lim during his testimony. Thirdly, there is the lack of any hard evidence of correspondence between Yuasa Japan and the defendant in September 1990. The only correspondence the defendant produced was D1, the photograph of a properly marked Xinjiang Electric Yuasa battery, and that appeared to have been sent in July 1991. The accompanying letter was not shown to the court.
It therefore appears to me, on the balance of probabilities, that at the time the circular was sent out the defendant had not seen the Chinese Yuasa batteries or, if it had, it had not made proper investigations as to the authenticity of such batteries. The defendant knew of the imminent distribution of such batteries in Singapore since the plaintiffs` salesmen had been actively promoting their products and also knew that there would be stiff competition from the more cheaply priced Chinese batteries. In fact, Mr Teh did say that in November 1990, one of his dealers who had previously refused to buy batteries from the plaintiffs, changed his mind and bought a substantial quantity when the price was lowered.
In my judgment, the dominant intention of the circular was to nip the competition in the bud by traducing the plaintiffs` Yuasa batteries as imitations. That is why the circular stated categorically that there was no Yuasa manufacturing facility in China. Mr Jibu conveniently omitted to mention the licensing agreement with Xinjiang Electric. If he had put this in, he would have had to admit the possibility that the Chinese batteries were authentic Yuasa batteries. He preferred to disregard this possibility entirely. The phraseology of circular is, in my opinion, excessive. The word `imitation` is mentioned three times and once in conjunction with the word `illegal`. The circular also expressly mentions the names of the plaintiffs when it was not necessary to do so in that the information that it was the plaintiffs who were dealing in these batteries had come from the dealers themselves and thus they did not have to be told with whom not to deal. The circular goes much further than it need have to protect the legitimate interests of the defendant and its authorized dealers. A simple statement that buyers of Chinese Yuasa batteries would not enjoy the defendant`s guarantees and after-sale service would have been quite sufficient for that purpose. Instead, the defendant sent out a five-paragraph circular which contained significant factual omissions and unjustified conclusions both on the origin and the quality of the Chinese batteries.
In my opinion, there was malice present in the publication of the circular and the defendant cannot rely on privilege. The whole attitude of the defendant was further shown by its conduct after the plaintiffs had asked for an apology. At that stage, it appeared to recognize that the plaintiffs were dealing in Xinjiang Electric`s batteries and warned them not to go on doing so. The defendant was intent on preventing competition. When it came to the suit, however, the defendant withdrew its recognition of the authenticity of the batteries and revived the charge that the batteries were imitation. The word `imitation` appeared throughout the pleadings and the affidavit of evidence-in-chief filed by Mr Jibu. This unrelenting attitude did not, however, result in any concrete evidence being produced to substantiate the defendant`s stand. Its whole attitude appears to me to be that since it had been given authority by Yuasa Japan to sell Yuasa batteries in Singapore, nobody else should do so and it was therefore justified in taking whatever action it felt necessary to remove or obstruct such competition. This attitude led easily to the defendant exceeding the bounds of the protection of its legitimate commercial interest.
 Issue (4): Did the defendant slander the plaintiffs` goods?
The general principles to be applied in an action for slander of goods are clearly set out in para 317 of 
 Gatley 
 which reads: 
 
An action for slander of goods lies whenever a man maliciously publishes a false statement in disparagement of another person`s goods, and thereby (save in the cases specified in s 3(1) of the Defamation Act 1952) causes him special damage. The statement may be in writing or by word of mouth. `It makes no damage whether the falsehood is oral or in writing.`
 
 
 
To succeed in an action for slander of goods the plaintiff must allege and prove (i) that the statement was made of and concerning his goods; (ii) that it was false; (iii) that it was published maliciously, ie with a dishonest or other improper motive and (iv) ... that he has suffered special damage thereby.
In the present case, the plaintiffs pleaded that the following sentences in the circular were falsely and maliciously written and published in relation to the quality of the Yuasa batteries sold by the plaintiffs: 
 
We categorically state herein that `Yuasa` Battery Co Ltd of Japan do not have a manufacturing facility in the People`s Republic of China. Such Yuasa brand batteries are therefore illegal imitation of our registered brand.
 
 
 
We, Yuasa Battery Singapore hereby stress that we will not hold any responsibility on the quality or whatsoever of these imitation batteries.
The plaintiffs say that the above words were false in that the plaintiffs` Yuasa batteries were not imitation Yuasa batteries, nor were they unfit for the purpose for which they were sold.
It is quite clear, in view of the findings that I have made in relation to the earlier issues, that the plaintiffs are able to satisfy the first three elements of the tort of slander of goods. First, the statements complained of were made of and concerning the plaintiffs` goods. Secondly, those statements were false in that the goods were authentic Yuasa batteries and there was no evidence at all that they were unfit to be used as automotive batteries. Mr Teh confirmed that he did not get any complaints about the batteries sold by the plaintiffs. Thirdly, the statements were, as I have found, published maliciously. In relation to quality, there is the additional point that the defendant had not put the batteries which it said were the plaintiffs` batteries through any form of test to ascertain their quality. Therefore the aspersion on the quality of these batteries which appeared in the circular had no basis in fact.
The fourth element is proof of special damage. In this connection, the plaintiffs adduced the testimony of two dealers in batteries who testified that after they had received the defendant`s circular, they had returned the unsold Chinese Yuasa batteries which they had bought from the plaintiffs. I accept this evidence. It was not seriously undermined in cross-examination. Whilst it did appear that one of the witnesses had been a director of the second plaintiff between 1985 and 1992, this did not in my view, make this witness` testimony that he had returned 64 batteries to the plaintiffs because of rumours in the market that the goods were imitation, incredible. I therefore accept the plaintiffs` submission that they were unable to sell a substantial portion of the goods because of the circular.
 Issue (5): Damages
There are two issues to be considered here: first, what award of special damages should be made in respect of the slander of goods and secondly, what quantum of general damages should be awarded for the defamation action.
As regards the special damages, Mr Tok`s submission was that the plaintiffs had not substantiated their claim. The plaintiffs` claim here is for $51,467.50 being the cost of acquiring the Chinese batteries and a further sum of $15,440 being the profit which they would have earned if they had been able to sell all the batteries. I agree that this claim has been overstated. In the first place, the plaintiffs cannot recover the total amount paid for the batteries since they managed to sell some of them and, on their pleadings, only 502 batteries remained unsold whilst a further 235 batteries were returned to them after the purchasers became aware of the circular. On their own figures, it is clear that out of the consignment of 1,400 batteries, the plaintiffs managed to dispose of 663 pieces and, therefore, cannot maintain any claim for special damages in respect of those pieces.
As regards the 737 batteries unsold or returned, I am not able to make any award in respect of the plaintiffs` loss of profits. This is because no documents were produced showing the prices at which the three types of batteries which made up the remainder of the consignment could have been sold by the plaintiffs to dealers in Singapore. Some figures were mentioned in the pleadings and it should not have been difficult for the plaintiffs to substantiate these figures by producing copies of their invoices for similar batteries. As they did not do so, I have no basis on which to make an award in respect of loss of profits.
I do, however, think that since these batteries would now be unsaleable, it would be correct to make an award of special damages reflecting the loss which the first plaintiff had sustained by reason of its purchase of the batteries (although the purchase contract named the second plaintiff as purchaser, the first plaintiff actually paid for the goods). The 737 batteries remaining are not all of the same type: 362 are N50 batteries which cost $29.06 each (US$16.80 converted at the rate of US$1 = $1.73), 321 are N50Z batteries which cost $33.74 (US$19.50) each and the remaining 289 are N100 batteries which cost $50.17 (US$29) each. On the foregoing basis, the total cost of these items was $35,849.43 and I think that it would be right to make an award of special damages in that amount in favour of the first plaintiff.
As regards the general damages, the plaintiffs have urged me to make an award of aggravated damages and a separate award of exemplary damages. I do not think that this is a case in which exemplary damages should be awarded. I have taken note of the aggravation which the defendant`s plea of justification and its repetition of the allegation of imitation goods has added to the defamation in making my award. In my judgment, the sum of $100,000 as a single award would, in all the circumstances, be adequate to compensate the plaintiffs for the injury they have sustained by reason of the defendant`s defamation.
 Issue (6): Does the defendant have a claim for passing off against the plaintiffs?
The leading case of 
 Reckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc 
 set out the following elements as being the essential ingredients of an action for passing off:
 
 
(1) that the plaintiff`s goods or services have acquired a goodwill or reputation in the market and are known by some distinguishing feature; 
 
(2) that there is a misrepresentation by the defendant leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by the defendant are goods or services of the plaintiff; and 
 
(3) that the plaintiff has suffered or is likely to suffer damage as a result of the erroneous belief engendered by the plaintiff`s misrepresentation.
  
 
 
In the present case, the important element is element 2. The issue is whether the plaintiffs, who in relation to the counterclaim are defendants, made a misrepresentation which would lead the public to believe that the batteries offered by them for sale were the batteries of the defendant. In my judgment and on the basis of the findings that I have made, the answer to this question must be in the negative. Whilst some members of the public might have mistaken the Yuasa batteries marketed by the plaintiffs for those manufactured by the defendant, such mistake would not have arisen from any misrepresentation on the part of the plaintiffs. This is because although such confusion may arise from the brand name `Yuasa` appearing on both sets of batteries, no element of deceit was involved in the affixing of that brand to the Chinese batteries.
The defendant in seeking damages in a passing off action is in fact trying to prevent a parallel import of the goods in which it deals. Parallel imports do not constitute passing off. This is made quite clear by para 202 of 48 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed, Reissue) which states: 
 
`Parallel imports` means strictly the importation and sale by others of goods originating from the owner of industrial property rights in parallel with his own importation of such goods whether carried out by himself or through authorized agents, but is used more generally to describe the importation and sale by third persons of goods obtained in another country which originate from an international company or group irrespective of whether the company or group satisfies the market in the United Kingdom by imports from that country.
 
 
 
The importation and sale in the United Kingdom of the plaintiff`s goods bearing the marks under which the plaintiff has allowed them to be sold in a foreign country does not generally amount to passing off, since no misrepresentation is involved as to the origin of the goods. Attempts by plaintiff to argue that the sale of goods bearing a manufacturer`s mark impliedly represents that the goods has passed through the accustomed channels of supply have been rejected by the courts, as has an attempt to sever and assign the goodwill of the business importing the goods into the United Kingdom from the goodwill of the business carried on in the country of origin. It generally makes no difference that the imported goods originate not from the same legal person who supplies the goods to the market in the United Kingdom but from another member of the same group of companies, since in modern trading conditions customers will usually neither know nor care which company within a group is responsible for the sale of the goods, the commercial origin of which is indicated by marks used by the group as a whole ... It is probable that goods which are manufactured and to which marks are applied under licence stand in the same position as goods actually made by a member of the group of companies.
In this context, it is noteworthy that the batteries manufactured by the defendant in Singapore in addition to bearing the trademarks `Yuasa Pafecta` under licence from Yuasa Japan, also bear the name `Yuasa Battery Co Ltd` rather than the name of the defendant itself. The general public in Singapore might very well in such case believe that the defendant`s batteries were manufactured by Yuasa Japan itself. Yuasa Japan being the same entity which licensed Xinjiang Electric to put the Yuasa brand on the latter`s batteries, it appears to me that the defendant can hardly substantiate a claim of illegitimate passing off which Yuasa Japan itself would be unable to justify.
I therefore conclude that the defendant has no basis on which to maintain a cause of action in passing off against the plaintiffs in respect of any batteries manufactured by Xinjiang Electric during the period when the licence agreement between the latter and Yuasa Japan was in effect. That agreement expired about two years ago but the facts in this case relate to a period when it was effective. No evidence has been adduced by the defendant to show that since the expiry of the agreement the plaintiffs have been dealing in any Yuasa brand batteries whatsoever.
Mr Tok did contend that passing off could be constituted by a representation on the part of the plaintiffs that by acquiring the Chinese batteries, consumers would also be acquiring the warranty and aftersales service of the defendant and by a further representation that the plaintiffs were associated with the defendant in the sale of Yuasa batteries. He did not, however, produce any evidence in support of his assertion that such misrepresentations had been made. The only evidence that the court had as to how the plaintiffs had promoted their sales came from Mr Teh. His sources of information were the defendant`s dealers who were knew very well that the plaintiffs had nothing to do with the defendant and that the origin of their goods was completely separate from the defendant. Not one dealer gave evidence that he thought or was given the impression that the defendant would provide any warranty or services in respect of the Chinese batteries. In the circumstances, this allegation cannot stand and the counterclaim must fail.
 Conclusion
There will be judgment for the plaintiffs in respect of the claim in the sum of $100,000 in general damages and costs. The first plaintiff is also awarded the sum of $35,849.43 as special damages together with interest thereon at the rate of 6% pa from 15 July 1994 which was the date when particulars of these damages were furnished. The counterclaim is dismissed with costs.

GROUNDS OF DECISION
The deceased, Baharuddin Bin Mohd Aris, a motorcyclist, was killed on the 5th day of July 1986 at about 3.00pm as a result of a collision between his motorcycle No. FC 8451 and an omnibus SBS No. 4750H (""the bus"") driven by the First Defendant, the servant or agent of the Second Defendants whilst travelling along Amber Circus and whilst negotiating a bend at the circus.
The Plaintiff, as the lawful father and Administrator of the estate of the deceased, who was 23 years of age and a bachelor, brought this action for the benefit of the deceased's estate under s 7 of the Criminal Law Act (Cap. 43). Subject to liability, the quantum had been agreed by the respective parties at $88,000/- in respect of all the items claimed.
Evidence was adduced by both parties on the issue of liability. The relevant witnesses called by the Plaintiff were Sgt Khoo Kim Hock (PW1) from the Traffic Police who had investigated the accident and Rahmat Bin Othman (PW2) the deceased's pillion at the time of the accident whilst the Defence called Salmah Bte Kader Myden (DW1) the driver of the bus and an independent witness Anthony Vincent Phey Yew Koon (DW2).
PLAINTIFF'S CASE
PW1 testified in respect of the road conditions at about the time of the accident and in respect of the sketch plan AB6 of the scene of the accident. He stated that the weather was fine, road surface dry, clear visibility and light flow of traffic.
PW2 who suffered minor injuries gave evidence next. In his examination-in-chief he stated that he rode pillion on the motorcycle in question ridden by the deceased. The deceased was riding the motorcycle from Marine Parade Road which had three lanes and was heading towards the city. The deceased occupied the extreme right lane of the road. As the deceased neared the circus, he slowed down his motorcycle, looked to the right for on-coming vehicles and thereafter proceeded to enter the circus. Whilst the deceased was negotiating the circus, suddenly the bus cut across the path of the motorcycle. The deceased tried to control his motorcycle but the front of the right rear wheel of the bus came into contact with the left side of the motorcycle handle. The deceased and he fell on their left side and were dragged forward. The deceased died on the spot.
In cross-examination, PW2 stated that when he first saw the bus, it was travelling in the extreme left lane about nine meters away from point ""P"" in the sketch plan AB6, i.e. the junction of circus with Marine Parade Road from where the road broadens to form the circus. The speed of the deceased's motorcycle was about 35 to 45 kmph. The deceased's motorcycle was ahead of the omnibus. There were no vehicles in front of the bus or the motorcycle as well. The front part of the bus was slightly behind him. The motorcycle was also in front or slightly ahead of the bus when the motorcycle entered the circus. Whilst the deceased was negotiating the circus between point ""O"", where the island of the circus began, to point ""Z"", the start of a scratch mark a short distance away in AB6, the bus overtook the motorcycle.
PW2 denied when it was put to him by Defence Counsel that it was in fact the other way round - that the bus was ""ahead of you"" and entered the roundabout ""before you did"". He insisted the motorcycle moved out first to enter the circus. He then denied giving a statement to PW1 in which he had categorically said that the bus had entered the roundabout before the motorcycle did. Pursuant to an application made to Court, which was allowed, Defence Counsel proceeded to impeach the credit/contradict PW2 in respect of his answers given in his evidence by producing PW2's statement through PW1 who had recorded the same on the day of the accident. The relevant portions of paragraphs 3, 8 and 9 of PW2's statement Exh.D1 which were underlined, were then shown and put to PW2 for his explanation as required by s 147 of the Evidence Act Cap.97 which relates to cross-examination as to previous statements in writing:
Paragraph 3:2 ""My rider was travelling on the centre of the second lane from left of the said road. My rider was travelling at about a speed of 40 to 50 kmph"" (emphasis added)
Paragraph 8: ""I wish to add that I first noticed the said motorbus was when our motorcycle was about 4 meters to arrive at the said junction, along Marine Parade Road and the estimated speed of the said motorbus was about 40 kmph....The motorcar that was on my right was travelling at about a speed of 50 kmph.....Among the three vehicles, (our motorcycle, the said motorcar and the said motorbus), the motorbus was the first to move out from Marine Parade Road into Amber Circus"" (emphasis added).
Paragraph 9: ""When my rider travelled for another 4 meters (after the 10 meters from the said junction) while negotiating the bend of the said circus, the motorbus right rear portion was somewhere in line with the front of our motorcycle.""
In respect of paragraph 3 of Exh.D1, PW2 answered by stating that he was referring to the position of the motorcycle at an earlier stage when the deceased had filtered out from a side road into Marine Parade Road. When it was further put to him that there was no mention of any filtering in the statement, PW2 replied that he did not know what the Sgt. reduced into writing.
In respect of paragraph 8, PW2's response was: ""I said that the bus was in front of us cutting into our path"".
In respect of paragraph 9, PW2 admitted the content of paragraph 9 but qualified it by stating that he was referring to the point at which the bus came into contact with the motorcycle.
PW2 said that he thought the Sgt. had misunderstood him on all these matters.
Defence Counsel thereafter requested PW2 to answer whether the underlined portions in paragraphs 3, 8 and 9 of Exh.D1 were true or not. PW2 answered:
""Paragraph 3 is true and correct. I was trying to explain how we were gradually changing lanes. Paragraph 8: ""Among the three vehicles (our motorcycle, the said motorcar and the said motorbus), the motorbus was the first to move out from Marine Parade Road into Amber Circus"". The portion is not true. I was asked a question whether there were other vehicles there I said yes, they were behind me"". (page 20 N.E.)
When asked why he had not corrected his statement, PW2 stated that it was unlike the manner in which the statement had been explained to him in Court and when pressed further, he stated that perhaps PW1 misunderstood him. PW2 acknowledged that the signatures on the statement were his.
The rest of the evidence of PW2 was interposed by the recall of PW1 by Defence Counsel to explain the allegations of PW2. PW1 confirmed upon cross-examination that he had recorded Exh.D1 being PW2's statement in English and he had read it over to PW2 and he understood it before he signed it and he did not request to make any amendments save make an addition at the end of the statement (which is not relevant).
In re-examination by Plaintiff's Counsel, PW1 confirmed that the motorcar referred to in paragraph 8 of the statement as being on the right of PW2, was the same motorcar described in paragraph 5 as travelling on his right rear side and about 3 to 4 meters away from the rear of the motorcycle. PW1 stated that in Exh.D1, PW2 stated that the motorcycle was travelling ""in the centre of the second lane from left of the road. When it was put by Plaintiff's Counsel to PW1 that PW2 was in fact trying to say that he was filtering towards the third lane and had filtered into the third lane before arriving at the circus, PW1's reply was that if that was what PW2 was saying he would include that in the statement. He did not make any omission. He had been trained to do his work and take down what is said. He believed he had taken down everything to the best of his ability.
Thereafter, PW2 was further examined by his Counsel and asked to explain how he had come to say in Exh.D1 that ""among the three vehicles....the motorbus was the first to move out"". His answer was merely:
""I was trying to explain when I was negotiating the circus suddenly the bus overtook me and in the course of doing so, the bus obstructed me. That was when it grazed onto the motorcycle"". (page 27 N.E.)
He repeated that he thought the Sgt. had misunderstood him and that the version he gave in Court was the true version.
With PW2's evidence concluded, the Plaintiff closed his case.
DEFENDANTS' CASE
Salmah Bte Kader Myden (DW1) in her defence testified that she drove the bus in the first lane from the left side and when she reached point ""P"" in the sketch plan AB6, she stopped her bus. She let a car pass at the circus in front of her before driving into the circus. When she reached the point ""Z"" in AB6 (being the beginning of a scratch mark), she saw a car stopped at another junction on her left (point ""K"" in AB6). She then heard the sound of a crash behind her bus and stopped the bus in the position as shown in AB6. She later made a police report in respect of the accident.
In cross-examination by Plaintiff's Counsel, she stated that she had looked several times to the right and left before moving from the junction into the circus because she had to take precautions. She denied inventing the story that she had stopped at the junction to the circus because there was a car coming from the right and in front of her. To Counsel's question that if she was travelling in the first lane from the left, she would have been closer to the left side of the road, she stated that there were no lanes marked out at the roundabout. The following questions and answers on the point are relevant:
Q: Put: When the motorcycle was very close to your side, you encroached too much near to the side of the circus and grazed the motorcycle causing him to loose control?
A: No Q: Even though no lines are drawn around the circus if you had kept to the left - this collision would not have happened? 
A: I disagree 
Q: Why?
A: You can never say when an accident happens. I drove on the left. (pages 42/43 N.E.)
In re-examination, DW1 stated that from the time she arrived at point ""P"", the junction of the circus until she heard the sound of collision, she had not seen the motorcycle at any time.
DW2, an Assistant to a Stockbroker and Personal Assistant to the Chief Commissioner of the Singapore Scouts Association, an independent witness stated in his evidence that he was a passenger in a car driven by his brother. The car had stopped at the junction of Amberville Road with the circus (point ""K"" on AB6), waiting for the traffic to clear from the right i.e. from the direction of the Marine Parade Road junction with the circus (i.e point ""P"" on AB6). When he looked to the right he saw a bus negotiating the circus. A few moments later, he saw a motorcycle also negotiating the roundabout from the right side of the bus. He saw the motorcycle wobble just before he lost sight of it as the bus blocked his view of it. He then saw something going under the bus. He added, ""The motorbus came first and the motorycle thereafter"". He marked the positions of the motorcycle (MX in red) and the bus (in yellow) when he first saw them each.
In cross-examination by Plaintiff's Counsel, DW2 explained that he had looked to the right by instinct as he was also a driver. He denied that the position of the bus as marked in AB6 would block his sight of the motorcycle. To a further question by Defence Counsel he answered,
Q: As marked, it would be impossible for you to see the motorcycle? 
A: That's what I saw
Q: How far was the motorcycle behind when you first saw them? 
A: 2 to 3 car lengths. One car length would be 12 - 15 feet. (page 48 N.E.)
He finally stated that he had given his particulars as an eye witness to PW1 upon his arrival at the scene of the accident. He did not know the driver of the bus.
FINDING
In assessing the evidence of the Plaintiff and the Defendants, I found that PW2 had materially contradicted himself in Court vis-a-vis his statement, Exh.D1 which he gave to PW1 after the accident. The first material contradiction was that at the hearing PW2 stated that the deceased was riding his motorcycle with him as a pillion in the extreme right lane of Marine Parade Road as they were approaching the junction of the circus whereas in his statement he stated the motorcyle was occupying the centre of the second lane from the left i.e. the lane adjacent to the bus. The second material contradiction was that the deceased's motorcycle was the first to move away and enter the circus whilst in his statement, he had stated that the motorbus was the first to move out from Marine Parade Road. PW2 had also stated in his statement that whilst the deceased's motorcycle was travelling in the centre lane, there was a motorcar travelling on his right or to the right rear side. This could only mean that the motorcar was travelling in the extreme right lane whether parallel to the deceased in the centre lane or slightly behind to his right. In his evidence at the hearing no mention was made of the said motorcar by DW1. His evidence in Court gave rise to the inference that one of the three lanes, the centre lane which was 3m 10cm broad had no vehicle close to or abreast of the deceased's motorcycle.
PW2 was given ample opportunity to study and explain the contradicting nature of his statement compared with his evidence in Court and to clear up the dispute as provided by S 147 of the Evidence Act. PW1 had also given further evidence to prove the statement was taken regularly and accurately. I found that PW2 was unable to reconcile the version given in Exh.D1 and the version given in Court. He did not dispute the voluntariness of the statement. His explanation was that earlier he was filtering from the left lane to the right lane after coming out from a side road but there was nothing in his statement to this effect as Defence Counsel had rightly put it to him. Thereafter, his explanation 2was no more than that PW1 had misunderstood him. PW1 had testified that PW2 had understood the statement before he signed it. I found that PW1's evidence was not dented by Plaintiff's Counsel's cross-examination of him on the issue raised that he had not taken his statement properly or accurately or had misunderstood PW2. I believed PW1 that he had taken PW2's statement accurately and there was no misunderstanding as to the statement's content.
In the circumstances, PW2's evidence at the hearing that the deceased's motorcycle had moved out first and entered the circus ahead of the bus and the bus thereafter overtook the motorcycle at the circus is a severe strain-on credibility considering the proposition in the circumstances of the situation that a two-wheeler which had moved away first from the junction of the circus, could be overtaken by a bus in the short distance between the junction at point ""P"" to point ""Z"" in AB6 (beginning of the scratch mark at the circus). I further found that the distance between the edge of the circus ""Q"" and the scratch mark ""Z"" (the point at which or just before which the impact took place) was some 2m 80cm (9.1ft) a distance sufficient for two to three motorcycles to pass through.
The evidence of DW1 as stated earlier was straightforward and her credibility emerged unshaken.
The independent evidence of DW2, in my opinion, reinforced and corroborated DW1's evidence that she having emerged from the left lane of Marine Parade Road, was travelling to the left of the circus. DW2 marked the position of the bus when he first saw it to the left of the circus. He also testified that when he first saw the motorcycle at the circus it was 2 to 3 car lengths behind the bus and the motorcycle then made a wobble just before disappearing from his view as it went to the right side of the bus, moments after which the accident took place. He did not see the actual impact because it took place on the right side of the bus whereas he was witnessing events from the front and to the left side of the bus from point ""K"" as shown in AB6. His evidence in my opinion, standing by itself showed that the deceased could not have been the first to move out from the junction at point ""P"" in AB6 and hence the bus could not have overtaken the motorcycle at the circus. DW2's evidence showed that it was the bus that was travelling ahead of the deceased's motorcycle and it was the deceased's motorcycle that was two to three car lengths behind. The inescapable inference to be drawn is that the deceased went into the circus from the junction at point ""P"" in AB6 after the bus and he caught up with the bus from the rear in the circus just before point ""Z"" whilst attempting to overtake it from the right. I found that in doing so, it was the deceased who wobbled his motorcycle and moments later collided into the right rear wheel of the bus whilst overtaking the bus. Defence Counsel's submission that DW2 could not have seen the deceased's motorcycle as the bus in front would be blocking it as marked in the sketch plan AB6 was clearly not supported by DW2's answers who was emphatic about what he saw - otherwise why say it? He had no interest in the matter. It is pertinent to note that neither the sketch plan AB6 nor the markings on it were to scale and it was impossible to say as Plaintiff's Counsel had suggested, that the position of the bus as marked would block the vision of DW2 of the deceased's motorcycle as marked by DW2. What was significant was DW2's categorical evidence that the deceased's motorcycle was not just slightly behind but two to three car lengths behind the bus when he first saw it inside the circus which demolished PW2's evidence that the deceased's motorcycle moved out first from the junction into the circus.
I found that PW2's evidence was materially inconsistent with his previous statement and unreliable. His attempts to explain away his earlier statement were feeble and unconvincing. I therefore rejected without basis as the assertion during cross-examination and submission on the Plaintiff's behalf that DW1 was driving her bus too close to the circus. I likewise rejected the further submission that the bus overtook the deceased's motorcycle at the circus and encroached or cut across the path of the deceased thereby causing the accident.
I had anxiously considered all the time whether there was any contributory negligence on the part of DW1 and if I could apportion some part of the blame to DW1. I was unable, on the evidence, to apportion any portion of the blame to DW1.
I therefore found that the Plaintiff had not proved his case on a balance of probabilities that the First Defendant was wholly negligent or for that matter, had to any extent, contributed by her negligence to the accident and in the circumstances, I dismissed the Plaintiff's claim with costs.",1993-03-22 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 5 October 1989, I delivered judgment in Magistrate`s Appeal No 185 of 1987 dismissing an appeal by the appellant (who was an investigator of drug offences at the Tanglin Police Station) against his conviction for an offence under s 201 of the Penal Code. [See 
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 136
 .] The district judge had found that the appellant had caused evidence (an admissible statement (P4) made by Razali under s 120 of the Criminal Procedure Code (the CPC) of the commission of an offence by one Razali bin Bakar confessing to possession of cannabis) to disappear by not including P4 in the investigation papers file.
In this motion which is made under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (the SCJA), counsel for the appellant has applied for an order that the following questions which, he claims, are questions of law of public interest (and which have arisen in the course of Magistrate`s Appeal No 185 of 1987 and the determination of which affected the event of the appeal) be reserved for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal:
 
 
(1) whether the conviction of the appellant can be sustained on a record that cannot be relied on in its original form; 
 
(2) whether in the proper exercise of judicial discretion, the court can take cognizance of extraneous correspondence (ie letters exchanged between the Registrar of the Subordinate Courts and the trial judge) which formed no part of the record? Alternatively, whether there was legal power in the court to take cognizance of documents other than the record; 
 
(3) whether a magistrate or district judge could add, supplement, clarify or correct his written grounds of decision after a complaint had been lodged in the petition of appeal as to the propriety of the record and the grounds; 
 
(4) whether such additions, supplements, clarifications or corrections could be done by way of letters; 
 
(5) whether the failure by the trial judge to explain as to how he had come to record a purported application by the DPP whilst in fact there was none [such failure read with the trial judge`s earlier explanation to the court in his letter dated 18 June 1988 where he said that: `from the notes of evidence and my grounds of decision it is quite clear that at the conclusion of the prosecution case, I had in mind amending the charge from one under s 201 to one under s 204 of the Penal Code], contravenes the principles of fair hearing, ie justice must be manifestly seen to be done; 
 
(6) whether the aforesaid failure by the trial judge is or is not a relevant question for the determination of the appeal; 
 
(7) whether the direction by the learned trial judge as encapsulated by me at pp 18 and 19 of my grounds of decision [ie that `the trial judge did not proceed on the basis that he preferred the evidence of Razali to that of the appellant and of DW2. He proceeded on the basis that the appellant, as the investigating officer, had to explain why he did not include P3 in the IP as was his duty to do so as an investigating officer.` ... `The appellant was convicted because he could not give a satisfactory reason for not including P3 in the IP.`] runs counter to and is in conflict with the well-established tenet of law that it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt and whoever has the function of deciding facts at the trial of a criminal offence should keep an open mind and assess to what extent (if any) that witness`s evidence has been confirmed, explained or contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses - 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  at p 51 letters H and I; 
 
(8) in the light of the averment in the charge that the accused `caused the evidence of the offence to disappear 
 by deliberately not enclosing the statement 
` (emphasis added), 
 
(a) is not `deliberateness` an essential element to be proved by the prosecution; 
 
(b) what is the meaning of the word `disappear`; and 
 
(c) can it be said that the evidence in this case did not disappear particularly when it has been kept by the accused in his office drawer and produced to the authorities when asked about it.
  
 
 
The DPP has submitted that none of these questions of law is of public interest and that this application is an attempt to appeal against a conviction which has been finally determined under the law.
The relevant provisions of s 60 of the SCJA are as follows: 
 
(1) When an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court, the judge may on the application of any party and shall on the application of the public prosecutor reserve for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the course of appeal and the determination of which by the judge has affected the event of the appeal.
 
 
 
 
... 
 
(5) For the purposes of this section but without prejudice to the generality of its provisions - 
 
(a) any question of law regarding which there is a conflict of judicial authority shall be deemed to be a question of public interest; and 
 
(b) the reservation of a question of law for the consideration of the High Court under the provisions of any written law relating to criminal procedure or the exercise by the High Court of any power of revision under any such written law shall be deemed to be an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter.
  
 
 
It is plain from the terms of the provision that even if a question satisfies all the prescribed conditions, the court has discretion whether or not to refer it to the Court of Criminal Appeal, where it is invoked by a party other than public prosecutor.
The relevant condition to be met is whether the questions were of public interest. What is a question of law of public interest? Counsel for the appellant has referred me to a number of authorities decided under s 60 and the corresponding s 66 of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 (the CJA).
In 
 Tan Yin Yen v PP 
 
 
 [1976] 2 MLJ 143 
, the Federal Court of Malaysia refrained from answering the question referred to it by the High Court (the question being whether the magistrate had properly exercised his discretion in making an order of confiscation of a fishing vessel and net under s 16(1) of the Fisheries Act 1963) on the ground that the public prosecutor had agreed that the forfeiture was wrong. However, Suffian ACJ in his oral judgment said: 
 
It is to be observed that questions of law which may be referred to us under s 66 should not be questions that are of personal interest only to the accused or the public prosecutor, but should be questions that are of 
 public
 interest, and it seems to us better if the High Court were to exercise their discretion under s 66 sparingly, so that the references are not used as an in direct way of appealing against matters that under the law have been finally determined by the High Court. (Emphasis of court.)
 
 
 
In emphasizing the word `public`, his Lordship seemed to be suggesting that the relevant question of law was not of public interest. On the other hand, he might have meant that although the question of law was one of public interest, the High Court should have exercised its discretion sparingly in order that that procedure should not be used as a means of appeal. This judgment throws little light on what is a question of law of public interest.
In 
 A Ragunathan v PR 
 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 139
 , Raja Azlan Shah Ag LP delivered a more substantial judgment on the issue. The question in that case was whether the appellant was a `public officer` within the meaning of that expression in s 18(1) of the Public Service Tribunal Act 1977. He was charged for the offence of communicating with the press in regard to proceedings of the tribunal and his defence was called. The questions were: 
 
(1) What ingredients must the respondent prove to establish a prima facie case in a prosecution against a defendant on a charge under s 18(1) of the Public Service Tribunal Act 1977 read with para 7 of the Schedule to the said Act?
 
 
 
 
(2) In a prosecution under s 18(1) of the Public Service Tribunal Act 1977, is it sufficient for the respondent to establish that a defendant is a public officer within the meaning of the said Act by leading evidence to show that he (the defendant) is a member of a trade union consisting of government servants?
  
 
 
His Lordship said (at pp 141 and 142): 
 
But it is not sufficient that the question raised is a question of law. It must be a question of law of public interest. What is public interest must surely depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. We think that the proper test for determining whether a question of law raised in the course of the appeal is of public interest would be whether it directly and substantially affects the right of the parties and if so whether it is an open question in the sense that it is not finally settled by this court or the Privy Council or is not free from difficulty or calls for discussion of alternative views. If the question is settled by the highest court or the general principles in determining the question are well settled and it is a mere question of applying those principles to the facts of the case the question would not be a question of law of public interest.
 
 
 
It was urged upon us that in at least two previous cases (see 
 PP v D`Fonseka
 
 
 
[1958] MLJ 102
 ; 
 Yap Ee Kong v PP
 
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 144
 ) the applicants had successfully obtained a reference, and that we should follow those cases and determine the questions referred to us. It was further said that the questions are of general importance upon which further argument and a decision of this court would be to the public advantage (see 
 Buckle v Holmes
 
[1926] 2 KB 125
). A short answer is that the two cases referred above involved misdirections in law and this court had no hesitation to intervene because they called for discussion of alternative views. There are no two views about the present case.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
But basically, we must consistently decline to receive and answer questions which though they may be questions of law are nevertheless not questions of law of public interest, in the sense as we understand it, that a necessity arises for the determination of the questions having regard to the uncertain or conflicting state of the law on the subject: see s 66(6)(a) Courts of Judicature Act 1964.
 
 
 
In the event, the court declined to answer the questions following the reason given by the same court in 
 Cecil Rajah v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 1 MLJ 147
  (ie that it was more convenient for the court to `consider such points of public importance` after the High Court had dealt with them and given the benefit of its views).
In 
 Nunis v PP 
 
 
 
[1982] 2 MLJ 114
 , the question of law related to the meaning of the expression `or other advantage` in s 2(2) of Act 22 of 1970 which the High Court judge had construed widely, following two previous Federal Court decisions. The Federal Court refused to grant leave. Raja Azlan Shah CJ (Malaya), in delivering the judgment of the court, said: 
 
For leave to be granted, it is necessary that the question posed is a question of law raised in the course of the appeal to the High Court and is of public interest. I have in delivering the judgment of this court in 
 Ragunathan v PR
 
 
 
[1982] 1 MLJ 139
  dealt with the test for determining what amounts to a question meeting the requisite factors for the purposes of s 66 of the Courts of 
 j
udicature Act 1964, and I made it clear that if it is a mere question of principles, which in the matter before us only involve the construction of certain words in a statutory provision in their application to the facts of the case, the question would not be a question of law of public interest.
 
 
 
In 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 453
 , the applicants raised the following issues for decision by the Court of Appeal under s 60 of the SCJA: 
 
(i) Magistrate`s Appeal Nos 8 and 9 of 1984
 
 
 
 
(a) whether the declaration by the respondents was a declaration within the scope and meaning of s 199 of the Penal Code; 
 
(b) whether Mr Daljit Singh was authorized by law to receive the said declaration from the respondents.
  
 
 
(ii) Magistrate`s Appeal Nos 11 and 13 of 1984
(a) whether the property in the cheques for $2,000 and $200 was in the Workers` Party before the cheques were negotiated; 
(b) on who was the onus to prove the property of the cheques in the Workers` Party and whether such onus was discharged by the party on who it lay on the whole of the evidence adduced before the court; 
(c) whether the said onus shifted at any time from one party to the other, alternatively whether there was any onus on the respondents at any state of the trial to prove that the property in the said cheques was not in the Workers` Party; 
(d) whether on the whole of the evidence adduced before the court the prosecution had discharged the onus on it to satisfy the court that the respondents fraudulently transferred the property in the said cheques assuming the property in the said cheques was in the Workers` Party; 
(e) whether the High Court was right and justified on well established principles of law in disturbing the very careful findings of fact made by the trial judge before acquitting the respondents on the charges.
 
 
 
(iii) Magistrate`s Appeal Nos 14 and 15 of 1984
(a) whether the property in the cheque for $400 remained with the Workers` Party after the end of May 1982 and in particular was it so on 2 July 1982 when the proceeds on the cheque was realized; 
(b) whether the whole of the evidence adduced before the court was capable in law to support the finding of a common intention between the appellants.
 
 
 
The Chief Justice held that the said questions were questions of fact, but that if they were questions of law, they were not questions of law of public interest. The applicants appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal which held that there was no right of appeal in the matter: see 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 453
 . The applicants then petitioned the Privy Council for special leave to appeal to the Privy Council. Leave was refused on 6 March 1986.
In 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
 (Criminal Motion No 59 of 1986) (unreported), the same applicants raised, again unsuccessfully, for any of the following issues for determination by the Court of Criminal Appeal: 
 
(a) whether it is necessary for the purposes of s 199 of the Penal Code that a `declaration` therein referred to must be in such a form that it is capable of standing on its own as a piece of evidence and is receivable by the court as evidence of the facts within it without being appended to any other document. In other words is it necessary for the declaration to be in such a form that it is receivable as evidence of the facts contained within it as though the maker of the declaration had himself gone into the witness box and given evidence on oath?
 
 
 
 
(b) whether the declaration in the instant case (ie P13A) which was not a statutory declaration, which was not on oath and did not contain within it any of the solemn words which could in any way enable it to stand on its own feet as an admissible document, was not fatal to the argument that it could be described as a `declaration` within s 199; 
 
(c) whether on the interpretation of the relevant legislative provisions, Daljit Singh could have been regarded as a Commissioner for Oaths at the material times; 
 
(d) whether the requirement under the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 that verification of accounts should be by affidavit can in any way be said to have been fulfilled in this case with regard to the Workers` Party accounts; 
 
(e) whether, as a matter of law, it is possible to say, in any event, that any rules of the Supreme Court which are in themselves procedural provisions, can abrogate or change the effect of a statute; 
 
(f) whether the fact that it is required procedurally for a deponent such as a receiver to give the grounds for stating what he believes `to the best of his knowledge and belief` in any way make any document which is simply evidence of the document`s belief admissible in its own right; 
 
(g) whether if it is intended or desired that any statement made in any declaration and annexed to any affidavit on grounds `to the best of my knowledge and belief` if it is thereafter to be submitted as evidence of the facts within it in his own right should not also be supported by an affidavit of those who made the declaration; 
 
(h) whether it is competent for the High Court sitting in an appellate jurisdiction in a criminal appeal from a subordinate court to pass a sentence which the subordinate court was not competent to pass at the time sentence was pronounced; 
 
(i) whether an appellate court can vary the sentences of a lower court outside the principles set out by the provision of s 260 of the Criminal Procedure Code and the authorities thereon the matter; 
 
(j) whether before a conviction under s 199 of the Penal Code can be made it is incumbent upon the prosecution to show knowledge on the part of the declarants that the declaration would be used in the manner and for the purpose set out in the section and whether this requirement has been satisfied in the present case upon the evidence before the court.
  
 
 
Lai Kew Chai J considered that questions (a), (b), (c), (f) and (g) were in substance the same as question (i) in Criminal Motion No 23 of 1985 (
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 453
 ) and held that they were not questions of law of public interest. His Lordship`s reasoning is as follows: 
 
In my judgment none of the five questions ... is a `question of law of public interest`... Both the learned Chief 
 j
ustice and I have decided that the joint declaration made by the applicants in circumstances under which they knew or ought to know that it would be and was in fact tendered in the interlocutory receivership proceedings was a `declaration` within s 199 of the Penal Code which the assistant registrar was `authorized by law (ie by O 41 r 5(2) of the Rules of Supreme Court 1970) to receive as evidence` touching on a material point. There is within our jurisdiction no divergence of judicial opinion in the High Court on this issue. That there is judicial agreement between the learned Chief justice and I is due to the fact that there is and can be no room for an alternative view on the law bearing on this issue and the application of the facts in this case to the law.
 
 
 
As for the contention that `there is a good deal of authority which are generally in favour of the [applicants]`, this contention is not correct at all. I invite attention to my analyses of the cases in my judgment delivered yesterday. I had distinguished the four cases cited by Lord Hooson. So far as 
 Baban Singh
`s case is concerned, I had amply demonstrated that the ratio decidendi of that case is that a declaration falling within s 199 is not required to be under oath or affirmation. The only conditions are: (i) that it is a voluntary declaration; (ii) that the law authorized its reception as evidence of a fact in issue; and (iii) that the maker knew or ought to know that it will be and is tendered as evidence touching on any point material to the object for which the declaration is made or used.
 
 
 
Accordingly, the applicants are unable to come within the presumption under s 60(5) of the Act, the relevant parts of which provide as follows:
 
 
 
`For the purposes of this section but without prejudice to the generality of its provisions -
 
 
 
(a) any question of law regarding which there is a conflict of judicial authority shall be deemed to be a question of public interest; ...`
 
 
 
On the remaining questions, Lai Kew Chai J held that question (d) had no relevance; that question (c) was also not relevant as the validity of the appointment of Mr Daljit Singh as Commissioner for Oaths could not affect the outcome of the appeal, that question (j) was not in dispute, but that knowledge on the part of the applicants had been proved, that question (h) was not relevant as he had not intended to pass a sentence which the lower court had no jurisdiction to pass and that question (i) did not raise any disputed point of law as there was a long line of authorities which justified his decision to vary the sentence.
However, in 
 JB Jeyaretnam v Law Society of Singapore 
 
 [1988] 5 MLJ 425 
, the Privy Council took the opportunity to give their views on the meaning of s 60 of the SCJA. Their Lordships said (at p 432): 
 
The conviction of the appellant on the accounts charge depends on a construction of s 199 of the Penal Code first propounded by the Chief justice sitting as a single judge and later adopted by judge Foenander and Lai Kew Chai J, which is attacked as bad in law. The convictions on the $2,000 and $200 cheque charges depend on findings of fact by the Chief Justice reversing the primary findings of the trial judge on grounds which are attacked as bad in law. The affirmation by the Chief 
 j
ustice of the conviction by Judge Khoo of the $400 cheque charge is attacked as bad in law. The appellant has had no opportunity to test any of the questions of law which he claims are involved by appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal of Singapore or, if necessary, by further appeal to the Board, because the Chief 
 j
ustice and Lai Kew Chai J refused to reserve any questions of law pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of 
 j
udicature Act and, in the absence of such reservation, neither the Court of Criminal Appeal nor the Board had any jurisdiction to entertain any appeal. If it can be shown that there were questions of law of public interest which should have been reserved for decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal and that this would have led to the quashing of the convictions either by the Court of Criminal Appeal or on appeal by the Board, it must surely be appropriate, to quote Lord Simon`s words `that the conviction(s) should not be conclusive against the accused in the course of disciplinary proceedings, the object of which themselves is, after an, to promote justice`.
 
 
 
Their Lordships have from the outset entertained no doubt that these convictions do indeed raise serious questions of law and they find it difficult to understand how any serious question of law arising in a criminal case on which a person`s conviction of a grave offence may depend can be said not to be `of public interest` within the meaning of s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of 
 j
udicature Act. In the end, therefore, the determination of the appeal turns on the question whether the convictions are vitiated by errors of law.
 
 
 
It is to be noted that the views of the Federal Court of Malaysia on the corresponding section were not considered by the Privy Council, presumably because the relevant decisions were not cited. The test laid down by the Privy Council as to when a question of law is of public interest, ie `any serious question of law ... on which a person`s conviction of a grave offence may depend`, is not easy to apply, if only because of its uncertain ambit. What is a grave offence as distinguished from any other offence? From the case itself, we can deduce that any offence which carries a sentence of imprisonment is a grave offence, as Jeyaretnam was sentenced to one month`s imprisonment on one of the charges. He was also fined on one charge in an amount which disqualified him from being a Member of Parliament. Does potential disqualification from holding a public office make an offence grave? Is the test of gravity related to the standards of morality or conduct of Singapore society or to the individual`s own standing in society or both? The gravity of an offence is not necessarily commensurate with the gravity of its consequences to the person who has been convicted of such offence.
What is a 
 serious 
 question of law as distinguished from any other question of law? The ambit of this requirement is also uncertain as the Privy Council have not given any guidelines, beyond stating that the convictions against Jeyaretnam raised serious questions of law. What were these questions of law?
On the accounts charge under s 199 of the Penal Code (ie making a false declaration in relation to the accounts), the question was whether the declaration signed by Jeyaretnam was a declaration within the terms of s 199 of the Penal Code. The Privy Council held that there was no ambiguity about that section, that `what is required is a declaration which is per se admissible as evidence of any fact`, that the declaration made by Jeyaretnam, not being a statutory declaration, was not per se admissible of the facts stated therein, although it was receivable in evidence.
With respect to the charges on the $2,000 cheque and the $200 cheque, on both of which the Chief Justice reversed the trial judge`s decision, the Privy Council held that the trial judge`s decision was based on findings of fact and that the Chief J ustice in setting out to controvert the findings of fact on the central issue as to the circumstances in which the donor had altered his cheque to make it payable to bearer, had exceeded his proper function as an appellate judge and had thereby committed a serious error of law which vitiated his decision.
With respect to the charge on the $400 on which Jeyaretnam was convicted by the trial judge, the question of law was whether the drawer was entitled to withdraw his cheque or change the donee whilst the cheque was still in the possession of Jeyaretnam. The Privy Council, after stating that `this was perhaps the simplest case of all and here it was the trial judge who fell into error probably because the right point was never clearly taken`, held that there was an imperfect gift of the cheque, and therefore the donor could withdraw it at any time, and was on the evidence withdrawn because he did not want the proceeds to go to the receiver for the creditors of the Workers` Party.
The question of law common to the three cheques was whether the property in them had passed to the Workers` Party at the time the cheques were altered by the donor or dealt with by J eyaretnam with the consent of the donor. The Privy Council held that the property in the cheques had never vested in the Workers` Party as, until they were presented for payment or negotiated to a third party, each of them was nothing more than a revocable mandate to the drawer`s bank to pay the amount shown and a revocable promise to the donee that the amount would be paid. Accordingly, the drawer could change the mandate and the promise at any time before it was acted upon. The reason why the lower courts went wrong on this question of law was that, according to their Lordships, `it is fair to all concerned to point out that these important considerations do not appear to have been fully appreciated at any stage in the criminal proceedings or to have been adequately formulated in argument until the matter reached the Board.`
It can thus be seen that of the questions of law considered as serious by the Privy Council, two of them concerned substantive principles of law: (i) the gift cheque as a revocable mandate, which was the `simplest of all`, and (ii) the legal nature of a declaration under s 199 of the Penal Code, which turned on the fine distinction between a declaration that is admissible as evidence of the facts stated therein and one that is admissible in evidence but not of the facts stated therein. The other two questions of law concerned (iii) the proper role of an appellate court in regard to findings of fact by a trial judge.
The word `serious` used in relation to ideas and concepts connotes the quality of weightiness, complexity and importance and requiring or deserving careful and thoughtful consideration. Except for point (ii) which was conceptually a subtle and therefore difficult point, the other points were not serious in the above sense as point (i) was held to be simple, and point (iii) is settled law.
In regard to point (iii), it was, of course, open to argument that the Chief Justice`s approach was wrong, and, in the event, the Privy Council held that the Chief Justice committed a serious error of law. However, the word `serious` in this context means no more than that it made the difference between an acquittal and a conviction. But, it should be noted, that this kind of questions of law, by its nature, can only be raised in relation to a particular case. It is of no public interest. It was of personal interest to Jeyaretnam in each case.
In Singapore, the majority of criminal cases are tried in the subordinate courts. The normal recourse available to a convicted person who is dissatisfied with his conviction and/or the sentence is to appeal to the High Court. It is in the public interest that a person who has been wrongly convicted of any offence (and not only a grave offence), whether by the wrong application of the law or the application of the wrong law, should be able to have it corrected on appeal. Such a right is provided under existing law, but it does not go beyond the High Court. The public interest in giving a convicted person the right to have his conviction corrected on appeal has to be balanced against the public interest that there has to be finality in the proceedings, and Parliament has decided as a matter of policy that finality in criminal cases tried in the subordinate courts stops at the High Court. Parliament has set the balance by giving a limited right of appeal in such cases rather than to allow them to go all the way to the Privy Council. However, Parliament has also recognized that there are certain questions of law which should be settled by the Court of Criminal Appeal as it is in the public interest that they should be so settled. It is doubtful that s 60 was designed to refer for decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal questions which by their nature cannot affect the outcome of cases other than those from which they arose.
It is on these considerations that the courts in Malaysia and Singapore have recognized the limitations of s 60.
It is not an ordinary appeal provision to argue points of law which are settled or novel points which can be decided by the application or extension of established principles of law or the application of statutory provisions which have been authoritatively construed by higher courts. Hence, Suffian ACJ`s caution that the provision be used sparingly lest it be made use of as an appeal provision.
I turn now to the questions before me and the submissions of counsel for the appellant and of the DPP.
Questions (1) to (6) can be taken together. It is common ground that the certified copy of the record of the trial transmitted to the appellant pursuant to s 249 of the CPC contained the following entry: 
 
DPP: Applies under s 163 CPC to amend charge under s 204 Penal Code.
 
 
 
 
Court: Defence called on 
 amended 
 charge. (My emphasis.) 
 
Two courses explained to accused in ordinary language. 
 
Elects to give evidence from the witness box.
  
 
 
It was common ground that the DPP did not at any time apply to amend the charge. In the course of the appeal the DPP produced the correspondence between himself and the district judge in which the district judge gave two inconsistent explanations for the existence of the entry in its typed form. The second explanation was supported by the contents of a xeroxed copy of the manuscript notes of the district judge which I found sufficiently legible to read the word typed as `amended` in the record as `original` in manuscript. For this reason, and upon analysing the notes of evidence, I concluded that the district judge had convicted the appellant on the original charge and not on an amended charge. I accepted the comment that the district judge had not explained how he came to make the entry relating to the application by the DPP to amend the charge when no such event had taken place, but for reasons I have given, I came to the conclusion that no miscarriage of justice had occurred.
In this application, counsel for the appellant informed me that at the hearing of the appeal he had objected to the admissibility of the correspondence between the district judge and the DPP and of the xeroxed copy of the manuscript notes. He submitted that I should have never looked at these documents and should have heard the appeal on the basis of the record transmitted under s 249 of the CPC. During the hearing of the appeal, I did not understand counsel to have objected to my looking at the said documents to determine whether there was any basis for the trial judge`s second explanation. The reason for my understanding was that his argument was that the record could not be supplemented or added to which was not what I had done. However, for the purpose of this application, I am prepared to accept that an objection of this nature was made. But, even on that basis, I do not see how this objection can be a question of law of public interest. The objection is a procedural objection (that an affidavit should have been filed, referring to 
 Goh Teng Lok v R 
 
 
 
[1939] MLJ 309
  and not a substantive objection that the documents were not admissible at all. If I had been fully aware of the nature of counsel`s objection, I would have given directions to ensure compliance with the correct procedure. There was and is no suggestion that the xeroxed manuscript was not genuine or that the word `original` is not legible or written there,
There is, I think, a question of law of public interest in the second part of question (2) in regard to the legal status of a certified record of the trial and the powers of an appellate court to take cognizance of documents other than the certified record. By this, I do mean or refer to attempts to supplement the record or to put in material which the trial judge had omitted from the record or which, whilst in the record, he had never brought into consideration. What I have done in this case was to refer to extraneous documents to correct what was obviously a typographical error in the certified record. This error would never have occurred if the manuscript record had been xeroxed in its entirety and signed by the trial judge. For this reason, I hold that the first part of question (2) and questions (3) and (4) are not relevant. But, I think that a higher court should consider the question whether a certified record should be allowed to be corrected and to what extent. It is an important issue pertaining to the administration of justice. If a trial record certified by the trial court (presumably as correct in all respects) could be corrected, it might be said to give rise to public concern as to the integrity of the judiciary or the judicial process. In the present case, the error happened to be one that could have been construed in favour of the appellant, but supposing the error could be construed in favour of the prosecution, what then?
I am also of the view that questions (5) and (6) relating to the unexplained entry is an issue of law of public interest as it relates to the way in which criminal trials are conducted. The existence of such an entry not only created a grievance in the mind of the appellant that he might not have received a fair trial but a public concern on errors of this nature. The suggestion could be made that by reason of the entry the trial judge had not been paying attention to the proceedings. If this were a probable inference, then the question would arise whether it was sufficient to vitiate the conviction.
With respect to question (7), I think that the words taken from my judgment and referred to therein do not nor were they intended to run counter to the tenet that it is for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt or that it is contrary to direction in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
. Those words should be read in the context of pp 17, 18 and 19 where I considered the submissions of counsel for the appellant. However, if it were otherwise, as contended by counsel, then I have made a serious error of law which would vitiate my affirmation of the conviction of the appellant on a grave offence. Notwithstanding this but for the views of the Privy Council, I would not have been prepared to refer this question to the Court of Criminal Appeal.
As regards question (8), the disappearance of the evidence is an essential ingredient of the offence. The appellant had taken two statements (P3 and P4) from Razali. He put P3 (which was inculpatory in nature) in his drawer and P4 (which was exculpatory in nature) in the investigation papers file. He then made a recommendation that Razali be charged for consumption of morphine but not also for possession of cannabis on the ground that there was insufficient evidence on the second charge. Now, Razali had already twice admitted to possession, the first time orally and the second time in P3. The appellant had given various reasons for not including P3 in the investigation file as a result of which his testimony was not believed by the trial judge. I confirmed the trial judge`s decision that the appellant, by deliberately not putting P3 in the investigation file had caused it to disappear in order to shield Razali. I held and continue to hold the view the word `disappear` in the said section means `to vanish from sight` and that the evidence, P3, disappeared at the relevant time when the appellant`s superior officer made his decision whether to accept or reject the appellant`s recommendation as to whether Razali should be prosecuted on one or two charges. Counsel for the appellant had submitted that P3 did not disappear as it was in his drawer all the time and that the appellant produced it immediately he was asked by the investigating CPIB officer. I did not and do not agree that this act did not make P3 `disappear`. In my view, P3 disappeared because it was locked away in a drawer. Nevertheless, because it is a point on which there is no local authority and because it is a question of law on which depended the conviction of the appellant for a grave offence, I have decided to refer it for decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal.
For the above reasons, the following questions of law were on 13 December 1989 referred by me for decision by the Court of Criminal Appeal:
 
 
(1) whether in law the signed copy of the record of the trial transmitted to the appellant under s 249 of the CPC may be corrected by reference to the manuscript notes of evidence of the trial judge; 
 
(2) whether the omission of the trial judge to explain his entry in relation to any event that never took place during the trial was sufficient by itself or in the context of the whole record to vitiate his verdict in this case; 
 
(3) whether the trial judge had made up his mind as to the guilt of the appellant before calling on his defence and whether the trial judge had misdirected himself in convicting the appellant on the basis that it was not for the prosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt; and 
 
(4) whether, on the evidence, the appellant had caused P3 to disappear.

Cur Adv Vult
 
You, Ko Mun Cheung, Raymond, are charged as follows: 
 
That you on or about December 1986, at about 2.20pm at the Arrival Hall of the Singapore Changi Airport, Singapore, did import into Singapore a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) to wit, 16 packets of drug containing not less than 1,133.46g of diamorphine without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
You, An Man Keny Chiu Sum Hing, are charged as follows: 
 
That you on or about 12 December 1986, at about 2.20pm, at the Arrival Hall of the Singapore Changi Airport, Singapore, did import into Singapore a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) to wit, 16 packets of drug containing not less than 1,127.93g of diamorphine without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
The evidence that has been adduced by the prosecution shows that both of you, who are Hong Kong nationals, boarded a Thai International Airways flight no TG 405 from Bangkok on 12 December 1986 and arrived at Changi International Airport, Singapore at about 2pm. After disembarkation, both of you were cleared through the Singapore immigration checkpoints at the airport. Both of you then proceeded to the customs checkpoint.
You, Ko, followed by AMK, proceeded to the customs checkpoint located next to Belt 21. Each of you was carrying two bags. You, Ko, were cleared by customs and you then walked out into the arrival hall where you were arrested by N/O Chew Khai Chow (PW6).
You, AMK, proceeded to Counter 20 which was opposite Belt 21. You were stopped by C/O Ahmad bin Ali (PW5). He asked you in English whether you had anything to declare. You remained silent. He asked you again, and this time you replied in English that you had nothing to declare. He then asked you for your passport which you produced. Your passport no was 898857. At that moment, two CNB officers approached the said counter, identified themselves and arrested you. The N/Os were Yip Yat Choi and Tan Wu Chyuan. At about that time, you, Ko, were also brought to the said counter by PW6.
Both of you were then brought by the N/Os to the customs search room. There, both of you were searched. You, Ko, were asked by PW6 whether you had anything to declare. You did not reply. PW6 then searched your bags. He then told you to take off your clothes, whereupon, you told him that you had something on your body. PW6 asked you what it was and you replied that it was something your friend has requested you to carry to Singapore. PW6 did not ask you what the things were. He then told you to take off your shirt, which you did. Underneath the shirt was another white T-shirt which was covering a body vest strapped to your body. PW6 felt the vest and felt something bulky concealed in the vest. You were told to dress and then handcuffed.
You, AMK, were also told to bring your bags into the customs search room by PW6. You then told PW6 in Cantonese that there was no need to search you and that the `things` were on your body. You then touched your chest with both your hands. You were then asked what the things on your body were and you replied `Pak Fun` (which is the Cantonese expression for heroin or diamorphine). You were then told to take off your clothes. PW6 also ascertained that you were dressed similarly like Ko. PW6 also felt your vest and felt something bulky contained in the vest. You were told to dress and then handcuffed.
After the body search, both of you were taken by car to the CNB headquarters. On the way, PW6 learnt that there was a contact man who, if he did not meet you at the airport, would look for you at Apollo Hotel at Havelock Road. The contact man, who was Ho Pak Keung, also a Hong Kong national, but known to you as `Ah Mun` was subsequently arrested by N/Os at Apollo Hotel. The documents seized from him showed that he had booked air tickets for both of you to fly to Amsterdam. Both of you were subsequently able to identify Ah Mun at two identification parades conducted by the CNB officers.
On arrival at the CNB office at about 3.30pm, both of you with your vests containing the bulky substance were handed over to N/O Lee Kiong Lock. He then directed that photographs be taken of both of you in three stages of dressing and also the vests, each containing 16 packets of a white substance wrapped in plastic material. N/O Lee then weighed the 32 packets in your presence and found that each packet weighed approximately 120g. He then sealed and marked the said packets in two lots of 16 packets as LKL-A1-16 (seized from Ko) and LKL-B1-16 (seized from AMK). Urine samples were also taken from both of you. Subsequently, on 15 December 1986, N/O Lee handed the said 32 packets to Dr Chow Shui Tse, the principal scientific officer at the Department of Scientific Services, for analysis. Dr Chow found, upon analysis, that the 16 packets marked LKL-A1-16 contained a total weight of not less than 1,133.46g of diamorphine and that the 16 packets marked LKL-B1-16 contained a total weight of not less than 1,127.93g of diamorphine. Diamorphine is a Class `A` controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act).
At about 7.10pm on the same day, SNO Jamaluddin (PW7) proceeded to take a statement from you, Ko, pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC. You elected to speak in Cantonese. A certificated interpreter, Wu Nan Yong (PW8), was present to interpret. He interpreted to you in Cantonese the charge under s 7 of the Act and the notice of warning both of which were read out in English by PW7. You were then invited to make a statement. You then made a voluntary statement which was recorded down by PW7 which was signed by you and Wu and PW7. All other statutory requirements in relation to the taking and the making of your statement were complied with.
You, AMK, also gave a s 122(6) statement to PW7 at about 7.55pm, ie immediately after Ko had given his statement. You also elected to speak in Cantonese and Wu Nan Yong was the interpreter. Again, PW7 followed the same procedure as in the case of Ko. You also made a voluntary statement which was signed by you, Wu and PW7.
As neither of you has challenged the admissibility of your statements, we admitted them in evidence. You, Ko, made the following statement: 
 
I owed one Ah Lock, a Hong Kong resident HK$5,000. He then pressurized me to repay the money I owed him. I told him that I have no money but Ah Lock suggested that I helped his friend to bring something to Holland and I will be paid HK$45,000. I agreed to help and I asked Ah Lock what was this thing I was to carry. Ah Lock told me that this thing is prohibited and if at all, I were arrested, I would be fined at the very most. Ah Lock later gave me a plane ticket for Bangkok. Ah Lock greeted me at the airport in Bangkok and brought me to a hotel where I was introduced to one Ah Mun. After the introduction, Ah Lock left, I stayed there for a few days and Ah Mun gave me a few thousand bahts for spending. This morning before I left for Singapore, Ah Mun gave me a vest to put on. I put on the vest and only on my arrival in Singapore and arrested by government officers did I realize that the vest contained drugs.
 
 
 
You, AMK, made the following statement: 
 
I do not know that there is such a law in Singapore. I knew what I had in the vest was heroin and I did it because I was in financial difficulties. The man who asked me to do it, Ah Mun, offered me HK$45,000. Ah Mun told me that the quantity of heroin I was to carry was only a small quantity. Later, after my arrest, I saw Ah Mun being handcuffed along the corridor of this government building.
 
 
 
The contact man in Singapore called Ah Mun gave evidence for the prosecution. He said that between 1985 and 1986, he had borrowed HK$10,000 from a man called Ah Lock and when he could not repay the loan Ah Lock suggested that he should assist in carrying drugs from Bangkok to Amsterdam. He agreed when he was told that all he had to do was to fly to Singapore and buy some air tickets for the carriers of the drugs. As arranged, Ah Mun went to Bangkok with Ah Lock and there he was introduced by Ah Lock to both of you. There, Ah Mun took the measurements of both of you for the purpose of making a vest for each of you. Ah Mun flew to Singapore on 10 December 1986 and in Singapore he bought two air tickets for both of you to fly to Amsterdam on 13 December 1986.
What we have just recounted is the evidence adduced by the prosecution at the close of its case against both of you. On this evidence, we found that the prosecution has made out a case against both of you which, if unrebutted, would have warranted your convictions. Accordingly, we called on both of you to enter on your defence. Both of you elected to give evidence in the witness box.
You, Ko, testified that you owed one Ah Lock about HK$3,000 as a gambling debt. You then modified this statement and said that you owed two other gamblers the said sums and that they had threatened to assault you if you did not pay up, and that Ah Lock acted as your guarantor as a result of which the threats were averted. However, you did not know whether Ah Lock actually paid your debt. You said that because Ah Lock had stood surety for you, he was able to persuade you to assist him in carrying some things to Amsterdam after telling you that although it was illegal to do so, it was not dangerous as, if you were arrested, all that would happen would be that the things would be forfeited and that you would be fined. He also offered you a handsome reward for the job, the amount being HK$45,000. Later on, you said Ah Lock decided to throw in his own fee of $5,000 to enable you to pay off your gambling debt and to buy winter clothing. You said that whilst waiting for about a month for your passport to be issued to you, you had thought about the nature of the things you had agreed to carry for Ah Lock. It crossed your mind that the things would have to be valuable and therefore could be counterfeit notes or antiques or diamonds or drugs. You said that you asked Ah Lock what the things were but he said that he could not tell you at that early stage for fear that you might tell other people. Later, you asked Ah Lock again but again he would not tell you. In your mind, you discounted that the things you would be asked to carry were ganja or MX pills as they were freely available in Hong Kong and that it would not be necessary to get them from Bangkok. You also discounted heroin as you had been told by Ah Lock that you would only be fined and you were aware that you would be imprisoned if you were arrested for having possession of heroin. You said that you trusted Ah Lock as he had never cheated you. Finally, you came to the conclusion that the things you would be carrying must be diamonds, and this, to your mind, w as confirmed when you asked Ah Lock whether you were being required to carry diamonds and he just smiled and did not reply.
As arranged with Ah Lock, you flew to Bangkok on 8 December 1986 to start your mission. You were met in Bangkok by Ah Lock who later introduced you to various people, viz Ah Mun, AMK (second accused), one Tai Tow Chai or Tai Tow Sook, a Thai who was the boss. Your body measurements were taken by Ah Mun and later you went to a house in the outskirts of Bangkok with TTC or TTS for fitting. You were fitted with a vest which you felt was heavy, weighing at least 1kg. The vest was lined with packets of things stitched into the vest. You could not see what was in the packets in the vest. You said if you had known that they contained heroin, you would not have agreed to take them to Amsterdam. When asked by the DPP as to what you thought were in the packets in the vest, you said that you did not know. When asked whether you thought they concealed diamonds, you thought it was possible as if you were asked to carry diamonds, it would not be a few but a lot. You met Ah Lock again on 11 December 1986, but again you did not ask him what was in your vest. You felt it was useless to ask again as you had asked, he had smiled and so you thought your guess that they contained diamonds was correct.
After you boarded the plane to Singapore on 12 December 1986, the plan was that you would on board the plane exchange your travelling bag with one carried by the Thai national. The bag to be exchanged for yours would contain the two vests which you and AMK would wear to Singapore. This plan was carried out after the plane had landed at and flown out of Phuket. You took the bag to the toilet, took out one of the vests and put it on. You handed the bag to AMK when you came out of the toilet. When you landed in Singapore, you were arrested at the arrival hall. When you were asked in the customs search room what was in the vest you said you did not know. When you were questioned by the DPP why you did not tell the CNB officers that it contained diamonds if you, as you have claimed, believed that you were carrying diamonds, your reply was that you were nervous as you were doing something illegal and that the best thing to do was to say you did not know. Your defence is that you did not know you were carrying drugs in your vest.
We have given careful consideration to your testimony and the submissions of your counsel on the evidence. We do not believe that you did not know what was in the 16 packets that were stitched to the vest which was worn by you into Singapore, nor do we believe that Ah Lock did not tell you that you were being asked to carry drugs from Bangkok to Amsterdam via Singapore. Although you were relatively young, you were not a simpleton as your counsel has said you were. You were familiar with cannabis and knew what MX pills were and had also seen pictures of heroin and you also knew that drugs were not welcome in foreign countries and that illegal possession of drugs would mean imprisonment. We do not see how you could have remained under the impression, assuming that we accept your evidence that you believed that you were being asked to carry something valuable like diamonds, that the vest weighing more than 1kg and with 16 bulging packets stitched to it could contain diamonds. We do not believe that you could have been under the impression that you were not carrying something `dangerous` when you were being paid HK$45,000, a substantial sum of money for someone who assisted in the selling of poultry, for carrying something to Amsterdam. We do not think you were so naive that you really thought the bulky patches on a specially designed vest contained diamonds and not drugs.
Section 18(2) of the Act provides that any person who has in his possession a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. You were found in possession of drugs on your body and accordingly the onus of discharging that presumption lies on you. The standard of proof is the balance of probabilities. In our view, for the reasons we have given, you have not proved, on a balance of probabilities, that you did not know the nature of the drugs you were carrying. You had a lot of time and many opportunities to find out whether you were being asked to carry drugs to Amsterdam. You had suspicions that it was drugs that you were being asked to carry and you made no effort to find out in a more positive manner what the vest contained. We do not think that the presumption that you know the nature of the drug has been rebutted by your failure to enquire further, after having had suspicions that it could be drugs that you were being asked to carry.
You, AMK, have admitted all along, from the moment you were arrested and in the witness stand, that you knew you were carrying `Pak Fun` from Bangkok to Amsterdam. You agreed to do so at the request of Ah Lock because you were in financial difficulties. You stated that you agreed and it was your intention to carry the drug to Amsterdam but not to Singapore and that you broke your journey in Singapore for convenience and not with a view to disposing of the drug in Singapore or delivering it to any person, not even Ah Mun, your contact man in Singapore, who would be accompanying you to Amsterdam. The air tickets seized by the CNB officers from Ah Mun corroborated your evidence as regards your intention to carry the drug to Amsterdam. So did Ah Mun`s evidence.
On this evidence, your counsel has submitted that you have not committed the offence of importing the drug into Singapore under s 7 of the Act but only of being in possession under s 5 thereof. The submission is valid only if the word `import` in s 7 has a meaning which restricts it to bringing something into Singapore as its ultimate destination. The DPP has referred us to two decisions which support the contrary view that the word `import` in s 7 should be given its ordinary and natural meaning of bringing something into a country, whatever the purpose may be and whether or not it is the ultimate destination thereof. In 
 R v Geesman 
(1970) 13 CRNS 240, a Quebec Sessions Court found the accused guilty of importing hashish into Canada under s 5(1) of the Narcotic Control Act 1960-61 when he was arrested by the customs authorities at Dorval Airport, Montreal after arriving from Spain with ten pounds of hashish strapped to his body which he had intended to transport to British Columbia and then across the border to the United States. Section 5(1) is similar to s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), and neither law contains a definition of the word `import`. The president of the court gave the word its ordinary and natural meaning, ie to bring or cause to be brought in something from a foreign country. His Honour was able to ascertain the intention of the Canadian Parliament as to the scope of that word by reference to Canada having ratified the United Nations` Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), art 1, s 1(M) of which defines the word `import` to mean the transfer of drugs from one state to another state. 
 R v Geesman 
was referred to in 
 R v Bell 
 (1984) 3 DLR (4d) 385, where the Supreme Court of Canada gave a similar meaning to the word `import`, although in that case, the ultimate destination was Canada.
The DPP also referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in 
 R v Smith 
 
[1973] 1 QB 924
 where it was held that for the purpose of showing that a person has committed the offence being knowingly concerned in the fraudulent evasion of the prohibition against the importation of cannabis imposed by the Dangerous Drugs Act 1965, contrary to s 304(b) of the Customs and Excise Act 1952, it is sufficient to prove that he had been a party to the importation of the cannabis into the United Kingdom as a staging post for onward transmission to another country, and that it was unnecessary to show that he had done anything in the United Kingdom to further the transaction. Accordingly, the appellant was held to have been properly convicted when he arranged for cannabis to be transferred from an aircraft which had landed at Heathrow Airport to another waiting aircraft bound for Bermuda.
In our view, the reasoning in 
 R v Geesman 
is applicable to ascertaining the meaning of the word `import` in s 7 of the Act. Singapore has also ratified the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. The Misuse of Drugs Act is not a law which is concerned with customs duty but a law enacted by Parliament as part of Singapore`s efforts to suppress the illegal importation into and exportation from Singapore of controlled drugs as defined in the Misuse of Drugs Act.
Furthermore, the DPP has drawn our attention to s 2 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) which defines the word `import`, with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, to mean, `to bring or cause to be brought into Singapore by land, sea and air`. The definition is clear and unambiguous. We do not see any reason for not applying the statutory definition to the said word in the Misuse of Drugs Act.
Accordingly, we reject the submission of your counsel that you did not import diamorphine into Singapore on 12 December 1986 when you brought in 16 packets of substance containing the said drug.
For the reasons we have given, we find that on the facts and on the law the prosecution has proved its case against both of you without any reasonable doubt. We find both of you guilty as charged and we convict you accordingly.

The accused, a 23-year-old male Chinese, was tried by us on the capital charge of having committed murder by causing the death of one Irene Louise Prinsen, a 24-year-old Caucasian girl from New Zealand, on 6 October 1985 at about 2am at the 22nd level, Block 12, North Bridge Road, Singapore.
At the close of the case for the prosecution, counsel for the accused submitted that the prosecution had failed to adduce `some evidence (not inherently incredible)` which if we, as deciders of law, were to accept as accurate, would establish that the accused had at the 22nd level of the block of flats lifted the deceased over the parapet wall and had thrown the deceased to her death at the canopy of the 2nd level of the block of flats.
We were sure and it was not disputed in cross-examination that the accused was the last person who was seen with the deceased alive and that the accused after the fatal fall had reported to the police that there was a case of suicide. In opening the case against the accused, the deputy public prosecutor stated that the prosecution would rely on one of the statements purportedly made by the accused during which the accused was alleged to have demonstrated to Sgt Raymond Roy how he lifted the deceased over the parapet wall. If this statement was in fact made by the accused, it would have amounted at the close of the case for the prosecution to credible evidence that the accused had at least placed the deceased over the parapet wall and had, inferentially, caused her to fall, subject to any defence which might be raised if the defence was called.
The prosecution also indicated that the pathologist, Prof Chao Tzee Cheng, who had visited the scene and had performed the autopsy on the deceased, would refer to five injuries sustained by the deceased which were not caused by or sustained in the course of the fall from the 22nd level. We were also told that Prof Chao would opine that the five injuries were sustained as a result of a struggle before the fall. If these crucial opinions were to stand after cross-examination at the close of the case for the prosecution, obviously there would have been credible evidence which would support an irresistible inference, subject to any defence that might have been raised, that the accused and the deceased did have a struggle shortly before her fatal fall.
The prosecution then disclosed that at the 22nd level Sgt Raymond Roy at about 3.20am on 6 October 1985 found a footprint in the inner parapet wall and another set of footprints on the outer parapet wall. Both the footprints were quite clear and they showed the toes pointing downwards. In addition, marks which appeared to be palm prints were also found on the concrete awning or roof canopy. The presence of the footprint marks on the outer parapet wall was to Prof Chao most unusual. The deputy public prosecutor told us that Prof Chao would tell us that in his opinion, the deceased must have been held (a) on the outside of the parapet wall and (b) by someone for a brief moment for the footprint to be imprinted. Professor Chao would further express the opinion that the deceased could have been holding on to the roof canopy with the foot touching the parapet wall before she fell. If these opinions had stood at the close of the case for the prosecution, the defence would have had to be called.
Towards the end of his opening statement, the deputy public prosecutor told us that the prosecution would adduce evidence from Dr Owen Edwin Facey, a forensic scientist attached to the Metropolitan Police Forensic Science Laboratory, London, United Kingdom. The DPP indicated that Dr Facey would testify that the footprints which were found on the outer parapet wall at the 22nd level of the block, which were sent to him for examination, showed the footprint of the left foot of the deceased. Dr Facey would also say that he found a second mark which was the heel print probably made from the right foot of the deceased. Dr Facey would also opine that the footprint on the outer parapet wall could not be made in the course of a fall.
The DPP concluded his opening statement by submitting that the prosecution would prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused intended to cause the death of the deceased at the 22nd level of the block `by lifting her over the parapet wall and later throwing her down`. That was in summary the case of the prosecution.
In the course of the case for the prosecution, counsel for the accused successfully persuaded us to exclude the statements allegedly made by the accused. The five injuries sustained by the deceased were either shown by the defence to be related to the fall or were sustained in the course of the fall or, at the lowest, serious doubts were thrown on the opinion of Prof Chao that they were not related to the fall or not sustained in the course of and when the body of the deceased was handled and carried over the parapet wall to the mortuary. Further, Prof Chao in the course of cross-examination, had to concede that if the deceased had sat on the edge of the parapet wall it was physically possible for her to have held herself slightly outwards and made the footprint marks on the outer parapet wall. Dr Facey, after hearing all the evidence in court, did not feel himself qualified enough to venture the opinion, as Prof Chao did, that the deceased must have been held on the outer parapet wall for a brief moment before she fell to her death.
In the light of (a) the different light thrown on the prosecution evidence as a result of careful and skilful cross-examination; (b) the revised opinions of Prof Chao as to how the injuries of the deceased were sustained, which could not be said to be not due to the impact of the fall or sustained in the course of the fall; (c) our refusal to admit the statements allegedly made by the accused either because we were not sure they were his statements or because we had doubts whether they were voluntarily made; and (d) generally the entire circumstances of the case, the course of police investigations including the fact that the deceased was mentally very anxious over the prospects of returning to her hometown after having broken off with her boyfriend, we accepted the submission of learned counsel for the accused that no case has been made out against the accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction. We accordingly acquitted the accused of the charge of murder without calling for his defence. We now proceed to recite and evaluate the evidence in some detail.
The deceased was in Singapore in transit on her way to New Zealand, having flown from Tel Aviv via Athens. She arrived at the Changi International Airport, Singapore at about 9.50pm on 4 October 1985. The first evidence of the accused having anything to do with the deceased was given by Ng Teck Chua, a catering officer of Olympic Airways who worked at the Changi International Airport. The deceased had flown from Athens to Singapore on a flight of the Olympic Airways. Ng said that the accused had approached him at about 11pm on 4 October 1985 and had mentioned that the deceased had wanted an endorsement on her air ticket to ensure her onward flight to Auckland, New Zealand. Evidence was also given by Wendy Ng Siew Kuan, a traffic officer of Olympic Airways. Her evidence was that at about 10.50pm on the night of her arrival in Singapore the deceased had told her that she wanted an endorsement from her on her air ticket so that she could use her Olympic Airways ticket and fly to Auckland in another air carrier, if necessary, since her flight on Olympic Airways was subject to availability of a seat. According to Wendy Ng, the deceased was wait-listed in Athens and Singapore as the Olympic Airways flight was over-booked. At about 12.15am on 5 October 1985, Wendy Ng made the endorsement. As shown by the air ticket dated 1 October 1985 which Olympic Airways issued to the deceased, she was booked subject to an available seat to leave Singapore on a flight of Air New Zealand at 7.30pm on 8 October 1985. Her air ticket was endorsed so that she could fly by another carrier if she could not get on the Air New Zealand flight. After the endorsement the deceased could have left Singapore earlier if the other carrier had an available seat. Wendy Ng said that the deceased wanted the two options as she was concerned about her return to New Zealand. In cross-examination, Wendy Ng was asked about the demeanour of the deceased when arranging her onward flight to Auckland. She said the deceased might have been a little anxi ous about getting a seat and beyond that she could not add anything useful. We appreciated the point that the deceased was therefore rather anxious to return home.
At 9.15am later that Friday morning, the deceased checked into the Nam Hai Hotel at Bencoolen Street, Singapore. According to Lawrence Nathan, the manager of the hotel, the accused accompanied her. She checked into room No 34. Ten minutes later, she left the hotel with the accused.
The next relevant evidence to which we should turn established, albeit inferentially as the accused was not identified, that at about 1am or 1.30am on 6 October 1985 the accused was seen in the company of the deceased waiting near the lift at the 21st floor of the building, at the foot of which the deceased was found dead about an hour later. Madam Chang Fong Thai, a housewife who lived in a flat on the 21st floor, said in evidence that at that time she had opened the door of her flat for two of her husband`s friends as they were leaving after playing mahjong with them. Outside her flat, she saw a young female Caucasian and a male Chinese standing near the lift. She did not identify the accused or the deceased. In cross-examination, counsel did not touch on the identity of the Caucasian lady nor that of the male Chinese. On being asked, this witness said that she did not pay attention as to whether there was anything unusual about the couple. She had closed the door of her flat as soon as she had let her two guests out. It should be noted that at the commencement of her cross-examination counsel for the accused established that this witness, after returning to her flat that Sunday morning, had heard a loud thud and that before hearing this loud thud she did not hear any screams nor any other kind of noises coming from outside her flat. Obviously, learned counsel for the defence was making the point that it was at least rather odd that if the deceased had been bundled over the parapet wall, held for a moment, however brief, and then dropped, as the prosecution asserted, how was it that the deceased did not scream at all.
The two guests of Madam Chang and her husband were Lim Lam San and Yeo Keih Hwa, both school teachers. Their evidence was that at about 1.30am that Sunday morning, they were leaving Madam Chang`s flat after a game of mahjong. They saw a young female Caucasian and a young male Chinese near the lift. When the lift came, all four of them went into the lift. They got off the lift at ground level and they went their separate ways. Lim elaborated that the couple in the lift were not holding hands. He did not notice their appearance. But the couple was not quarrelling and neither of them was crying. Yeo in cross-examination said that there was nothing unusual in the appearance of the couple. The shirt of the male Chinese was not crumpled nor was the dress of the Caucasian female who was neither sad nor angry.
A shop assistant, Lim Kim Ann, was sitting on a bench in front of Block 12 North Bridge Road from about 10.45pm on 5 October 1985. His back was facing the block of flats. At about 2am on 6 October 1985 he heard a `thud` coming from the block. A few moments later, the accused approached him and told him that someone had committed suicide. The accused asked him to call the police. He refused. He told the accused to call for the police himself from a public telephone. The accused went across the road and he followed him and saw him making the telephone call. Lim Kim Ann in elaboration of his evidence said that it was about five minutes after hearing the thud that the accused approached him. He said the accused looked excited. When cross-examined, he said that he did not hear any screams before he heard the thud. He said that at those small hours of the morning it was quite quiet in the vicinity of the block.
The telephone call made by the accused was received by Teresa Tan Kah Choo, a woman police constable. At about 2.07am on 6 October 1985 she received a call from one male who identified himself as Mr Lim. The caller spoke in English. The caller told her that there was a suicide case and that a lady was lying at the ground floor of Block 12, Crawford Street which was the other road near the block. The caller said the lady was a European. Teresa Tan then contacted the ambulance and the Operations Room, Beach Road Police Station. She recorded the message in the police message form. The text of the message was: `There is a suicide here. A lady is lying at the ground level.`
The first police officer at the scene was PC Yeo Hen Guan. He was a crew commander of a patrol car. At about 2.08am on 6 October 1985, he received a message from the Operations Room to go to the block. He was told to go and attend to `a case of fatal fall`. On arrival at North Bridge Road near the block, he met the accused who appeared nervous and frightened. From there, the accused led him to the second level canopy where he saw the deceased lying there in the position as shown in a photograph admitted and marked exh P4, photograph no 4. Then they took a lift to the 21st level and from there they proceeded to the 13th level after which they went to the 24th level. They then went down to the 22nd level. There the accused pointed to him a pair of white shoes lying side by side next to the parapet wall. PC Yeo then preserved the scene and telephoned for his duty officer to go to the scene. At about 3.20am AIO Ng Swee Eng arrived at the scene and he handed the investigations over to him. Subsequently, Sergeant Raymond Roy also arrived at the scene. In cross-examination, PC Yeo agreed that he did not tell the accused that he was detaining him but for all purposes the accused was detained. He said that he was told it was a suicide case and that he was looking for some evidence, such as a stool, which the deceased might have used to commit suicide. He said he came to the conclusion the accused was nervous and frightened because he looked pale and was panting. He said he did not question the accused as to why he was nervous or frightened. He also stated that he did not record his observation in his log-sheet the fact that the accused appeared nervous and frightened. The nervous and frightened demeanour of the accused, of course, could either reveal something sinister or shock by the fatal fall.
At about 2.35am on 6 October 1985 the ambulance officer, Lim Li Hua, arrived at the scene and examined the deceased. She found the deceased lying on her right side in a pool of blood at the edge of the canopy. Her ears and nose were bleeding. After examining the deceased, the ambulance officer pronounced her dead. The ambulance officer said that the deceased was lying in the position as shown in photograph exh P4. The next exhibit, exh P5, was a photograph which showed the deceased lying on her back. In cross-examination she said the deceased was not lying face up when she first saw her dead body.
Ng Swee Eng was an assistant investigation officer attached to the Beach Road Police Station. After being informed of a case of fatal fall at Block 12, North Bridge Road, he proceeded to the scene arriving there at about 2.50am. He met PC Yeo Hen Guan who was with the accused. AIO Ng proceeded to the 2nd level, Block 23. At the canopy of that level he saw the deceased lying in a pool of blood. The deceased had a leather pouch strapped on her left shoulder. He also noticed that she was not wearing any shoes and that the soles of her feet were dirty with black dust. AIO Ng said that the deceased was lying on her right side. He remembered that her right hand was lying below her shoulder level. At about 2.55am, he proceeded to the 22nd level with PC Yeo. He could not remember whether the accused was with him. There he found a pair of white laced shoes. AIO Ng turned over the body of the deceased before photograph exh P5 was taken. He said he just turned her over by touching her on her left shoulder. He did not touch her body below the waist. After police photographs were taken of the scene and the deceased, AIO Ng went to the 22nd level and seized a pair of white shoes. He examined the inside of the shoes and found they were clean and there was no dust. At the scene, he established the identity of the deceased as one Irene Louise Prinsen. AIO Ng then went on to say that he had a conversation with the accused. It was a short conversation which lasted between five to ten minutes. He asked him questions and he gave answers. The accused was quite hesitant in giving his answers. According to AIO Ng, the accused appeared restless and worried. At 3.20am, Sgt Raymond Roy arrived at the scene and he handed over the investigation to him. At 9am the same morning, AIO Ng identified the deceased to the State Coroner at the Singapore General Hospital mortuary.
At about 12pm the same day, AIO Ng again visited the scene. He was in the company of Prof Chao Tzee Cheng, the pathologist, Insp Lee Chee Chiew and other officers. At the 22nd level, AIO Ng found footprints on the inner and outer faces of the parapet wall. He also noticed some prints on the canopy of that level which appeared to him to be thumb prints. He said that the footprints on the outer face of the parapet wall showed that the toe were pointing downwards. Similarly, the footprints on the inner face of the parapet wall also showed that the toes were pointing downwards. In cross- examination, he said that it was Sgt Raymond Roy who first noticed the footprints.
In cross-examination, AIO Ng said that he tried to make enquiries from the occupants at the 21st, 22nd, 23rd and 24th levels. He did not succeed in interviewing any occupant. He suspected foul play because of the inconsistencies of the answers given by the accused. He said that neither he nor any of the officers recorded any statement or made any notes of any statement of the accused. We therefore did not have any details of the answers which would support the opinion of AIO Ng that the accused had given inconsistent answers. But he agreed that leaving aside the question of the alleged statements of the accused, he had no reason to suspect foul play. In cross-examination, AIO Ng said that he saw Prof Chao Tzee Cheng at the mortuary at about 10.45am that day. As directed by Prof Chao, he caused police photographs to be taken of the deceased lying on the mortuary slab. He said that Prof Chao examined the body of the deceased for about half an hour. Prof Chao told him that he suspected foul play and he requested to visit the scene. At the balcony of the 22nd floor he saw a footprint on the inner side of the parapet wall and another three footprints on the outer side of the wall. One of them was quite clear showing the toes pointing downwards.
On 6 October 1985, the accused was medically examined by Dr Naranjan Singh, the doctor of the prison hospital. He found no injury on the person of the accused.
Prof Chao carried out the autopsy at 9am on 7 October 1985. He drew a body diagram of the deceased which was admitted as exh P58a. He certified that the cause of death was multiple injuries. He found the deceased weighed 5,070g and was 160cm in height. There was dirt on the soles of both feet. Prof Chao took swabs of the fingernails of the deceased to find out if there had been any human skin or tissues beneath the fingernails and none were found. His examination of the pelvic region of the deceased revealed that the external genitalia did not show any evidence of trauma. The hymen showed serrated edge and was intact, admitting one finger only. There was no tear or bruise. The vaginal wall was normal. The smears taken were negative of spermatozoa. The anus was slightly lax with an old tear in the 10 o`clock Position. There was no evidence of penetration and the smear was negative for spermatozoa. The deceased therefore had died a virgin and was not sexually molested in any way.
In his autopsy report (exh P58), Prof Chao had described the external injuries in the following terms: 
 
Injuries consistent with fall:
 
 
 
1 Laceration 8 x 2cm at right shoulder with surrounding abrasion.
 
 
 
 
(2) Large patch of bruise at right upper arm 14 x 4cm. 
 
(3) Large patch of abrasion at right forearm 14 x 6cm with a laceration 6 x 5cm at the elbow and another laceration 1 cm at the wrist. There were fractures of the upper and lower ends of the right radius and ulna. 
 
(4) Lacerations at the right palm with fracture of the metacarpals. 
 
(5) Bruise at the back of both hands. 
 
(6) Abrasion 3 x 2cm at the right hip region. 
 
(7) A laceration on the left hip region 2.5cm with some abrasions around. 
 
(8) Small abrasions at left inguinal region. 
 
(9) Laceration at the inner side of the right upper thigh. 
 
(10) A long linear bruise with blanched centre and erthyematous margins running from the right buttock down the posterior surface of the right thigh and leg consistent with hitting a long object such as railing. 
 
(11) Abrasions were present in both ankles. 
 
(12) Laceration at left popliteal fossa.
  
 
 
Injuries not consistent with fall:
 
 
 
13 Bruise around right eye lid with conjunctive haemorrhage in the right sclera consistent with being hit such as a blow by fist.
(14) Bruise at the left chest region consistent with a blow. 
(15) An oblique linear bruise with blanched centre and erythematous margins 18 x 3cm in the lower abdomen with a linear abrasion on the right side 7 x 1 cm consistent with pressing against an edge. 
(16) Round and oval shaped bruises on both thighs and legs consistent with finger tip pressure marks. 
(17) A row of small abrasions on the left toes consistent with rubbing against a rough surface. 
(18) Bruises on the palmer side of both hands consistent with grappling some object very tightly.
 
 
 
The above classification did not stand up to closer scrutiny. Prof Chao upon cross-examination conceded that three injuries which were numbered 15, 17 and 18 could have been caused by the deceased climbing over the parapet wall. In relation to injury No 16, which were oval shaped bruises and which the professor said could have been caused by finger pressure applied shortly before death, the professor again conceded that such injuries could have been caused by police attendants who had to carry the body of the deceased at and from the canopy of the second level where the body was found over the parapet wall at that level and from there down the flight of steps to the ground floor. We refer to injury No 14, the bruise at the left chest region which the professor in evidence identified as being below the left clavicle and which he opined in evidence as consistent with having been caused by a blow of the fist. The body chart (exh P58a) drawn by the professor clearly showed that this injury was below the left nipple and not beneath the left clavicle. Learned counsel pointed out that the overhang of the left breast would have been in the way of any blow by the fist to which the professor observed that the injury could have been caused if the blow was `properly directed`. However, on being asked if the injury could have been caused by the deceased knocking into a wall, the professor commented that the breast would have been in the way.
We turn to injury No 13, the bruise around the right eye lid with conjunctival haemorrhage which the professor had ventured the opinion that this was consistent with a blow from the fist. The suggestion was obvious that the deceased was assaulted in the right eye before she fell. However, the opinion of Prof Chao on the cause of this injury did not survive cross-examination. Aided by an expert opinion, learned counsel for the defence asked Prof Chao who agreed that the injury could have been caused by blood seeping through to the eyelids as a result of the fracture at the base of the skull. Learned counsel then referred to the railings at the canopy which were about 6m from the line of the parapet walls in the block of flats, the fact that the deceased had landed on the canopy very close to the railings and that the deceased had sustained injury on the right side of her leg. On being asked Prof Chao agreed that injury No 13 could have been sustained as a result of a second fall. In dealing with all six injuries learned counsel pointed out to us that at the preliminary inquiry, Prof Chao had stated that injury Nos 13 to 18 `included injuries caused by blows, fingertip pressures and marks consistent with pressing against an edge and bruises on the palm on both hands consistent with grappling some object very tightly` and that `(t)hese were consistent with some forms of struggle prior to the fall`. In examination-in-chief, to questions by the learned deputy public prosecutor, Prof Chao had said he did not know if one could say that there was a struggle: `How would I know that she was struggling?` But on being confronted with what he had said at the preliminary inquiry, the professor changed his opinion and stuck by his evidence given at the preliminary inquiry. Learned counsel for the defence therefore submitted that Prof Chao`s opinion on the issue whether there was a struggle was wholly unreliable.
Prof Chao had also given his opinion as to how the deceased had fallen from the 22nd level. The first version was this: the deceased was seated on the parapet wall, made the footprints and fell. The second version was that she was held outside the parapet wall by someone and then pushed by that person. The third postulation was that she was outside the parapet wall without being held by any person and in that situation the deceased could have made the footprints found at the outer wall. As it later emerged in the cross-examination, the third postulation was identical to the postulation of the defence which was represented by a diagram (exh D9) drawn of the deceased when she made the footprints shortly before the fall. Dr Facey had observed that the footprints were found at 0.7m from the top of the wall and it was clear on the measurements that a person of the height of the deceased could not have been seated on the wall and made the footprints on the outer wall. So Prof Chao was constrained to withdraw his first version. We now refer to the third version and in giving the third version we had observed that the professor had given a demonstration of a person outside the wall with two hands stretched behind and gripping the top of the parapet wall. Prof Chao had thought that this was one probable version as to how the deceased had come to be outside the parapet wall, without the aid of any other party. But on learning that the defence was making the same postulation Prof Chao attempted to express some reservations about that version which was, originally, one of and the last of his three versions.
The state of the prosecution evidence relating to the question as to how the deceased had fallen was this. There were Prof Chao`s two surviving versions, namely, that someone held the deceased outside the parapet wall or she had held herself outside the outer wall. If the first version was the only version, obviously the accused would have had a case to answer as the irresistible inference was that he was the only person in the company of the deceased at the time and that he must have been the person, subject to any defence that might be raised. If the evidence was that the deceased could have held herself outside the wall and made the prints before she fell, then there would be no case for the accused to meet. In that situation, the accused did not cause the death of the deceased.
We would now summarize Dr Facey`s evidence. He was sent the footprints made on the outer wall and the prints from the left foot of the deceased. He said that examining the prints alone and taking no other evidence into account there were sufficient matching details that he was driven to the conclusion that the footprints found on the outer wall were made by the deceased. However, he carefully pointed that the footprints lifted from the outer wall were not so clear and that he was unable to say conclusively that looking at them alone those footprints were made by the left foot of the deceased. In the light of other evidence, such as the fact that the deceased had fallen from outside that parapet wall at that particular time when shortly thereafter the footprints were lifted, we were satisfied that there was credible evidence that the footprints were indeed made by the left foot of the deceased. Dr Facey in his evidence has postulated three parameters, namely, first, that the deceased was facing outwards of the parapet wall, otherwise the toes could not have been pointing downwards; secondly, taking into account the measurements of limbs of the deceased and the third parameter, the waist of the deceased must have been below the top of the parapet wall when the footprints were made; and thirdly, the feet of the deceased must have been 0.7m from the top of the parapet wall. Finally, Dr Facey told us in evidence that the footprints were entirely consistent with having been made by the deceased when she was held outside the parapet wall by someone or having been made by the deceased who held herself outside the parapet wall as postulated in exh D9 by learned counsel for the defence who had prepared it with the assistance of an expert. He said both versions were equally probable on the evidence. To the question which of the two versions would be more probable Dr Facey said, `I can`t comment`. He explained that he could not comment because it involved `too many variables and matters be yond my expertise`.
It remains for us to deal with the alleged oral and written statements which were allegedly made by the accused to the police. The learned deputy public prosecutor sought to admit three oral statements and two written statements allegedly made by the accused. Their admissibility were objected on the grounds that they were not statements made by him or they were not voluntarily made by him. The voir dire lasted 17 days. At its conclusion, we did not admit any of the five statements. We gave our reasons which we now reproduce: 
 
The first oral statement:
 
 
 
This was allegedly made on 6 October 1985 between 3.40am and 5.45am by the accused to Sgt Raymond Roy. It was not given in evidence at the preliminary inquiry. Almost three years later, and on the 11th day of this trial on 4 October 1988 the oral statement was reduced into two and a half pages by the prosecution who on the second day of the voir dire gave notice of the same under s 188(3) of the CPC. The reliability and accuracy of the oral statement depended entirely on the memory of Sgt Roy; there was no record of it anywhere. We are not satisfied that the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that it was the statement made by the accused, seeing that the prosecution itself has described the two and a half page record as `the gist` of what the accused had allegedly said at the scene and in the light of the evidence which we have heard.
 
 
 
The second oral statement:
 
 
 
This was allegedly made to Sgt Roy and Inspector Lee on 6 October 1985 between 5.40am and 7.40am at the Beach Road Police Station. The prosecution has pointed out that it is not seeking to admit this statement as the accused might be tired, might be confused.
 
 
 
The third oral statement:
 
 
 
This was allegedly made by the accused to Sgt Roy and Inspector Lee on 7 October 1985 at about 5.15pm when the accused was brought back to the scene the afternoon following the incident. It was recorded in exhs D2 and D 11, the investigation diary of Sgt Roy and the investigation diary of AIO Ng Swee Eng respectively. The accused was asked about the events leading to the death of the deceased, after he had undergone two periods of interrogation of about six to seven hours each. We are satisfied that he was tired and confused. In any case, the accused did not incriminate himself, even in regard to the charge under s 304A Penal Code, causing death by a rash act, which was the only charge he was facing.
 
 
 
The fourth statement (written) taken between 7.50am, 7 October 1985 and 3.10am on 8 October 1985:
 
 
 
This was taken during an 18-hour interrogation, with an hour`s break. It was taken during the fourth night in a row in which the accused did not have any adequate sleep. The charge the accused was facing was one under s 304A Penal Code. We are satisfied that the accused had spoken, after the police had rejected his earlier versions, and had spoken when he would not have otherwise. He mentioned attempted strangulation until the deceased was semiconscious, in respect of which there was no forensic evidence of any marks around the neck of the deceased which would have been present if the incident had happened. Similarly, his alleged punches on the face of the deceased left no evidence except for a punch on the right eye of the deceased. We are aware that in a voir dire we are not to inquire into the truthfulness or otherwise of statements made but we infer that these statements, contradicted as it could not be disputed by hard forensic evidence, were made in circumstances where there was oppression.
 
 
 
The fifth statement (written) made on 14 October 1985:
 
 
 
It was made after protracted CID interrogation. It was a reiteration of what the accused had said in his earlier written statement except for three matters which were brought up in the course of the CID interrogation. It followed the accused`s s 122(6) statement given in response to the murder charge in which the accused had withdrawn his previous written statement and proclaimed his innocence. We do not accept Sgt Roy`s evidence that this statement (exh P64 for identification) was recorded as he merely wanted clarification about the brown substances which had been recovered from the person of the accused. We are satisfied that the threat of further interrogation induced the accused to make this statement.
 
 
 
Formal evidence was led after we had ruled on the admissibility of the five statements. These were followed by submissions by learned counsel for the defence that there was no case to answer and by the learned deputy public prosecutor that defence should be called. In view of the evidence led and the reasons which we had given, we decided not to call upon the accused to enter upon his defence and we, accordingly, acquitted him of the charge of murder.

This is an appeal by the defendants against the decision of the senior assistant registrar giving leave to the plaintiffs to enter judgment in the sum of US$135,370.25 for loss and damage suffered by the plaintiffs, and interest thereon.
The loss and damage occurred in the following circumstances: the plaintiffs had contracted to buy 45,455 cartons of black tea from a company called Africom Trading Pte Ltd (Africom) to be shipped from Singapore to Port Sudan at the price of US$500,000. The plaintiffs` bankers, The Blue Nile Bank Ltd, opened a confirmed irrevocable letter of credit which allowed partial shipments and required, inter alia, a full set of `clean on board` bills of lading to the order of The Blue Nile Bank and the plaintiffs as the party to be notified. In November and December 1987, the defendants issued three sets of bills of lading purportedly evidencing three shipments of 8,960, 2,800 and 7,280 cartons of black tea. The said bills were, in November/December 1978, negotiated by Africom under the letter of credit with a bank in Singapore for the total amount of US$209,249.60. No tea was in fact shipped on board the named vessels. Instead, the plaintiffs received a shipment of 6,720 cartons of black tea from another vessel in March 1988 to the value of US$73,897.60. The plaintiffs have, in this action, given due allowance for this value.
This action was commenced on 12 January 1989. The plaintiffs` causes of action, as pleaded in the alternative in the statement of claim, are set out in paras 7,11, 12 and 15. They read as follows: 
 
7 The defendants at the time when they issued or caused to be issued the said first, second and third bills of lading knew and/or ought to have known that the said representations contained therein were untrue and/or were made recklessly not caring whether they were true or false.
 
 
 
 
(11) Further and/or alternatively, at the time when the said representations were made, the defendants well knew or ought to have known that the plaintiffs would rely on the said representations and would be induced thereby to accept the said first, second and third bill of lading under the said letter of credit. 
 
(12) In the premises, the defendants were under a duty to take care in the making the representations. 
 
(15) In breach of the said duty, the defendants were negligent in making the representations.
  
 
 
The defendants filed a defence on 23 February 1989 in which they pleaded, inter alia, that the three bills of lading were fraudulently issued by one Alfred Tay, their employee, without their consent or authority. Accordingly, they denied making any representations by the bills of lading. Further, they alleged that the issuing bank acted negligently in accepting the bills of lading contrary to art 26(c)(iv) of the Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits 1983.
By reason of the admission of the defendants that their manager had fraudulently issued the three bills of lading, the plaintiffs applied for summary judgment on 1 June 1989 on the ground that there was no defence to the claim. The plaintiffs succeeded in obtaining judgment before the senior assistant registrar.
In this appeal, counsel for the defendants has raised a procedural issue in addition to the matters raised in the defence. He contends that the plaintiffs` primary claim is based on an allegation of fraud, ie that of Alfred Tay in issuing the bills of lading for which there were no goods, and that the plaintiffs are precluded by the terms of 0 14 r 1(2)(b) from applying for summary judgment. On the substantive defences, counsel also contends that 
 Grant v Norway 
(1851) 10 CB 665 is a defence to the plaintiffs` claim based on the fraud of Alfred Tay which the defendants readily admitted. By implication, the defendants were also denying the plaintiffs` alternative claim based on negligent representation. On the same issue, counsel also contends that the defendants had no dealing with the plaintiffs and therefore could not have induced them to accept the three bills of lading. The final submission is that the defendants are not liable as the loss was caused by the negligence of the issuing bank in accepting the bills of lading.
 Order 14 jurisdiction - `fraud` 
The first issue is whether the claim is based on an allegation of fraud in terms of O 14 r 1(2)(b) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970. Order 14, so far as relevant, provides as follows: 
 
1(1) Where in an action to which this Rule applies a statement of claim has been served on a defendant and that defendant has entered an appearance in the action, the plaintiff may, on the ground that the defendant has no defence to a claim included in the writ, or to a particular part of such a claim, or has no defence to such a claim or part except as to the amount of any damages claimed, apply to the Court for judgment against that defendant.
 
 
 
Counsel for the plaintiffs made two points on this issue. The first is that the plaintiffs` claim is not based on an allegation of fraud. The second is that it is not based on an allegation but on the admitted fact of fraud.
It is established law that the expression `fraud` means fraud in the technical sense as used in 
 Derry v Peek 
(1889) 14 App Cas 337
, ie the tort of deceit: see 
 Barclays Bank Ltd v Cole 
 
[1967] 2 QB 738
 and 
 Newton Chemical Ltd v Arsenis 
[1989] 1 WLR 1297
. In the 
 Barclays Bank 
case, the Court of Appeal held that robbery was not fraud. Lord Denning MR at p 744 said: 
 
... in law `fraud` is proved when it is shown that a false representation has been made knowingly or without belief in its truth or recklessly, careless whether it be true or false: see 
 Derry v Peek
 
(1889) 14 App Cas 337
, 374, per Lord Herschell. In any case, `fraud` involves a false representation.
 
 
 
In regard to this first point, counsel has contended that the plaintiffs` claim is based on breach of contract and/or negligence on the part of the defendants in relation to the issue of the three bills of lading. In my view, this is not strictly correct. There is nothing in the statement of claim which pleads a breach of contract. Paragraph 7 of the statement of claim contains a succinct statement of the tort of deceit. Not only does the allegation contain the essential ingredients of that kind of fraud, it contains no other constituent elements which establish a separate and different cause of action on which the plaintiffs rely. The defendants` answer to para 7 of the statement of claim as set out in the defence is a bare denial, but the basis of that denial is found in para 4 of the defence which states, inter alia, that: 
 
The said bills of lading were issued by one Alfred Tay, an employee of the defendants, acting fraudulently for his own rather than the defendants` benefit and without the knowledge, consent, instructions, or authority of the defendants. In doing so, he was acting outside the scope of his employment. In the premises, the defendants are not responsible for any representations made by the issue of the said bills of lading.
 
 
 
 
 
 ` 
 
 
 
 
 
 Allegation` 
 
 
 
With regard to the second point, counsel for the plaintiffs has contended that the claim is not based on an allegation of fraud in terms of the particular rule as the defendants have admitted, for the purpose of the defence, the fraud of their employee. Counsel for the plaintiffs contends that r 1(2)(b) of O 14 should be construed restrictively, for the reasons following, so as not to apply to a case where the defendants have admitted fraud before the application for summary judgment:
 
 
(a) the courts have construed the expression `fraud` in the rule restrictively; 
 
(b) even though the rule was introduced in England because a party charged with `fraud` was entitled to trial by jury under s 6(1) of the Administration of Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1933 (Cap 36), the Court of Appeal in 
 Arsenis 
has criticized its anomalous status: it is even more anomalous in the context of Singapore as we have no trial by jury; 
 
(c) the word `allegation` means an unproved statement or assertion, and here, the assertion has been proved.
  
 
 
I agree entirely with counsel`s submission that the sub- rule is not only anomalous in Singapore but also that it serves no purpose whatever as we have no trial by jury. The sub-rule should be abrogated. However, it exists in a form which has meaning and to which it is the duty of the court to give effect. Reading rr 1 and 2 together, the sub-rule precludes an application for summary judgment where the action includes a claim based on an allegation of fraud. This would ordinarily mean the action when commenced. Having regard to para 7 of the statement of claim, I have no doubt that this action, when commenced, is based on an allegation of fraud. Once this precondition is satisfied, the preclusionary effect of the sub-rule operates. If the defendants had not filed their defence, the plaintiffs would not have been able to contend that fraud had been admitted, and they would not have been able to apply for summary judgment. The meaning of the sub-rule cannot change because the defendants chose to file their defence. The preclusive condition is the allegation of fraud, and not the admission of fraud.
The word `allegation` in the sub-rule bears the ordinary meaning of a statement that one undertakes to prove, and, of course, in the present case, if the matter were to go for trial, the plaintiffs would seek to prove the truth of the allegation of fraud by relying on the admission of the defendants. But, the mere assertion of fraud is not its own proof even though the plaintiffs have in their possession the proof. In this sense, and because of the adversarial nature of the proceedings, every action by a plaintiff must, on the pleadings, start with assertions of fact upon which the liability of a defendant is founded. They are in the nature of allegations. Even if the defendants had, prior to the plaintiffs commencing this action, admitted the fraud of Alfred Tay, the plaintiffs could only have pleaded that the defendants had admitted the fraud of their servant, but until the defendants had put in their defence or filed their affidavit, the pleading would remain as an allegation. In my view, the claim is still, at that point of time, based on an allegation of fraud.
Accordingly, notwithstanding the force of the plaintiffs` arguments, I am constrained by the clear words of the sub-rule to hold that the plaintiffs` claim is based on an allegation of fraud and that they are precluded from applying for summary judgment. I can see no injustice to the plaintiffs in denying them the right to apply for summary judgment. They could have applied for judgment on the ground that the defence did not disclose a defence in law in that the defendants were liable for the fraud of their servant, 
 Grant v Norway 
 notwithstanding. They chose not to do so. Moreover, this judgment does not prevent them from doing so on that basis.
In the circumstances, although counsel for the plaintiffs have urged me to state my views on
 Grant v Norway 
 on the ground that I have heard full arguments on it, I decline to do so. The reason is that the plaintiffs have the choice of appealing against my decision or making a fresh application for judgment on the ground that the defence does not disclose a defence. I believe they are more likely to take the latter course. They may, of course, take both courses and I believe the probability of their taking the latter course is higher than in respect of the former course. It is not desirable that in these circumstances that I should say anything which may be prejudicial to either party.
 Alternative claim 
Counsel for the plaintiffs has also contended that the plaintiffs are entitled to succeed on their alternative claim based on negligent misstatement. The contention is that the defendants owe a duty of care not to make any misstatements in their bills of lading to persons whom they know or ought to know will rely on them, that the plaintiffs as the consignees named in the bills of lading are such persons that the defendants` employee breached the duty negligently, and that the defendants relied on the said bills and suffered a loss. I agree with this proposition of law: see 
 Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd 
 
[1964] AC 465
; 
 Lawton v BOC Transhield Ltd 
 [1987] 2 All ER 608. However, the difficulty here is that the defendants have, by implication, denied any negligent breach by pleading a wilful breach. A wilful act is not a negligent act.
Counsel for the plaintiffs seeks to overcome this difficulty by relying on the judgment of the Court of Appeal in 
 Arsenis 
. In that case, the said plaintiffs (Newton) claimed the repayment of commission and bonus commission paid by them to the defendant (Arsenis), who was their self-employed sales representatives, on sales orders fabricated by Arsenis. Newton`s causes of action were founded on breach of contract and fiduciary duty and negligence. Newton applied for summary judgment and Arsenis pleaded that the claim was based on an allegation of fraud. The Court of Appeal, whilst agreeing that an allegation of fraud could be made without actually using the word `fraud` in the pleading, held that although Newton`s averments contained all the essential ingredients of a 
 Derry v Peek 
fraud, Newton had expressly chosen to found their action on breach of contract and fiduciary duty and negligence and not fraud, and to succeed with the claims as pleaded, Newton did not have to prove that Arsenis had acted dishonestly, and that accordingly, Newton was entitled to apply for and to obtain summary judgment.
Nicholls LJ analysed the issues (at p 1302) as follows: 
 
Order 14 r 1(2)(b) is directed at actions in which a plaintiff has chosen to put forward a claim founded on Derry v Peek fraud. Derry v Peek fraud founds entitlement to damages: the tort of deceit. It can also found a claim for rescission of a transaction brought about by such fraud. In the present case the plaintiffs have set up, as the causes of action on which alone they seek their relief, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, and breach of a duty of care. In other words, their claims are not based on an allegation of 
 Derry v Peek
 fraud. Their claims under para 6(8) are based exclusively on contract, fiduciary duty and negligence. To the extent that in this case these claims include an allegation of misrepresentations by the defendant, these claims contain one of the essential ingredients of 
 Derry v Peek
 fraud. But although there is this common feature, the constituent elements of the plaintiffs` chosen causes of action and the constituent elements of 
 Derry v Peek
 are not strictly the same. On the one hand, the causes of action relied on by the plaintiffs include ingredients not present in 
 Derry v Peek
 fraud. To succeed in their claim for damages for breach of contract in respect of payment of commission, the plaintiffs have to establish the existence of a contract containing an implied term that the defendant would not claim commission except on sales actually effected. Likewise with the claim for breach of fiduciary duty: to succeed, the plaintiffs have to establish the existence of a fiduciary duty not to claim commission save on actual sales. Again with the negligence claim: the plaintiffs have to prove the existence of a duty to exercise reasonable care in making claims for commission. On the other hand, and importantly, unlike with 
 Derry v Peek
 fraud, in order to succeed with their claims for repayment of commission it will not be necessary, as a matter of strict law, for the plaintiffs to prove that the defendant put forward claims which to his knowledge were not true. 
 Strictly, on the pleaded
 causes of action it will be sufficient if the plaintiffs prove that,
 however the claims came to be made, they were not supported by
 actual orders
. The plaintiffs` claim would include instances where the defendant honestly but mistakenly thought that the chemist had punched through the order on his computer terminal as well as instances where the defendant knew that no order had been transmitted. A similar analysis is equally appropriate to the claims under para 6(9) in respect of expenses. (My emphasis.)
 
 
 
Counsel for the plaintiffs relied on the emphasized statement of Nicholls LJ as authority for the proposition that on the pleaded cause of action in the present case, ie negligent misstatement, it is sufficient if the plaintiffs prove, as they have done, that the bills of lading were not supported by any goods. I am not persuaded. In my view, the statement of the law of Nicholls LJ cannot be applied to the facts of the present case. In 
 Arsenis 
, it did not matter how Arsenis pleaded his defence as he was not entitled to the commissions he had received because they were not supported by actual sales. He was liable to repay them to the said plaintiffs (i) in contract, on the ground of breach of an implied term or (ii) on the ground of breach of fiduciary duty arising from his relationship with the plaintiffs or (iii) on the ground of negligence, that if he had not claimed the commissions fraudulently, he must have claimed them honestly but mistakenly. It should also be noted that Arsenis did not plead by way of defence that he made his claims fraudulently. He could not simply because that would not have provided him with any defence. Naturally, he decided to deny, and denied all the allegations against him, which allegations included all the ingredients of 
 Derry v Peek 
 fraud. Arsenis was liable whether he was fraudulent or negligent. But it is obvious he cannot be liable both for fraud or negligence at the same time.
In the present case, however, the plaintiffs are faced with a rather different situation where they are not able to rely on any other cause of action on which they can succeed in an application of summary judgment if the defendants can show that there is a triable issue on the claim based on negligence. By denying negligence, the defendants have raised a triable issue. They, of course, have gone further than merely denying negligence. They have positively alleged fraud on the part of their own freight manager. On this plea, I am unable to see how the plaintiffs can succeed by showing that the three bills of lading were not supported by goods, which fact has been admitted by the defendant. If they succeed at all at this stage, it is on the basis that the defendants were liable for the fraudulent acts of their servant and not on the ground that the defendants were liable for the negligence of their servant. Whether or not Alfred Tay was, in actual fact, negligent or fraudulent, is irrelevant at this stage of the proceedings as the defendants are entitled to plead any defence available to them. 
 Grant v Norway 
, on the face of it, provides a defence in law. If 
 Grant v Norway 
is good law in Singapore and is applicable to the facts as alleged by the defendants, it provides a complete defence to the action. If the defendants are not liable for the fraud of their servant they cannot, rationally, be liable for his negligence.
Accordingly, the plaintiffs must, at this stage of the proceedings, fail on the alternative claim on the evidence before me. The appeal is allowed with costs. The defendants are entitled to unconditional leave to defend on the alternative claim based on negligent misstatement.

The accused, Chia Chee Yeen, is charged before us on the following charge: 
 
You, Chia Chee Yeen, m 19 years
 
 
 
NRIC No 1798906/F,
 
 
 
are charged, that you, on or about 17 July 1987, at about 10.35am at Provost Unit, Mowbray Camp, Ulu Pandan Road, Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Daniel De Rozario, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under section 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The accused was at the relevant time a national serviceman holding the rank of lance corporal (LCP) and performing the duty of an armskoteman at the armoury of the HQ Company, Singapore Armed Forces Provost Unit (`SAFPU`). The deceased, Daniel De Rozario was, at the time of his death, a staff sergeant holding the post of a company sergeant major (CSM) at SAFPU. The section in SAFPU to which he belonged was known departmentally as `S4`.
 Prosecution`s case 
The evidence led by the prosecution shows that on 12 July 1987, the accused and two others, LCP Ang Cheng Kam and LCP Mok Weng Yeong, were required to perform an assignment as a punishment for offences which each of them had committed. Their assignment was to clean an area around the ammo dump (ammunition store). They carried out this duty between the hours of 7.55am to 2pm.
On 13 July 1987, the CSM, Daniel De Rozario, inspected the area cleaned by the three men. He found that it was not satisfactorily done and decided to make the three clean the area again in the next few days. The accused and LCP Ang were given orders so to do. They returned to the ammo dump and divided the area into three sections so that each punished person would clean a respective part. Both LCP Ang and the accused started cleaning the area but the accused seemed to be unhappy as LCP Mok appeared to have escaped having to clean the area again as he was not around.
On 14 July 1987, following a phone call made by the accused to LCP Mok, the latter came to LCP Ang`s office and he was told of the repeat cleaning job. However, LCP Mok said that as he was engaged in other duties, he would not be able to join them in undertaking the same. LCP Ang returned to the area and continued with his work. The accused, however, was not keen in carrying on with the cleaning and told LCP Ang that he preferred guard duties rather than cleaning the area. He also told LCP Ang to stop work and accept whatever punishment the CSM might mete out. LCP Ang did not listen to the accused and continued with his work and completed his portion of the area on the afternoon of 15 July 1987.
On 16 July 1987, the CSM checked the area around the ammo dump and asked LCP Ang why was it that only certain parts were cleaned. LCP Ang told the CSM that LCP Mok was not around to do his share and that the accused was not interested in cleaning. LCP Ang also told the CSM that the accused had asked him not to do the cleaning. The CSM instructed LCP Ang to see him the next morning.
On 17 July 1987 at about 9am, LCP Ang went to the CSM`s office as instructed. The accused was already there with the CSM. The CSM scolded the accused for not obeying orders. However, the CSM told LCP Ang that he could leave the office as he was satisfied with his work. The CSM awarded two sets of six-weekend punishment against the accused, one for not carrying out instructions to do the cleaning and the other for instigating others to disobey orders.
At about 10am, the accused returned to the armoury and the armourer, LCP Chan Wai Seng (PW5) asked him what happened and he replied, `Nothing.` The accused`s face showed no expression. He walked about in the armoury. Fifteen minutes later, the accused told PW5 that he was going to the ammo dump to do a stock-check. He took the keys from the drawer and left. About ten minutes later the accused returned and placed the keys in the drawer. Not long after, the accused told PW5 that he was leaving for his CTSS exercise. The accused was seen leaving with an M-16 rifle slung over his right shoulder. It had no bayonet attached. He was also wearing his skeleton battle order (`SBO`).
The accused came to see the CSM at his office. They had a conversation and at a certain point the CSM was heard to have told the accused, `I don`t want to talk to you any more.` The CSM came out of his room and asked Zainodin bin lbrahim (PW8) about his pay slip. The CSM then went to a cupboard near the door of the general office. Then the accused was heard to call out the name of the CSM. The muzzle of the rifle, which was slung over his right shoulder, was pointing downwards. He was mumbling something. Suddenly there was a loud gun-shot sound followed by the accused running quickly out of the general office.
The CSM`s body was found lying supine on the floor with his head pointing towards the direction of the door. Blood splashed all over the place. The top part of his skull was blown off and his brain was dislodged and was seen on the floor.
K Baskaran (PW14) and Muthiah Gunalan (PW15), whose office was next door, heard a loud explosion and they ran out to investigate. They saw the accused coming out of the office of S4 and, according to PW14, the accused jumped out of the door-way, walked a few steps and then started to run along the corridor by the side of the cook-house cum canteen. PW15 said that when the accused came out of the door-way, he was holding an M-16 rifle with both his hands in a high port position. He saw smoke from the rifle. PW14 and PW15 chased the accused.
PW14 gave up the chase after a short distance because he had a pain in his back. PW15 was joined by Kiang (PW16). Half way down the road, the accused turned around and pointed the rifle he was holding in the direction of his pursuers. As a result, PW15 and PW16 took cover and squatted down. The accused continued to run.
Near the car park of the Special Investigation Branch (SIB) which is just about 10 to 20m from the main gate, the accused stopped running and pointed the rifle at himself. Two to three shots rang out. The accused collapsed on to the ground. The accused was groaning and muttering words in Mandarin to the effect that, `I cannot take it. I cannot take it. I am sorry for my parents. I want to die.` The accused`s uniform on the right side was torn. Subsequently, a group of officers arrived. They unbuttoned his shirt and they noticed that he had abrasions below his left nipple and they carried the accused to the office of the officer-in-charge, SIB.
A short while later a medical officer, Dr Daniel Sim (PW23), arrived at the SIB office. On examining the accused, he found that he had superficial abrasions over the left chest. There were no other injuries. He did not think there was any need to prescribe any treatment. The accused was conscious when he was examined by Dr Sim though he did not respond to questions or instructions given. Neither did Dr Sim detect any traces of alcohol or glue. However, the accused did keep on mumbling to himself repeatedly in Mandarin, `I cannot take it. I cannot take it.`
The following ammunition was recovered from the accused`s shirt and trouser pockets, ie 20-round type magazine with nine live rounds of 5.56mm bullets inside; 30 live rounds of 5.56mm bullets and 40 live rounds of 0.38in bullets. At about 3pm the same day, the investigating officer from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID), Insp Ng Chee Kok, directed that the accused be placed under arrest and he was brought back to the CID. A statement was recorded from the accused from 5.25pm to 8.15pm. Both the Inspector and the interpreter who was present at the recording of the statement, testified that the accused gave the statement voluntarily.
The accused did not challenge the voluntariness of the statement. However, his counsel raised the point that the notice of warning given by the investigating officer immediately prior to the commencement of the recording of the statement was defective. Under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), before a statement is taken, it is required that the accused should be served with a notice in writing and which shall be explained to him to the following effect: 
 
You have been charged with/informed that you may be prosecuted for - ...
 
 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge? If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now, and you would like it written down, this will be done.
 
 
 
However, the actual wording used by the inspector was `you have been charged with that you may be prosecuted for`. Counsel for the accused made the point that for a statement to be admissible under that provision the person must have been charged with the offence or has been officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it. He submitted that the wording used by the investigating officer is obscure as it sought to combine the two alternative situations into one. He said that this is a defect which renders the whole statement inadmissible. Having considered the matter and for the reasons which we gave after hearing both counsel, we rejected the submission of the defence that the statement was inadmissible. We were satisfied that the statement given by the accused was voluntarily made without any inducement, threat or promise. We were satisfied that the accused was not misled by slight deviation in the wording of the notice read to him. We accordingly admitted in evidence the statement of the accused.
The evidence of the prosecution`s witnesses shows that the accused was, at worst, an `ordinary national serviceman`, and at best, a `good national serviceman`. His commanding officer, Captain Lim (PW13), said that he had not given any major disciplinary problems. All the witnesses from the Armed Forces knew him only in the course of work and their impression of him is that he was generally a friendly person. Several said that he carried out the duties of an armskoteman well. Some said that he was shy and reserved. He admired or adored actors and actresses and his primary hobby seems to be to take photographs with his idols, that is, actors and actresses, so much so that he had a number of albums where he collected these photographs and had these albums passed round his office for his colleagues to look at. None of them said that he was an aggressive person. They were all surprised at what the accused had done to the CSM.
 Section 122(6) statement 
In his s 122(6) statement, the accused recounted the events which were broadly in line with what were said by the witnesses for the prosecution. He said he was very unhappy with the punishments that the CSM meted out to him on the morning of 17 July 1987. Though reluctant, he signed the Register of Informal Punishments. He left the office of the CSM in a most unhappy state. This was what the accused said in his statement: 
 
I left the office and kept thinking about the matter everywhere I went. I went to the canteen and took some food. The more I thought over the matter, the more I thought I was victimized. I was extremely unhappy over the punishments meted out to me. I was so infuriated. I decided that I should shoot him to death and kill myself later.
 
 
 
In his statement the accused further said that he then went to the armoury and to the ammunition dump where he took out his M-16 rifle and two revolvers together with 50 rounds of 5.56 bullets for the rifle and 40 rounds of the 0.38 bullets for the revolver. He was then dressed in the skeleton battle order as he was due to go for a CTSS exercise that afternoon. He explained why he took the .38mm bullets and the revolvers as follows: 
 
I drew the .38mm bullets and the two Smith & Wesson revolvers because I imagined myself to be the killer like one of those featured in the TV show entitled `The Bund`. I took the tucked revolvers in my waist covered by my shirt. I do not know why. The reason for (tucking) the two revolvers in my waist was that it was exactly the way in which one of the killers did in the TV show entitled `The Bund`.
 
 
 
Counsel for the accused took great pains to elicit from the investigating officer, Ng Chee Kok (PW24), the meaning of the sentence `I do not know where I fired the shot, from his front or his back or some other directions` that appears in another part of the statement. Counsel suggested that this sentence is bad and that the word `from` should really be `at`. PW24 insisted that he recorded what was said by the accused through the interpreter. He said if the word `at` were substituted for the word `from` then the meaning of the sentence would be different. The interpreter, Loh Kok Lin (PW25), in his evidence said that what he did was a literal translation of what the accused told him. His understanding of this sentence is that it merely indicates the direction of the accused viz-a-viz the CSM. In other words, the accused was not sure whether at that point the CSM was facing him or whether the CSM`s back was towards him or if some other part of the body of the CSM was facing him. We accept that that is the correct meaning of that sentence and the one the accused intended to convey.
At the close of the prosecution`s case, counsel for the accused did not make any submission of no case to answer. The court being satisfied that a prima facie case was made out against the accused on the charge, called for the defence. The two courses were explained to the accused and he elected to give evidence on oath.
 Defence case 
In his evidence, the accused did not deny that he shot the CSM. According to him, on 17 July 1987, he went to see the CSM at the latter`s office. The CSM was angry with the accused for not carrying out properly the assignment (area cleaning) as a punishment. The CSM also spoke angrily to the accused in Hokkien, `recently you have been very smart, asking other people not to obey my order`. The CSM awarded against the accused two sets of six weekend confinements as punishment; the first was for not carrying out the cleaning and the second for instigating LCP Ang not to obey orders. As the accused was due to go for his CTSS exercise that afternoon, the CSM asked the accused to see him again before the latter went for his exercise.
Following this rebuke by the CSM, the accused felt that he had been wronged. He was angry. He felt himself to be the hero in the television serial `The Bund` starring Chow Yuen Fatt, a popular Hong Kong movie actor. He wanted to have a talk with the CSM to try to get a solution. But if no solution could be found, then he would open fire. He said he left the CSM`s office for the armoury and the ammo dump (ammunition store) where he took an M-16 rifle, two revolvers and many rounds of bullets for the rifle and for the revolvers. He also took two magazines. He tucked the two revolvers in his waist. He wanted to take as much ammunition as possible as that was what Chow Yuen Fatt, the hero in `The Bund` did. The accused was dressed in the skeleton battle order.
Shortly thereafter, the accused returned to see the CSM at the latter`s office. The accused asked the CSM to change the weekend confinements to guard duties which was refused. There were some arguments between the two and the CSM said words in Hokkien to the following effect, `You dared to do it. You have no penis. You are not a man.` The accused was asked to sign an acknowledgment of the punishment awarded against him. He hesitated but signed it. (We would observe the accused might be confused here. He was asked to sign the acknowledgment at the first meeting that morning.) The CSM did not want to talk any further with the accused and walked out of his own room into the general office. The accused felt wronged and humiliated. At that point, the accused loaded the bullet-filled magazine onto the rifle and corked it. The accused walked out into the general office and fired once in the direction where the CSM was standing.
The accused said he saw red in the background and thought he had seen a ghost. He jumped over the body of the CSM which was lying at the doorway. He walked a few steps and then, sensing that the ghost was chasing him, ran in the direction which he was familiar passing the cookhouse-cum-canteen. Running half-way down the road to the main gate of the camp, he took off his skeleton battle order and threw it away. As he ran near to the main gate, he saw something obstructing him. At that point he thought of dying as a hero. He felt that the world meant nothing to him. So he tried to point the muzzle of the rifle at himself. He opened fire. He could not remember how many shots he fired. He felt he was bleeding and dying.
In his evidence the accused said that he hated the CSM the first time he saw him. He felt that the CSM was a villain. He could not explain why he felt that way towards the CSM. He said prior to this incident, the CSM had frequently scolded him saying that the latter was crazy and lazy. He also hated his mother because on one occasion when his parents were quarrelling he heard that his mother actually did not want to bring him into this world as she wanted to abort him when she was pregnant with him. Until the age of seven, he was cared for by child-minders.
The accused said he studied up to primary six but did not complete that grade. His parents often quarrelled. He took various jobs but did not hold any for long. Though he failed the basic training and had to repeat the course, he was nevertheless promoted to a lance corporal. A few weeks before the incident, he felt stress on account of thinking of certain aspects of his past: his mother not wanting him; his failure at school; being bullied because he was soft in nature; in working life he was also a failure. He said he `heard things` and could not control himself. But because he was not selfish, he did not trouble other people with his problems. He repeatedly said when he thought of his problems he wanted to die as a hero as the world meant nothing to him.
In line with the evidence of the prosecution`s witnesses, the accused said one of his hobbies was to have himself photographed with movie television actors and actresses. He also liked to watch movies and television serials. The accused said that he was very affected by what he saw in `The Bund` and to use his words, `I was completely thrown in with the character in the scene.`
When asked why on 14 July 1987 he asked LCP Ang not to do cleaning work the accused said that he felt dejected. He could not take it any more. But he contended that he did not ask LCP Ang to stop work or not to listen to the CSM; he was only expressing to LCP Ang what he himself felt.
The defence called the mother (DW2) of the accused to give evidence as to the childhood and the behaviour of the accused at home. First, we would observe that DW2 herself was given away to foster parents when she was a child. DW2 was pregnant with the accused when she was at a very young age - in her mid-teens. Thus she attempted an abortion of that pregnancy. According to her, her married life had been hard because her husband was a rather irresponsible person who did not support or care for the home. Thus there were many quarrels. As a result she felt depressed and attempted suicide twice. She felt that there was no meaning in life and wondered why she had been so unlucky and had to work all her life.
Notwithstanding the attempted abortion, DW2 said she loved the accused none the less, like any other mother would her child. She agreed that perhaps she did not demonstrate her affection for him outwardly. During the first seven years when the accused was cared for by child-minders, DW2 would bring the accused home once a week.
DW2 said the accused did not do very well in school; but neither was he very bad. Sometimes he was obedient and sometimes not. But he did not complete primary six. The decision to stop schooling was taken by the accused`s father. The accused did not talk much at home and neither did he confide in DW2. She said the accused`s attitude towards her was all right but not particularly affectionate; neither was there any outward hostility. He did not tell her much about school or of how he fared at the national service. In so far as DW2 was concerned she did not notice anything unusual in the behaviour of the accused, though she had observed that the accused did not sleep well. She thought this might be due to the fact that he had too many things on his mind.
A week before the incident she noticed that the accused appeared unhappy as he did not listen to music, and listening to music was one of his hobbies. His other hobby was seeing movies and his favourite star was Chow Yuen Fatt. The accused had during the past expressed to DW2 that he was a failure in life.
 Diminished responsibility 
The defence does not dispute that the accused did, in fact, shoot the CSM with the rifle and caused his death. The only defence raised is that of diminished responsibility under exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code. The medical evidence in support of this defence came primarily from DW3, Dr R Nagulendran, consultant psychiatrist, who examined the accused on four occasions at the Queenstown Remand Prison, ie on 24, 26 and 30 January 1989 and on 2 February 1989. Dr Nagulendran also interviewed the accused`s parents to obtain background information on his personal history.
Based on his psychiatric examination and on all the facts made available to him by the accused and his mother, Dr Nagulendran was of the opinion that at the time when the accused fired his rifle at the CSM he was suffering from psychotic depression with personality disorder. In arriving at this conclusion he relied on the following facts and circumstances:
 
 
(i) His mother had suffered symptoms of mental depression so much so that she had attempted suicide twice. 
 
(ii) Lack of consistent and stable maternal care during the first seven years of the accused`s childhood as he was fostered out and tended to by multiple child-minders. 
 
(iii) There was marital disharmony between his parents as they frequently quarrelled. 
 
(iv) The accused had a poor scholastic achievement being unable to complete even primary six. 
 
(v) Inability to satisfactorily discharge his military duties leading to frequent punishments. 
 
(vi) Persistent low mood feeling, associated with insomnia, poor appetite, loss in weight, low self esteem, sense of worthlessness and suicidal ideation. 
 
(vii) Severe punishment meted out by the CSM coupled with humiliating remarks as to his manliness. 
 
(viii) Intense feeling of victimization, depression and anger followed by sudden decompensation and break with reality characterized by grandiose delusional thinking in which he believed he was the hero in `The Bund`, [to which we have already referred] - going to battle armed with a rifle, revolvers and a large quantity of bullets. 
 
(ix) Continuation of aspects of psychotic behaviour when he confronted the CSM and subsequently shot the CSM at very close range in full view of other military personnel. 
 
(x) Determined attempt to commit suicide by repeated firing of three bullets at his chest.
  
 
 
Dr Nagulendran said that on the day of the incident, the accused suffered psychotic depression, ie major depressive episode, with delusion. In accordance with the authority to which he referred 
 Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry 
 (4th Ed) by Kaplan and Sadock (material parts of which were tendered in evidence and marked `D4`), he said that the accused satisfied the essential diagnostic features of a major depressive episode which that authority has identified to be the following: 
 
A Persistent dysphoric mood: depressed: low: irritable: hopeless. Loss of interest. Loss of pleasure.
B At least four of these symptoms for at least two weeks: 
(1) Poor appetite or weight loss or increased appetite or weight gain. 
(2) Insomnia or hypersomnia. 
(3) Psychomotor agitation or retardation. 
(4) Loss of interest in normal activities or decrease in sexual drive. 
(5) Loss of energy. 
(6) Feelings of worthlessness, inadequacy, or excessive (inappropriate) guilt. 
(7) Reduced concentration or indecisiveness. 
(8) Suicidal ideation.
 
 
 
Dr Nagulendran opined that the accused satisfied not only four of the symptoms but five and he identified the five to be poor appetite and weight loss; insomnia; loss of interest in normal activities; feelings of worthlessness or inadequacy; suicidal ideation. He made specific reference to what he described as the depressive mood suffered by the accused for a period of at least two weeks prior to the date of the incident and the humiliating rebuke which the CSM gave him that morning. These, Dr Nagulendran said, brought about the psychotic depression in the accused which in turn caused him to suffer the delusion that he was the hero in the television serial, `The Bund`. He was therefore going to have a talk with the CSM to `settle` matters and if no settlement could be achieved then he would shoot the CSM and then commit suicide.
In law, the burden of proving diminished responsibility, which is on a balance of probability, rests on the accused. This is a question of fact which must be decided in the light of all the evidence before the court, including medical opinion. So the first point which we must determine is whether it has been shown to this court on a balance of probability that the accused was suffering from a major depressive episode. As we have stated above, none of the witnesses for the prosecution said that there were any changes in the accused`s behaviour or the way he carried out his duties prior to the date of the incident.
From exh P115 (the extract from nominal record) we see that there is no evidence of any weight loss on the part of the accused. In his work he showed no less interest as testified by his colleagues and officers. He has further not indicated any suicidal tendencies to either his parents or any of his colleagues though the accused explained that he did not wish to burden others with his own problems. To all intents and purposes the prosecution`s witnesses were all of one voice to say that immediately prior to 17 July 1987 the accused was performing his duty as an armskoteman satisfactorily. None of them has observed that anything was amiss or that he was not his usual self at any time. They also noted that he was by nature reserved.
That none of his colleagues or officers were close to him in the sense that they did not socialize with him outside official duties was always in the forefront of our minds. If the accused was that seriously depressed for two weeks before the incident, his colleagues like Chan Wei Seng (PW5), who worked in the armoury with him, would have noticed the change. The accused`s performance at work would have been affected. Chan had worked with the accused for a year. Other than some vague references by the accused`s mother that the accused seems to have many things on his mind and that he could not sleep, there was no objective evidence tendered to show that he was not his normal self during the two weeks before the incident.
It is pertinent to note that on 12 July 1987 when the accused was carrying out the work of cleaning the area of the ammo dump as a punishment together with LCP Ang and LCP Mok, he even had the sense, which is quite normal, of telling LCP Ang that they should finish their work quickly. Even as late as 14 July 1987, when he was required to clean the ammo dump all over again, all he was complaining about was that it was unfair that LCP Mok was not required to do the cleaning together with them. There were no signs of any exceptional behaviour but only expression of unfairness that LCP Mok should get off just because he had another assignment to do.
The facts or circumstances upon which Dr Nagulendran relied to show that the diagnostic features of a major depressive episode were present were all obtained from the accused himself and his mother. But by their very nature such facts or circumstances must be carefully scrutinized and matched against the objective evidence, particularly the conduct of the accused shortly before and after the incident, bearing in mind that it is all too easy for an accused person to say that he was depressed or had insomnia or had poor appetite. We say this fully conscious of the quantum with which an accused has to prove any matter where the law imposes a burden upon him.
Dr Ang Ah Leng (PW28), a psychiatric consultant with the Woodbridge Hospital, examined the accused on 11, 18, 21, 25 and 31 August 1987 at the Changi Prison Hospital. During the first three occasions of his examination of the accused the latter was uncooperative and gave either `I don`t know` answers or approximate or stupid answers evidencing what Dr Ang called `Ganser Syndrome`. Dr Ang also interviewed the parents of the accused. The accused only opened up and talked to Dr Ang on the fourth occasion and related to him what happened on 17 July 1987. In this interview the accused did not mention anything to Dr Ang about the accused believing himself to be the hero in `The Bund` and going for a settlement talk with the CSM. We would observe that we do not place much significance in this omission as the accused did in his s 122(6) statement, recorded immediately after the incident, make specific mention of the hero in `The Bund`.
However, Dr Ang, who sat through the proceedings in this court, was nevertheless, having considered all the material before the court, of the opinion that the accused was not suffering from any mental illness which would substantially impair his mental responsibility for his acts. He was of the opinion that the accused could not be suffering from any psychotic depression because a person who suffers from psychotic depression coupled with a delusion of the kind alleged would continue to harbour such a delusion even after the villain had been eliminated. The very nature of a delusion is that it is a false belief that arises without appropriate external stimulation and is maintained unshakably in the face of reason and such a belief is not one ordinarily shared by other members of a patient`s social, cultural, and educational grouping. Dr Ang said that the delusion suffered by a psychotic patient cannot disappear just like that. The delusion will disappear as the psychotic depression subsides. A person who truly suffers from psychosis could not return to reality immediately after the happening of an event.
 Assessment of the court 
Having considered the undisputed facts of the case, the conduct of the accused prior and subsequent to the incident and the medical evidence, we find that the accused was not suffering from psychotic depression on the day of the incident. There was hardly sufficient objective evidence to show that the required diagnostic criteria for major depressive episode have been satisfied. The information furnished by the accused to Dr Nagulendran after a considerable lapse of time must necessarily be viewed with some caution. In so far as the mother was concerned, she admitted that she was not close to the son and he did not confide in her. From the ambivalent answers given by the mother in this court, it seems to us clear that she really had very little contact or knowledge of her son. In any event, even the mother did not really observe any significant change in the accused`s behaviour during the two weeks before the incident.
On the other hand there is evidence to show that the accused was discharging his duties as an armskoteman in the usual manner. While we agree that the accused, on being awarded the punishments by the CSM that morning, was very upset and angry, and here we would say that is only to be expected, there is nothing more than that. Even on the accused`s own evidence, he disliked the CSM from the first time he laid eyes on the CSM, and that the CSM often called him lazy and crazy, yet he had the audacity to challenge the authority of the CSM by instigating LCP Ang not to carry out the CSM`s order. In our judgment, what happened on 17 July 1987 was a continuation of that defiant streak in the accused.
We turn next to consider whether the accused was suffering from brief reactive psychosis. This point arose during the cross-examination of Dr Ang when he said that a person who suffers from delusion as a result of psychotic depression could not get out of that deluded state in a matter of one and a half hours. Treatment is required for a person who suffers from such a mental illness. It could go off spontaneously without treatment but that would require even more time. Counsel for the defence then tendered `Other Psychiatric Disorders` (exh D9) which is an article written by Prof Lehmann, a Professor Emeritus at McGill University, to show that a certain type of psychosis could last only for a very short period.
In the opinion of Prof Lehmann `a group of brief psychotic disorders presents certain characteristic features that distinguish these disorders from other psychotic conditions. Most importantly, the symptoms of this type of psychotic breakdown are almost always preceded by stressful life events to which the patient reacts with strong dysphoric affect. In addition to a clear history of such precipitating events, the disorder is further characterized by its acute and florid symptoms, short duration and a good prognosis.` According to Prof Lehmann, the precipitating factor must be a major stress experience closely related in time to the emergence of symptoms. He says that unstable rather than stable personalities seem to be more susceptible to this kind of psychotic breakdowns. Further, he also says that most such patients recover within a few days and that `acute reactive psychotic states may occasionally last only an hour or less, particularly if they are sleep induced, epileptic, or hysterical-dissociative in nature.`
According to Prof Kok Lee Peng (PW31), Associate Professor of Psychiatric Medicine at the National University of Singapore, brief reactive psychosis can occur even to a normal person, but there must be an immediate stressful life event for that to come about.
Both Dr Nagulendran and Dr Ang are agreed in two respects: the event that morning was very stressful for the accused and the suicide attempt by the accused was genuine. Where they differ is as to the effect of that event on the accused. Dr Nagulendran says that the event brought about his brief psychotic depression, and the shooting of the CSM and the suicide attempt were acts done while the accused was still suffering from the psychosis. On the other hand Dr Ang is of the opinion that the event did not bring about any psychosis on the part of the accused. What happened was that, as a result of the event the accused became very angry and imagined himself to be the hero in `The Bund`. He thus requested the CSM to alter the punishment imposed. When that was refused, he could not care less and fired at the CSM. He ran away from the scene of the crime and when he realized that he could not escape, he tried to shoot himself in a suicide attempt.
What strikes us is that if the accused did in fact suffer a brief reactive psychosis following the first meeting with the CSM that day, it is most extraordinary that the first thing he thought of on the occurrence of the brief reactive psychosis was to go to the canteen to eat and after that on his return to the armoury, to loiter there in silence. If the brief reactive psychosis had come over the accused which made him believe that he was the hero in `The Bund` we would expect him to act immediately. His emotions then must have been high. In our view, his conduct portrays the picture of a person who wanted to imagine himself a hero and who was trying, in that angry state, to figure things out in his mind. And having reflected and figured out how he would act, he proceeded to get the ammunition, two revolvers and one M-16 rifle, got dressed in the skeleton battle order and left the armoury telling Chan Wai Seng (PW5) that he was going for his CTSS exercise. His s 122(6) statement supports this view.
We are conscious that in the opinion of both Dr Ang and Prof Kok it does not follow that a person who suffers from a delusion will have his sensorium affected. The person will know his whereabouts, time and place and could also recognize friends, depending on the intensity of his emotion. Prof Kok opined that the fact that the accused informed PW5 that he was going to the CTSS exercise is consistent with the position that his sensorium was not clouded; but she also added that if the accused was in the grips of powerful emotion, it was unlikely that he would say that. This remark of the accused, viewed in the contexts of what he did earlier, ie going to the canteen and loitering in the armoury, clearly shows that he was very much his own self.
A great deal has been said about the way the accused over-armed himself. Why did he require 90 rounds of ammunition, two revolvers and one rifle? This court has not been shown how the hero went about meeting the villains in `The Bund`. No evidence was placed before this court on that. Assuming that that was how the hero did in going to meet the villains, we think this aspect of the accused`s conduct is consistent with both scenarios, ie the accused truly believing himself to be the hero and the accused imagining himself and consciously wanting to imitate the hero in `The Bund` in the circumstances in which the accused found himself.
We move next to the contention that unless the accused was truly under a delusion he would not shoot the CSM in the presence of so many other people in the office. Here again we think that this fact is neutral. It could be as much the act of an angry person who did not care about the consequences. This point and the previous point on overarming must be viewed in the overall context.
The next point is this. The accused said that he believed himself to the hero. He was going to have a settlement talk with the CSM and if that failed he would shoot the villain (CSM) and then commit suicide. Yet, what happened was that after having shot the villain the accused did not embark on any self-wounding action that would lead to suicide; instead he ran away.
The accused explained that he ran away because he saw blood and thought that was a ghost. Would a hero in that position be afraid of blood and ghost? Such a hero would have expected blood to flow, as that would be the natural consequence of his act. Neither would a hero be afraid of a ghost or ghosts. Why did the accused run away and only stop to shoot at himself when he realized he was pursued and he discovered the barrier a short distance in front of him? This, in our view, shows that he was conscious all the time of what he was doing and when he discovered that he could run no further, he took what he then came to think was the only way out - to commit suicide.
It is pertinent to note that some of the first utterances of the accused after his attempted suicide were `I can`t take it any more`; `I want to die`; `sorry for my parents`. We are unable to accept Dr Nagulendran`s opinion that that was the point at which the accused`s psychotic depression subsided and the delusion of being a hero ceased. It seems to us that the accused`s senses and rational behaviour never left him. Having considered all the evidence before us, we are not satisfied that a case has been made out that the accused was suffering from brief reactive psychosis for the period from slightly past 9am to approximately 10.40am on 17 July 1987 or any part thereof.
We would observe that while Prof Lehmann said that one could have brief reactive psychosis for even one hour, it seems his experience relates to those which are sleep induced, epileptic or hysterical-dissociative in nature. The three experts before us have not come across a case of brief reactive psychosis of such extremely short duration. Prof Kok said from her experience the shortest period was three days. Even Prof Nagulendran has not encountered a case of psychosis of such brief duration. We agree that one should not be obsessed with the question of the duration of the psychosis which must by its very nature vary from case to case. It is nevertheless a point to be borne in mind. Of course far more important are the acts and conduct of the person during the relevant period in question.
It seems to us quite clear that here you have an average national serviceman who had performed his duties satisfactorily, but who, like others, had occasionally run foul of the rules and regulations of the camp resulting in minor punishments being meted out to him. On no account can the accused be said to be a failure in the army as Dr Nagulendran thought him to be. Notwithstanding the fact that he repeated the basic course, he was good enough to be promoted a lance corporal. Some, if not most, of his colleagues and officers considered his work as `good` or `efficient`. His relationship with those colleagues and officers in the camp was also cordial. They have regarded him as friendly though reserved. Workwise they have no complaints. He had his main hobby - that of being photographed with movie television actors and actresses. His other hobbies were going to the movies and listening to music.
However, we are forced to conclude there lies in him a streak of temper which will even cause him to defy authority if he thinks that what he is being asked to do is unfair. This streak manifested itself on 14 July 1987 when he told LCP Ang not to carry out the work and accept whatever punishment the CSM might mete out to them. In our view what happened on 17 July 1987 was a further manifestation of that streak. We find that he tried to imitate the actor Chow Yuen Fatt in `The Bund`. We do not think that he at any time seriously believed that he was Chow Yuen Fatt, the hero. He knew what he was doing, ie to copy the way Chow Yuen Fatt went about on a showdown with the villains.
Though the accused broke down on two occasions while being under cross-examination, one can see from his answers that he is not a person without considerable understanding. Though he did not even complete his primary six education he is certainly a person capable of deep thought. For example: (i) when he was asked was the DPP a bad man, he answered `using my present thinking, nobody is a bad man`; (ii) when he was asked if he accepts that his work was good and thus he was promoted to be a lance corporal, he said, `What I think now is we mustn`t claim credit for what we do. If we claim credit or show off about our work this is hypocrisy. Just like what I said just now, a monk in the temple, he chants the sutras. To you all he appears to be good. Behind him what do you know what he did behind. That`s what I mean. I am inclined to say as a person, so long as my conscience is clear, let things take its natural course. This is what I mean.`
The accused`s answers in court, even in respect of events prior to and subsequent to the period of the alleged psychosis, were very often `cannot remember` or `I don`t know`. At some stages answers of this type were almost mechanical that it was difficult to resist the inference, that he was, so to say, intellectually malingering.
Accordingly, we reject the defence of diminished responsibility. Neither do we find that any one of the other exceptions to s 300 applies. We, therefore, convict the accused on the charge of murder.

This is a criminal revision which arises out of the conviction of one Pong Tek Yin alias Fong Foot Ting (the accused) of a charge of bigamy punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) in DAC 2480 of 1989 before the district court. On 4 March 1989 before the district court, the accused pleaded guilty to the following charge: 
 
You, Pong Tek Yin (Fong Foot Ting)
 
 
 
M/49 Yrs NRIC No: 1853434-G
 
 
 
are charged that you, on or about 1 June 1970, at the Registry of Marriages, Perak, Malaysia, married one Mdm Lim Nya Hoo when your wife Mdm Lim Seh Moi was still living and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under se 494 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The statement of facts admitted by the accused in relation to the charge is as follows: 
 
Complainant is Mrs Chua-Quek Soo Noi attached to the Registry of Citizens, Singapore.
 
 
 
2 Accused is one: Pong Tek Yin @ Fong Foot Ting m/49 yrs NRIC No 1853434-G Blk 199, Boon Lay Drive #15-61 (2264).
 
 
 
 
(3) In her letter A/F 810505 (G) dated 17 March 1988, complainant reported that the accused had contracted two marriages. 
 
(4) Investigations revealed that the accused first contracted a customary marriage in accordance with the Chinese customary rites with Mdm Lim Seh Moi sometime in 1964 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. By this marriage, they have five children. 
 
(5) Whilst his first marriage was still subsisting, the accused contracted another customary marriage with Mdm Lim Nya Hoo, NRIC No 4160219-FOM, on 10 May 1975. Their marriage was re-registered at the Registry of Marriages, Perak, Malaysia, on 1 June 1978 vide Marriage Certificate No 160/78. By this union, they have two children. 
 
6 Accused`s second marriage is therefore bigamous, as at the time of his second marriage, his first marriage with Mdm Lim Seh Moi was still subsisting and has not been dissolved. 
 
(7) Accused is charged accordingly.
  
 
 
The accused was convicted and sentenced by the learned district judge to a term of one day`s imprisonment and a fine of $900, and in default of payment a term of 45 days` imprisonment. He served the nominal term of imprisonment and paid the fine. At that time he was not represented by counsel.
Before me further facts were produced, which were not disputed. They are as follows. The accused was a Malaysian citizen, and resided in Malaysia. In 1964 he married one Lim Seh Moi, also a Malaysian citizen, in Malaysia according to Chinese customary rites, and five children were born out of this union. He first came to Singapore to work in 1970; he worked as a labourer in a shipyard. In 1972 he went back to Malaysia, and disputes between him and his wife arose. As a result, he left her in 1974. It is not clear whether at that time he was still working in Singapore, or whether only after he had left her did he return to Singapore to work. In any case, in the same year, he met one Lim Nya Hoo, also a Malaysian citizen, in Singapore. On 10 May 1975, the accused went through a Chinese customary marriage with Lim Nya Hoo (1975 marriage) in Taiping in the state of Perak, and subsequently began cohabitation with her in Singapore. Two children were born out of this marriage. On 1 June 1978, the accused and Lim Nya Hoo went through a civil marriage (1978 marriage) before the Registrar of Marriages in Perak under the Civil Marriage Ordinance 1952, then in force in Malaysia. In this respect, the statement of facts, which said that the parties registered their marriage at the Registry of Marriages in Perak, is not correct. According to the certified true copy of the marriage certificate, their marriage on 1 June 1978 was solemnized by the Registrar of Marriages in accordance with the Civil Marriage Ordinance 1952; it was not simply a registration of their 1975 marriage under the Registration of Marriage Ordinance 1952. In other words, they purported to contract a civil marriage under the Civil Marriage Ordinance 1952. I say `purported` advisedly, because under s 30(b) of that Ordinance, a marriage purported to be solemnized thereunder is void, if either of the parties was at the date of such marriage married under any law, religion, custom or usage to any person other than the other party; that precisely was what happened in this case: the accused was, at that date, married to Lim Seh Moi under Chinese customary rites, and hence the 1978 marriage is by virtue of that section void.
In 1979, the accused applied for and obtained a permanent resident status in Singapore, and on 6 October 1987 he acquired Singapore citizenship. In 1988, the accused applied for Singapore citizenship for his second wife, Lim Nya Hoo, and it was in the course of processing this application that the 1978 marriage surfaced. In consequence, a complaint was lodged by an officer of the Registry of Citizens, and criminal proceedings were initiated against the accused which culminated in his conviction.
Before me, counsel for the accused mounted a two-pronged attack on the conviction. First, he submitted that a Singapore court has no jurisdiction to try the act alleged to be an offence, as the act was committed outside Singapore, assuming that such an act is an offence punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code. Secondly, and independently of the first argument, he submitted that s 494 of the Penal Code has no extra-territorial operation, and as the act alleged to be an offence was committed outside Singapore, it is not punishable under s 494. As will become apparent, both arguments are closely connected; the first hinges on the second, and I therefore propose to consider them jointly as one.
As a starting point, counsel referred me to s 15 of the Supreme Court of judicature Act (Cap 322, 1985 Ed) which provides: 
 
(1) The High Court shall have jurisdiction to try all offences committed
 
 
 
 
(a) within Singapore; 
 
(b) on the high seas on board any ship or aircraft registered in Singapore; 
 
(c) by any person who is a citizen of Singapore on the high seas or on any aircraft; 
 
(d) by any person on the high seas where the offence is piracy by the law of nations; and 
 
(e) by any person within or outside Singapore where the offence is punishable under and by virtue of the provisions of the Hijacking and Protection of Aircraft Act
  
 
 
(2) The High Court may pass any sentence allowed by law.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that on the basis of this section the High Court has no jurisdiction to try the act alleged to be an offence, as the act was committed outside Singapore, and a fortiori the district court also has no jurisdiction. He relied on two Malaysian authorities: 
 PP v Nai Prasit 
 
 
 
[1961] MLJ 62
  and 
 PP v Rajappan 
 
 
 
[1986] 1 MLJ 152
 . In the first case the accused was convicted of bigamy punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code (FMS Cap 45); the second marriage on which the charge was founded took place in Australia. Upon a criminal revision, Thomson CJ held that the court had no jurisdiction to try the offence and the proceedings were a nullity, and accordingly the conviction was set aside. He said, at p 62: 
 
The actual act of bigamy, that is to say, the second marriage which was alleged to be void by reason of the wife of the first marriage being still alive, took place in the State of Victoria in the Commonwealth of Australia. In the circumstances the sessions court had no jurisdiction to try the case. The territorial jurisdiction of the sessions court is set out in s 59 of the Courts Ordinance and s 9 of the Criminal Procedure Code and except in the case of certain offences committed on the High Seas (that is outside territorial waters) the court has no jurisdiction to try any offence committed outside the Federation.
 
 
 
In the present case, therefore, the proceedings were a nullity and the conviction of the accused is accordingly set aside.
 
 
 
Thomson CJ arrived at the conclusion purely on the basis that the Courts Ordinance and the Criminal Procedure Code did not confer jurisdiction on the court to try the offence. He did not consider and decide whether s 494 of the Penal Code has extra-territorial operation, ie whether the bigamous marriage committed abroad is punishable under s 494.
That decision was approved by the Supreme Court of Malaysia in the 
 Rajappan 
case. In that case the accused was married according to Hindu customs in India in 1947. In 1954 the accused, his wife and children migrated to Malaysia, and his marriage was registered with the Registry of Marriages, Malaysia. In 1984, the accused, whilst still being married to his wife, went to India and married another woman and brought her back to Malaysia, and lived together with her in Klang. On a complaint by his first wife, the accused was prosecuted before the magistrate`s court. The learned magistrate held he had no jurisdiction to try the alleged offence. Upon application by the public prosecutor under s 127(c) of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code, the High Court held that bigamy committed by a person was not an offence in Malaysia if the second marriage took place outside the country, even though the spouse of the person of the earlier marriage was alive, and the courts in Malaysia had no jurisdiction to try the offence as it was committed outside Malaysia. The learned public prosecutor, acting under s 66 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 of Malaysia, then referred for determination by the Supreme Court two questions, namely: 
 
(a) whether or not in law a person who is domiciled in Malaysia and marries again during the lifetime of his or her husband or wife at a place outside Malaysia and thereafter returns to Malaysia with the second spouse has committed an offence punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code (FMS Cap 45); and
(b) if the answer to question (a) is in the affirmative, then whether or not in law a magistrate`s court has jurisdiction to try such person for an offence punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code (FMS Cap 45).
 
 
 
On the first question, the Supreme Court held that a bigamous marriage contracted abroad by a Malaysian citizen or permanent resident is not an offence punishable under s 494 of the Malaysian Penal Code. This conclusion was arrived at on a construction of s 494 of the Malaysian Penal Code and ss 5, 6 and 7 of the Law Reform (Marriage and Divorce) Act 1976. Salleh Abas LP said at p 157: 
 
Reverting back to the question which we are required to answer, I am of the view that a bigamous marriage, committed abroad by a Malaysian citizen or a permanent resident notwithstanding such marriage is in contravention of s 5(1) of the LRA, is not an offence punishable under s 494 of the PC. Section 7 of the LRA does not make the offence under s 494 of the PC an extra-territorial offence. It simply declares that a bigamous marriage in contravention of s 5 shall be deemed to be an offence of bigamy. Even without this deeming provision, a marriage in contravention of s 5 will be a marriage `which is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife` within the meaning of s 494 of the PC and so constituted an offence of bigamy under it. In other words, s 7 adds nothing new to s 494 of the PC. It is merely declaratory of the position under the Code. If the offence under s 494 is not extra-territorial (see 
 PP v Nai Prasit
 
 
 
[1961] MLJ 62
 ), I cannot see how it could not be extra-territorial by reason of ss 5, 6 and 7 of LRA. These sections only deal with situations obtaining in Malaysia. The only effect of the LRA on s 494 of the PC is that the persons who can be guilty of the offence of bigamy are extended to all Malaysian citizens and those having Malaysian domicile provided they are not Muslims. The Act extends only the personal scope but not its material scope, ie the actus reus.
 
 
 
On the second question, the Supreme Court held that on the true construction of s 22 of the Courts of Judicature Act 1964 the High Court had no jurisdiction to try the offence. Salleh Abas LP, after referring to s 22(1), said at p 158: 
 
There is nothing in this section from which it could be inferred that the High Court can try a Malaysian citizen or permanent resident who whilst already married has contracted a bigamous marriage abroad. The seemingly wide jurisdiction given to the High Court under para (b)(iii) of sub-s (1) to try a Malaysian citizen or permanent resident in respect of an offence committed in any place without and beyond Malaysia, is limited only to trial of offences under Chapter VI of PC, those under the Extra-Territorial Offences Act, and those certified by the Attorney-General to be security offences.
 
 
 
It would appear therefore that the issue of jurisdiction or lack of it is tied up with the issue whether an act is an offence or not. There is no point in giving a jurisdiction when the relevant act is not an offence. On the other hand it is ridiculous for Parliament to deem an act committed abroad to be an offence without giving jurisdiction to try such offence to any particular court or courts. The truth is that as the court is not given the jurisdiction, the act complained of cannot be an offence.
 
 
 
Section 22(1) of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964 is in pari materia with s 15(1) of our Supreme Court of Judicature Act, and if s 15(1) is the only provision governing the jurisdiction of the courts, I would agree entirely with counsel for the accused that the courts have no jurisdiction to try the offence with which the accused was charged. The learned deputy public prosecutor, however, has referred me to s 9 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), and contended that under that section the courts have jurisdiction to try the offence. Section 9 is as follows: 
 
Subject to the other provisions of this Code -
 
 
 
(a) any offence under the Penal Code may be tried by the High Court or by any other court by which the offence si shown to be triable in the 8th Column of Schedule A;
 
 
 
 
(b) any offence under any law other than the Penal Code may be tried by the High Court or by any other court mentioned in that behalf by that law; 
 
(c) when no court is so mentioned such offence may be tried by the High Court or by any court constituted under this Code:
  
 
 
Provided that
(i) no District Court shall try any such offence which is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may exceed 10 years; 
(ii) no Magistrate`s Court shall try any offence which is punishable with imprisonment for a term which may exceed 3 years.
 
 
 
The equivalent of s 9 in the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code was not discussed and considered in 
 Rajappan 
. However, presumably, since the Supreme Court had decided that s 494 of the Penal Code has no extra-territorial operation, it became unnecessary to consider and decide whether the equivalent of s 9 of the Malaysian Criminal Procedure Code confers any jurisdiction on the court. In my opinion, s 9 of our Criminal Procedure Code does confer jurisdiction on the High Court and, in numerous cases, on the subordinate courts as provided in Schedule A, to try offences punishable under the Penal Code. As provided in Schedule A, the offence punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code is triable by a district court, besides the High Court. It therefore follows that if the act committed by the accused is an offence punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code, the district court, besides the High Court, will have jurisdiction to try the offence and convict him.
I now turn to the next question that immediately arises, namely, whether the act committed by the accused, ie contracting the 1978 marriage or, for that matter, the 1975 marriage in the State of Perak is an offence punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code. This is identical with the first question posed before the Supreme Court in Malaysia in the 
 Rajappan 
case, which the court there answered in the negative. It is convenient at this stage to set out s 494 of the Penal Code, which is as follows: 
 
Whoever, having a husband or wife living, marries in any case in which such marriage is void by reason of its taking place during the life of such husband or wife, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 
 
 
Exception. - 
 This section does not extend to any person whose
 marriage, with such husband or wife, has been declared void by
 a court of competent jurisdiction, nor to any person who contracts
 a marriage during the life of a former husband or wife, if
 such husband or wife, at the time of the subsequent marriage, has
 been continually absent from such person for the space of 7 years,
 and has not been heard of by such person as being alive within
 that time, provided the person contracting such subsequent
 marriage, before the marriage takes place, informs the person
 with whom the marriage is contracted, of the real state of facts
 so far as the same are within his or her knowledge.
 
 
 
This section is identical with s 494 of the Malaysian Penal Code. Counsel for the accused therefore relied on 
 Nai Prasit 
 and 
 Rajappan 
 and submitted that this section has no extra-territorial effect and the second marriage entered into by the accused abroad is not punishable under this section. The question is one of construction, and in construing that section it must be borne in mind that there is a well-established presumption that in the absence of clear and specific words to the effect a statute which creates an offence is not intended to make an act taking place outside the territorial jurisdiction of the country an offence triable in the courts here: 
 Air-India v Wiggins 
. In that case, Air-India carried a cargo of some 2,000 live birds on a flight from India to London with a scheduled stop at Kuwait. While the aircraft was at Kuwait it developed engine trouble and in consequence was delayed on the tarmac for 31 hours. During this period of delay the birds remained unattended in crates in the aircraft without proper ventilation. As a result only 89 birds were found to be alive when the aircraft arrived at Heathrow airport in London, the remainder of about 2,000 had died from asphyxiation. It was found that these birds were already dead before the aircraft entered the British airspace. Air-India were charged with offences under the Transit of Animals (General) Order 1973. It was held that on the true construction of the relevant provisions of that Order and s 23 of the Diseases of Animals Act 1950 (under which the Order was made and which was amended and applied to air transport by s 11 and Schedule 2, para 1(1) of the Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1954), the commission of the offence ceased when the birds` suffering ended with their deaths in Kuwait, and, accordingly, no offence was committed by the airline in respect of those birds which were dead. In the course of his judgment, Lord Diplock had this to say about the statutory pr esumption against extra-territorial effect, at p 596: 
 
My Lords, in construing Acts of Parliament there is a well-established presumption that, in the absence of clear and specific words to the contrary, an `offence-creating section` of an Act of Parliament (to borrow an expression used by this House in 
 Cox v Army Council
[1962] 1 All ER 880, 
[1963] AC 48
) was not intended to make conduct taking place outside the territorial jurisdiction of the Crown an offence triable in an English criminal court. As Viscount Simonds put it ([1962] 1 All ER 880 at 882, 
[1963] AC 48
 at 67):
 
 
 
`... apart from those exceptional cases in which specific provision is made in regard to acts committed abroad, the whole body of the criminal law of England deals only with
 
 
 
acts committed in England.`
 Cox v Army Council 
 was concerned with a statute which in the plainest possible words made acts committed abroad by serving members of the British Army offences triable by court-martial. The presumption against a parliamentary intention to make acts done by foreigners abroad offences triable by English criminal courts is even stronger. As Lord Russell CJ said in 
 R v Jameson 
[1896] 2 QB 425
 at 430: 
 
`One other general canon of construction is this - that if any construction otherwise be possible, an Act will not be construed as applying to foreigners in respect of acts done by them outside the dominions of the sovereign power enacting.`
 
 
 
Returning to s 494 of our Penal Code, there are no clear and specific words therein to suggest that the section has any extra-territorial operation. On the basis of the presumption, the word `marries` in the section must be construed to mean `marries in Singapore`. In my judgment, on the true construction of s 494 a bigamous marriage taking place abroad is not an offence punishable under that section. On this point, I respectfully follow the decisions in 
 Nai Prasit 
 and 
 Rajappan 
.
The next question is whether this provision has been extended by the relevant provisions of the Women`s Charter so as to cover a bigamous marriage contracted abroad and render it punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code. The relevant provisions of the Women`s Charter are ss 3(1), 4(1), 5(1) and 6, and in this connection, the relevant provisions I have to consider are those in force at the time when the act for which the accused was charged was committed, ie 1 June 1978. Sections 3(1), 4(1), 5(1) and 6 then in force provided as follows: 
 
3(1) Save as is otherwise expressly provided this Act shall apply to all persons in Singapore and shall also apply to all persons domiciled in Singapore who are resident outside Singapore.
(4) (1 Every person who on the date of the coming into operation of this Act is lawfully married under any law, religion, custom or usage to one or more spouses shall be incapable, during the continuance of such marriage or marriages of contracting a valid marriage under any law, religion, custom or usage with any person other than such spouse or spouses. 
(5) (1) Every marriage contracted in contravention of the provisions of section 4 in this Act shall be void. 
(6) Any person lawfully married under any law, religion, custom or usage who during the continuance of such marriage purports to contract a marriage under any law, religion, custom or usage in contravention of the provisions of section 4 of this Act shall be deemed to commit the offence of marrying again during the lifetime of husband or wife, as the case may be, within the meaning of section 494 of the Penal Code.
 
 
 
It was submitted by the learned deputy public prosecutor that s 3 applies to two classes of person, namely: (i) all persons in Singapore and (ii) all persons domiciled in Singapore who are resident outside Singapore, and that at the material time, that is, 1 June 1978, the accused was domiciled in Singapore and therefore falls within the second category of persons in s 3. The words, `Any person` in s 6 mean any person falling within s 3, and applying s 6 to the accused, he was at the material time lawfully married to his first wife and during the continuance of that marriage purported to contract a marriage with his second wife in contravention of s 4, and therefore he is deemed to have committed the offence of marrying again during the lifetime of his first wife within the meaning of s 494 of the Penal Code. I am unable to accept this argument. There are two difficulties in the way. First, I am not satisfied that on the facts before me the accused at the material time was domiciled in Singapore and was resident in Malaysia. This the prosecution has to establish, and the facts are inadequate for the purpose. On the facts before me, the accused was not in Singapore when he committed the act; nor was he at that time domiciled in Singapore and resident abroad. The Women`s Charter therefore did not at the time, apply to the accused, and it follows that the act committed by the accused, namely, contracting the 1978 marriage in Perak, was not an offence punishable under s 494 of the Penal Code.
Secondly, assuming that the Women`s Charter by virtue of s 3 thereof applies to him, and therefore he is `a person` falling within s 6, there is still the question whether that section enlarges the ambit of s 494 of the Penal Code to the extent that it covers a bigamous marriage contracted abroad. In my opinion, as it stood at that time, it did not. It did not provide expressly or by necessary implication that a person (to whom the Women`s Charter applied) who contracted a bigamous marriage abroad would be deemed to have committed the offence within the meaning of s 494 of the Penal Code. Sections 3 and 6 of the Women`s Charter therefore, as they stood in 1978, did not confer on s 494 of the Penal Code any extra-territorial effect. Since then, material amendments have been made to ss 3, 5 and 6 of the Women`s Charter, and the question whether these sections have enlarged the scope of s 494 of the Penal Code giving it extra-territorial operation is not before me, and I refrain from expressing any opinion on it.
In the result, in my judgment, neither under s 15 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act nor under s 9 of the Criminal Procedure Code has a court in Singapore any jurisdiction to try the alleged offence committed by the accused. The proceedings before the district court were therefore a nullity. Accordingly, I quash the conviction and set aside the sentence, and order that the fine of $900 paid by the accused be refunded to him.
 Order accordingly

s 185(1)(b) Applicant a politician and professional person Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
By this criminal motion, the applicant applied for an order that Income Tax Summons Case Nos 90142 to 90147 of 1988 be transferred from the subordinate courts and heard in the High Court pursuant to s 185 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). At the conclusion of the hearing of the criminal motion, I held that the application did not, in my judgment, come within s 185(1)(a), (b) or (e) of the CPC and accordingly dismissed it. I indicated that I would give my reasons later. This I now do.
For present purposes, the relevant statutory provisions in the CPC which require recital are as follows: 
 
185(1) Whenever it is made to appear to the High Court that -
 
 
 
 
(a) a fair and impartial inquiry ... trial cannot be had in any criminal court subordinate to it; 
 
(b) some question of law of unusual difficulty is likely to arise; 
 
... 
 
(e) such an order is expedient for the ends of justice ...,
  
 
 
it may order that -
 
 
 
...
(ii) any particular criminal case shall be transferred to and tried before the High Court.
 
 
 
The appellant was charged with four counts of evasion of income tax under s 96(1)(a) and two counts under s 96(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act (Cap 134). The relevant income tax summonses were due to be heard on 5 December 1988 to 23 December 1988 in Court No 10 of the subordinate courts. In support of the criminal motion, the applicant filed an affidavit which contained 40 paragraphs. As I was satisfied that it contained irrelevant and scandalous matters, pursuant to O 41 r 6 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970, I ordered that except for eight paragraphs the other paragraphs of the affidavit be expunged.
The first contention of the applicant was that there were questions of law of unusual difficulty to be tried in this case, within the meaning of s 185(1)(b) of the CPC. However, an analysis of the charges would disclose that the only two issues before the trial courts would be whether the applicant had omitted to declare certain earned income in his income tax returns and, if he did, whether the omission was wilful. It is beyond dispute that district judges are perfectly competent to try the sort of cases with which the appellant was concerned: see 
 Measor & Anor v PP 
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 195
 .
The applicant`s second contention was based on his status as a non-constituency Member of Parliament and as a professional person. In the penultimate paragraph of his affidavit the applicant asserted that `previous prosecutions of political figures in the subordinate courts and their erroneous convictions led to disquiet and allegations of executive interference in the subordinate courts judiciary`. He then concluded in these terms: `In order to avoid further allegations from being made, it is my firm belief that the said matters be heard by a High Court. Further, bearing in mind the grave consequences to me as an NCMP and professional person in addition to the possibility of a custodial sentence I believe this case involves matters of public interest.` It appeared to me that it was fashionable to make scurrilous allegations of this kind. The law must take its course. The real question was whether this court would fairly and legitimately treat politicians who were charged differently from accused persons who were not politicians. As was held by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 336
  at p 339: `It is beyond question that all accused persons should be treated equally regardless of status.`
The final ground of the applicant as contained in para 40 of the applicant`s affidavit was that if he was tried in the High Court and convicted he would have a further recourse to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. This ground was rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
 for the reasons they gave and I need not repeat them in this judgment. The criminal motion was accordingly dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an application by the plaintiff seeking a declaratory judgment for the following orders: 
 
(i) that the plaintiff did not cease to be an elected member of the Sixth Parliament on 10 November 1986;
 
 
 
 
(ii) that the plaintiff was at all material times the elected member of the Sixth Parliament for the electoral district of Anson and continued in that capacity until the dissolution of Parliament on 17 August 1988; 
 
(iii) that the announcement by the Speaker of the Sixth parliament on 9 December 1986 that the plaintiff had vacated his seat was a nullity; and 
 
(iv) that the plaintiff is qualified to offer himself for election to Parliament in any election for any vacancy arising in Parliament.
  
 
 
Before I go into the issues raised in this originating summons, it is necessary that I set out briefly the background facts. The plaintiff first became a Member of Parliament for the Constituency of Anson on 31 October 1981 when he was elected at a by-election in that constituency. During the general election held in December 1984, the plaintiff was reelected the Member of Parliament for the same constituency.
In December 1983 the plaintiff, together with on other person (Wong), were jointly charged and tried before the then senior district judge (SDJ Khoo), for three offences under s 421 (concealment of property) of the Penal Code. The plaintiff and Wong were each separately charged with a fourth offence under s 199 (false declaration) of the Penal Code. The then SDJ Khoo convicted the plaintiff and Wong of a charge under s 421, involving a cheque of $400, but acquitted them of all the other charges. For that conviction the plaintiff and Wong were each sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000.
Both the plaintiff and Wong appealed against the conviction to the High Court. The public prosecutor also appealed against the acquittals as well as the sentence imposed on the charge on which the plaintiff and Wong were convicted. The appeals came up for hearing before the Chief Justice who, in a judgment given in April 1985, set aside the acquittal as regards the charge under s 199 and ordered a retrial of both persons on that charge. He allowed the appeal of the public prosecutor against the acquittals on the two charges under s 421 and sentenced each of the accused to pay a fine of $ 1,000 on each charge. On the $400 charge under s 421 the Chief Justice dismissed both the appeals of the plaintiff and Wong against conviction and that of the public prosecutor against sentence.
In June 1985, pursuant to s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed), the plaintiff and Wong applied to the Chief Justice that certain questions of law arising from his decision on the appeals be reserved for the consideration of the Court of Criminal Appeal. The application was refused. The plaintiff and Wong appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against this refusal. This was dismissed. This decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal was affirmed when the plaintiff and Wong`s further application to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (hereinafter referred to as the Privy Council) for special leave to appeal was also turned down.
Retrial on the s 199 charge took place before SDJ Foenander, who convicted both the plaintiff and Wong and sentenced each to a term of imprisonment of three months. They appealed to the High Court. On 10 November 1986, Lai Kew Chai J dismissed the appeals against conviction but allowed the appeals against sentence to the extent that the imprisonment term was reduced to one month plus a fine of $5,000 (here I should explain that the original fine imposed was $10,000; applying s 216 of the Criminal Procedure Code, this was altered to $5,000 later in the afternoon on the same day. The judge was mistaken as to the maximum fine that could be imposed under the law). On 11 November 1986, they applied to Lai Kew Chai J, under s 60(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed), for certain questions of law to be reserved for the Court of Criminal Appeal. This was refused. Both then sought to challenge the refusal of Lai Kew Chai J by an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. They also filed two related criminal motions before the Court of Criminal Appeal. All these were rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal for want of jurisdiction. Their subsequent petition to the Privy Council for special leave to appeal was also rejected for want of jurisdiction.
Following that the Attorney General reported to the Law Society of Singapore that the plaintiff was convicted of three charges under s 421 and one charge under s 199, which showed that the plaintiff was unfit for his profession and requested that the matter be referred to a Disciplinary Committee. The committee, after due deliberation, reported that cause of sufficient gravity existed for disciplinary action to be taken.
The plaintiff was consequently required to show cause before a court of three judges why he should not be struck off, suspended or censured. After hearing the parties, the court on 19 October 1987 ordered that the plaintiff be struck off the roll. The plaintiff appealed to the Privy Council. Applying the test laid down in 
 Ratnam v Law Society of Singapore 
 
 
[1976] 1 MLJ 195
 , the Privy Council felt that the circumstances of the case warranted going behind the four convictions. The Privy Council held that the four convictions were wrong in law and allowed the appeal. Their Lordships accordingly restored him to the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court of Singapore.
In the meantime on 12 November 1986, the Registrar of the Supreme Court informed the Speaker of Parliament of the outcome of the appeal on 10 November 1986 and also of the refusal of the High Court to an application of the plaintiff that a question of law be reserved for the Court of Criminal Appeal. On the same day, the Clerk of Parliament wrote to the Attorney General, who on 13 November 1986 confirmed that the plaintiff was disqualified to be and ceased to be a Member of Parliament with effect from 10 November 1986.
On 27 November 1986, the plaintiff, through his own law firm, wrote a letter to the Speaker indicating his intention to attend the sitting of Parliament on 9 December 1986 and requesting the Speaker to make arrangements to enable him to do so. The Speaker sought the advice of the Attorney General who again stated that the plaintiff had become disqualified to be a Member from 10 November 1986. On 9 December 1986, the Speaker made a statement notifying the House of the letter he received from JB Jeyaretnam & Co and also of the advice he received from the Attorney General; he also informed the House that the plaintiff had ceased to be a Member of Parliament with effect from 10 November 1986. No query on this matter was subsequently raised by any member of the House or by the plaintiff.
Counsel for the plaintiff argues for this present application on two distinct grounds. First, in relation to the first three prayers, he submits that in the absence of a resolution of Parliament the plaintiff never ceased to be a Member of Parliament. In this regard he relies particularly on art 48 of the Constitution of Singapore. He contends that the statement of the Speaker of the House was insufficient to disqualify the plaintiff from the House. Further at the time when the Speaker made the statement the plaintiff had still not exhausted his legal remedy. Second, in relation to the fourth prayer, counsel submits that in view of the decision of the Privy Council in 
 Jeyaretnam JB v Law Society of Singapore 
 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 425
 , the convictions recorded against the plaintiff on the four charges are clearly bad. He contends that this High Court is bound by that decision of the Privy Council and accordingly the plaintiff is entitled to come before this court to seek a declaration that he is not disqualified to be a Member of Parliament.
 First ground 
I will now proceed to consider the first ground submitted by the plaintiff. For a better appreciation of the submission, it is necessary for me to set out the relevant provisions of the Constitution and they are the following: 
 
45(1) ... a person shall not be qualified to be a member of Parliament who -
 
 
 
 
(e) has been convicted of an offence by a court of law in Singapore or Malaysia and sentenced to imprisonment for a term of not less than one year or to fine of not less than $2,000 and has not received a free pardon ...
  
 
 
46(2) The seat of a member of Parliament shall become vacant -
(e) if he becomes subject to any of the disqualifications specified in art 45.
 
 
 
48 Any question whether -
(a) any Member of Parliament has vacated his seat therein; or 
(b) in the case of any person who has been elected as Speaker or Deputy Speaker from among persons who are not members of parliament, any circumstance has arisen that, if he had been elected to a seat in Parliament, would cause him to vacate his seat by virtue of art 46(2)(a) or (e), 
shall be determined by Parliament whose decision shall be final:
 
 
 
Provided that this article shall not be taken to prevent the practice of Parliament postponing a decision in order to allow for the taking or determination of any proceedings that may affect the decision (including proceedings for the removal of the disqualification).
 
 
 
There is no doubt that on 10 November 1986 the plaintiff was convicted of an offence under s 199 when his appeal against that conviction was affirmed by the High Court. The sentence imposed on him by SDJ Foenander was varied to that of one month`s imprisonment, plus a fine of $5,000. Under the law there was no further right of appeal from the decision of the High Court to the Court of Criminal Appeal unless, pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed), the High Court should decide to reserve a point of law of public interest for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal. Such an application of the plaintiff to the High Court was refused by the judge on 11 November 1986. There the matter ended.
Notwithstanding the clear legal position, the plaintiff tried to appeal by filing on 19 November 1986 a notice of appeal against the decision of Lai Kew Chai J given on 11 November 1986 in refusing to reserve a point of law of public interest for the Court of Criminal Appeal. On that same day he also filed a criminal motion before the Court of Criminal Appeal (No 61 of 1986) asking the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider certain questions of law under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 15, 1970 Ed). On 19 December 1986 he filed another criminal motion (No 65 of 1986) before the Court of Criminal Appeal asking for an order that the original fine of $10,000 imposed by Lai Kew Chai J was null and void and the subsequent alteration on that same day to $5,000 was also null and void. As I have indicated above, the appeal and the two criminal motions were rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal on 28 April 1987 and eventually by the Privy Council on 29 July 1987 on the ground that there was no jurisdiction to entertain them. Both fora did not really go into the merits.
Therefore, effectively on 11 November 1986 all legal recourse available to the plaintiff had been exhausted. As from 10 November 1986 the plaintiff stood convicted of an offence and was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one month and a fine of $5,000. His case clearly came within the ambit of art 45(1)(e) of the Constitution. And by virtue of art 46(2)(e), the seat of the plaintiff as a Member of Parliament of the constituency of Anson `shall become vacant`.
I turn next to art 48 of the Constitution upon which considerable emphasis has been placed by counsel for the plaintiff. That article provides that `any question whether any Member of Parliament has vacated his seat therein ... shall be determined by Parliament whose decision shall be final`. I would make three observations on this provision. First, this article in no way restricts or modifies the scope of arts 45(1) and 46(2). Secondly, it is really a provision empowering Parliament to decide any such question if it should arise and such decision of Parliament shall be final; it does not say that a member shall only vacate his seat on a decision of the House. Thirdly, the article talks about whether any Member of Parliament `has vacated` his seat and not, for example, `is to vacate` his seat.
Mr Thomas relies on two Malaysian cases in support of his contention that unless there is a resolution of the House, a member though falling within the ambit of art 45(1)(e) may continue to be a member: 
 Fan Yew Teng v Setia Usaha, Dewan Ra`ayat & Ors 
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 40
  and 
 Michael Ben Anak Panggi v PP 
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 65
 , both decisions of the Malaysian High Court.
In 
 Fan Yew Teng 
 , the plaintiff, who was a member of the Malaysian Parliament, was convicted on 13 January 1975 in the High Court for an offence under the Sedition Act and was sentenced to a fine of $2,000 or six months` imprisonment. On the same day he appealed against the said decision. The appeal was pending in the Federal Court when by a letter dated 4 February 1975 the first defendant informed the plaintiff that on his conviction and sentence he had become disqualified under art 48(1)(e) of the Federal Constitution and by virtue of art 50(1) his seat had become vacant. On 17 February 1975 the Election Commission by writ of election directed that there be a by-election. The requisite notice was published in the 20 February 1975 issue of 
 Utusan Malaysia 
 newspaper. Following that, the plaintiff instituted an originating summons questioning the assertion that his seat had become vacant. Mohamed Azmi J said (at p 42): 
 
... it is my conclusion that the mere fact that a member of Parliament has been convicted and sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000 and has not received a free pardon does not render his seat vacant automatically 
 in all cases
 under art 50(1). In my view where a member has appealed against his conviction and sentence, the matter becomes sub judice and accordingly a question or dispute has arisen as to his disqualifications, and as such it is wrong to consider arts 48(1)(e) and 50(1) only without regard to the provision of art 53. It is my finding that where a question or dispute has arisen whether a Member of Parliament has become disqualified, the seat of that particular member shall only become vacant when he becomes disqualified and the power to decide whether he has become disqualified or not clearly rests with the Dewan to which he belongs by virtue of art 53.
 
 
 
[Emphasis added. The Malaysian arts 48(1)(e), 50(1) and 53 are the equivalent of our arts 45(1)(e), 46(2) and 48, with some slight differences in wording.]
 
 
 
As compared with our present case, there are at least two distinguishing features in 
 Fan Yew Teng 
. First, the plaintiff there had appealed to the Federal Court exercising his undoubted right to appeal; legal proceedings were still pending. Secondly, on being informed by the Setia Usaha of the Malaysian Parliament that he had been disqualified from being a Member of Parliament and that his seat had become vacant and on the issue of the requisite notice for a by-election, he questioned that assertion and immediately commenced the action in court. In those circumstances I could see the relevance of the Malaysian art 53 and the need for a decision of the House. Mohamed Azmi J even said that `the power given to the House of Parliament under art 53 is so clear and overriding that it can be exercised even where a member of the House has not fully exhausted his legal rights.`
In our present case, the decision of the High Court was in exercise of its appellate criminal jurisdiction. There was no further right of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The plaintiff, having been informed by the Speaker of Parliament that in law he had ceased to be a Member of Parliament, accepted it without any further query. He did not challenge what was communicated to him. Therefore, there was no question before Parliament which Parliament needed to take a decision. The position in our present case is entirely different from that in 
 Fan Yew Teng 
 . I would observe that Mohamed Azmi J did not say that in every case before a Member of Parliament is disqualified and his seat becomes vacant there must be a resolution of the House. In fact he impliedly recognized there could be automatic vacation of a seat when he stated that the fact that a member had been convicted and fined for not less than $2,000 `does not render his seat vacant automatically in all cases under art 50(1)`. Then one may ask what would be the instances where automatic disqualification and vacation of seat would occur. I could think of two situations straight away - when the member has exhausted all his rights of appeal or if he decides not to appeal. On the facts of the case in 
 Fan Yew Teng 
, I would humbly agree with the decision therein.
Turning to 
 Michael Ben Anak Panggi 
 , that was a case where the applicant, a member of the Sarawak State Legislative Assembly (Dewan), on an appeal to the High Court had his sentence for an offence under s 379 of the Malaysian Penal Code varied from one of ten months` imprisonment to a fine of $2,000. Subsequently, by way of a motion he sought to have the High Court refer two questions of law to the Federal Court under s 66(1) of the Malaysian Courts of Judicature Act 1964. That application was refused. It was also argued that the direct result of the sentence would be to disqualify the applicant from continuing to be a member of the Dewan and the sentence accordingly contravened art 19 of the Sarawak Constitution (which provides that if any question arises whether a member has ceased to be qualified, the decision of the Council shall be taken and shall be final). Yusoff J having quoted with approval a part of the passage of Mohamed Azmi J in 
 Fan Yew Teng 
, which I have set out above, went on to hold that (at p 67): 
 
the applicant was not automatically disqualified and did not cease to be a member of the Dewan upon his conviction of an offence and sentence to $2,000 fine. A question in the Council has to be raised on such disqualification before the Dewan could take a decision to disqualify him and determine his tenure of seat.
 
 
 
Yusoff J appears to hold that in every case of a member of the Dewan having been convicted and sentenced to a fine of not less than $2,000 he does not cease to be a member until a question is raised and decided in the Council. The judgment itself does not set out fully all the relevant provisions of the Sarawak Constitution. Perhaps those provisions warrant such a finding. I would, however, make these observations. First, 
 Fan Yew Teng 
`s case was certainly not on all fours with 
 Michael Ben Anak Panggi 
`s case - in 
 Fan Yew Teng 
 an appeal as of right was still pending whereas in 
 Michael Ben Anak Panggi 
 there could be no further appeal. The criminal process in 
 Michael Ben Anak Panggi 
 had ended. This distinction does not appear to have been noted. Secondly, Yusoff J seems to place no significance on the following words of Mohamed Azmi J which he had cited with approval: `... does not render his seat vacant automatically in all cases under art 50(1)`. Thirdly, if the relevant Sarawak provisions are in fact indistinguishable from the Singapore provisions, then I would, with respect, say that the views expressed by Yusoff J might be just a little too wide. Obviously if a member of the Dewan though convicted and sentenced to a fine of $2,000 persists in asserting that he is not disqualified, then the Dewan must decide the question. That appears to be the position in 
 Michael Ben Anak Panggi 
. But if he should let the matter be and no longer asserts he is still a member, I do not see why the Dewan should have to decide anything.
In my judgment, arts 45, 46 and 48 of our Constitution should be given their plain meaning and applied in a sensible and practical manner. It is one thing to say that a question whether a Member of Parliament has vacated his seat shall be determined by Parliament; it is another to say that no member shall cease to be a member and his seat vacated until Parliament has so decided. To illustrate my point, take for example art 46(2)(c); it says that the seat of a member shall become vacant `if, by writing under his hand addressed to the Speaker, he resigns his seat in Parliament`. Of course the Speaker will inform the House of the resignation. But is there a need for Parliament to take a formal decision on the letter of resignation? Can it be said that until Parliament takes a decision on it, the person does not cease to be a member? Is there a question before the House? I can see none. The construction contended for by the plaintiff runs counter to the plain words of arts 46(2)(c) and 48.
As I see it, the purpose of art 48 is two-fold. First, it recognizes that the circumstances under art 46(2) where the seat of a member could become vacant are numerous and some of those could be controversial; thus the need for Parliament to decide such a question should it arise. Second, that such a question, if it arises, shall be decided by Parliament and its decision shall be final. When such a question does arise Parliament must decide and not the court.
Now after a lapse of almost three years from the date of the decision of the High Court and long after the Sixth Parliament had been dissolved (on 17 August 1988), the plaintiff by this originating summons filed on 6 October 1989 raises the question that he was still a member until 17 August 1988. It is clearly too late for him to do so after the Sixth Parliament had ceased to exist. It is not for this court to decide such an issue.
I accept the submission of the Attorney General that the Speaker made no decision when he informed the House on 9 December 1986 that the plaintiff had ceased to be a member from 10 November 1986. A plain reading of the Hansard will bear that out. In the circumstances of this case as I have outlined, his seat had become vacant by operation of law.
I may add that a system of automatic disqualification is not something exceptional. Under the English Forfeiture Act 1870, a person convicted of felony and sentenced to a term exceeding 12 months` imprisonment was automatically disqualified from sitting or voting in Parliament. This was amended by the English Criminal Law Act 1967 which abolished automatic disqualification and disqualification from sitting in Parliament during sentence became entirely a matter for the House of Commons to decide. However, the Representation of the People Act 1981 restores the automatic disqualification from membership of the House of Commons of those convicted persons who are sentenced or ordered to be imprisoned or detained indefinitely or for more than one year so long as they are detained or are unlawfully at large. The seat of a member who is so disqualified shall be vacated. Such a person may not be nominated for election and if nominated, that nomination shall be void.
Mr Thomas also drew my attention to the case involving one Peter Arthur David Baker, where the English House of Commons took a formal decision to expel him from the House. The report in the Hansard does not indicate whether the case came within the Forfeiture Act 1870, ie offence was a felony and the sentence was more than 12 months` imprisonment. But the letter written by Baker clearly asked the Speaker and the House to dispossess him of his seat without delay. I can find nothing in that case which is of assistance in the interpretation of arts 45, 46 and 48 of our Constitution.
For the reasons aforesaid, I reject the first ground put forward on behalf of the plaintiff.
 Second ground 
I now turn to the second ground advanced by counsel for the plaintiff. What he says may be simply put as follows: the Privy Council has in the disciplinary case ruled that the convictions recorded against the plaintiff on the four charges were bad in law. The Privy Council formed part of the judicial system of Singapore and therefore its judgment on an appeal from Singapore was and is binding on all courts in Singapore. What the plaintiff now seeks under prayer (iv) is a declaration from this court that notwithstanding the conviction under s 199 and sentence imposed, the plaintiff is entitled to come to court to ask for a declaration that he is not disqualified to offer himself for election to Parliament should an election occur. Counsel concedes that he is not asking that the conviction be erased or be set aside as that cannot be done. He argues that it could not have been the intention of art 45(1)(e) to apply to a case where the conviction is bad. In support of his contention that the plaintiff is entitled to a declaration of his rights he relies on 
 Munnich v Godstone Rural District Council 
 [1966] 1 All ER 930.
In 
 Munnich 
 , the plaintiff and another whose name was Taras bought a one and a half acre field on which was a rough sort of bungalow. In early 1960, they allowed four caravans on the field. In March 1960, the Godstone Rural District Council (Godstone RDC) served four enforcement notices on the owners and a notice each on the occupier of each caravan requiring them to remove the caravans concerned from the field. The notices were disregarded. More caravans came on to the field. On 29 August 1960 the Caravan Sites and Control of Development Act 1960 came into operation and within two months the owners applied for a site licence but it was refused. On 16 April 1962, the plaintiff pleaded guilty to permitting the land to be used as a caravan site in contravention of the enforcement notice and was fined. In June 1962 the plaintiff issued a writ against Godstone RDC claiming a declaration that he had `deemed permission` for the site and that he was entitled to a site licence. In November 1962, the plaintiff was charged again with continuing to permit the land to be used as a caravan site in contravention of the notice. The plaintiff`s counsel argued strenuously that the enforcement notice was bad. The justices nonetheless convicted and fined him. In July 1964, the plaintiff was charged again for the same offence. He pleaded not guilty but was convicted and fined. No appeal against those convictions was taken up by the plaintiff. Then the civil action commenced by the plaintiff came on for hearing. Mocatta J held that the enforcement notice was bad; that in consequence the plaintiff had a `deemed permission` to use the land as a caravan site and he was entitled to a site licence. He made a declaration to that effect. Godstone RDC appealed to the Court of Appeal and contended that in view of the convictions the court ought not to entertain this claim for a declaration. Lord Denning MR said (at p 933): 
 
The courts have in recent years been ready to use the machinery of declaration far more than they used to do and it has proved most useful ... . But it must not be carried too far. If this were a case where a defendant was seeking to reverse a finding against him on the facts, we should not entertain it for a moment ... . When property rights, however, come into question, it may be different. A criminal court is not the best of tribunals to deal with vexed questions of rights to property ... and I would not myself be prepared to throw out this case simply on the ground that the matter had already been adjudged in the magistrates` court.
 
 
 
Salmon LJ asked (at p 936): 
 
Suppose that it is shown that a man under a mistake as to the law pleads guilty to an offence of this kind which he has not in fact committed, does that take away his ordinary common law right of coming to the High Court and asking for a declaration as to his property rights?
 
 
 
and he answered: 
 
I cannot for myself accept that in a case which turns entirely on a point of law, the fact that a man had made a mistake as to the law before the magistrates takes away his right of coming to the High Court or makes it improper for him to do so.
 
 
 
It was obvious that a factor that weighed very much in the consideration of the Court of Appeal whether to exercise its discretion was the fact that the conviction was before a magistrates` court of lay justices. Denning MR felt that such a court could not be expected to competently deal with property rights questions. But this reasoning can have no application to our present case. It would also be noted that Denning MR recognized that there was a limit to the use of the machinery of declaration. I ought to add that on the merits of the claim the Court of Appeal disagreed with Mocatta J that the enforcement notice was bad and refused a declaration.
Reference was also made by counsel for the plaintiff to 
 Arnold & Ors v National Westminster Bank 
 [1988] 3 All ER 977. There the question under consideration was issue estoppel. The facts are succinctly set out in the headnote to the report and they are as follows: 
 
In 1983 on the first rent review date of a lease a dispute arose between the landlords and the tenants over whether the `fair market rent` defined in the lease meant the rent under a hypothetical lease containing the same provision for five-yearly rent reviews as the actual lease or the rent under a hypothetical lease containing no provision for reviews. The judge held that the hypothetical lease was to be treated as containing no provision for rent reviews. Shortly before the second review date the lessees instituted proceedings seeking rectification of the lease and a determination of the true construction of the rent review clause on the ground that subsequent cases had shown the judge`s decision on the first rent review to be wrong. The landlords applied to strike out the claim on the ground that there was an issue estoppel between the parties which prevented the tenants from re- litigating the matter.
 
 
 
Browne-Wilkinson V-C held that a subsequent change in the law which indicated that an earlier decision on a point sought to be reopened in a second action was wrong was capable of bringing the case within the exception to the doctrine of issue estoppel where the injustice of not allowing the matter to be relitigated outweighed the hardship to the successful party in the first action in having to relitigate the point. In my view 
 Arnold 
`s case is entirely different and is of no assistance to me.
The Attorney General argues that what the plaintiff here seeks to do is to negate the effect of the criminal convictions through proceedings for a declaratory order in a civil court. He seeks to have his convictions redetermined. The Attorney General pointed out that, even the Privy Council recognized that it could not disturb the convictions. Accordingly, he submits that this proceeding amounts to an abuse of the process of the court. In support, he cited 
 Eshah bte Sa`at v Meriam bte Sa`at & Ors 
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 97
  and 
 lmperial Tobacco Co Ltd & Anor v A-G 
[1980] 1 All ER 866. I do not think I need go too much into these two cases as the principles they lay down are fairly well established. 
 Eshah bte Sa`at 
 decided that a civil court should not by a declaratory order rule that a determination of the Collector of Land Revenue in a distribution suit is wrong; the proper proceedings should be by certiorari. In 
 Imperial Tobacco 
 , the House of Lords held that where criminal proceedings were properly instituted against a person, it was not a proper exercise of judicial discretion for a judge in a civil court to grant that person a declaration that the facts alleged by the prosecution did not in law prove the offence charged, because to make such a declaration would usurp the function of the criminal court. All the more so, Mr Tan argues, that where by the criminal process a person has been duly convicted and sentenced by a lower court for an offence and that conviction is upheld on appeal by the High Court exercising appellate criminal jurisdiction, it would be improper for a civil court to grant a declaratory order that the conviction is bad and cannot stand.
Having considered the arguments of both Mr Thomas and the Attorney General it is my opinion that it would be wrong to grant the declaration asked for by the plaintiff. This would be stretching the machinery of declaration too far. Before me, neither Mr Thomas nor the Attorney General sought to go into the merits or demerits of the conviction under s 199. I would not have been inclined to hear them on that if either of them had wanted to do so as I do not think it proper for me to review the decision of another court of equal competence which was exercising its appellate criminal jurisdiction. But Mr Thomas says that under the doctrine of precedent the views on the four convictions expressed by the Privy Council in the disciplinary case bind me. Obviously those views must carry very great weight. For the present purposes, I do not think I need decide whether they are strictly binding on me. I would only observe that those views of the Privy Council were not expressed in an appeal against the four convictions where the Public Prosecutor was a party. They were expressed in an appeal on a disciplinary matter where the convictions on the four charges formed the substance of the complaint against the plaintiff. On a strict application of the doctrine of stare decisis I would be inclined to think that those views are obiter dicta rather than ratio decidendi. Be that as it may, the correct procedure to adopt to overcome the convictions (assuming they are bad), has been clearly indicated by the Privy Council itself in the disciplinary case (at p 434): 
 
... Their only prospect of redress, their Lordships understand, will be way of petition for pardon to the President of the Republic of Singapore.
 
 
 
Even Mr Thomas recognizes the difficulties of the point he is making. As I have mentioned above, he has to concede that he is not asking that the conviction be set aside as that cannot be done. That was also what the Privy Council had in fact said. But the practical effect of the declaratory order which he now asks me to make is to do that very thing which cannot be done, ie to remove or set aside the conviction on the s 199 charge so that the plaintiff will no longer be disqualified to be a Member of Parliament. It is without question that a civil court cannot set aside a criminal conviction. This court will not usurp a jurisdiction which it does not possess. The course which the plaintiff urges upon me to take clearly deviates from the established procedure under our criminal justice system, which is, if at the end of the day it is shown that a person`s conviction is wrong (for whatever reasons) and there is no further process for appeal, the only recourse available to that person is to petition the President for a pardon. Indeed this procedure is implicitly recognized in art 45(1)(e) itself where it also refers to a free pardon. To go by way of a civil action for such a declaratory order is not a process I would sanction.
If I were to grant prayer (iv), that would not only cause confusion but I would be declaring something which is contrary to arts 45(1)(e) and 46(2)(e). Clearly, whether a conviction is subsequently considered good or bad, it remains a conviction unless it is removed by a free pardon from the President. Only such a pardon can remove the disqualification. It is significant that the Privy Council did not say that because the conviction was bad, therefore, art 45(1)(e) did not apply and the plaintiff was not disqualified from being a M ember of Parliament. Instead, it accepted that a petition for a pardon was the only available redress.
Finally, as I understand it, the plaintiff has petitioned the President for a pardon. But that has been refused. I hope the plaintiff is not thinking that by this originating summons he could indirectly get this court to override the President`s refusal to exercise the prerogative of mercy even though no question regarding the exercise of the prerogative is raised in this application. But I would only add this. I have serious doubts, as is the position in England, that the manner of the exercise of this prerogative is a matter that can be questioned in court: see 
 Hanratty v Lord Butler of Saffron Walden 
(1971) 115 SJ 386.
In the result, and having given this matter the most careful consideration, the application in this originating summons has to be dismissed with costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This action for slander arose out of what the defendant had uttered in the course of an electioneering speech made on 26 August 1988 in the Parliamentary general elections of 1988 before a crowd of about 7,000 people at Bedok Town Centre, car park no 6. The trial of this action, which lasted four days, is concerned with the usual, and in this case the most important, issue as to the ordinary and natural meaning of the speech complained of. The second issue is whether the defence of fair comment avails the defendant. The third issue is whether, as the defendant asserted, there is a novel defence of privilege based on art 14(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore. Fourthly, where the answer of this court to the second issue and/or third issue is in the affirmative, only then will the question arise as to whether the defendant was actuated by malice which would be fatal to the defences of fair comment and privilege. The fifth matter for consideration in this trial is the quantum of damages if the defendant is liable for the slander and, finally, this court has to decide whether in its discretion it will grant the injunction sought.
At the commencement of the trial there was some doubt, having regard to the averments of para 5 of the defence which was later renumbered as para 7 of the amended defence, whether the defendant was relying on the defence of justification. Those averments, followed by certain particulars of facts, are in these terms: 
 
Further or in the further alternative, in so far as the words used by the defendant consist of allegations of fact, they are true in substance and in fact.
 
 
 
Those averments do not allege that the particulars of facts pleaded apparently by way of justification go to prove the truth of the defamatory meaning of the words as contended by the plaintiff. Nor do they seek to justify any lesser defamatory meaning or meanings which have to be spelt out in accordance with the decision of 
 Lucas-Box v News Group Newspapers Ltd 
[1986] 1 WLR 147
. If 
 Lucas-Box 
 has been followed, the issue or issues would have been defined between the parties and they and this court would have been assisted when it came to deal with this aspect of the case. Inevitably, Mr Eady, learned counsel for the plaintiff, submitted that unless the particulars justify the published words in some defamatory meaning, they were irrelevant and should be struck out. However, Mr Thomas, learned counsel for the defendant, made it clear to this court that the defendant was not pleading justification as a defence and that the particulars listed will be relied upon only in support of the plea of fair comment. In those circumstances, para 7 of the amended defence was allowed to stand so far as they may be relevant to the issue of fair comment.
 The parties 
The plaintiff was admitted to practise as an advocate and solicitor in August 1951. He has been very active in politics. In November 1954, he became the secretary-general of the Peoples` Action Party (PAP) on its foundation and, save for a brief interlude of a month in 1957, has held that office ever since. In March 1955, he became a member of the Legislative Assembly. In the May 1959 general elections, the PAP won a majority and the plaintiff formed the government and became the Prime Minister of Singapore. Since then there has been eight general elections which the PAP won. Throughout this period the plaintiff has remained the Prime Minister.
The defendant is also an advocate and solicitor. He was for a time in the Singapore Legal Service where he rose to become the Registrar of the Supreme Court and the equivalent of the senior district judge in 1963. He went into private practice in 1964. On 27 June 1971 he joined the Workers` Party and on the same day became its secretary-general. He has held that office ever since. He unsuccessfully contested a number of elections between 1972 and 1980. In October 1981 he won the by-election for the Anson seat. In the 1984 general elections he retained the Anson seat with an increased majority. However, he was declared by the Speaker of Parliament to be disqualified from Parliament following a conviction for an offence under the Penal Code.
 The factual background 
In August 1988, general elections were called. Polling day was scheduled for 3 September 1988. The PAP contested all 81 parliamentary seats in 55 electoral divisions and won all of them save one seat. Two defeated Workers` Party candidates were declared as non- constituency members but one of them, Mr Francis Seow Tiang Slew, was disqualified with effect from 17 December 1988 under art 45(i)(c) of the Constitution of Singapore because he was convicted of five offences and fined $3,000 each for three offences and $5,000 each for two offences. The Workers` Party contested in 20 electoral divisions having a total of 32 seats. The defendant was not himself a candidate because of his disqualification from Parliament. However, he ran the election campaign for the Workers` Party as secretary-general and spoke in about 24 election rallies in support of his party`s parliamentary candidates. In response to the plaintiff`s emphatic and oft-repeated call for `high moral and intellectual ground`, the defendant in the election hustings questioned the honesty of the PAP government. In the course of his attack against the claim of the PAP government that it was an honest government, the defendant referred to the suicide of Mr Teh Cheang Wan, the former Minister for National Development. It was submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that in the course of such an attack at the Workers` Party rally on 26 August 1988 at the Bedok Town Centre, car park no 6, the defendant had slandered him. Before I turn to the speech of the defendant in question, I need to set out the context relevant for the purposes of this action.
On 20 November 1986 the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB), which was answerable to the plaintiff as the Prime Minister, learnt for the first time of an allegation that $500,000 had been paid some years earlier to Mr Teh Cheang Wan as bribes. One Liaw Teck Kee was alleged to be the intermediary and he was asked by the CPIB for an interview. Liaw Teck Kee immediately visited Mr Teh Cheang Wan to warn him. On the following day the plaintiff was informed by the CPIB of the allegation of corruption against Mr Teh Cheang Wan. The plaintiff authorized discreet investigations to continue. On 25 November 1986 one Liu Cho Chit on behalf of Mr Teh Cheang Wan offered a bribe to Liaw Teck Kee to induce Liaw Teck Kee not to implicate Mr Teh Cheang Wan. Liu Cho Chit later pleaded guilty to this offence in the district court. Towards the end of November 1986, Mr Teh Cheang Wan was in Jakarta, Indonesia where he attended the eighth meeting of ASEAN Ministers on Agriculture and Forestry. At this time, the plaintiff was asked by the CPIB to authorize open investigations which meant that Mr Teh Cheang Wan and other witnesses would be interrupted by officers of the CPIB. The plaintiff gave the authority. Following the interrogation of Mr Teh Cheang Wan he was instructed on 2 December 1986 by the plaintiff to take leave of absence until 31 December 1986. On 11 December 1986 the investigation papers were referred to the Attorney General as public prosecutor to consider prosecution.
On 13 December 1986 Mr Teh Cheang Wan wrote a letter to the plaintiff to `bring some relevant points of the investigations` to his attention. In the letter he referred to two allegations put to him by CPIB. The first allegation was that he had assisted a private developer so that two- thirds and not the entire piece of land were acquired by the Ministry of Defence and that he further assisted in facilitating the development of the remaining one-third of the land. The second allegation was that he had assisted in the sale of a piece of state land to another private developer who could after amalgamation with his own land put up a bigger hotel. It was alleged that he had received $800,000 as gratification for being in the two cases. Mr Teh Cheang Wan went on in his letter to explain that he had assisted in the first case because it was morally right to intervene and that the second case was not an uncommon occurrence where the proposed development merited amalgamation. He thought the truth of the matters was that Liaw Teck Kee had taken advantage of his personal relationship with him and that Liaw Teck Kee had pocketed the money paid by the two private developers. He ended the letter in these terms: 
 
11 I am completely innocent of any gratification. If I am brought to trial, the very process of it (sic) which will be painful and long, will certainly be the end of me even if I am found innocent. I strongly believe that innocence deserves to be protected.
 
 
 
 
(12) I am extremely sorry that matters have come where the reputation of the PAP government might be adversely affected. My error has been in wrongly trusting a friend who has made use of me for his own profit. I am willing to accept full responsibility for this. 
 I would accept any 
 decision which you may want to make 
. (The emphasis is added as references to this sentence have to be made later.)
  
 
 
At about 8am on 14 December 1986 Mr Teh Cheang Wan was found dead in his home at 12 Bukit Tunggal Road, Singapore. The autopsy carried out later that day established that death was due to an overdose of Amytal barbiturate.
At 9.15am on 14 December 1986 the security officer of Mr Teh Cheang Wan delivered to the plaintiff a letter which Mr Teh Cheang Wan had addressed to him shortly before his death. The plaintiff knew that this letter had to be turned over to the State Coroner and had duly noted on the envelope `opened and read 9.15am 14 December 1986, LKY`. In the undated handwritten letter to the plaintiff Mr Teh Cheang Wan stated that he had been feeling very sad and depressed for the two weeks preceding, that he felt responsible for `this unfortunate incident` and that he should accept full responsibility. He ended the letter by saying: `As an honourable oriental gentleman, I feel it is only right I should pay the highest penalty for my mistake.`
A coroner`s inquest was held on 20 January 1987. Mr Evan Yeo, director of CPIB, gave evidence of the investigations on Mr Teh Cheang Wan and of the referral of the investigation papers to the Attorney General. Mr Teh Cheang Wan`s undated letter was produced in court. Professor Chao Tzee Cheng, clinical professor and senior forensic pathologist, Department of Pathology, opined in evidence that the cause of death was `Amylobarbital poisoning`, that Mr Teh Cheang Wan had taken a lethal dosage of 2,000mg of Amytal barbiturate, which was 10 to 20 times the normal dosage and twice the known lethal dosage of 1,000mg. In the light of those evidence the state coroner returned a verdict of suicide.
Following the verdict of the state coroner, the Workers` Party on 21 January 1987 at a press conference called for a Commission of Inquiry to be appointed immediately to inquire into the allegations disclosed at the coroner`s inquest that Mr Teh Cheang Wan had received bribes of two sums. At the press conference, the defendant said that he hoped the government would not close the file with the coroner`s inquest, that the public should know fully everything concerning the allegations and that it was essential for public confidence in the government that the public be told the whole truth.
On 26 January 1987 the plaintiff as Prime Minister made a statement in Parliament on the suicide. He stated, inter alia, as follows: 
 
(a) The Director of the CPIB, Mr Evan Yeo, had seen me on 21 November on a complaint of corruption against Teh Cheang Wan. I asked that investigation be discreet because once people come to know that the CPIB was investigating so prominent as that for National Development, the news would spread like windfire. The Ministry for National had more opportunities for corrupt than practices than any other. A minister`s reputation would be put to severe test by an investigation. Such an investigation could not be secret. Therefore, once open investigation had started, they would have to go on until all the evidence is uncovered to show either that the complaints are baseless, or that there is enough evidence to submit to the Attorney General for him to place before a court of law for trial and judgment. [Hansard, 26 January 1987, cols 933-934.]
 
 
 
 
(b) Sir, there is no way a minister can avoid investigations, and a trial if there is evidence to support one. Teh Cheang Wan chose death rather than face a trial on the charges of corruption which the Attorney General had yet to settle. The effectiveness of our system to check and punish corruption rests, first, on the law against corruption contained in the Prevention of Corruption Act; second, on a vigilant public ready to give information on all suspected corruption; and third, on a CPIB which is scrupulous, thorough, and fearless in its investigations. For this to be so, the CPIB has to receive the full backing of the Prime Minister under whose portfolio it comes. But the strongest deterrent is in a public opinion which censures and condemns corrupt persons, in other words, in attitudes which make corruption so unacceptable that the stigma of corruption cannot be washed away by serving a prison sentence. [ibid, col 935.]
  
 
 
Dr Arthur Beng Kian Lam (Member of Parliament for Fengshan) asked whether any other persons, in particular, officials of the Ministry of National Development had been implicated in the allegations for which Mr Teh Cheang Wan was being investigated. The plaintiff said: 
 
The investigations have not disclosed the complicity of any other person in the ministry. There was in the case of the land acquisition an unusualness in procedure. The land having been acquired, an appeal was lodged. It usually takes six months to a year for the appeal to be heard and for it to go before the minister for his decision. In this case, the appeal was never heard, and the minister intervened and gave his decision without an appeal ever being heard. No complicity by any official was involved. It was the minister`s personal intervention. Therefore, the officers of the CPIB who conducted this investigation are satisfied that there was no complicity and no aiding and abetting by any official of the ministry or any other permanent secretary or minister or parliamentary secretary. [Ibid, cols 936-937.]
 
 
 
The Workers` Party responded to the ministerial statement of the plaintiff. By a press release dated 27 January 1987 the Workers` Party questioned why the plaintiff as Prime Minister had not decided to hold a public inquiry into the allegations made against one of his ministers. It said there were several questions which had not been answered in the plaintiff`s statement to Parliament. The questions were: 
 
(i) What did the Prime Minister do when he received Mr Teh Cheang Wan`s letter of 13 December 1986, which the Prime Minister says he received that morning. Did he respond to Mr Teh`s statement in the last sentence that he would accept any decision which the Prime Minister may make?
 
 
 
 
(ii) The Prime Minister says that he gave Mr Teh leave of absence on 2 December 1986. Why wasn`t a public announcement made then? 
 
(iii) Did the Prime Minister enquire how he was financing the building of his house which the Prime Minister says cost more than $1.5m when Mr Teh told him of his plan to build. 
 
(iv) The Prime Minister has not answered the question as to whether any steps would be taken to recover any sums found to have been received by Mr Teh. The Prime Minister merely contents himself with the statement there is (no) legal provision for the recovery. Why not? 
 
(v) Where and how did Mr Teh get his supply of the tablets? 
 
(vi) The party is dumbfounded at the Prime Minister`s answer that Mr Law Teck Kee would not be prosecuted . Why not? Will anyone be prosecuted?
  
 
 
The suicide of Mr Teh Cheang Wan and the allegations of his corrupt practices, not unexpectedly, attracted enormous publicity and debate. At the sitting of Parliament on 4 March 1987, Mr Chiam See Tong (Member of Parliament for Potong Pasir) called for public inquiry to get to the bottom of `the Teh Cheang Wan affair` and to make recommendations to prevent further corruption in high places. A protracted exchange ensued between the plaintiff and Mr Chiam See Tong. On 26 March 1987, Professor S Jayakumar, the then Second Minister for Law, announced that the government had agreed to a public inquiry and that the President had on 25 March 1987 appointed a Commission of Inquiry consisting of three members. The terms of reference of the Commission were as follows: 
 
(1) To enquire whether -
 
 
 
 
(a) the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau did all that was necessary to uncover all the acts of corruption or criminal wrongdoing of the late Mr Teh Cheang Wan as Minister for National Development; 
 
(b) the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau was thorough in their investigations before concluding that there was no involvement by any other minister, parliamentary secretary, or government officer in these acts of corruption or other criminal wrongdoing; 
 
(c) there has been any attempt to overlook, to conceal or cover up any information concerning corruption or criminal wrongdoing.
  
 
 
(2) To investigate -
(a) into the circumstances which made it possible for the former Minister of National Development to accept the two $400,000 bribes; 
(b) whether other persons were involved or implicated in relation to the said two bribes or other bribes, if any; 
(c) the system used by the Ministry of National Development in 
(i) acquisition/alienation of land; 
(ii) receiving and accepting of tenders; and 
(iii) the operations of its related companies.
 
 
 
(3) If the Commission finds on the evidence that -
(a) in respect of reference 2(b) there were wrongdoings, then it shall refer the person or persons involved or implicated to the appropriate authorities; 
(b) there are shortcomings in the system used by MND and/or any of its or related companies, it shall receive proposals and make recommendations for their improvements and to prevent further corruption.
 
 
 
On 18 December 1987 the Commission of Inquiry submitted its report to the President of the Republic of Singapore. Its findings on the terms of reference were:
 The first term of reference 
 
1 Having considered the evidence, we find that:
 
 
 
 
(a) the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau did all that was necessary to uncover all the acts of corruption and wrongdoing of the late Mr Teh Cheang Wan in investigating complaints of or leads to acts of corruption by the late Mr Teh Cheang Wan as Minister for National Development; 
 
(b) the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau was thorough in their investigations before concluding that there was no involvement by any other minister, parliamentary secretary, or government officer in these acts of corruption or other criminal wrongdoing; 
 
(c) there has been no attempt to overlook, to conceal or cover up any information concerning corruption or criminal wrongdoing.
  
 
 
 
 
 The second and third terms of reference 
 
 
 
 
 
2 Although Mr Chiam failed to lead reference, we are of the view that the evidence adduced before the Commission in respect of the first term of reference is sufficient to enable us to make findings on paragraphs (a) and (b) of the second term of reference. We propose to do so.
 
 
 
 
(3) In respect of paragraph (a), we find, on the evidence, that: 
 
Teh Cheang Wan was able to accept bribes by abusing his position as the Minister of National Development to do favours for Hock Tat Development Pte Ltd and Ho Yeow Koon. 
 
(4) In respect of paragraph (b), we also find, on the evidence, that: 
 
with exception of those persons already identified at the inquiry, no other person was involved or implicated in relation to the two bribes and that there were no other bribes. 
 
(5) As Mr Chiam failed to lead evidence on paragraph (c) of the second term of reference, we are unable to make any finding of the subject matter of the enquiry under this paragraph. In consequence, no finding is required in respect of the third term of reference.
  
 
 
 
 
 The speech 
 
 
 
I now turn to the speech in English made by the defendant which according to the plaintiff constituted a serious and grave slander against him. That speech was fully recorded on video cassette tapes which were by consent produced in court and marked as exhs P1 and P1A. The video cassette tapes were by consent played out and viewed by me in open court for about 40mins during the opening of the case for the plaintiff. On the invitation of both learned counsel I viewed the tapes again after I had concluded the hearing of the case and had reserved judgment. The full text of the defendant`s speech appeared in plaintiffs bundle no 1 at pp 259 to 265. The speech complained of appeared at pp 261 and 262. The authenticity and accuracy of the text of the speech were accepted by the defendant. Its publication was also admitted. The defendant at the beginning of his speech said that he had `a number of serious things to say` that night. He further said that at the Workers` Party rally at Fullerton Square the previous night, he had posed a number of questions to government leaders. He took up the plaintiff`s statement made at the National Day Rally that the government was an honest government and that voters should vote for an honest government. He then referred to specific instances and asked whether the government was honest.
That part of the defendant`s speech of which complaint is made is in the following terms: 
 
Now the (pause) one of the other questions that I asked related to our late minister Mr Teh Cheang Wan (applause), the minister of whom our beloved Prime Minister said where can we get another Teh Cheang Wan? (Applause) What I asked at the Fullerton Square Rally yesterday was this. It was revealed at the coroner`s inquest, and this is another thing, why did we have to wait till the coroner`s inquest to be hold that Teh Cheang Wan had committed suicide? It was revealed at the coroner`s inquest that Teh Cheang Wan committed suicide by taking poison. Well, as everybody in Singapore knows you can`t buy poison over the counter. (Applause) Under the Drugs Act or under the Poisons Act, a register is kept of all the chemists or pharmacists that deal with this drug, this poison and they have to record the persons to whom the poison was supplied and the name of the doctor who prescribed the poison. My question was why hasn`t the government conducted any inquiry to find out how Mr Teh Cheang Wan came by this poison, by these drugs. (Applause) Shouldn`t the people be told? I said it was essential for a government to tell the truth and nothing but the whole truth and not to hide anything. (Applause) Well, to this time there has been no response on that. Well I hope before polling day we will be told how Mr Teh Cheang Wan came by that poison. But I have one other question which I didn`t ask at Fullerton Square but I am going to ask tonight. (Applause) You may recall that it was reported in the Straits Times and that Teh Cheang Wan wrote to the Prime Minister, I think a day before his death, and I think the letter was also published. And if my memory serves me right and I think it does, Mr Teh Cheang Wan ended that letter by saying I am very sorry I will do as you advise. (Applause) My question to our Prime Minister from here tonight is this. Did he respond to that letter from Mr Teh Cheang Wan? And if he did respond what was his response? (Applause) I was not in Parlia ment then, but we said in our paper, the Hammer, that ministers must not be allowed to escape responsibility. And the Cabinet bore the responsibility for the whole thing. And I said it was wrong to allow Mr Teh Cheang Wan to get away from answering this question and so we must know how is it that he came by his death.
 
 
 
So I hope we will have an answer to this question from the Prime Minister before polling day. (Applause)
 
 
 
On 31 August 1988 solicitors for the plaintiff wrote to the defendant and referred to the speech complained of in extenso. It was common ground that they had by mistake quoted the word `advised` in the past tense when it should have been `advise` in the present tense. The solicitors contended that by those statements the defendant had imputed that the plaintiff was unfit for the office of Prime Minister in that (i) he advised Mr Teh Cheang Wan, one of his ministers, to commit suicide in order that Mr Teh could avoid investigations into his conduct and thereby escape responsibility; and (ii) he was guilty of criminal misconduct in that he abetted Mr Teh`s suicide. The plaintiffs solicitors stated in the letter that the statements were completely untrue and accordingly constituted a grave slander upon the plaintiff. The letter went on to require the defendant to: 
 
(1) publish on or before 2 September 1988 and at your expense an apology in terms of the draft now enclosed. The apology is to be published with appropriate prominence in the Chinese, English, Malay and Tamil newspapers;
 
 
 
 
(2) read the said apology at the Workers` Party rally following delivery of this letter and, in any event, not later than 1 September 1988; 
 
(3) forthwith undertake in writing that you will not repeat the same or similar statements concerning him; 
 
(4) compensate him by way of damages; and 
 
(5) indemnify him in respect of the costs which he will have incurred in this matter.
  
 
 
The draft apology was in the following terms: 
 
Apology
 
 
 
I, JB Jeyaratnam, hereby unreservedly withdraw all allegations made by me, during the course of the speech at the rally of the Workers` Party held on 26 August 1988, concerning the character and conduct of the Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew which I admit meant, and were intended to mean, that Mr Lee advised Mr Teh Cheang Wan, one of his ministers, to commit suicide in order that Mr Teh could avoid investigation into his conduct and thereby escape responsibility and that Mr Lee is guilty of criminal misconduct in that he abetted Mr Teh`s suicide.
 
 
 
I acknowledge that there was no truth whatsoever in any of the statements I made, and I sincerely apologize to the Prime Minister for having uttered them.
 
 
 
The defendant replied on the following day in the following terms: 
 
I refer to your letter of 31 August 1988.
 
 
 
I do not admit the accuracy of your client`s transcript of my speech at Bedok. I shall require your client to prove strictly all the words he alleges I uttered at the rally which he says were defamatory of him.
 
 
 
I deny that my speech or any part of it bore the imputation that your client has chosen to put on my speech.
 
 
 
All I may have done was to exercise a fundamental constitutional right, namely, a fundamental constitutional right of a citizen in relation to a matter of public importance to ask another citizen, who may possibly hold relevant information to have the power to ensure that by a public inquiry relevant information is discovered, to reveal any such information held by him or to order a public inquiry to discover for the public all information which may touch upon the matter and which the public have a right to know.
 
 
 
No suggestion of misconduct on the part of your client was ever made by me.
 
 
 
The defendant sent a copy of his reply to the press. The 
 Straits Times 
 reported it on Friday, 2 September 1988 under the caption `Jeya denies speech was slanderous`. It was reported that the defendant did not make any apology at the rallies he had addressed on Wednesday and that he said in the letter that he had made no suggestion of misconduct on the plaintiff`s part.
On the night of the eve of polling day, the defendant addressed a Workers` Party rally at a car park in Bukit Merah View. Two audio cassette tapes of that speech were duly proved in court and admitted as exhs P2 and P2A. The relevant parts of that speech are reproduced below: 
 
4 Now, the prime Minister is reported, you know, I got home last night, after addressing three rallies, and this was on TV. A whole hour, I think was devoted to showing the PAP rally at Fullerton Square. (Shouts and applause) So I watched, you know, for a little while, and I heard them say the things they were saying about me and about Mr Francis Scow. And, you know, looking at them on TV, all you could see on their faces was, you know, a sort of whining and griping. (Applause) I thought to myself, they need a good dose of laxative. (Shouts) But the Prime Minister doesn`t like me asking questions. (Shouts and applause) He has, he has threatened to sue me because I asked questions. (Shouts and applause) But he must, he must know by now that Jeyaretnam is not to be frightened. (Shouts and applause) He must know that Jeyaretnam is not to be intimidated. (Shouts of `No`) Now I, I have more questions for him tonight. (Shouts) Now, this is what is reported in the government paper as having said. Now can I read what is reported? Please, can you please listen. He says, stay on high moral and intellectual ground and he says, he says the PAP has stayed in power by never, and he means, and he said I mean literally never, breaking faith with you, that is the people. This is important . We are not making this speech for Saturday. Here the Prime Minister says we`ve never broken faith with the people. Now, I want to ask him three questions on this now and I hope that he will answer this sometime.
 
 
 
 
... 
 
(9) Now, the next question, one of the next questions that I asked was, why was there no investigation or inquiry into how our late minister Mr Teh Cheang Wan (shouts), how he got the supply of Amytal, you know, the drug which killed him. I, I said there should have been an investigation and I said why wasn`t there an inquiry into why, how he got that. Well, we haven`t had an answer to that question yet and I`m asking that question again tonight. Like I said, I know Mr Lee our Prime Minister doesn`t like me asking questions but I was in Parliament. I`m sure you must have seen that on TV. (Shouts) Now they liked me because I was asking too many questions. (Laughter) You know, I`ll tell you something that I miss and that is, having this, you know, duelling with the Prime Minister (shouts), because there was nobody else in Parliament who could duel with me. (Shouts and applause) So they, you know, the great man came down ... (garbled) to start duelling with me and I enjoyed every minute of it. (Shouts and applause) But somebody told me that he looked haggard and worn when he was duelling with me and now he is a bit more relaxed because I am no longer in Parliament.
  
 
 
In this context, I should now refer to the knowledge of the defendant regarding a defamation action which the plaintiff had commenced on 27 March 1987 in the High Court of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia against the Star Publications (Malaysia) Bhd and its editor-in-chief. In that action the plaintiff was alleging that those defendants had falsely and maliciously published or caused to be written two articles in 
 The Star 
 newspaper of 1 February 1987 and 22 February 1987. The plaintiff alleged in his statement of claim in the Malaysian action that the articles meant, inter alia, (a) that he had persuaded Mr Teh Cheang Wan to commit suicide and had provided him with the means to do so; and (b) that he had ensured that there was no investigation to search for the source of the Amytal used by Mr Teh Cheang Wan to commit suicide. That action is pending trial in Malaysia and I must make it clear that I am not expressing any opinion whatsoever on those imputations as alleged. The defendant, however, accepted in his cross- examination that he knew, as most people in Singapore knew, that the plaintiff had instituted those proceedings in Malaysia over very similar allegations. The defendant also accepted in cross-examination that he knew that the plaintiff would challenge any suggestion of any cover up or impropriety on his part over the suicide of Mr Teh Cheang Wan.
 The natural and ordinary meaning 
Central in this action is the meaning of the speech complained of. The meaning to be elicited from it which this court as a decider of fact has to ascertain involves a process of construction which, in some ways, is peculiar to the law of defamation. So far as it is a question of fact, it does not involve the acuity of a lawyer in the construction of legal or commercial documents nor the imperviousness of a simpleton. The aim and object of the whole process of eliciting the meaning of the speech is to find out what an ordinary fair-minded person in Singapore who was in the audience that night and using his general knowledge and common sense would understand by the words spoken in the context and according to the tone and mode of delivery. The correct approach received a great deal of attention of the House of Lords in 
 Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd 
 
[1964] AC 234
 where Lord Reid said at p 258 as follows: 
 
There is no doubt that in actions for libel the question is what the words would convey to the ordinary man: it is not one of construction in the legal sense. The ordinary man does not live in an ivory tower and he is not inhibited by a knowledge of the rules of construction. So he can and does read between the lines in the light of general knowledge and experience of worldly affairs ... . What the ordinary man would infer without special knowledge has generally been called the natural and ordinary meaning of the words. But that expression is rather misleading in that it conceals the fact that there are two elements in it. Sometimes it is not necessary to go beyond the words themselves, as where the plaintiff has been called a thief or a murderer. But more often the sting is not so much in the words themselves as in what the ordinary man will infer from them, and that is also regarded as part of their natural and ordinary meaning.
 
 
 
The observations about inferences echoed what was said by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in 
 Jones v Skelton 
 
[1963] 1 WLR 1362
 at p 1370.
It may be worth recalling what Lord Devlin had metaphorically said in 
 Rubber Improvement Ltd v Daily Telegraph Ltd 
 at p 285: 
 
A man who wants to talk at large about smoke may have to pick his words very carefully if he wants to exclude the suggestion that there is also a fire: but it can be done.
 
 
 
It was agreed by counsel for both parties that the sense in which the words were intended by a defendant is irrelevant and that the sense in which the words were understood by a plaintiff is also irrelevant. It was further agreed that a minute linguistic analysis of every phrase used is unlikely to reflect the impression actually formed by those who beard the words spoken by the defendant at Bedok Town Centre car park no 6 on 26 August 1988: see 
 Sim v Daily Telegraph Ltd 
 [1968] 1 All ER 497 at p 504A-B per Diplock LJ (as he then was).
If the speech complained of does not bear the meaning asserted by the plaintiff in his statement of claim his claims must completely fail and the other issues raised in this trial would not require any further consideration. On the other hand, if the speech bears the meaning as claimed by the plaintiff, it is abundantly clear that applying the test of Lord Atkin set out in 
 Sim v Stretch 
 [1936] 2 All ER 1237 at p 1240 it will be defamatory of the plaintiff. However, I will have to consider the other issues which I had mentioned at the beginning of this judgment.
By para 4 of the statement of claim the plaintiff is asserting that the speech meant and was understood to mean that he was guilty of dishonourable conduct and/or criminal conduct in the discharge of his office as Prime Minister of Singapore in that: 
 
(i) he advised Mr Teh Cheang Wan (Mr Teh) to commit suicide and/or when he knew that Mr Teh would or might commit suicide took no action to prevent Mr Teh from committing suicide, in order to avoid a full investigation into allegations of corruption against Mr Teh which investigation would have resulted in findings to the discredit or embarrassment of the plaintiff as Prime Minister and leader of the People`s Action Party and of the government Singapore;
(ii) he has failed to order an inquiry into how Mr Teh obtained the poison with which he committed suicide because the plaintiff had advised Mr Teh to commit and/or when he knew that Mr Teh would or might commit suicide took no action to prevent Mr Teh from committing suicide in order to avoid a full inquiry into allegations of corruption against investigation would have resulted in findings to the discredit or embarrassment of the plaintiff as Prime Minister of the plaintiff as Prime Minister and leader of the People`s Action Party and of the government Singapore.
 
 
 
By para 4A of the statement of claim, the plaintiff pleaded innuendo as an alternative cause of action. Before me, however, Mr Thomas conceded that it was a matter of general knowledge in Singapore in August 1988 that Mr Teh Cheang Wan had been accused of two charges of corruption shortly before his death. I was therefore asked by both counsel to look at the natural and ordinary meaning of the speech in the light of the general knowledge mentioned. Having pointed out the general knowledge as part of the context to find out the meaning of the speech, Mr Eady made the following submissions:
 
 
(a) He observed that from the words themselves, in the context of an electoral attack on the plaintiff, it was difficult to see what point the words could have had except to accuse him of a `cover-up`. The defendant, as he made plain at the beginning of the speech, was attacking the claims of the PAP government as an honest government; he returned to the same theme on 2 September 1988. 
 
(b) By saying that it was `essential for a government ... not to hide anything` in the context of the plaintiff not revealing how Mr Teh Cheang Wan came by the poison, the defendant was alleging that the plaintiff kept it quiet because it would discredit him if the truth came out. The listeners could not possibly conclude that the information was being withheld for some innocent reason, seeing that the whole object of the speech was to damage the plaintiff`s credibility. 
 
(c) The matter was taken further by the defendant`s misquote of the 13 December letter of Mr Teh Chang Wan. The defendant attributed to Mr Teh Cheang Wan the words `I will do as you advise`. He highlighted the fact that the letter was written the day before Mr Teh Cheang Wan`s death and then asked the question `What reply (ie advice) did the plaintiff give?.` The implication was irresistible for listeners that the plaintiff not only `advised` Mr Teh Cheang Wan to commit suicide but also ensured that he was given the means to do it. The letter in question made no reference to any `advice`- neither to advice being solicited nor to advice already given. The mistake in using the word `advised` in the letter before action and in the statement of claim did not have any material effect on the construction of the speech. 
 
(d) The defendant asserted that it was wrong to `allow` Mr Teh Cheang Wan to get away from answering his questions. He was clearly asserting that the plaintiff had permitted Mr Teh Cheang Wan to escape the CPIB investigations by suicide. 
 
(e) The speech stood in contrast to legitimate questions asked in the Workers` Party press release issued on 27 January 1987 by the defendant as secretary general.
  
 
 
Mr Thomas made the following submissions on behalf of the defendant:
 
 
(a) The defendant`s question about the source of the poison merely repeated question no 5 of the 27 January 1987 press release to which there had been no answer and in respect of that question the plaintiff had made no complaint. 
 
(b) The defendant`s question about the response, if any, to Mr Teh Cheang Wan`s letter was again a repetition of question no 1 raised in the press release and in several issues of `Hammer`. It was only on the third day of this trial that it emerged that the plaintiff did not think that any enquiry into the source of the poison was necessary and that he had not responded to Mr Teh Cheang Wan because he believed and practised the `hands off` policy. 
 
(c) The defendant`s speech must be considered in the context of an election where the PAP had set honesty of its government as an issue and where the defendant was attacking the government`s honesty in the broad sense that it did not keep faith with the people, in contrast to money corruption.
  
 
 
I have considered these submissions. I have viewed the video tapes and seen and heard what Mr Eady described as the `pregnant pauses` and `waits for effect`. I entirely accept the force of the submissions of Mr Eady. Inspite of the forensic efforts of Mr Thomas, it came through to me after listening to the speech that what the defendant was driving at was exactly what has been pleaded in para 4 of the statement of claim. The defendant was obviously suggesting that the plaintiff had encouraged or countenanced the suicide for the improper purpose of covering up what, in a full trial, would have been a scandal most embarrassing to the government and the PAP. That was the clear impression I formed after listening to the speech. It was confirmed by the second viewing of the video cassettes.
 Fair comment 
The defendant would have a complete defence in this action if he proved that the speech was made by him as fair comment on a matter of public importance. It is accepted that in the law of defamation fair comment is a defence of great importance and wide scope. To invoke this defence the defendant has to prove the following four elements: (i) the words complained of are comment, although they may consist of or include inferences of fact; (ii) the comment is on a matter of public interest; (iii) the comment is based on facts; and (iv) the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved.
It is now necessary to recite the averments of the defendant in relation to the defence of fair comment. They were set out in paras 6 and 7 in the amended defence. Paragraph 6 reads as follows: 
 
Further or in the alternative, the words used by the defendant were fair comment, made in good faith and without malice upon a matter of public interest, namely, the need in Singapore for frank and open government.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
(a) The defendant was engaged in criticizing the government in the course of an election campaign. The defendant`s remarks were directed to the need for frank and open government in a number of important areas. Open government is an issue of public importance which the defendant has addressed throughout his political career including in a speech at an election rally at Fullerton Square on Thursday 25 August 1988.
(b) The suicide of a government minister, one Teh Cheang Wan, following allegations against him of corruption was a matter of outstanding public interest. 
(c) It was a proper matter for public concern that the deceased had taken poison whilst under investigation for corruption. 
(d) Similarly, the public interest required that the plaintiff should say whether he responded at all, and if he did, what his response was, to a letter from the deceased written to the plaintiff on the day before his death and received by the plaintiff the same day in which the deceased said he was willing to accept full responsibility and that he `would accept any decision which you (the plaintiff) may want to make`. 
(e) In the premises, the defendant was entitled to comment by way of question: 
(i) why the government had failed to conduct any public inquiry as to how the deceased had obtained access to poison; and 
(ii) what response, if any, the plaintiff had made to the said letter. 
(f) Further, the defendant was entitled to comment that ministers should not be allowed to escape responsibility to answer for any misconduct and that the Cabinet bore collective responsibility for the whole matter. 
(g) Further, the defendant was entitled to call for a full public inquiry into the circumstances of the death of the deceased.
 
 
 
Paragraph 7 reads as follows: 
 
Further or in the further alternative, in so far as the words used by the defendant consist of allegations of fact, they are true in substance and in fact.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
(a) The coroner`s inquest revealed that the said deceased committed suicide by taking poison.
 
 
 
 
(b) Under the Poisons Act (Cap 234) statutory particulars are required to be maintained of all poisons supplied to any person. 
 
(c) The government have not ordered a public inquiry as to how the deceased obtained access to the poison. 
 
(d) A letter was written by the deceased to the plaintiff a day before the deceased died and received by the plaintiff the same day in which the deceased said `he would accept any decision which you (the plaintiff) may wish to make`. 
 
(e) The plaintiff has not revealed whether he made any response to the said letter or what his response, if any, was.
  
 
 
It will be seen that the defendant had failed to state the defamatory meaning against which the defence of fair comment would protect him. He did not accept that his speech bore the defamatory meaning as contended by the plaintiff. But he had not set out any lesser defamatory meaning to which his defence of fair comment would attach as he was unquestionably required to do since the decision of 
 Control Risks Ltd & Ors v New English Library Ltd & Anor 
 [1989] 3 All ER 577 which extended the 
 Lucas-Box 
 principle of pleading governing the defence of justification to the defence of fair comment. The reason why the defendant had failed to do so was, in my view, identified by Mr Eady who correctly observed that the truth of the matter was that the speech was not capable of any lesser defamatory meaning. Either they bore the defamatory meaning which I have found as a fact, as the plaintiff asserted, or they bore a meaning which was not defamatory at all. Mr Eady said that there was no half-way house which could be excused by the defence of fair comment.
I have found that the speech of the defendant contained the imputations that the plaintiff had encouraged, or failed to prevent, the suicide of Mr Teh Cheang Wan in order to cover up wrongdoing. I accept Mr Eady`s submission that those imputations were factual in character, both in relation to the allegations about the plaintiff`s conduct and those relating to his state of mind. As to the later, Bowen LJ said in 
 Edgington v Fitzmaurice 
 (1885) 29 Ch D 459 at p 483: `The state of a man`s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion.` It therefore inevitably followed that those allegations would be susceptible to the defence of justification (which was not raised in this action) and not the defence of fair comment. In relation to these submissions, I must state that Mr Thomas in his closing submissions very properly and candidly admitted that those imputations were not and could not be comment but that they were of a factual character. Accordingly, the defendant had failed to prove element (i) above and, in the circumstances, it would not be necessary to deal with elements (ii) to (iv) as set out above.
 `Constitutional privilege` 
By way of a novel defence, it was submitted on behalf of the defendant that in view of art 14 of the Constitution of Singapore there is in the law of defamation of Singapore a form of `constitutional` privilege whereby a defendant who unwittingly defamed a politician or a public figure would not be liable, unless the plaintiff proved actual malice. Under this doctrine, which was first developed in the United States, even misstatements of facts about public officials, candidates for office and public figures would not be actionable unless made with knowledge that the statements were false or the defendant was reckless as to their truth. This principle was first laid down by the Supreme Court of the United Sates of America in the case of 
 New York Times Co v Sullivan 
 (1964) 376 US 254 and it has often been referred to as the 
 New York Times 
 rule. It should not be difficult to see that this rule is analogous in a sense to the traditional common law defence of fair comment and that as a matter of policy it prefers the principle that debate on public issues and on the conduct of public officials or of public figures should be uninhibited, robust and wide open than the principle that the rights of individuals (who may be public personalities), including the protection of reputation, should be respected. As a matter of pleadings, the defendant put the submission in the following terms: 
 
4 ... The defendant merely asked questions seeking information on and concerning a matter of public interest from the plaintiff in his capacity as Prime Minister and as representing the government on the basis of facts which are indisputable and which are particularized hereunder.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
(i) The late minister Teh Cheang Wan was a member of the Cabinet of which the plaintiff is and was the head and died of an overdose of poison.
 
 
 
 
(ii) The availability of the said poison to individuals is controlled and regulated by law. 
 
(iii) It is possible by an inquiry and investigation to discover how the said Teh Cheang Wan came by the poison. 
 
(iv) The government of which the plaintiff is the head has and had the power to order an inquiry and investigation into how the said Teh Cheang Wan obtained the poison and to release the information to the public. 
 
(v) The public has not been informed of any such inquiry or investigation and its results. 
 
(vi) The plaintiff received a letter from the late Teh Cheang Wan a day before his death in which the said Teh wrote: `I am willing to accept full responsibility for this. I would accept any decision which you may want to make.` 
 
(vii) The plaintiff has not revealed to the public whether he responded to the said letter. 
 
(viii) The plaintiff has not revealed to the public what he said or wrote to the said Teh Cheang Wan if he did respond to the said letter.
  
 
 
5 In the premises, the defendant was exercising the constitutional liberty of free speech guaranteed by art 14(1) and (2) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore in good faith and without malice.
 
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
(a) The right to information is implicit in the `right to freedom of speech and expression` guaranteed by the said article.
(b) The right arises in relation to matters of public concern. 
(c) The suicide of the said minister, following allegations against him of corruption was a matter of outstanding public concern. 
(d) The defendant was entitled to enquire of the plaintiff in his capacity as Prime Minister in relation to the factual matters set out under para 4 (particulars) above. 
(e) The said factual matters were neither false, nor made with reckless disregard for the truth, nor were the words complained of uttered with malice.
 
 
 
The defendant has at no time suggested, nor does he now suggest, that the plaintiff had anything to do with the death by suicide of the said minister, nor has the defendant attributed any role to anyone in the matter. The defendant will refer at the hearing to the terms of his letter dated 1 September 1988 and reported in The Straits Times dated 2 September 1988.
 
 
 
An analysis of these pleadings will show (a) that the defendant was again disputing the defamatory imputations as he contended that he was merely asking legitimate questions on matters of outstanding public importance; (b) that the defendant repeated his assertion that at all material times he did not suggest that the plaintiff or anyone had anything to do with the suicide; and (c) by implication, if the speech bore the imputations which I have found, as the plaintiff had asserted, then the defendant in any event should be excused from any liability because he had made the imputations against the plaintiff as a public figure without malice within the 
 New York Times 
 rule.
I should now elaborate on the submissions of Mr Thomas on what he had described as `the interesting and unusual topic of constitutional privilege`. He referred to the provisions of art 14 of the Constitution of Singapore which is reproduced below in its entirety with the relevant parts for present purposes emphasized by me: 
 
14(1) Subject to cll (2) and (3) -
 
 
 
 
(a) every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression; 
 
(b) all citizens of Singapore have the right to assemble peaceably and without arms; and 
 
(c) all citizens of Singapore have the right to form associations.
  
 
 
(2) Parliament may by law impose -
(a) on the rights conferred by paragraph (a) of cl (1), such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation, or incitement to an offence; 
(b) on the right conferred by paragraph (b) of cl (1), such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof or public order; and 
(c) on the right conferred by paragraph (c) of cl (1), such restrictions as it deems necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof, public order or morality.
 
 
 
(3) Restrictions on the right to form associations conferred by paragraph (c) of cl (1) may also be imposed by any law relating to labour or education.
 
 
 
Mr Thomas then compared art 14 of the Constitution of Singapore with art 19(1) of the Constitution of India and referred to the Indian case of 
 Indian Express Newspapers (Bombay) Pte Ltd & Ors v Union of India & Ors 
 AIR 1986 SC 515 to make the point that as art 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India was based on Amendment I of the Constitution of the United States it would be legitimate and proper to refer for guidance to the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States of America in order to appreciate the true nature, scope and extent of the freedom of speech. Following these preliminary submissions, I was referred to the 
 New York Times 
 rule. As I have sufficiently set out the rule I do not think it is necessary to set out the facts of that case. Mr Thomas emphasized the importance of understanding the rationale of the 
 New York Times 
 rule and, in deference to his arguments, I set out below para 3(b) of the United States Supreme Court Reports, October Term 1978, pp 983-984 as follows: 
 
The rationale for the court`s decision in the 
 New York Times
 case [(1964) 376 US 254] started from the initial premise of the profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide open. Since the threat of defamation liability possesses great potential for intrusion on the zone of protected public speech, the court declared that common law defamation principles were incompatible with First Amendment precepts. Thus, the extension of a conditional constitutional privilege to defame as to matters within the realm of public discussion of public affairs, defeasible only upon publication of defamatory falsehoods with `actual malice`, provided freedoms of expression with the breathing space that they need to survive, the court said. In a number of subsequent decisions, the court has likewise acknowledged that the New York Times rule seeks to implement the First Amendment policy of maximization of public debate through minimization of the incentives for self-censorship presented by the threat of defamation liability.
 
 
 
Mr Thomas then pointed out that the European Court of Human Rights had in his view adopted a similar approach in the case of 
 Lingens v Austria 
 (1986) 5 EHRR 407 in which art 10 of the Convention of Human Rights was considered. Article 10 is in the following terms (the emphasis is added): 
 
(1) Everyone has the right to freedom of expression. This right shall include freedom to hold opinions and to receive and impart information and ideas without interference by public authority and regardless of frontiers. This article shall not prevent States from requiring the licensing of broadcasting, television or cinema enterprises.
(2) 
 The exercise of these freedoms 
, since it carries with it duties and responsibilities, 
 may be subject to such formalities, conditions, restrictions or penalties 
 as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society, in the interests of national security, territorial integrity or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals, 
 for the protection of the reputation or rights of others 
, for preventing the disclosure of information received in confidence, or for maintaining the authority and impartiality of the judiciary.
 
 
 
Mr Thomas concluded his submissions on this issue by exhorting this court to develop and incorporate the 
 New York Times 
 rule into the law of defamation of Singapore where, unlike England, there is a written Constitution which contains an express guarantee of the freedom of speech.
I am not persuaded by the submissions of Mr Thomas. His arguments based on Amendment I of the Constitution of the United States of America, which was ratified on 15 December 1791 and extended to bind the constituent States of the Union by Amendment XIV which was ratified on 28 July 1869, are untenable for the reasons submitted by Mr Eady. Freedom of speech is in terms of art 14 subject to or restricted by the law of defamation, much like the underlying concepts and constitutional bargain which are expressed by art 10 of the European Convention of Human Rights, and which in terms must be contra-distinguished from Amendments I and XIV which prohibit Congress and the States from promulgating any law restricting freedom of speech and expression. Thus, freedom of expression in the United States is so extensive that in the recent case of 
 Texas v Gregory Lee Johnson 
 (1989) 57 LW 4770, the Supreme Court by a five-to-four majority ruled that the Texan statute which criminalized the burning and desecration of the flag of the United States (in circumstances where no breach of the peace was likely) was unconstitutional and inconsistent with the Amendment I. I agree that the divergence of public policy between that underlying our art 14 and that underlying Amendment I of the United States could not be clearer. By art 14, the framers of our Constitution had after all deliberate considerations chosen the policy of balancing freedom of speech and expression against certain other individual rights, including not least the protection of reputation. As rightly pointed out by Mr Eady, that balance is sought to be achieved in England and in Singapore by the common law evolving certain well known defences, as modified by statute, for defendants in defamation cases, and all directed to the intent and purpose that freedom of speech must end where the rights of the individual begin. In 
 Lingens v Austria 
at para 41, second part, the European Court of Human Rights in terms clearly recognized that t he press was bound by legal obligations in relation to the reputation of individuals.
Accordingly, in the law of defamation of Singapore, as in England according to Mr Eady, it has never been suggested that a privilege extends to any statements which are made to the world at large except in the case of a legal, social or moral duty. I should begin by quoting Parke B who correctly stated the law in 
 Toogood v Spyring 
 (1834) 1 CM & R 181 at p 193: 
 
In general, an action lies for the malicious publication of statements which are false in fact, and injurious to the character of another, and the law considers such publication as malicious, 
 unless it is fairly made by a person in the discharge of some public or private duty whether legal or moral, or in the conduct of his own affairs, in matters where his interest is concerned
. In such cases the occasion prevents the inference of malice which the law draws from unauthorized communications, and affords a qualified defence depending on the absence of actual malice. 
 If fairly warranted by any reasonable occasion or exigency, and honestly made, such communications are protected for the common convenience and welfare of society.
 
 
 
I would next refer to 
 Adam v Ward 
(1915) 31 TLR 299 (CA), where Buckley LJ in the Court of Appeal correctly stated the principle of common law privilege and which was accepted and applied by Cantley J in 
 London Artists Ltd v Littler 
 
[1968] 1 WLR 607
 after a comprehensive review of the authorities. Buckley LJ at p 304 stated: 
 
... if the matter is matter of public interest and the party who publishes it owes a duty to communicate it to the public, the publication is privileged, and in this sense duty means not a duty as matter of law, but to quote Lord Justice Lindley`s words in 
 Stuart v Bell
 17 TLR 502; 
[1891] 2 QB 341
, 350] `a duty recognized by English people of ordinary intelligence and moral principle but at the same time not a duty enforceable by legal proceedings` ...
 
 
 
The House of Lords in 
 Adam v Ward 
 
[1917] AC 309
 (HL) accepted the above formulation of Buckley LJ. Lord Atkinson said at p 334: 
 
A privileged occasion is ... an occasion where the person who makes a communication has an interest, or a duty, legal, social or moral, to make it to the person to whom it is made, and the person to whom it is so made has a corresponding interest or duty to receive it. This reciprocity is essential.
 
 
 
In 
 Blackshaw v Lord 
 
[1984] 1 QB 1
 the Court of Appeal of England held that common law privilege applies where defamatory information is published in pursuance of a legal, social or moral duty to persons having a corresponding duty or interest to receive it but it stated that it does not cover `fair information on a matter of public interest` where there is no duty to publish. That decision was followed in Singapore by Thean J in 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies 
 
 
 
[1990] 1 MLJ 390
  at pp 413-414.
Mr Eady also pointed out, and Mr Thomas could not assert otherwise, that there is no case law in England or in Singapore which suggests that `public figures` fall into a special category so that anything can be said about them unless the potential plaintiff can prove malice.
In my judgment, the 
 New York Times 
 rule is not a defence in our law of defamation. I resolutely set my face against the sort of judicial activism advocated by Mr Thomas.
 Damages 
The defendant did grievously slander the plaintiff. He is not entitled to invoke any defence. He is therefore liable for the slander and has to pay damages. I have to consider the measure of damages. Generally, damages for a defamation has to be assessed on a compensatory basis for the injury to reputation and not as a punishment for a civil wrongdoing: see 
 Duncan and Neill on Defamation 
 (2nd Ed) paras 18.03 and 18.07. That the punitive (ie exemplary) element should generally be excluded in awards for damages was, however, not always in England any part of the judges` direction to juries when assessing damages. It appears that in the l9th century and the greater part of this century it was thought in England that an award of general damages in defamation cases could include an exemplary element if the conduct of the defendant had been so wanton as to warrant it: see 
 Sutcliffe v Pressdram Ltd 
 [1990] 1 All ER 269 at p 287 per Nourse LJ. It is and has been a matter, in any case, for a jury of 12 reasonable men and women as representatives of the public. In England, therefore, damages in defamation cases are `at large` in the sense that juries decide the amount without being told of any comparable cases, if there are such cases at all in the first place, nor are they told by the trial judges of the upper and lower brackets of those damages. This practice stems from high constitutional considerations that the assessment of damages is exclusively within the province of juries and awards are rarely disturbed on appeal except on exceptional grounds such as that the award could not have reasonably been given by a reasonable tribunal or that the award is irrational: see 
 Sutcliffe v Pressdram Ltd 
.
The general rule that damages in defamation cases may be compensatory only has been authoritatively settled by the House of Lords in 
 Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome 
 
[1972] AC 1027
. So far as it is relevant to defamation cases, the only exception which warrants exemplary damages is where the defendant, either with knowledge of the tort or recklessly, decides to publish because he has the prospects of gaining more than he would loose in material terms.
Lord Hailsham LC in 
 Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome 
stated at p 1071: 
 
In actions of defamation and in any other actions where damages for loss of reputation are involved, the principle of restitutio in integrum has necessarily an even more highly subjective element. Such actions involve a money award which may put the plaintiff in a purely financial sense in a much stronger position than he was before the wrong. Not merely can he recover the estimated sum of his past and future losses, but, in case the libel, driven underground, emerges from its lurking place at some future date, he must be able to point to a sum awarded by a jury sufficient to convince a bystander of the baselessness of the charge. As Windeyer J well said in 
 Uren v John Fairfax & Sons Pty Ltd
 (1967) 117 CLR 118 at 150:
 
 
 
`It seems to me that, properly speaking, a man defamed does not get compensation for his damaged reputation. He gets damages 
 because
 he was injured in his reputation, that is simply because he was publicly defamed. For this reason, compensation by damages operates in two ways, as a vindication of the plaintiff to the public, and as consolation to him for a wrong done. Compensation is here a solatium rather than a monetary recompense for harm measurable in money.`
 
 
 
... Quite obviously, the award must include factors for injury to the feelings, the anxiety and uncertainty undergone in the litigation, the absence of apology, or the reaffirmation of the truth of the matters complained of, or the malice of the defendant. The bad conduct of the plaintiff himself may also enter into the matter, where he has provoked the libel, or where perhaps he has libelled the defendant in reply. What is awarded is thus a figure which cannot be arrived at by any purely objective computation. This is what is meant when damages in defamation are described as being `at large`. (Lord Hailsham LC`s emphasis.)
 
 
 
In Singapore, there is no jury trial. The assessment of damages is a matter for the trial judge who by training looks at precedents (if available) for comparison or guidance, who appreciates the value of money and the financial implications of an award of damages in the hands of a successful plaintiff, and who will, more importantly in cases such as the present action, duly exclude any punitive element in accordance with 
 Cassell & Co Ltd v Broome 
 and assess the injury, original or additional, which the slander has caused to the feelings of an injured party.
I should now look at the factors relevant to the assessment of damages. The number of people who heard the slander was about 7,000 who were at a very busy bus interchange and a food centre. The imputations made by the defendant would in the ordinary way spread and would `snowball` by word of mouth in coffee shops and elsewhere. It would be difficult to know how far the poison had spread. I must highlight the serious nature of the slander. The slander alleged that the plaintiff was implicated in the unlawful taking of a human life for a sinister purpose. The allegation that the plaintiff had encouraged or countenanced the suicide for the sinister purpose of a cover-up had grievously wounded the plaintiff `at the very heart of his credo`. As Mr Eady rightly pointed out, the plaintiff at the National Day Rally was saying after 30 years in office that he and his colleagues had managed to establish an enviable reputation for an honest government and that it was necessary to remain vigilant always to ensure that honest people came into government, putting that `right at the heart of his credo`. It was wicked after convincing evidence had been produced before the Commission of Inquiry which confirmed his very firm handling of the investigations into the allegations of corrupt practices by Mr Teh Cheang Wan. The plaintiff did not show any favours and had unflinchingly set his face against corruption when the natural and emotional impulse of lesser leaders in power might have been to protect a ministerial colleague. In my view, a fair-minded person would be horrified on hearing the slander and would react with a great deal of indignation against the grievous injury inflicted on the plaintiff. I am satisfied that the defendant`s motive in bearing `false witness` against the plaintiff was to hit him below the belt at the general elections. Any award must provide the plaintiff with an adequate solatium. In view of the gravity of the slander, I have additionally to b ear in mind that the award of damages, albeit compensatory, must be commensurate with the gravity of the allegations if it is to serve as a full and sufficient vindication. In other words, the plaintiff must be able to point to the award of damages in this case and say `I was awarded $x by the judge to show that I was untruthfully accused of encouraging or countenancing Mr Teh Cheang Wan`s suicide for the purpose of a cover-up.` The element of vindication in this case, in my view, is important but that is not to say that the element of vindication should constitute a separate head of damages.
The defendant failed to correct or apologize for the imputations. In 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Seow Khee Leng 
 
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 172
 , the defendant did apologize by reading out the agreed terms of the apology at the next election rally. However, the accord reached in that case was not satisfied in respect of a material term as the defendant there went on to qualify the apology after having read it. For the slander which was serious and by reason of his subsequent aggravating conduct `at every turn` as chronicled by Chua J, he was ordered to pay $250,000 as damages. For the slander uttered by him at the same election rally against other plaintiffs, Mr Seow Khee Leng was further ordered in a companion suit to pay those plaintiffs another sum of $250,000 as damages.
In my view, the plaintiff suffered increased hurt by the speech made defiantly by the defendant on 2 September 1988. I have reproduced that speech earlier in this judgment. I am satisfied that anyone who was present at the Bukit Merah View car park and heard the defendant`s speech on 2 September 1988, far from thinking that the defendant was acknowledging that the plaintiff had not been implicated in the suicide, would think that the defendant was reaffirming the allegations made by him earlier. I also bear in mind the fact that the plaintiff has had to pursue this litigation for the last two years and face the defence of fair comment.
Mr Thomas made several submissions in mitigation of the damages. First, the imputations did not have the slightest effect on the plaintiff`s success at the general elections; the plaintiff`s reputation had clearly not suffered. I accept that the imputations did not affect the plaintiff`s chances at the general elections but the slander did have an adverse effect on his position, standing and reputation and such harm should be expiated by an appropriate award. On the other hand, I agree that it was a slander, albeit very grave, uttered in the heat of the hustings. Secondly, the plaintiff according to Mr Thomas was not really hurt in his feelings because he counter attacked and took every opportunity to broadcast his intention to sue the defendant and that in the process the plaintiff had himself made the slander louder and more extensively known through the English and Chinese media. I find that the plaintiff was deeply hurt in his feelings and was in fact outraged by the slander. In this regard, I accept the submission of Mr Eady that the plaintiff took these steps, as the plaintiff had said in evidence, to minimize the damage that could have been done to his personal and well-known credo for honesty and to the electoral prospects of his party. However, I do agree with Mr Thomas that the plaintiff`s robust and calculated electioneering response before polling day did reduce the harm to the plaintiff`s reputation and I must make an allowance for this fact. Thirdly, it was said that the defendant had inadvertently made the imputations and that, according to 
 Smith v Harrison 
 (1856) 1 F & F 565; 175 ER 854 `small damages would suffice`. In my judgment the imputations were not made inadvertently; the defendant had intended to make the imputations. He resurrected the matter inspite of the findings of the coroner`s inquest and of the Commission of Inquiry. Further, in early 1987 he knew that the plaintiff had commenced proceedings in Malaysia a gainst a newspaper and its editor for what the plaintiff complained were imputations of a similar nature. Inspite of this knowledge the defendant chose to wait one and a half years to raise the matter again and uttered the slander. He was up to no good when he built up the aspersions in the speech and then said that Mr Teh Cheang Wan had written to the plaintiff the day before the suicide saying: `I will do as you advise.` He then paused for the effect on the audience. I totally reject his claim that he was merely asking questions on matters of public importance and exercising his freedom of speech. Finally, Mr Thomas referred to 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Derek Gwyn Davies 
to make the points that the two libels in that case were circulated in the Far East, if not worldwide, and that the subsequent conduct of the defendants in that case and that of counsel in cross-examination had caused further hurt to the feelings of the plaintiff. Mr Thomas suggested that the award of $230,000 was made by reason of those matters which made that case much more serious than the present case. Each defamation case is different. In my view, it cannot be gainsaid that the slander uttered by the defendant in this case was indeed very grave.
In my judgment the fair and reasonable sum as damages for the plaintiff is $260,000. I accordingly enter judgment for him in that sum together with interest at the rate of 6% from 1 September 1988 to the date hereof. In the exercise of my discretion I also grant an injunction against any repetition of the slander or of similar imputations. I also order the defendant to pay the costs of these proceedings to the plaintiff and, in this regard, I would certify for two counsel.
 Order accordingly.",1990-08-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

The appellant, Ramli bin Awang, was tried and convicted by the High Court on a charge of murder. The charge was as follows: 
 
That you, Ramli bin Awang, are charged that between 1pm on 27 October 1984 and 11.45am on 28 October 1984 on board the bunker barge SB 167G anchored at the Eastern Anchorage, Singapore, together with one Rohani and in furtherance of the common intention of both of you committed murder by causing the death of one Tan Jae Tuang, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
The appellant was sentenced to death. He appealed against sentence and conviction. His appeal came before us and we dismissed it. These are our reasons for having done so.
On the morning of 30 October 1984, the body of Tan Jae Tuang (the deceased), who was aged about 71, was recovered from the sea at the western petroleum anchorage. He was found to have been strangled.
The deceased had been employed by Hong Lam Marine Pte Ltd (Hang Lam) as a watchman aboard one of its bunkering barges, SB 167G.
The appellant was also an employee of Hong Lam. He was a steersman. On 30 October 1984, he was arrested and charged in the terms to which we have referred, with the murder of the deceased. Between 7.45pm and 10.35pm that night, a statement was recorded from the appellant under the provisions of s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
At his trial, the appellant admitted that he and Rohani, the person named in the charge and referred to at the trial as `Ronnie`, planned to steal oil from barge SB 167G upon which the deceased was employed as watchman. The appellant put four sleeping tablets into the deceased`s coffee at about 7pm on the night of 27 October 1984, in order to put the deceased to sleep, so that he and Ronnie could proceed with the planned theft.
In the event, the potion failed to put the deceased to sleep for long enough. The appellant reported to Ronnie that the deceased had woken up, whereupon Ronnie told him that as they had been seen by the deceased, he must be killed by strangling. The appellant disagreed and tried instead to persuade the deceased to participate in the theft. While his conversation with the deceased was going on, Ronnie came upon the deceased from behind, with a towel, and attempted to strangle him. The appellant said that he was shocked and frightened and that he did nothing.
The deceased fell to the deck of the barge, and Ronnie and the appellant carried him to the toilet, the appellant being under the impression the deceased had `fainted`.
For some two hours after the deceased was placed in the toilet, oil was pumped from barge SB 167G onto another vessel in pursuance of the theft. When this operation was concluded, Ronnie went aft and returned to inform the appellant that the deceased was `still alive`. Ronnie asked the appellant for a rope, and the appellant handed him one. The appellant said that he did not ask Ronnie why he wanted the rope, thinking that Ronnie intended to tie the deceased with it. Ronnie went to the toilet, after which the appellant heard, coming from the toilet, the `sound of a person in trouble`. He saw one of the deceased`s legs emerge from the toilet and he pushed it back in with his foot, closed the door and leaned on it.
Subsequently, the appellant assisted Ronnie to pull the deceased out of the toilet. He saw the rope he had supplied to Ronnie round the deceased`s neck. The appellant and Ronnie dragged the deceased`s body to the edge of the barge and Ronnie pushed the deceased into the sea.
In answer to a question from his counsel as to whether he would have handed the rope to Ronnie had he known that Ronnie was going to use it to strangle the, deceased, the appellant answered: `No.` He said that at no time had he planned with Ronnie to murder the deceased. He admitted that in due course the oil he and Ronnie had stolen was sold and that he had collected his share of the proceeds.
The material part of the accused`s s 121(6) statement was in the following terms: 
 
... I went back to the barge SB 167G ... and met Ronnie who told me that the deceased had woke up. I looked at the deceased and confirmed that he had woke up. The deceased knew of our presence on the barge but he did nothing. I told Ronnie to abandon the plan of stealing the oil from the barge. Ronnie advised me to proceed with the plan of stealing the oil. He told me that after all the deceased had seen us and would report the matter. He then suggested that we kill the deceased by strangling him to death. I was against the idea and told Ronnie that if he wanted to kill the deceased, he could go on with it and as for me, I do not have the heart to do so. I then approached the deceased and sought his permission to allow us to steal the oil. The deceased refused to cooperate with us. Whilst I was talking to the deceased coaxing him to work with us by allowing us to steal the oil, Ronnie came with a towel on his hand. He came from behind and used the towel to strangle the deceased who was sitting next to me. I just looked on and did not interfere. I also did not make any attempt to stop Ronnie from strangling the deceased. When the deceased had weakened and seemed fainted, Ronnie asked me to help him carry the deceased into the toilet on the barge. I proceeded to assist him in carrying the deceased into the toilet. After which I locked the deceased inside the toilet from the outside by just turning the wooden stopper of the door. Minutes later, the tug-boat `Satrya Madura` arrived alongside next to the barge SB 167G. I then proceeded to steal the oil from the barge by transferring the oil in the barge SB 167G to the tug-boat using the pump on the barge which worked by the generator. We emptied three tanks of oil from the barge SB 167G. They were tank numbers 2, 3 and 4. As for tank number 4 we only emptied half the tank. The transfer of oil was completed at about 4.00 am on Sunday 28 October 1984. It took us two hours for the job which started at about 2.00 am. After which Ronnie went back to the toilet to check on the deceased. He told me that the deceased was still alive and asked for a rope. I then took a rope about three metres long from the deck and gave it to Ronnie who was guarding the deceased at the toilet. He took the rope and went inside the toilet to use it to strangle the deceased. I closed the toilet door from outside as soon as Ronnie entered and stood next to the door to keep watch. I heard the sound of the deceased struggling and there was a time when the deceased kicked the door open and I kicked his leg in and closed back the door. About ten minutes, there was silence and Ronnie came out. He told me to carry the deceased onto my boat and threw him far away from the scene. I refused. I had then saw the deceased lying in the toilet. He was motionless and there was a rope around his neck and his legs were tied by the same rope. He then suggested that we pulled him out and threw him into the sea. I then helped him to pull the deceased out of the toilet by pulling one of his legs with Ronnie pulling the other one leg, and placed him on the verge of the deck. Ronnie subsequently pushed the deceased whom I believed was already dead, into the sea with his leg. I saw the deceased body sank.
 
 
 
The admissibility of this statement was challenged on the grounds that it was not voluntary. It was asserted on behalf of the appellant that the statement had been obtained by threats, promises or inducements on the part of investigating officers. In the first place, it was contended that S/I Chew Keng Gee, in the course of questioning the appellant between about 11.35am and 1.35pm on 30 October 1984, told the appellant that his body was `fit for hanging`; secondly, it was said that ASP S Suppiah had threatened the appellant at the CID later the same afternoon by telling him that if he did not speak the truth his limbs would be broken; and finally it was urged upon the learned trial judges that the appellant`s statement was induced by Inspector Samadi bin Aman, during an interview which took place that afternoon when, it was alleged, Inspector Samadi told the appellant that if he cooperated, the charges against him would not be severe, and that he would go to prison for between six and seven years, at the most.
The learned trial judges determined, at the conclusion of the voire dire, that the appellant`s statement was admissible. The first ground of the appeal, which was not strenuously argued, was that they were wrong in so holding.
It is clear from their grounds of decision that the learned trial judges gave careful consideration to the evidence relating to the basis upon which it was sought to exclude the appellant`s s 121(6) statement. They found, as matters of fact, that S/I Chew did not make the remark alleged of him; that ASP Suppiah was not even present in the CID building when he was alleged to have threatened the appellant; and that, given the evidence, it would not have been possible for Inspector Samadi to have interviewed the appellant at the time, or for the period, asserted by the appellant, in order to have held out the alleged inducement.
We saw no basis whatsoever for disturbing these findings of fact on the part of the learned trial judges, and the appellant accordingly failed on his first ground of appeal.
The only other ground upon which it was sought to upset the conviction was that the appellant had not formed a common intention, with Ronnie, to murder the deceased. Counsel for the appellant conceded that, whether or not a common intention was formed was matter of fact for determination by the trial judges. However, he argued that the proper finding would have been that the appellant`s intention was from the outset, to steal his employers` oil, and no more, and that this intention did not extend at any time to an intention to kill the deceased. The trial judges had therefore been wrong to conclude, on the evidence, that a common intention to murder had been formed.
We were unable to agree. The trial judges had in mind that common intention is to be inferred from surrounding circumstances, and the conduct of the parties. While accepting that when the appellant had sought to drug the deceased he had done so only to facilitate the theft of the oil, they disbelieved the appellant when he said that he stood by, for between five and six minutes, during Ronnie`s first attempt to strangle the deceased with a towel, because he was shocked and frightened. The trial judges concluded, as they were entitled to on the evidence, that the appellant also wanted the deceased dead.
Were that not enough, the appellant had handed to Ronnie the rope that eventually dispatched the deceased. Although he claimed in his evidence that he did not know what Ronnie wanted the rope for, and later, that he thought Ronnie intended to use it to tie the hands and feet of the deceased, his evidence, which on the face of the grounds of decision was carefully weighed, was disbelieved. The judges took account of the fact that after Ronnie entered the toilet with the rope, the appellant closed the toilet door and braced himself against it because the wooden latch had become detached. The appellant heard the struggling inside, followed by a silence for about ten minutes before he was asked by Ronnie to stand clear of the door so that they could both dispose of the body. The judges bore in mind that, in his s 121(6) statement, the appellant had said that, upon handing Ronnie the rope: `He [Ronnie] took the rope and went inside the toilet to use it to strangle the deceased`.
In the event, the learned trial judges concluded beyond reasonable doubt, that the appellant had handed Ronnie the rope in order for him to strangle the deceased. A common intention had arisen between them to murder the deceased when Ronnie had attempted earlier to strangle the deceased with the towel. That attempt having failed, and the oil having been successfully pumped out of SB 167G, the appellant had actively assisted Ronnie to murder the deceased, and dispose of his body overboard.
There was no basis upon which we could possibly conclude that the learned trial judges` finding as to the existence of common intention was unjustified. There was ample evidence to support it. The appellant`s second ground of appeal, like his first, therefore failed.

Whether civil action an abuse of process of court
 
In July 1988, various complaints were made to the magistrate by members of a firm of private investigators alleging that Rising Sports Pte Ltd (Rising Sports) of No 1, North Bridge Road, 17-08, High Street Centre, Singapore 0617 had imported six containers of counterfeit Reebok shoes for sale in Singapore, thereby committing an offence under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332) (the Act). As a result, six search warrants were issued in respect of the six containers and two search warrant were issued against the premises of Rising Sport. In laying the complaints under the Criminal P rocedure Code, the firm of private investigators acted on behalf of Reebok International Ltd, the plaintiff in the present action.
By Criminal Motion No 24 of 1988 (CM 24/88) Rising Sports and Royal Corporation (a Japanese corporation having its place of business in Nagoya, Japan and the defendant in the present action) applied to the High Court that the record of the subordinate courts relating to the above search warrants be removed to the High Court and that the High Court do give to the subordinate courts the following directions: 
 
 
(i) the complaints based on which the said search warrants were issued be at once dismissed as disclosing no offence under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332); 
 
(ii) the said search warrants be quashed; 
 
(iii) the `Reebok` shoes or products and documents seized thereunder be released to their rightful owners, the applicants respectively; and 
 
(iv) such other directions as justice may require.
  
 
 
At the hearing of CM 24/88 on 15 and 22 August 1988, there was incontrovertible evidence that Rising Sports did not import the six containers of `Reebok` shoes and that the shoes belong to Royal Corporation, the defendant herein. In an affidavit filed therein on behalf of Rising Sports and Royal Corporation it was, inter alia, stated that: 
 
12 The above document shows no doubt that (Rising Sports) was merely a notifying party and were not themselves the importers. It also shows that at no time did (Rising Sports) have possession of nor control over the goods. As such, (Rising Sports) have not committed any offence whether punishable under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act or at all. The allegations raised in the complaints of the various complainants are therefore false. 
13 It is clear from the above that the complainants who purport to be from a firm of professional investigators had not conducted proper and thorough investigations before lodging a complaint before the learned magistrate where they accused (Rising Sports) of having committed a criminal offence in telling half-truths and outright falsehoods. They have misrepresented to the learned magistrate who in good faith relied upon the information provided and issued the warrants.
 
 
 
The president of Royal Corporation, one Iwao Nakane, has affirmed in a statutory declaration that the `Reebok` shoes belong to him. He explained in this way why the shoes have come to Singapore. Around April/May 1988, Royal Corporation was over-stocked with shoes. Storage space was expensive in Japan. From their inquiries it was much cheaper to ship the goods from Nagoya to Singapore and then back to Nagoya and to take advantage of the 28 days free storage offered by PSA for transhipment goods. Accordingly, Royal Corporation instructed its carrier `K-Line` to ship the six containers of shoes to Singapore and after to ship them back to Japan. These assertions were not disputed at the hearing of the criminal motion at which the Public Prosecutor authorized the counsel for the plaintiff herein to act and argue for the respondent in that motion.
From the written submission of the respondent in CM 24/88 it is clear that there was only one main issue before the court and I would quote from it: `The sole issue before this honourable court is whether there has been any impropriety in obtaining the search warrants, the subject of motion, and if so, whether such impropriety or irregularity has resulted in a failure of justice to nullify the seizure of the offending goods.` However in the course the hearing, extensive arguments were also made by counsel for the Public Prosecutor on the interpretation of s 73, particularly the word `imports`. At the conclusion of the hearing the High Court ordered that: 
 
 
(1) the complaints based on which the said search warrants were issued be at once dismissed as disclosing no offence under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332); 
 
(2) that the search warrants be quashed; 
 
(3) that the documents seized from the office of the first applicant to be released and returned to the first applicant; 
 
(4) the six containers and their contents to be released to the carriers `K-Line` and they are to be shipped back to Japan on the first available ship.
  
 
 
Application for a stay of execution was also refused.
On 23 August 1988, following the quashing of the search warrants, Reebok International Ltd, the plaintiff herein, instituted the present suit against Royal Corporation for infringement of the plaintiffs trade mark `Reebok` bearing registration no 326/84 in class 25 in respect of articles of sports clothing and footwear. Under `particulars` in the statement of claim filed herein, the same six containers of shoes are referred to. On an ex parte summons-in-chambers filed on the same day, an interim injunction was granted in favour of the plaintiff. On 1 September 1988, the defendant applied by summons-in-chambers to have the interim injunction dissolved and for damages to be assessed.
The application to dissolve the interim injunction is now before me. Counsel for the defendant raised a preliminary point of law for the determination of this court. It is the plea of res judicata or issue estoppel or abuse of the process of the court.
In the amended defence fled to this suit, the defendant avers: 
 
6 Further or in the alternative on the ground of res judicata and or issue of estoppel the issues in this action have been determined and adjudicated upon in Criminal Motion No 24 of 1988 in the High Court of the Republic of Singapore and therefore the same is frivolous and vexatious and an abuse of the process of the court.
 
 
 
In the reply to this specific point, the plaintiff pleads: 
 
4 The plaintiff refers to para 6 of the amended defence and say that the plaintiff is not a party to the said Criminal Motion No 24 of 1988. In any event, the plaintiff says that the issues herein were never argued in nor adjudicated upon by the said Criminal Motion No 24 of 1988. Criminal Motion No 24 of 1988 relates solely to the question of whether search warrants obtained on the grounds that Rising Sports Pte Ltd had committed an offence under the Trade Marks Act ought to be quashed.
 
 
 
The origin of the doctrine of res judicata, and the subsequent development of the principle of `issue estoppel` were succinctly dealt with by Lord Guest in 
 Carl-Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner and Keeler 
 
[1967] 1 AC 853
 at p 933-934; [1966] 2 All ER 536 at p 564 as follows: 
 
The doctrine of estoppel per rem judicatam is reflected in two Latin maxims, (i) interest rei publicae ut sit finis litium and, (ii) nemo debet bis vexare pro una et eadem causa. The former is public policy and the latter is private justice. The rule of estoppel by res judicata, which is a rule of evidence, is that where a final decision has been pronounced by a judicial tribunal of competent jurisdiction over the parties to and the subject matter of the litigation, any party or privy to such litigation as against any other party or privy is estopped in any subsequent litigation from disputing or questioning such decision on the merits (
 Spencer Bower on Res Judicata
 p 3).
 
 
 
As originally categorized, res judicata was known as `estoppel by record`. But as it is now quite immaterial whether the judicial decision is pronounced by a tribunal which is required to keep a written record of its decisions, this nomenclature has disappeared and it may be convenient to describe res judicata in its true and original form as `cause of action estoppel`. This has long been reed as operating as a complete bar if the neck conditions are present. Within recent years the principle has developed so as to extend to what is now described as `issue estoppel`, that is to say where in a judicial decision between the same parties and some issue which was in controversy between the parties and was incidental to the main decision has been decided, then that may create an estoppel per rem judicatam ...
The principles governing res judicata and issue estoppel are stated in this way by Lord Denning in 
 Fidelitas Shipping Co Ltd v V/O Exportchleb 
 
[1966] 1 QB 630
 at p 640: 
 
The law, as I understand it is this: if one party brings an action against another for a particular cause and judgment is given upon it, there is a strict rule of law that he cannot bring another action against the same party 
 for the same cause
. Transit in rem judicatam: 
 King v Hoare
 (1844) 13 M & W 494, 504; 153 ER 206. But within one cause of action there may be several issues raised which are necessary for the determination of the whole case. The rule then is that, once an issue has been raised and 
 distinctly determined between the parties
, then, as a general rule, neither party can be allowed to fight that issue all over again. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Three essential conditions must therefore be present before this plea can be successfully raised. First, there must have been a final judgment or decision; second, there must be an identity of subject matter or issue in the former and in the present litigation; and third, there must be identity of parties.
I will now examine whether in relation to the present suit by the plaintiff, the three conditions are satisfied. There is no dispute that in so far as the matter prayed for in CM 24/88 is concerned, a final judgment was given by the High Court on 22 July 1988 to quash the search warrants because the complaints disclosed no offence, followed by two consequential orders to return the documents and shoes seized to the rightful owners. The arguments of both counsel before me centred on whether the second and third conditions are satisfied.
I will next deal with the second condition: identity of subject matter. It is clear that what the court was asked to decide in CM 24/88 was whether the complaints, as set out above, disclosed an offence under s 73. The complaints were against Rising Sport, which was alleged to be the importer. However, as indicated above, evidence was placed before the court that Rising Sports was not the importer at all. Arguments had no doubt also been submitted on the interpretation of s 73. It seems clear to me that what the learned judge had decided was that, I based on the complaints and the facts before him, no offence under s 73 had been committed by Rising Sports. But the record does not show under which precise grounds the learned judge had so decided. Further, there is nothing to indicate that the learned judge in CM 24/88 bad also decided that no offence had been committed by the defendant. Counsel for the defendant seems to argue that the learned judge must be taken to have so decided because the defendant had added itself as an applicant to CM 24/88. It seems plain to me that that was not and could not be the issue before the court as the complaints were not against the defendant. The arguments here of the defendant are very tenuous indeed. As Lord Denning indicated in 
 Fidelitas Shipping 
 
[1966] 1 QB 630
, for the plea of res judicata or issue estoppel to be successfully raised, the subject matter or the issue must have been `distinctly determined between the parties`. Other than that the complaints against Rising Sports could not stand, and the search warrants issued pursuant thereto had to be quashed, I do not think anything more could or should be read into the order of 22 July 1988.
An alternative argument raised by counsel for the plaintiff in relation to the second condition is this. Even assuming that the court did in CM 24/88 decide that the defendant had not committed an offence under s 73 when it had the shoes brought into Singapore, that in no way means that the plaintiff is precluded from instituting a civil action to protect its rights as the proprietor of the trade mark `Reebok`. Both are entirely different subject matters. I accept this argument. A simple illustration will bear this out. A person who is acquitted of a criminal charge in relation to a motor accident or an assault may still be sued in a civil claim. The reason should be apparent: the ingredients constituting a criminal offence are different from those of a civil claim. There is of course the additional point on burden of proof which will be dealt with below. In relation to the present case, what constitutes an offence is set out in s 73 and under that section, proof of innocence as to the infringement is a defence. On the other hand, the rights of a proprietor of a registered trade mark are set out in s 45. A prosecution under s 73 and a civil action to protect the rights of a trade mark proprietor are not coterminous.
A further alternative ground submitted by counsel for the plaintiff is that the burden of proof in a civil claim is different from a criminal case. Thus, there cannot be any estoppel. Counsel for the defendant referred to the case Hunts v Chief Constable where the House of Lords held that where a final decision had been made by a criminal court of competent jurisdiction it was a general rule of public policy that the use of a civil action to initiate a collateral attack on that decision was an abuse of the process of the court.
But the question of different standards of proof is clearly a material consideration and this is borne out by what Lord Diplock said in 
 Hunter v Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police 
 
[1982] AC 529
 at pp 542-543: 
 
... this is the first case to be reported in which the final decision against which it is sought to initiate a collateral attack by means of a civil action has been a final decision reached by a court of criminal jurisdiction. This raid a possible complication that the onus of proof of facts that lies upon the prosecution in criminal Proceedings is higher than that required of parties to civil proceedings who seek in those proceedings to prove facts on which they rely. Thus, 
 a decision in a criminal case upon a particular question in favour of a defendant whether by way of acquittal or a ruling on a voir dire, is not consistent with the fact that the decision would have been against him if all that were required were the civil standard of proof on the battle of probabilities
. This is why acquittals were not made admissible in evidence in civil actions by the Civil Evidence Act 1968. In contrast to this a decision on a particular question against a defendant in a criminal case, such as Bridge J`s ruling on the voir dire in the murder trial, is reached upon the higher criminal standard of proof beyond all reasonable doubt and is wholly inconsistent with any possibility that the decision would not have been against him if the same question had fallen to be decided in civil proceedings instead of criminal. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In passing I should add that his Lordships in 
 Hunter 
 were also of the view that `it would be best, in order to avoid confusion if the use of the description `issue estoppel` in English law at any rate ... were restricted to the specie of estoppel per rem judicatam that may arise in civil actions between the same parties or their privies ... `.
Putting the highest, and even assuming that the order of 22 July 1988 amounted to an acquittal of the defendant of a criminal charge under s 73, I do not see how the institution of the present civil action, where a different standard of proof prevails, is an abuse of the process of the court, or could give rise to a plea of `issue estoppel`. This is not comparing like with like. The acquittal will be quite irrelevant in a civil action.
For all the above reasons, the condition of an identity of subject matter or issue is clearly not satisfied in the present case.
As regards the third condition, the point in the present context really boils down to this: can the plaintiff be considered to be a privy to the Public Prosecutor in CM 24/88? Admittedly, the search warrants were issued by the magistrate on complaints of private investigator who were specifically engaged by the plaintiff for that purpose. There is considerable force in the contention that the complaints must be treated as having been made by the plaintiff.
The Public Prosecutor was the respondent in CM 24/88. In pursuance of s 336(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), the Public P rosecutor authorized Mr Alban Kang Choon Hwee and/or Mr Tan Woon Tiang, counsel for the plaintiff, to act for the Public Prosecutor at the hearing of the criminal motion. Counsel for the defendant submitted that as the complaints were made by agents of the plaintiff and as counsel for the plaintiff were appointed by the Public Prosecutor to act for the Public Prosecutor in the criminal motion, those facts render the plaintiff a privy to the criminal motion.
Now, there are three classes of privies - privies in blood; privies in law; and privies in estate: see 16 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 1543. The plaintiff cannot by any stretch of the imagination be considered to be a privy in blood or privy in law to the Public Prosecutor. To establish privy in estate, besides having to show that the privy and a party have a similar interest, the privy must also be shown to have derived title from the party. Examples of a privy in estate are testator and devisee, vendor and purchaser and lessor and lessee. I have grave doubts whether the plaintiff could be considered to be a privy in estate to the Public Prosecutor in the criminal motion. Indeed, I do not think the concept of privies applies in criminal proceedings, though in appropriate circumstances as in 
 Hunter 
 , a civil action could be struck out on the ground that it is an abuse of the process of the court. Of course 
 Hunter 
 was decided on the basis of the English Civil Evidence Act 1968 which overruled the decision in 
 Hollington v Hewthorn 
 [1943] KB 587; non-admissibility of conviction in subsequent civil action. Fortunately, in view of what I hold in regard to the second condition, there is no need for me to rule on this point. Suffice it to say that I would be disinclined to hold that the plaintiff was such a privy. It must be borne in mind that the Public Prosecutor was at all times in total control of the matter and could intervene at any stage of the proceedings or take over the proceedings or give instructions to counsel. Speaking from the Bar, counsel for the defendant informed me that due to various reasons, perhaps manpower constraints, the police have, in practice, left the investigations of alleged infringements of intellectual property rights to the aggrieved party and the Public Prosecutor has invariably authorized counsel for the aggrieved party to act and appear for the Public Prosecutor in criminal proceedings instituted thereby. But I do not see how this practice affects the legal position that the counsel so authorized is the mouthpiece of the Public Prosecutor and not of the individual complainant.
One final point: the plaintiff through its counsel requested the Public Prosecutor to appeal against the decision in CM 24/88. The Public Prosecutor, however, refused. The matter ended there.
Accordingly, on the preliminary point of law, I have to rule that there is no merit on the plea of res judicata or isssue estoppel and that there is nothing to preclude the plaintiff from commencing the present suit. Neither does the commencement of such an action amount to an abuse of the process of the court. Nothing in the circumstances of the present action comes near to what Lord Halsbury said in 
 Reichel v Magrath 
 
(1889) 14 App Cas 665
 at p 668: `I think it would be a scandal to the administration of justice if, the same question having been disposed of by one case, the litigant were to be permitted by changing the form of the proceedings to set up the same case again.`

(delivering the grounds of decision of the court): The accused was tried before on us on the following charge, ie: 
 
That you Chan Kim Choi on or about 8 April 1985 at about 9pm at `Big A` Fried Chicken Restaurant, Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre, Upper Serangoon Road, Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Lee Mui Kee, and you have committed an offence of murder, punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, defence counsel made a submission that the defence had no case to answer. We found, on the basis of the law as stated in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 , that the prosecution had made out a case against the accused which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction. Accordingly, we called on the accused, in the words of the standard allocution, to enter on his defence.
The accused elected to remain silent. However, he called two witnesses. At the conclusion of the case for the defence and after hearing and considering the final submissions of counsel for the defence and the deputy public prosecutor, we convicted the accused of murder and sentenced him to death.
We now give our reasons for convicting him.
 The case for the prosecution
The evidence adduced by the prosecution consisted of the testimonies of witnesses at the scene of the incident, medical evidence on the stab wound and the cause of death of the deceased, and a voluntary statement made by the accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68).
The deceased, one Lee Mui Kee, died from a single stab wound inflicted on the left side of his neck. Prof Chao Tzee Cheng (PW3), a forensic pathologist, testified that he went to the `Big A` Fried Chicken Restaurant at about 11pm on 8 April 1985 in answer to a call from the police. There he found the deceased, already dead, lying in a pool of blood on the floor with a stab wound on the neck on the left side and another cut wound at the back of the right wrist. He did a post-mortem on the deceased the next day and made the following finding: 
 
Stab wound on left lower neck 6 cm long with the blunt end inside and sharp end outside plunging downwards and backwards from left to right side of the body at an angle of 45 degrees. It had transected the left common carotid artery, the oesophagus, the trachea and the right common carotid artery. It went over to the right side making a through and through wound on the right upper lobe of lung and ended up at the parietal pleura at the back of right 6th and 7th intercostal space cutting the 7th rib. The total depth was 24 cm. This was a fatal wound.
 
 
 
Cut at the back of right wrist 3 cm. Superficial wound.
Prof Chao was of the opinion that in view of the depth of the stab wound and the injuries suffered by the deceased, the stab wound in the neck had been inflicted with considerable force. The whole of the blade of the knife had gone into the neck and had transected various internal parts thereof. He said that it would not be possible to save someone with such injuries and that the deceased would have died a few minutes after being so stabbed. He was also of the opinion that the cut wound on the wrist was a defensive wound. He said that the stab wound was consistent with having been inflicted by either of the two knives which were found at the scene of the incident.
The said two knives were found at the scene of the incident by Lee Kok Kian (PW19) who was the first police officer to arrive there and who preserved the scene of the incident. As shown in P20 the knife which was heavily stained with blood was slightly less than 24 cm in length whilst the other was just over 24 cm long.
The prosecution called five witnesses to testify what they had seen at the time of the incident. We summarize below their testimony. 
 
 
(a) Lee Leong Huat (PW10), who was employed as a supervisor at the restaurant, said that at about 8.20pm the restaurant was not crowded and that he had taken an order for a jug of beer and some chicken from the accused and the deceased who were sitting at table 2. He could not remember if they were later joined by any other person. At about 9pm, whilst in his office, he heard a commotion and a scream in the restaurant. He came out of his office and saw a man (the accused) chasing another man (the deceased). The deceased was running towards table 9 and he had a lot of blood on his neck. The accused caught up with the deceased near table no 8 (see P51). PW10 saw the accused press his left hand against the chest of the deceased. The accused was about to stab the deceased when the latter fell onto the floor. The accused then ran away. He confirmed that he saw the two knives lying on the floor as shown in P17. He then called the police.
  
 
 
Counsel for the accused applied to impeach the credit of this witness on the ground that there was a discrepancy between his testimony in court that he saw only two persons sitting at table 2 and his statement made on 14 September 1985 wherein he had stated there were two other persons who had come into the restaurant and walked towards table 2. We allowed the application. When cross-examined about this discrepancy, the witness agreed he had made the statement and confirmed the truth of its contents, although he could not remember any details concerning the two men who came in. He was also cross-examined on another discrepancy between his testimony that when he first saw the deceased, the latter was at a point near to table 8 and his statement wherein he had said that the deceased was staggering from table 2. However, the witness was positive the accused had chased the deceased.
In our view, we were not in a position to conclude that the credit of this witness had been successfully impeached. Both his statement and his oral testimony were given a long time after the incident and it was not improbable that he could not have remembered in exact detail what crossed his vision as he came out of his office. However, there was consistency in his evidence about the accused having chased the deceased although he could not remember exactly where the chase had started from or where the deceased was when he first saw him. There was, however, evidence that the two knives were found lying near on either side of the body of the deceased. PW8 subsequently also testified that she saw the accused chasing the deceased and was about to stab the deceased when he collapsed, whereupon the accused threw away the knife and ran away. These two bits of evidence, unless disbelieved or rebutted, would tend to show that the accused had certainly ran after or in the same direction as the deceased. It would not be unreasonable for the witness to describe this as a chase. Accordingly, we did not think that the credit of this witness had been impeached. 
 
 
(b) Toh Kwee Choo (PW7), another supervisor at the restaurant, also testified that she had been instructed by PW1O to and did serve a jug of beer and glasses to the deceased and the accused at table 2. She could not remember what shirt the accused was wearing. She also recalled seeing two or three persons coming into the restaurant later but she was unable to say whether these persons sat at table 2. Not long after their arrival, she heard noise of tables and chairs falling over. She was then standing at the service counter with her back to table 2. She turned round and saw the deceased running towards table no 9. He was then in front of the dispenser counter and there was blood on his neck. She also saw the accused holding a knife and chasing the deceased. At table 9, the deceased turned round. The accused then tried to stab the deceased a `second` time but before he could do so, the deceased fell on the ground. The accused then ran out of the restaurant.
  
 
 
Counsel for the accused also applied to impeach the credit of this witness on the ground that in her previous statement made on 13 September 1985 she had not said anything about the accused chasing the deceased and trying to stab him. We allowed counsel to cross-examine the witness on the statement of 13 September 1985. In cross-examination, she explained that although she did not see the accused stabbing the deceased the first time, she thought that he must have done so as there were only two persons at table 2. However, she admitted that she had not, in her statement, disclosed that she saw the accused chasing the deceased and trying to stab him. Her reason for not having done so was that she was confused and frightened. She admitted that the investigation officer, Johnny Ho (PW28), had questioned her on whether she had seen the accused chasing or trying to stab the deceased and that she had not given a reply. PW28 subsequently testified that he had questioned her on these matters and that if she had given such answers, they would have appeared in her statement. In view of this, we considered that her evidence on the chase and the attempted stabbing was not reliable and we ignored it when calling for the defence. 
 
 
(c) Chng Siew Choo (PW8), a waitress employed at the restaurant, said that at about 8pm she saw two male Chinese sitting at table 2. She heard them talking in a normal fashion. At about 9pm another two male Chinese came in and walked towards table 2. One of them asked her for an empty drinking glass. She brought it to table 2. The situation at table 2 remained normal. Half an hour later, while standing at the cashier`s counter, she heard the noise of tables failing over from the direction of table 2. She then saw the deceased running from table 2 and bleeding from the neck being chased by the accused. The accused tried to stab the deceased `one more time` but did not do so as the deceased was `dead` and leaning against table 9. The accused then threw away the knife and ran away. She could not recognize which knife the accused had been holding whilst chasing the deceased. The other two male Chinese who had come in later were standing there for a while and then left. In cross-examination, she said that table 2 was placed against and touching the wall and that the accused and the deceased had been sitting side by side, the deceased on the left of the accused, and the other two male Chinese sitting on the opposite side of the table. She also said that the deceased ran towards table 9 along the passage between the tables and the restaurant counter. 
 
(d) Toh Bee Choo (PW11), another waitress at the restaurant, testified that she saw the accused and the deceased eating and talking at table 2. She also heard the sound of tables falling and later saw the deceased lying on the floor in a pool of blood with a wound in his neck and a knife as shown in P18. She could not recall anything more. 
 
(e) Leo Jim Kee (PW9), the proprietor of the restaurant, was in his office when he heard a table and a chair failing. When the noise continued, he came out of his office into the restaurant and saw a man, his body dripping with blood, holding on to table 9 and about to fall over. He also saw a crowd of people standing up and leaving the restaurant. He then told his supervisor to call the police.
  
 
 
The testimonies of the witnesses who were not at the scene of the incident in so far as they have some bearing on the incident are summarized below. 
 
 
(f) Lee Mui Tong (PW14), the brother of the deceased, testified that two or three weeks before the stabbing, the deceased had asked him for $1,000 to repay a loan shark called `Lau Hee Low`, which sum he had borrowed for the accused. PW14 was told by the deceased that the accused did not have money to repay the loan and that if the loan were not paid he, the deceased, would be assaulted by Lau Hee Low. PW14 further testified that he agreed to pay the said sum directly to Lau Hee Low but that his brother preferred to do it himself. He gave the money to the deceased who, he said, paid the money to Lau Hee Low the same day. The rest of his testimony was not material to the charge.
  
 
 
Under cross-examination, PW14 said that he did not know Lau Hee Low personally but had heard of him and that he did not know how to contact him. PW14 also did not know whether the deceased had actually borrowed money from Lau Hee Low or when the friendship between the accused and the deceased began. 
 
 
(g) Ng Chee Keong (PW17), a friend of the accused, testified that on 8 April 1985 at about 10am, whilst he was having a drink at the Farrer Road Hawker Centre with his brother, Ng Kian Kee (PW15) and two neighbours, Ng Hock Chwee (PW16) and Tan Hang Li (PW18), the accused came and sat beside him. The accused was nervous. The accused then told PW17 that he had stabbed someone to death with a knife. The accused, who was wearing a colourful striped T-shirt, then told PW17 that he needed some money whereupon PW17 gave him $400. The accused then asked PW17 to lend him a shirt as his was stained with blood. PW17 then left the accused at the coffee stall and went to his mother`s house nearby and returned with a green coloured T-shirt. He handed the said shirt to the accused who then went into the toilet and, a short while later, came out wearing the green T-shirt. The accused joined the group for a while and then left. After that, PW17 told PW15, PW16 and PW18 what the accused had told him.
  
 
 
PW17 and the accused first became friends when they were serving national service in the same unit during the period 1978/80. They used to go out together and also drank coffee at the same coffee stall. Since his discharge in 1980, PW17 had not gone out with the accused.
Under cross-examination, PW17 said that he could not recall whether the accused had told him of a fight at the Big `A` Fried Chicken Restaurant. He also did not notice whether the accused had any blood on him.
Our observation on the evidence of PW17 was that he was trying to deny his friendship with the accused after both of them had left national service. The friendship must have been continuing as otherwise the accused could not have gone to look for and found PW17 at the Farrer Road hawker stalls. Nevertheless, PW17`s testimony that the accused had told him that he had stabbed the deceased was not seriously challenged in cross-examination. What was challenged was PW17`s evidence that the accused had not told him that the stabbing occurred in a fight at the `Big A`. 
 
 
(h) Ng Kian Lee (PW15), in his testimony, confirmed the testimony of his brother (PW17) except that he did not hear what the accused had told PW17 although they were talking for about ten minutes. The testimony of Ng Hock Chwee (PW16) and Tan Hang Li (PW18) was substantially the same as that of PW15. 
 
(i) Chan Kim Suan (PW29), the uncle of the accused, testified that he knew both the accused and the deceased, that they were very good friends from childhood days, that the deceased was a suspected gangster who was, at one time, released into his custody on probation. PW29 said that both the accused and the deceased were good boys although they were hot-tempered and would `fight to the end` if tortured or angered. He did not know why the accused would stab the deceased.
  
 
 
PW29 testified further that on the night of the incident, PW29 went to the scene immediately after he was informed by PW14 that the deceased had been killed in the restaurant. At the restaurant, PW29 met Insp Johnny Ho (PW28) and directed PW28 initially to 95Q Punggol Road and then to Blk 23 Hougang, to look for the accused. The accused could not be found at either place. PW14 then went home to 203 Lorong Buangkok at about 12 midnight. He found the accused waiting for him. He told the accused that the police was looking for him and asked why the accused was involved in a fight at the restaurant and whether he knew the deceased was dead. The accused became excited and exclaimed `Ah! Mui Kee die?`. He then told PW29 that he was involved in a fight in the restaurant because of a loan of $2,000 which he and the deceased had borrowed from a moneylender, that the moneylender has a gang and that he bought two knives in order to fight as they had in the past been `tortured` and beaten up in connection with their previous loans. 
 
 
(j) Inspector Johnny Ho (PW28), the investigation officer, testified as follows. He arrived at the scene at 10.35pm and took charge of the investigation. He instructed a sketch plan (P51) to be drawn and photographs (P1-P31) to be taken. He saw a trail of blood leading from the restaurant to the pavement outside the shopping centre in front of ABC coffee house. He collected the two knives, together with their paper covers, two crash helmets and also various blood swabs. During the course of the investigation, PW28 was able to establish the following facts: 
 
(1) one Lim Beng Gee, a police officer, who had accompanied Chan Kim Suan (PW29) to 95Q Punggol Road and Blk 23, Hougang Ave 3 (where the deceased lived), found some fresh drops of blood on the void deck of Blk 23. Lim collected a piece of tissue paper stained with blood and a blood swab and a motorcycle crash helmet which articles were subsequently handed over to PW28. He also discovered that shortly after the stabbing, a man went to the house of the deceased and informed the deceased`s mother that his son had been killed. 
 
(2) John Masih (PW21), a police officer, had taken custody of the accused when the latter surrendered himself in the company of Chan Kim Suan (PW29) at about 2.50am. PW28 interviewed the accused at about 3.40 pm and as a result of what the accused had said left his office at about 4.05 am with the accused to Farrer Road Hawker Centre where the accused showed him a blue plastic pail outside the `Gents` toilet where he had thrown his blood-stained T-shirt earlier. Photographs were duly taken (P41 to P46). 
 
(3) The medical examinations of the accused both before and after he gave a statement to the police under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) showed that the accused`s medical condition was normal and that he did not have any external injuries on his body. 
 
(4) Various articles including the two knives, the blood swabs and the tissue paper were sent for analysis for blood group. A specimen blood was also taken from the accused with his consent. The results were as follows (see P57): 
 
(i) the blood swabs taken at the restaurant and on both knives was group O; 
 
(ii) the blood on the tissue paper and the blood swab from Blk 23 was group B; 
 
(iii) the blood group of the accused was A.
  
 
 
PW28 also testified that although he had instructed his officers to trace the identities of the other persons who had been seen at or near table 2 in the restaurant, the results were negative. However, under cross-examination, he admitted that his screening of the deceased for secret society affiliation disclosed that the deceased was in 1980 listed as a member of a secret society.
The court, in exercise of its power under s 399 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), summoned Lim Sye Imm, the mother of the deceased, to give evidence. The court exercised this power in response to the submission of defence counsel that the police might have learnt the identity of the man who told her of her son`s death but had not pursued their investigation diligently. Madam Lim testified that on 8 April 1985 at about 9pm, a male Chinese came up to her flat and told her that her son had been stabbed to death at a shopping centre. She had never seen the informant before and was not told who had stabbed her son. The informant then left and after that she received a telephone call from someone with a male voice who said that her son had been killed at the shopping centre at 5 milestone Upper Serangoon Road. Madam Lim also testified that the deceased had told her that he had borrowed money from a loan shark and that he had to sell his motor car in order to repay the loan.
The prosecution tendered in evidence, pursuant to s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code, a statement made by the accused under s 122(6) thereof. The defence challenged the admissibility of this statement on the ground that the accused had been induced to make it by an alleged misrepresentation or promise by the police officers (ie they told the accused that they would treat the case as one of a gang fight). However, in the midst of the trial-within-a-trial, counsel for the defence, on the instruction of the accused, accepted the statement as having been voluntarily made. The statement was accordingly admitted in evidence. The statement read as follows: 
 
On 6 April 1985 the deceased `Ah Tee` asked me whether I was prepared to pay the loan of $2,000. As I did not borrow this sum of money from the illegal moneylender I refused to repay him the loan. Ah Tee then told me to get someone to settle the matter with him. He had suggested that I could go to his house at Hougang, Avenue 3 on 8 April 1985 at 7.30pm. At the stated time I went to his house to look for him, but he was not at home. I have carried two knives with me, I tucked them in my trousers at the left waist and covered them up with my T-shirt. I bought the knives from an emporium at Hougang, Avenue 6 before going to look for the deceased at his house. When I could not find him I went to the ground floor to wait for him.
 
 
 
I wish to add that I brought the knives to his place because I expected that I would be confronted by the deceased and his friends when I was unable to give him any money. In fact prior to this meeting there were instances that I was assaulted by the deceased and his friends when I did not have money to give them. About half an hour later I saw the deceased coming towards the block. When I spotted him I called him. Ah Tee came to me and asked me to follow him to Upper Serangoon Shopping Centre. I agreed and sat on his motorcycle. On our way to the Upper Serangoon shopping centre I noticed that there were two motorcycles behind us. I believe that the motorcyclists behind are from his gang. On arrival Ah Tee led me to the Big `A` fried chicken restaurant, both of us occupied a table in the restaurant. Ah Tee ordered a jug of beer and some chicken. The motorcyclists and the pillion riders did not enter the restaurant. They waited outside.
Whilst we were still in the restaurant another four of the deceased`s gang came into the restaurant, one of them sat with us while the others sat at the next table. When we were about to finish the chicken and the beer, Ah Tee asked me whether I had brought the $2,000 to him. When I answered him that I did not have money to give him even I agreed to pay the loan. On hearing what I said Ah Tee was unhappy and gave me a punch. I managed to dodge away but I was still hit slightly by the punch on my right cheek near the eye. After which Ah Tee and his gang stood up and came towards me, before they could do anything I whipped out a knife from my trousers and stabbed Ah Tee with it. I remember stabbing the deceased once. I then saw one of his gang members came forward. I immediately whip out another knife to attack him. I did not know whether I had stab that person or not. At the same time I saw Ah Tee collapsed onto the ground. I immediately threw the knife which I was holding and fled.
From the scene I took a taxi to my friend`s house at Farrer Road to borrow a shirt from my friend. I changed into a fresh clothing and sat in the Farrer Road hawker centre for a while. After I had a cup of tea at the hawker centre I took a taxi to Ponggol and went into hiding. In my uncle`s house I consider the matter again and decided to surrender myself to the police, I then requested my uncle to send me to the Paya Lebar Police Station where I surrender myself. That is all I have to say.
The above is a summary of the material evidence adduced by the prosecution at the close of its case.
Defence counsel made a long submission that the accused should not be called to enter on his defence as the prosecution had not adduced sufficient credible evidence which if unrebutted would warrant conviction. Counsel relied on three grounds. The first was the narrow ground that there was no credible evidence that the accused had stabbed the deceased in the neck. No witness had testified to that fact. The accused had in his cautioned statement admitted to stabbing the deceased but as there was evidence that the deceased also had a cut wound on his arm, counsel suggested that the accused`s admission could refer to the second wound rather than the first. We rejected this submission. To our mind, there was credible evidence that the accused had stabbed the deceased in the neck. The cut wound on the deceased`s arm was a defensive wound and was consistent with an attempt to ward off the stab which landed on the neck. The evidence showed that no one else in the restaurant but the accused had a knife on him. Similarly, no one else was seen to have stabbed the deceased. It would be wholly unreasonable for the court to contemplate that the wound in the neck could have been inflicted by any of the deceased`s friends.
The second ground was that the prosecution had failed to produce credible evidence that the stabbing by the accused was done with the intention of causing (i) death; or (ii) injury as the accused knew to be likely to cause death or was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
Counsel submitted that the fact that the deceased had died from the stab wound did not necessarily mean that the accused had intended to cause his death as the accused might not have intended to inflict that particular injury. It was also said that there was no motive for the killing, that none had been shown to have existed and that if the accused had intended to kill the deceased, he could have done so earlier as he had the opportunity of doing so at the void deck of Blk 23.
Counsel also relied on the statements in the accused`s cautioned statement as evidence that the accused had stabbed the deceased when he had first been assaulted by the deceased and then threatened by his gang as well. It was submitted that these statements not only created a reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case but was also sufficient to establish the general exception of private defence or one or more of the special exceptions to s 300 of the Penal Code.
The statements in the cautioned statement relied on by counsel for the defence were as follows: 
 
 
(1) prior to the incident, the accused had been assaulted by the deceased and his friends when he did not have money to give them; 
 
(2) prior to his meeting the deceased on 8 April 1985, the accused bought two knives on the expectation that he would be confronted by the deceased and his friends; 
 
(3) he met the deceased at the ground floor of the deceased`s flat and agreed to follow the deceased to the Big `A` restaurant; he sat on the deceased`s motorcycle; 
 
(4) they were followed by two motorcycles whose riders belonged to the deceased`s gang; 
 
(5) four of the deceased`s gang came into the restaurant while he and the deceased were drinking and eating; 
 
(6) the deceased gave him a punch which hit him slightly on the left cheek; 
 
(7) the deceased and his gang stood up and came towards him whereupon he took out a knife and stabbed the deceased; when one member of the gang came forward, he took out the other knife to attack him.
  
 
 
This submission raised the issue as to whether or not statements made by an accused in a cautioned statement were admissible in evidence as the truth of the facts stated therein. Counsel contended that this was the law in Singapore, that where a cautioned statement was adduced as part of the prosecution`s case, it was admitted as substantive evidence of the truth of the facts stated therein: counsel referred to the following authorities: (i) 
 PP v Mohamed Noor Jantan 
 
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 80
 ; (ii) 
 Packiam v PP 
 
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 247
 ; (iii) 
 Chee Chiew Heong v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 287
 ; (iv) 
 PP v Lim Chor Pee 
 
 
 [1981] 2 MLJ 
 i; and (v) an article `The Admissibility and Effect of Exculpatory Statements in Criminal Cases` by Stanley Yeo Meng Heong published in 
 
 [1981] 2 MLJ 
 lxxi.
Counsel further contended as follows: 
 
 
(a) the defence was entitled, without the accused having to adduce evidence, to rely on the prosecution`s evidence to create a reasonable doubt in the mind of the court as regards the absence of one or more of the ingredients of the offence: see 
 Jayasena v The Queen 
 
[1970] AC 618
 at p 626 C-D; 
 
(b) likewise, the defence was entitled to rely on the prosecution evidence to discharge the burden, which was on the accused, of proving the existence of circumstances bringing his case within any of the general exceptions or the special exceptions in the Penal Code: see 
 The Crown v Muzaffar Hussain 
 (1943) 45 PLR 393; 
 
(c) the cautioned statement of the accused had created a doubt as to whether the accused had the requisite intention to kill the deceased or to cause such bodily injury as the accused knew to be likely to cause death or was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death: 
 Mohamed Yasin bin Hussin v PP 
 
 
 
[1976] 1 MLJ 156
 ; 
 
(d) the cautioned statement was sufficient to enable the accused to discharge the burden of proving the general exception of private defence and exceptions 2, 4 or 1, in that order, to s 300.
  
 
 
We considered these submissions and agreed that an accused was entitled to rely on any evidence adduced by the prosecution to raise a reasonable doubt as to the prosecution`s case as well as to establish his own. In 
 Jayasena v The Queen 
 
[1970] AC 618
 Lord Devlin in delivering the judgment of the Privy Council said: 
 
... But it must be remembered that the evidence on which the accused relies, when an issue of provocation or private defence is raised, may go to challenge the prosecution`s case as well as to establishing his own. The present case, as Mr Gratiaen has said, is a clear case of confession and avoidance; the defence admitted the intention to kill and relied entirely upon private defence. It is, however, much more frequent for an accused to deny the intention. He will say that he did not intend to kill or cause serious bodily injury but that anyway he was acting in self-defence. Likewise provocation and accident often feature together in an accused`s story. In such a case it is not only proper, but may be necessary, for the judge to remind the jury that the burden of establishing intention beyond a reasonable doubt rests always on the prosecution. The point has recently been before the Supreme Court of India in relation to the defence of insanity. In 
 Dahyabhai v State of Gujarat
 [1964] 7 SCR 361, Subha Rao J, at p 365, pointed out that evidence that fell short of proof of insanity might yet raise a reasonable doubt about the existence of the requisite intention. In 
 Bhikari v State of Uttar Pradesh
 [1965] 3 SCR 194, Mudholkar J said, at p 198:
 
 
 
`If upon the evidence adduced in the case, whether by the prosecution or by the accused, a reasonable doubt is created in the mind of the court as regards one or more of the ingredients of the offence, including mens rea of the accused, he would be entitled to be acquitted. This is very different from saying that the prosecution must also establish the sanity of the accused at the time of commission of the offence despite what has been expressly provided for in s 105 of the Evidence Act.`
 
 
 
Their Lordships respectfully agree with this observation.
 
 
 
In 
 The Crown v Muzaffar Hussain 
 (1943) 45 PLR 393, Sir Abdul Rahman J said: 
 
Once the prosecution is found to have established that an offence was committed by the accused the burden of proving the existence of circumstances bringing his case within any of the general exceptions in the Penal Code or with any special exception contained in any other part of that Code lies on the accused and the court has to presume the absence of such circumstances. Thus the burden of proving that the accused had acted in exercise of the right of self-defence which is in the nature of an exception is on him. It is true that this burden can be discharged otherwise than by producing defence evidence; but in those cases the version of the accused must be proved to have been established or in any case prima facie made out either by the prosecution evidence or by circumstances proved on behalf of the prosecution or elicited by the accused in his cross-examination of the witnesses for the prosecution. It cannot be disputed that the accused need not be called upon to establish right of self-defence unless the prosecution has succeeded in proving a case. But in a case where it has succeeded in making out the main facts, the prosecution cannot be thrown out merely because the prosecution evidence is to be regarded as unreliable on a few points.
 
 
 
However, we did not accept counsel`s submission that a cautioned statement, when admitted as part of the prosecution`s evidence, was substantive evidence of the truth of all the contents therein irrespective of the character of such statements. We did not think that the authorities cited by counsel supported his submission nor did we agree with such authorities if they did. In our view, the law makes a distinction between inculpatory (or disserving) statements and exculpatory (or self-serving) statements.
In 
 PP v Mohamed Noor Jantan 
 
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 80
 , the accused was charged with unlawful possession of an offensive weapon. He made a cautioned statement under s 75 of the Internal Security Act 1960 (which was, in terms, similar to s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code) that he had bought the knife from Changkat Stadium from which statement it could be inferred (as the court did) that he had the weapon for a lawful purpose. The prosecution decided not to produce this statement but was ordered to do so by the court. The accused was acquitted. The deputy public prosecutor appealed on the ground that the cautioned statement was not admissible in evidence. The High Court held that it was admissible in evidence in these words (at p 81): 
 
In the normal course of things a prosecutor who anticipates that a cautioned statement would prove useful for just such a purpose would produce it during the course of the prosecution case, and wait for the accused person to testify so that he would have available a useful weapon with which to shake his credit. Those words, however, do not restrict the admissibility to such purpose only, and since the statement is substantive evidence defence is at liberty to ask for and secure its admission during the course of the prosecution case. It follows that if after considering the cautioned statement and such other evidence as the prosecution had already adduced, the court finds that there is prima facie no case to answer, the court should of course acquit the accused at this stage.
 
 
 
We were unable to find anything in this passage or any part of the judgment to suggest that the judge had accepted the exculpatory part of the cautioned statement as true simply because the cautioned statement was admitted in evidence.
In 
 Packiam v PP 
 
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 247
  the first appellant, Packiam, had been convicted of voluntarily disposing of stolen property and the second appellant had been convicted of dishonestly retaining stolen property. The prosecution`s case was based primarily on the testimony of a police inspector that when the second appellant produced the box and the things in it, he had said that the things were brought by Packiam for him to keep. On appeal, the court held that the statement was inadmissible in evidence as a confession because it had been given not in compliance with s 26 of the Evidence Ordinance. In the course of his judgment, the judge said: 
 
The question therefore to be considered is whether it is admissible. If it is sought to be admitted as a confession by the second appellant, it is not in compliance with s 26 of the Evidence Ordinance and it is in violation of s 25. See also: 
 Lee Yew Seng & Ors v PP
, at p 216. But in its context it is clearly not a confession in the sense of an admission by the second appellant that he had received the goods but there was nothing in this admission to indicate that he had obtained such possession of the stolen articles and acquired such a knowledge of their origin that he should be said to have dishonestly retained them. As I read and understood the words, they were nothing more than an admission that he was constituted a bailee of these goods and in my view without any evidence that he knew of their dishonest origin, he could not be said to have been dishonestly in possession.
 
 
 
In his article `The Admissibility and Effect of Exculpatory Statements in Criminal Cases`, an academic writer relied on this passage as additional support for his thesis that exculpatory statements made by an accused, when admitted as evidence, was evidence of the truth of its contents. The writer says (at p lxxiv): 
 
It will be suggested here that unlike the English position, the statutory provisions in Singapore and Malaysia enable exculpatory statements to be admissible for all purposes. In particular, such statements are regarded as substantive evidence, that is, evidence of the truth of what is contained in them. Those statutory provisions discussed on the issue of admissibility will also be relied on here.
 
 
 
Section 21(3) of the Evidence Act enables an admission to be proved by or on behalf of the person making it if it is relevant otherwise than as an admission. There can be little doubt that the phrase `to be proved` denotes that the facts contained in the statement will be treated as substantive evidence. Illustration (d) of the section supports this contention. The accused`s statement that he refused to sell stolen goods below their value can be admitted as showing that he did not know that the goods were stolen. Similarly in the Malaysian decision cited earlier, 
 Packiam & Anor v PP 
, the second appellant`s statement was considered as nothing more than an admission that he was a bailee of the stolen articles. The court then held that, without there being any evidence that he knew of their dishonest origin, the second appellant could not be said to have dishonestly retained the said articles. This conclusion could only have been arrived at by treating the facts in the statement as true.
In our view, 
 Packiam 
`s case 
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 247
  did not support the writer`s thesis nor counsel`s submission. In that case the judge took the view that the statement was not a confession in the sense of admitting guilt but if it were a confession it was not admissible at all. In fact, the judge held that the statement was inadmissible and, there being no other evidence against both the appellants, quashed their conviction.
In 
 Chee Chiew Heong v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 287
 , the accused was charged with unlawful possession of a dangerous drug. The drug had been found next to her while she was sleeping in the compartment of a train which was travelling to Kuala Lumpur. After her arrest, she gave a cautioned statement in which she stated that she had been given a package by her husband`s friend to deliver to his relatives. She was told the package contained dried prawns. She thought the contents felt like dried prawns and accordingly did not open the package. The cautioned statement was put in by the prosecution as part of its evidence. The court disregarded the statement and convicted her. On appeal to the High Court, the conviction was quashed on the ground that the statutory presumption that possession of the container in which the dangerous drug was found was deemed to be possession of the drug itself had been rebutted by the cautioned statement. The judge appeared to have accepted the exculpatory statements of the accused as evidence of the truth. But there was no argument on this point and the ruling was made on the basis that the statements had been admitted as part of the prosecution`s case. Accordingly, we did not regard this case as an authority for counsel`s proposition.
In 
 PP v Lim Chor Pee 
 
 
 [1981] 2 MLJ 
 i, the accused was charged with criminal breach of trust of clients` moneys. The senior district judge acquitted the accused at the end of the prosecution`s case as he was not satisfied that the prosecution had proved that the funds in question belonged to the clients or that the accused had a dishonest intention in transferring them abroad. The judge dealt with the cautioned statement of the accused as follows: 
 
The prosecution has tendered as part of the evidence, the statements made by the accused pursuant to s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (exhs P18 and P19) explaining the reason why he transferred the sum of money in question to London. These statements, though unsworn, are admissible in evidence and since they are substantive evidence, I am of the view that it is open to this court to consider them at this stage of the proceedings (see 
 PP v Mohamed Noor Jantan
 
 
 
[1979] 2 MLJ 80
 ). It is for this court to consider whether his explanation is or might be true in the light of all the other evidence in order to determine if a prima facie case has been made out by the prosecution (see 
 R v Storey & Anwar
 (1968) 52 CAR 334) ...
 
 
 
I have carefully considered the accused`s statements in the light of all the other evidence, both documentary as well as oral and whilst his use of the client account to effect the transfer of funds to London appears to be in breach of the Rules, I cannot say that there can be inferred a dishonest intention on his part when he did so, being satisfied that they are in all probability true.
The Public Prosecutor appealed against the acquittal, but the Chief Justice dismissed the appeal.
It is clear to us that in 
 Lim Chor Pee 
`s case the district judge did not accept the accused`s explanation given in his cautioned statement as true simply because it was admitted as part of the prosecution`s evidence. He clearly stated that the explanations must be considered in the light of all the other evidence. The district judge referred to the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
 R v Storey & Anwar 
 (1968) 52 Cr App R 334. In that case, the police had found on entering the defendant`s flat a large quantity of cannabis. In a voluntary statement not on oath the defendant gave the explanation that it belonged to a man who had brought it into her flat against her will and the explanation, if true, would have afforded a complete answer to the charge. At the close of the case for the prosecution a submission was made by the defence that there was no case to answer. The judge overruled this submission and called for the defence. The defendant elected not to give evidence. The trial judge left the issue as to the truth or otherwise of the accused`s explanation to the jury. The accused was convicted. The Court of Appeal held that the judge`s ruling was correct. In delivering the leading judgment of the court, Widgery LJ said: 
 
The court has given careful consideration to this important point. We think it right to recognize that a statement made by the accused to the police, although it always forms evidence in the case against him, is not in itself evidence of the truth of the facts stated. A statement made voluntarily by an accused person to the police is evidence in the trial because of its vital relevance as showing the reaction of the accused when first taxed with the incriminating facts. If, of course, the accused admits the offence, then as a matter of shorthand one says that the admission is proof of guilt, and, indeed, in the end it is. But if the accused makes a statement which does not amount to an admission, the statement is not strictly evidence of the truth of what was said, but is evidence of the reaction of the accused which forms part of the general picture to be considered by the jury at the trial.
 
 
 
Accordingly, in our judgment, in this case the fact that the cannabis was on the applicant`s bed in her flat was in itself some evidence of possession to go to the jury. Her unsworn explanation, although, if true, it would have been a complete answer to the charge, did not cancel out or nullify the evidence which was provided by the presence of the cannabis. It was ultimately for the jury to decide whether that explanation was or might be true, and it was not for the judge necessarily to accept it at the stage when he was considering the submission. In the event therefore, we have come to the conclusion that the learned judge was entitled to and right to leave this matter to the jury and not to withdraw it from them merely because the accused`s unsworn explanation would, if true, have been a complete answer to the charge.
In 
 The Queen v Leung Kam Kwok 
 [1986] HKLR 188 a similar issue arose in a trial in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong Court of Appeal appeared to have suggested that in Hong Kong exculpatory statements of an accused should be admissible as evidence of the truth of their contents. The Privy Council on appeal re-stated the law of England in these words: 
 
... when considering whether the appellant`s defence had been properly placed before the jury, the Court of Appeal made certain observations upon the evidential status of the appellant`s several statements. The appellant, as already stated, did not go into the witness box. He had admitted responsibility for the killing in those statements but claimed that he had had no intent to kill and that he had fired upwards as a warning. The learned commissioner made no comment upon the appellant`s failure to give evidence though, in their Lordships` view, he might well have done so. But the Court of Appeal, following an earlier decision of that court in 
 Cheng Chiu v The Queen
 [1980] HKLR 50, appears to have treated the part of his statements concerned with his lack of intention as evidence of their truth even though they were not made on oath before the jury and were to this extent what have been called in this context `self-serving` statements. In their judgment in 
 Cheng Chiu
 the Court of Appeal considered a number of relevant English decisions some of which the court suggested ought not to be followed in Hong Kong.
 
 
 
Their Lordships respectfully suggest that the position resulting from those English decisions is not as complicated as the Court of Appeal there appeared to have thought. If an accused person in a statement not made on oath in court denies his guilt, saying, for example, `I am not guilty: I was not there` and no more, that statement is not evidence of the truth of his absence from the scene of the crime and thus of the truth of his alibi. But if such a statement consists partly of an admission and partly of an explanation, for example, `I shot him: it was an accident or I shot him: I was provoked`, the admission is plainly admissible and common fairness requires that the entirety of the statement should be admitted so as to show the precise context in which the admission was made, even though what is said by way of explanation or excuse is not evidence of its truth. Where the accused goes into the witness box and repeats the explanation or excuse on oath there is no problem. Where he does not go into the witness box it behoves the trial judge, when dealing in his summing up with the admission, in common fairness to the accused, also to refer to the accompanying explanation or excuse, adding if he thinks fit to do so that that explanation or excuse has not been supported by evidence on oath before the jury. It is then for the jury to evaluate the admission and the unsworn explanation or excuse as they think fit.
So to state is little more than to repeat and adopt the statements succinctly and correctly made by James LJ when giving the judgment of the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) in 
 R v Donaldson & Ors 
 [1977] 64 Cr App R 59 at p 65: 
 
`In our view there is a clear distinction to be made between statements of admission adduced by the Crown as part of the case against the defendant and statements entirely of a self-serving nature made and sought to be relied upon by a defendant. When the Crown adduces a statement relied upon as an admission it is for the jury to consider the whole statement including any passages that contain qualifications or explanations favourable to the defendant, that bear upon the passages relied upon by the prosecution as an admission, and it is for the jury to decide whether the statement viewed as a whole constitutes an admission. To this extent the statement may be said to be evidence of the facts stated therein. If the jury finds that it is an admission they may rely upon it as proof of the facts admitted. If the defendant elects not to give evidence then in so far as the statement contains explanations or qualifications favourable to the defendant the jury, in deciding what, if any, weight to give to that part of the statement, should take into account that it was not made on oath and has not been tested by cross-examination.
 
 
 
When the Crown adduces evidence in the form of a statement by the defendant which is not relied on as an admission of the offence charged such a statement is evidence in the trial in that it is evidence that the defendant made the statement and of his reaction which is part of the general picture which the jury has to consider but it is not evidence of the facts stated.` 
 
Their Lordships therefore regret that they are unable to agree with what was said in 
 Cheng Chiu
 in the passage quoted by the Court of Appeal in the instant case.
 
 
 
In our view, the evidential status of exculpatory or self-serving statements in Singapore is equally clear. Such statements when given in accordance with s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code may be admitted as part of the prosecution`s evidence, but not as to the truth of the contents thereof. They are admissible on the ground, as the Privy Council has put it, that `common fairness requires that the entirety of the statement should be admitted so as to show the precise context in which the admission was made`. We were of the view that the law of England is the same as the law of Singapore in this respect. The terms of s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code do not suggest any more than that what the accused is being asked to disclose is the fact or facts on which he intends to rely in his defence in court. What he says in order to exculpate himself cannot be admissible as the truth because it is self-serving and also because it is not necessarily consistent with other facts that may be established by the prosecution in the course of the trial.
Accordingly, we were not prepared to accept, in a submission of no case to answer, the contention of counsel for the defence that the explanations given by the accused in his cautioned statement were true. Without those explanations (which are set out on pp 409-410), the evidence adduced by the prosecution at the end of its case showed that the accused had brought with him two knives for a meeting with the deceased, that he stabbed the deceased whilst they were having drinks or eating, that the accused was seen chasing the deceased after having stabbed him, and that the deceased died from a stab wound inflicted with considerable force. There was evidence that two or three of the deceased`s friends were present at the restaurant and that at least two of them had sat at table 12 opposite the accused and the deceased who were sitting side by side. Beyond that, there was no evidence that the deceased had started the fight by delivering a blow to the accused or that the deceased and his gang had advanced menacingly on the accused. There was evidence of a commotion, of shouting and noise of table and chair overturning. Shortly after the incident, an unidentified male Chinese went to see the deceased`s mother and told her of the stabbing. Fresh drops of blood and a motorcycle crash helmet were found on the void deck of the flat where the deceased had lived.
To our minds, there was nothing in the evidence adduced by the prosecution or elicited from the prosecution witnesses which had, at that stage of the proceedings, created a reasonable doubt that the accused had intended to cause such injury as was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. There was credible evidence that the accused had intended to stab the deceased in the neck and such stabbing was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Accordingly, we called for the defence.
The accused elected not to give evidence. He called two witnesses to testify on his behalf. The first was one Lim Beng Gee, a police officer who assisted in the investigation of the stabbing incident. He testified that at 12.40am on 9 April 1985, he arrived at Blk 23, Hougang Avenue. He found some fresh blood drops on the pavement of the block and followed the blood trails into the void deck. The trail ended at a provision stall which was then closed. There was also a black and white motorcycle crash helmet near the staff. He was able to establish from the deceased`s relatives that the helmet had been used by a youth in the neighbourhood. Further investigations drew a blank as to the identity of this youth. The rest of the testimony of Lim Beng Gee threw no further light whatever on the incident.
The second witness called for the defence was the accused`s father. He testified that the accused and the deceased were very good friends and about a month before the incident, they both had a meal in his house. He also testified that the accused was a person of good temper with a good nature and was an obedient son. He knew of no reason why the accused would want to kill the deceased. He had never seen them quarrel. His testimony also did not throw any light on the incident.
It was further submitted that if this special exception to s 300 did not apply, then special exception 4 would apply as there was a sudden fight in which the accused had stabbed the deceased without premeditation and without having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Finally, it was submitted that the accused had been deprived of the power of self-control by grave and sudden provocation in stabbing the deceased.
The deputy public prosecutor submitted that none of the exceptions relied upon by the accused applied to him and that the accused had not discharged the burden of circumstances bringing him within any of the statutory exceptions in accordance with s 107 of the Evidence Act. As for the right of private defence, it was submitted that even if the deceased had threatened to assault the accused, the latter had time to have recourse to the public authorities and that in any case the accused had inflicted more harm than was necessary for the purpose of defence. As for special exception 2 to s 300, it was submitted that the accused had not exercised his right of private defence in good faith as he had brought two knives to the meeting with the intention of using them and he did use them. In respect of special exception 4, that the fight was not a sudden fight and that the accused had taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel manner by using a knife and stabbing the deceased with it. Finally, it was submitted that there was no provocation or that the provocation was not grave or sudden.
It was entirely possible that the account of the incident given in the cautioned statement was accurate as to the events described therein. But it was also possible that it was not a complete account of what had happened. On the evidence adduced by the prosecution, the accused was seen chasing the deceased with a knife in his right hand. The accused was also seen to have made a motion of stabbing the deceased. This event was not recounted in the cautioned statement. Giving such weight as we could to the cautioned statement in the light of the evidence adduced by the prosecution, we were unable to conclude that the accused had discharged, on a balance of probabilities, the burden of proving any circumstances which brought him within the general exception of right of private defence under s 96 of the Penal Code or any of the special exceptions 2, 4 and 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code.
Accordingly, we convicted the accused on the charge of murder.

This appeal is from a judgment of the Court of Appeal of Singapore (Wee Chong Jin CJ, Lai Kew Chai and Chua JJ) dated 19 August 1986 reported at 
 
 
[1987] 1 MLJ 176
  dismissing an appeal from a judgment of LP Thean J which dismissed the appellant`s claim against the respondent for damages for slander. That claim arose out of certain events which took place in 1981. At 6.30pm on 21 September 1981 the Singapore Democratic Party (the SDP), a registered political party in Singapore held its inauguration meeting at the Singapore Conference Hall auditorium. At that time the appellant was the secretary-general of the Workers` Party (the WP) which was another registered political party in Singapore. The secretary-general of the SDP, Chiam See Tong, accorded to the appellant, in the words of Thean J, the `unusually high honour` of being invited to this ceremony as the first main speaker and the only guest speaker, taking precedence over the speeches of all the leaders of the SDP. Such an honour was a clear indication that at the material time the relations between these two political parties were friendly.
On receipt of the invitation, the appellant had informed the secretary-general of the SDP that he would have to leave after his speech due to a dinner engagement on the same evening as the inauguration. This was acceptable to the SDP. From the reports of the meeting and according to the evidence of representatives of the press, who were present, the appellant was the most popular man that evening, receiving rounds of applause even before he spoke, as well as during his speech After his speech he left the meeting, as did a large proportion of the 300-strong audience.
The respondent, who was the defendant in the action, was at all material times Minister for Defence and Second Minister for Health in the government of Singapore and organizing secretary of the People`s Action Party, the party in government in Singapore. On 26 October 1981, the respondent held a press conference at Blair Plain at which representatives of the media were present. At that conference he said, inter alia: 
 
SDP had their inaugural earlier this month. Mr Jeyaretnam attended. After Mr Jeyaretnam had spoken, he left the hall, and when he left the hall, 200 participants left with him. I believe the exodus was engineered. I don`t think it was a spontaneous exodus. If it were, it did not speak well for the SDP. It shows that the crowd, the limited crowd still looks towards Mr jeyaretnam, for the time being, as a leader of the opposition. But I am inclined to believe that the exodus was contrived by the leader of the Workers` Party to show who is boss at this stage. And surely Mr Chiam cannot take that trick lightly.
 
 
 
On 23 November 1981 the appellant issued his writ claiming damages for slander and in his statement of claim delivered on 10 February 1982 he alleged that the words set out above were both defamatory and calculated to injure him in his office as leader of a political party. In his defence the respondent denied that the words which he had used were defamatory of the appellant and he denied that they were calculated to disparage the appellant in his office as the secretary-general of the WP. He raised two further defences, namely, that the words were fair comment spoken without malice upon a matter of public interest, namely, the conduct of leaders of the opposition parties including the appellant, and further or alternatively that the occasion on which the words were uttered was one of qualified privilege.
 The decision of the trial judge
The judge held that the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning were defamatory of the appellant. He said this: 
 
The crucial point in this issue is this: did the words complained of in their natural and ordinary meaning impute to the plaintiff any dishonourable or discreditable conduct or motives or lack of integrity on his part? If they did, then inescapably they were defamatory of the plaintiff. It seems to me that in considering this issue, one must bear in mind the following salient facts. First, the event to which the words made reference was the inauguration of the SDP - undoubtedly a great and important event to the SDP. Secondly, at the inauguration the plaintiff in his position as the secretary-general of the WP was accorded an unusually high honour in being invited to speak. He was the only guest speaker and the first main speaker taking precedence over the speeches of all the leaders of the SDP. From the reports and according to representatives of the press media, who were present at the meeting, the plaintiff was the most popular man that evening, receiving rounds and rounds of applause even before he spoke and during his speech. Lastly, though much has been sought to be made out by the defendant and his counsel that the WP and SDP were rival political parties, which was not borne out by evidence, at the material time at any rate the relations between the two political parties were friendly. In those circumstances the words, in my opinion, were capable of a defamatory meaning and were defamatory of the plaintiff. The sting lay in the suggestion or implication that the plaintiff took advantage of a gesture of goodwill from the SDP - a party with which the WP had good relations - on the occasion of the SDP`s inauguration for a purely selfish and self-serving purpose and engineered or contrived an exodus of a large section of the audience at the inauguration so as to project himself as the `boss` and leader of the opposition panics to the party in power. The words imputed to the plaintiff dishonourable or discreditable conduct or motive or a lack of integrity and such an imputation in my opinion was defamatory of the plaintiff.
 
 
 
The judge rejected the defence of qualified privilege and neither in the Court of Appeal nor before their Lordships was this decision or his decision that the words were defamatory, in the sense he particularized, criticized.
However the action was dismissed because the judge held: 
 
 
(1) That the words although defamatory of the appellant were not calculated to disparage him in his office as the secretary-general of the WP. He said, `They did not impute any want of integrity or corrupt or dishonest conduct or any other misconduct in the discharge of that office`. Accordingly the appellant was unable to take advantage of s 5 of the Defamation Act 1960 (Cap 32) and claim damages for the slander, without the necessity of proving special damage. The appellant did not assert, let alone prove, any special damage. 
 
(2) The respondent had established his defence of fair comment.
  
 
 
The Court of Appeal in dismissing the appellant`s appeal, confirmed the judgment on both the grounds set out above.
When Lord Hooson QC, on behalf of the appellant, opened this appeal, their Lordships invited him first to, address them on the second ground of the judge`s decision, and to develop his submissions as to why the judge was in error in the conclusions which he had reached. Their Lordships adopted this course because it appeared to them that the fair comment defence, in the circumstances of this case, presented the appellant with his greatest difficulties. If the judge had reached a correct decision in allowing this defence, which on its own would be fatal to the success of the appeal, then the more difficult questions raised by s 5 of the Defamation Act would not arise.
Lord Hooson did not criticize the judge in his statement of the four elements which the respondent had to establish, in order to succeed in his defence of fair comment. These he stated as follows: 
 
 
(i) the words complained of are comment, although they may consist or include inferences of fact; 
 
(ii) the comment is on a matter of public interest; 
 
(iii) the comment is based on facts; and 
 
(iv) the comment is one which a fair-minded person can honestly make on the facts proved.
  
 
 
As regards (ii) above, it was not contested that the comment, if it was a comment and not an assertion of fact, was on a matter of public interest. Their Lordships accordingly deal seriatim with elements (i), (iii) and (iv).
Lord Hooson did not dissent from the following statement to be found in para 697 of the current (8th Ed) of 
 Gatley on Libel and Slander 
: 
 
Comment is a statement of opinion on facts. It is comment to say that a certain act which a man has done is disgraceful or dishonourable; it is an allegation of fact to say he did the act so criticized ... while a comment is usually a statement of opinion as to merits or demerits of conduct, an inference of fact may also be a comment. There are, in the cases, no clear definitions of what is comment. If a statement appears to be one of opinion or conclusion, it is capable of being comment.
 
 
 
Of course, if a statement is capable of being comment, whether or not it is a comment or a statement of fact, must be a matter for the jury properly directed or, in this case where trial was by judge alone, for the judge, properly directing himself, to decide.
At the press conference, after stating that the appellant had spoken at the inaugural, the respondent said that the appellant `left the hall, and when he left the hall 200 participants left with him`. These were clearly statements of fact. He then said: 
 
I 
 believe
 the exodus was engineered. I 
 don`t think
 it was a spontaneous exodus. If it was, it did not speak well for the SDP. It shows that the crowd, the limited crowd still looks toward Mr Jeyaretnam, for the time being as a leader of the opposition. 
 But I am inclined to believe
 that the exodus was contrived by the leader of the Workers` Party to show who is boss at this stage. And surely Mr Chiam cannot take that trick lightly. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In their Lordships` judgment it was clearly open to the judge to take the view that the observations following the statement of facts were expressions of opinion or conclusions or inferences drawn from those facts and therefore capable of being comment. This being so, he was fully entitled to decide that these observations were `a comment and not a bare or naked statement of facts. It contained the defendant`s belief for his conclusions based on or drawn from certain facts`.
It is of course well established that a writer may not suggest or invent facts and then comment upon them, on the assumption that they are true. If the facts upon which the comment purports to be made do not exist, the defence of fair comment must fail. The commentator must get his basic facts right. 
 
The basic facts are those which go the pith and substance of the matter: see 
 Cunningham-Howie v Dimbleby
 
[1951] 1 KB 360
, 364. They are the facts on which the comments are based or from which the inferences are drawn - as distinct from the comments or inferences themselves. The commentator need not set out in his original article all the basic facts: see 
 Kemsley v Foot
 
[1952] AC 345
; but he must get them right and be ready to prove them to be true;
 
 
 
(per Lord Denning MR in 
 London Artists Ltd v Littler
 
[1969] 2 QB 375
.)
 
 
 
At the outset of this judgment, certain basic and agreed facts have been set out, such as the date and place of the inauguration, the invitation to the appellant, the honour conferred upon him, that there were 300 participants at the inauguration, his popularity on the occasion and the applause which he received and that immediately after his speech he left the hall. It is also common ground that the appellant`s departure was wholly unexplained. In his judgment, the trial judge held that the respondent had proved the following facts: 
 
At that time [ie when he left the hall] or immediately thereafter there was a large section of the audience - some 200 people - who also left the meeting. At the end of the meeting there were about 100 people remaining in the hall.
 
 
 
The respondent was not present at the meeting and therefore, in order to establish the truth of the facts upon which he relied, he was obliged to call evidence from persons who were present. The above findings of the judge were clearly based upon his acceptance of the evidence of Mr Leslie Fong Yim Leong, a journalist who attended the inaugural meeting and was the author of a report in the 
 Straits Times 
of that meeting. He said: 
 
Almost immediately after JBJ left the hall people from all parts of the hail stood up and made their way out. I heard rustles of people getting up and the people leaving took no extra care to do so quietly. My estimate is that about 150 people left. There was a steady trickle of people leaving the hall. I looked around again frequently. Twenty minutes after he left I estimated that there were about 100-120 people left inside the hall.
 
 
 
Lord Hooson made basically two criticisms of the judge`s finding quoted above: 
 
 
(1) The judge had inflated Mr Leslie Fong`s estimate of `about 150 people` to `some 200 people`, the number which the respondent had referred to at the press conference. 
 
(2) Mr Leslie Fong`s evidence was that `almost immediately after JBJ left` and not `at that time or immediately thereafter`, as stated in his judgment. Indeed Lord Hooson repeated the point (unsuccessfully made in the Court of Appeal, and described by that court as a pedantic quibble), that the words used by the respondent at the press conference were `left with him`.
  
 
 
While Lord Hooson`s complaints are strictly justified, in their Lordships` view the pith or substance of the matter was that after the appellant had spoken he left the hall, without any explanation, being given for his departure, and that he was then followed by a very substantial number of the audience. It matters not whether he was followed immediately or almost immediately after he left, or that the proportion of the audience which immediately or almost immediately followed him was a half or two-thirds of the total number of the participants. By virtue of s 9 of the Defamation Act 1960: 
 
In an action for ... slander in respect of words consisting partly of allegations of fact and partly of expression of opinion, a defence of fair comment shall not fail by reason only that the truth of every allegation of fact is not proved if the expression of opinion is fair comment having regard to such of the facts alleged or referred to in the words complained of as are proved.
 
 
 
In their Lordships` opinion no valid complaint can be made of the judgment under this heading.
The trial judge quoted very aptly from the direction given to the jury by Diplock J (as he then was) in 
 Silkin v Beaverbrook Newspapers Ltd 
 
[1958] 1 WLR 743
 at p 749: 
 
The matter which you have to decide and I emphasize this again, because it is so important, is not whether you, any of you, agree with that comment. You may all of you disagree with it, feel that it is comment that is not correct. But that is not the test. I will remind you of the test once more. Could a fair-minded man, holding a strong view, holding perhaps an obstinate view, holding perhaps a prejudiced view - could a fair-minded man have been capable of writing this? That is a totally different question from the question: Do you agree with what he said?
 
 
 
The judge decided that a fair-minded person, in the sense used by Diplock J, could have honestly arrived at the conclusion which the respondent reached. He said: 
 
It is significant that the defendant in arriving at this conclusion did consider the alternative conclusion, ie that the exodus from the SDP`s inauguration was spontaneous but in such a case it did not reflect too well on the SDP, and he ruled out this alternative. Now the conclusion which the defendant arrived at may not be impartial; obviously it cannot be so. That conclusion may be biased, may be prejudiced, may be grossly exaggerated or may even be wrong; it may be a conclusion I cannot and do not agree. But it is one which falls within the allowed limit of fair comment: it is a conclusion which a fair-minded person on the basis of those facts could have honestly arrived at.
 
 
 
The judge had properly directed himself on the law and there was clearly material which could justify his decision. In those circumstances it would be quite wrong for a court of appeal to interfere.
At the trial the appellant sought to establish that in uttering the words complained of, the respondent was actuated by malice, that is by ill-will, spite or improper motive. The trial judge had the advantage of hearing a prolonged cross-examination of the respondent. He observed: 
 
Nothing has emerged therefrom or been elicited from him which cast any doubt or suspicion on the bona fides of his belief that the conclusion he came to was true. I find no ground for disbelieving him that the belief he entertained was a genuine and honest one.
 
 
 
Once again it is apparent from the judgment that the judge properly directed himself as to the legal principles which he had to apply, and there was material, namely, his assessment of the credibility of the respondent, which could justify his reaching the decision which he made. Although in the appellant`s written case the judge`s rejection of the allegation of malice was attacked, Lord Hooson, with characteristic realism, did not embark upon arguing what would have been hopeless point.
For the reasons set out above their Lordships are satisfied that the judge was entitled to find that the defence of fair comment had been fully established by the respondent. This is, as stated above, a complete defence to the appellant`s claim for damages for slander and this conclusion is sufficient to dispose of this appeal.
Their Lordships had the benefit of submissions made by Lord Hooson QC and Lord Alexander QC of Weedon, on behalf of the respondent, as to whether, if the defence of fair comment had failed, the judge and the Court of Appeal were in error in deciding that the appellant could not take advantage of s 5 of the Defamation Act 1960 and recover general damages for the slander, notwithstanding the absence of special damage. However, in the light of their conclusion that the judge was justified in accepting the defence of fair comment, their Lordships see no virtue, in the special and unusual circumstances of this case, in burdening this judgment with what, for all practical purposes, would be a lengthy disquisition which would be of little but academic interest.
Accordingly their Lordships dismiss this appeal with costs.

(delivering the grounds of decision of the court): This appeal from the order of Wahab Ghows J dated 18 September 1986 arises from an application by the appellants, Standard Chartered Bank (Bank), seeking to discharge a garnishee order nisi dated 3 April 1986, obtained by the respondents, Central Provident Fund Board (the Board), to enforce four orders of the Magistrates` Courts for payment of arrears of contributions by Kai Chin (Pte) Ltd (Kaichin). At the conclusion of the hearing, we allowed the appeal and set aside the order of Wahab Ghows J, indicating that we would give our reasons at a later date. This we now do.
Kaichin, a company required under the Central Provident Fund Act (Cap 36) (the Act) to pay to the Board contributions for its employees, were in arrears of such contributions. The Board brought three summonses in the Magistrates` Courts - CPFB 00079185, CPFB 0 1 8198/85, and CPFB 04339/85 - against Kaichin under s 34 (now s 38) of the Act. These three summonses came before the Magistrates` Courts on 10 May 1985, 6 September 1985 and 20 December 1985 respectively. In all three summonses, Kaichin pleaded guilty to the charges and were convicted and fined. The Magistrates` Courts, before which Kaichin were convicted, further ordered that Kaichin pay the arrears of the contributions. It is relevant to note that one of these orders allowed the arrears to be paid in six instalments with effect from 3 January 1986. The sums due under these three orders amounted to $127,279.01. The sums due not being paid, the Board applied under s 224 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) and obtained three warrants to levy, which, in substance, authorized the Registrar, Subordinate Courts, to distrain by seizure and if necessary, sale of any property belonging to Kaichin to satisfy the sums due.
Kaichin were, at the material time, doing some work for Telecommunication Authority of Singapore (Telecoms) under certain contracts in respect of which it appeared that payments of a balance sum of $22,435.21 was due to Kaichin as at 6 September 1985 and a further sum of $147,251.40 was due to Kaichin on 2 April 1986.
At the material time, Kaichin was a customer of the Bank and had overdrawn on an overdraft facility granted by the Bank. On 6 September 1985, Kaichin gave an `Irrevocable Letter of Authority` to Telecoms. The letter, which was acknowledged by Telecoms on 12 September 1985, was in the following terms: 
 
Irrevocable Letter of Authority
 
 
 
We hereby authorize you to pay to our account with Standard Chartered Bank, Crosby House, 71 Robinson Road #01-01 Singapore 0106, the sum of S$22,435.21 being the balance of retention from Tender Number AMB/T/84/067 and a further sum of S$181,034.90 due and payable from your existing P/O No 44811 - Tender No AME/T/85/027 with us.
 
 
 
This letter of authorization is irrevocable. The aforesaid amounts are payable to our account with Standard Chartered Bank (Account No 0203039610 without any responsibility on your part for negligence or otherwise.
Kindly acknowledge receipt by signing the copy of this letter and returning it to Standard Chartered Bank accordingly.
On 17 January 1986, by Originating Summons No 75 of 1986, the Board instituted garnishee proceedings in the High Court to enforce the three orders of the Magistrates` Courts for the payment of the sum of $127,279.01 by garnishing the payments due to Kaichin in the hands of Telecoms. On the same day (17 January 1986), the court made a garnishee order nisi to that effect.
On 21 February 1986 (the day fixed for further consideration of the order nisi) upon the application of the Board who also mentioned on behalf of Telecoms, the garnishee order was, by consent, made absolute for the sum of $29,240.68. This sum of $29,240.68 was paid by Telecoms to the Board on 14 April 1986.
On 7 March 1986, the Board brought a fourth summons, CPFB 00318/86, in the Magistrate`s Court against Kaichin for arrears of contributions amounting to $35,996.80. Kaichin pleaded guilty to the charge and were convicted and fined. The Magistrate`s Court further ordered that Kaichin pay the arrears of contributions within six weeks of the order. On 21 March 1986, the arrears not being paid, the Board applied under s 224 of the Criminal Procedure Code and obtained the issue of a warrant to levy. The sums due to the Board now totalled $134,205.13.
On 3 April 1986, by Originating Summons No 392 of 1986, the Board instituted garnishee proceedings in the High Court to enforce the four orders of the Magistrates` Courts and the garnishee order absolute dated 21 February 1986 in Originating Summons No 75 of 1986 by garnishing the payments due to Kaichin in the hands of Telecoms. On the same day, the court granted a garnishee order nisi in the following terms: 
 
 
(1) All debts due or accruing due from Telecommunication Authority of Singapore, the abovementioned garnishee, to the abovementioned judgment debtor be attached to answer four orders in the Subordinate Courts and an order of court in the High Court recovered against the said judgment debtor be attached to answer four orders in the Subordinate Courts and an order of court in the High Court recovered against the said judgment debtor by the abovenamed judgment creditor on 10 May 1985, 6 September 1985, 20 December 1985, 7 March 1986 and 21 February 1986 respectively in Summons Case Nos 00079/85, 01898/85, 04339/85 and 00318/86; and Originating Summons No 75 of 1986 respectively ordering payment by the said judgment debtor to the abovenamed judgment creditor of the total sum of $207,870.59 together with the costs of the garnishee proceedings on which orders the sum of $134,205.13 remains due and unpaid.
  
 
 
On 3 July 1986, a petition for the winding up of Kaichin was presented by a creditor of Kaichin, Bank of America Trust and Savings Association, which petition was scheduled to be heard on 24 October 1986.
On 22 July 1986, the Bank, an interested third party by reason of the alleged assignment effected by the `Irrevocable Letter of Authority` referred to earlier, took out an application under O 49 r 6 for, inter alia, the following orders: 
 
 
(1) Standard Chartered Bank be directed to add or join as a party to the proceedings herein; 
 
(2) garnishee order absolute dated 21 February 1986 obtained under Originating Summons No 75 of 1986 and the garnishee order to show cause under the Originating Summons No 397 of 1986 herein be discharged; 
 
(3) Telecommunication Authority of Singapore be directed to pay to Standard Chartered Bank the assigned sums of $203,470.11 or such sums found due and payable.
  
 
 
A similar application was taken out by the Bank in Originating Summons No 75 of 1986, which application, we were told, was adjourned sine die pending the outcome of this appeal.
On 21 August 1986, the application was heard by the assistant registrar. At the hearing, the Bank relied on an issue, which, if determined in favour of the Bank, would be sufficient to dispose of the matter, namely, that the four orders of the Magistrates` Courts for payment of arrears did not constitute `judgment(s) or order(s) for payment` within the meaning of O 49 r 1(1) of the Rules of Supreme Court 1970 (the Rules). The argument was accepted by the assistant registrar who ordered that the garnishee order nisi dated 3 April 1986 be discharged on the ground that `there is no `judgment or order for payment` within O 49 r 1.`
The Board appealed to the judge-in-chambers. The appeal came before Wahab Ghows J on 18 September 1986. After hearing arguments, he made the following order: 
 
Proceedings stayed pending the making of a winding-up order against the judgment debtor with liberty to apply. To restore the status quo the appeal is allowed. Costs in the cause.
 
 
 
Upon a request for further argument by the Bank, the learned judge heard further arguments on 2 October 1986 and clarified his order as follows: 
 
The order of court should read: `The appeal be allowed and the order nisi herein dated 3 April 1986 be restored pending the making of a winding-up order against the company.`
 
 
 
The learned judge gave no reason for his decision, but it is apparent that the learned judge made no adjudication on whether the order nisi dated 3 April 1986 should be discharged on the ground which found favour with the assistant registrar. The judge was concerned only that the `status quo` be preserved pending the making of the winding-up order against Kaichin which order was subsequently made on the hearing of the winding-up petition on 24 October 1986. With respect to the learned judge, the presentation of the petition for winding up did not preclude him from adjudicating on the issue relied upon by the Bank, namely, whether the Board was entitled to institute garnishee proceedings in respect of the four orders of the Magistrates` Courts. It is true that a judgment creditor who has not completed the enforcement of his judgment debt before a petition for winding up of the company is presented may be forced to prove in the liquidation as an unsecured creditor for his money (see s 334 of the Companies Act (Cap 50)), but this does not mean that the court may not determine whether the mode of enforcement employed by the judgment creditor is one which is, in the first instance, available to him.
The procedure for garnishee proceedings in the Supreme Court is governed by O 49 of the Rules. Rule 1(1) of that Order provides: 
 
 
1(1) Where a person (in this Order referred to as the judgment creditor) has obtained a judgment or order for the payment by some other person (in this Order referred to as the judgment debtor) of money, not being a judgment or order for the payment of money into court, and any other person within the jurisdiction (in this Order referred to as the garnishee) is indebted to the judgment debtor the court may, subject to the provisions of this Order and of any written law, order the garnishee to pay the judgment creditor the amount of any debt due or accruing due to the judgment debtor from the garnishee, or so much thereof as is sufficient to satisfy that judgment or order and the costs of the garnishee proceedings.
  
 
 
By O 1 r 2(2) of the Rules, this Order, like the other Orders in the Rules, does not apply to criminal proceedings, which are governed by the Criminal Procedure Code. Order 1 r 2(2) provides: 
 
 
(2) These Rules shall not have effect in relation to proceedings of the kinds specified in the first column of the following Table (being proceedings in respect of which rules may be made under the written law specified in the second column of that Table):

6. Criminal Proceedings Criminal Procedure Code
The essential question for decision is whether the four orders of the Magistrates` Courts for payment of arrears of contributions under s 37 (now s 41) of the Act are `judgment(s) or order(s) for payment of money` within the meaning of O 49 r 1(1).
Section 37(1) of the Act provides: 
 
37(1) Any person convicted of an offence under this Act for which no penalty is provided shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $2,500 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding $10,000 and the court before which the conviction is had may in addition to the fine order him to pay the amount of any contributions together with any interest due thereon certified by an officer appointed by the Board in that behalf to be due from that person at the date of the conviction and the amount may be recovered according to the law for the time being in force for the recovery of fines.
 
 
 
The procedure for the recovery of fines is governed by s 224 of the Criminal Procedure Code: 
 
224 Where any fine is imposed under the authority of any law for the time being in force then, in the absence of any express provision relating to the fine in such law, the following provisions shall apply: 
(a) ... 
(b) in every case of an offence in which the offender is sentenced to pay a fine the court passing the sentence may, at any time before the fine has been paid in full in its discretion, do all or any of the following things: 
... 
(iii) issue a warrant for the levy of the amount by distress and sale of any property belonging to the offender.
 
 
 
Counsel for the Board advanced two separate, though related, propositions in support of his contention that this court should treat the order of the Magistrates` Court under s 37(1) as equivalent to a `judgment or order for payment of money` within O 49 r 1(1). It is convenient to deal with these two propositions separately.
The first proposition was that although the first part of s 37(1), ie the imposition of a fine, is clearly penal, the second is in nature civil and provides a summary process for recovery. It was suggested that because the object of the Act, considered as a whole, is not penal but essentially civil, the magistrates` orders should be treated and enforceable as such. We could not accept the submission. The essential character of a judicial order is to be determined by reference to the nature of, and the procedure adopted for, the proceedings, that is to say, whether the proceedings are in the nature of civil or criminal proceedings. In the present case, the relevant orders were orders made by the Magistrates` Courts in the exercise of their criminal jurisdiction upon convictions for criminal offences under s 34. The orders were, in form, criminal and are in the category of fines and penalties imposed for criminal offences. Indeed, for the purposes of recovery, s 37 treats the orders as if they were fines. That the section gives a summary process for recovery of the amount due to the Board cannot, in our view, convert the character of the order - which is stamped with a criminal character - into a civil debt or order.
The second proposition advanced by counsel for the Board is that the words `may be recovered according to the law for the time being in force for the recovery of fines` does not provide an exclusive mode of recovery but an additional mode over and above the usual methods of enforcement available to a judgment creditor. He relied strongly on the word `may` which, he contended, implies that the method of recovery specified in the section is only permissive and does not preclude recourse to other modes of enforcement. In our opinion, the argument is unsound. By s 40 (now s 45) of the Act, `any sum due to the Fund may be sued for and recovered by the Board under the Government Proceedings Act as if it were a debt due to the Government.` The section contemplates ordinary civil action or proceeding by the Board to recover any sum due and to enforce any, judgment or order obtained therein; and points to a clear distinction drawn in the Act between civil and criminal procedure. In our view, this serves to emphasize and reinforce the essentially criminal character of the order made under s 37. To treat an order under s 37 as equivalent to a civil judgment or order for the purposes of O 49 would, in our view, render the express provision of s 40 redundant. Reading s 40 with s 37, one is irresistibly drawn to the conclusion that it is only upon an entry of a judgment or order in pursuance of a civil proceeding that the Board may be able to avail itself of the process of enforcement of a money judgment or order.
Some support for our view can be found in the judgment of the English Court of Appeal in 
 R v Marlow (Bucks) Justices, ex parte Schiller 
 [1957] 2 All ER 783 dealing with the construction of the words `enforceable as a civil debt` in para 4 of Sch 3, Magistrates` Courts Act 1952 s 14. In that case, the applicant pleaded guilty to an information laid against him under the National Insurance Act 1946 alleging that he had failed to pay an insurance contribution due from him. He was fined Â£4 and further ordered under reg 19 of the National Insurance (Contributions) Regulation 1948 to pay Â£38 arrears of national insurance contributions due from him. The applicant failed to comply with the order and the justices committed him to prison for three months for non-payment of the arrears of contributions. He applied for an order of certiorari to quash the committal order on the ground that inasmuch as the 38 pounds arrears of contribution was enforceable only as a civil debt, the order of committal was bad in law. The Court of Appeal dismissed the application, holding that once the recovery of the sum as a penalty was ordered, the sum could no longer be described as `enforceable as a civil debt`. Devlin J said (at p 784): 
 
We have been referred to several decisions on other Acts, but, in my opinion, the question turns entirely on the true construction of para 4. We are not here concerned with the essential character of the sum, but with the mode of its enforcement or recovery. The combined effect of s 54(1) and reg 19(5) is that the sum can be recovered either as a civil debt or as a penalty. But, once its recovery as a penalty has been ordered, I do not think that the sum can any longer be described as `enforceable as a civil debt` within the meaning of para 4.
 
 
 
And, in relation to an argument on ultra vires (which is irrelevant for our purposes), Devlin J observed, obiter (at pp 784-785): 
 
Since the Act itself provides ... for its recovery as a civil debt, it is difficult to see what can be meant by its recovery on prosecution except as a penalty ...
 
 
 
In our opinion, therefore, the four orders of the Magistrates` Courts, being orders of a criminal character and recoverable as though they are fines, were not `judgment(s) or order(s) or payment` for the purposes of O 49.
Our conclusion on this issue in favour of the Bank is sufficient to dispose of the appeal. There is, however, a further ground relied upon by counsel for the Bank on which, in our view, this appeal must also succeed. By s 46 read with s 54 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321), an order of the Magistrate`s Court in the exercise of its civil jurisdiction may only be enforced in the High Court upon an application of the person who has obtained the order and upon the Magistrates` Court forwarding the order to the High Court with a request for execution. In the present case, the Board made no such application and no request for execution in the High Court was issued. In our view, therefore, even on the assumption that the relevant orders were orders of the Magistrates` Courts in the exercise of their civil jurisdiction, no execution proceedings could have been instituted in the High Court. Counsel for the Board urged that this non-compliance was a mere irregularity capable of cure - presumably under O 2 of the Rules of the Supreme Court. But O 2 applies only to non-compliance with the requirements of the Rules of the Supreme Court, so that non-compliance with requirements prescribed by statute do not come within that Order. In the present case, the non-compliance with the statutory requirement, going as it does to the root of the enforcement proceedings issued in the High Court, constitutes, in our view, so fundamental a defect in procedure that it renders the entire proceedings in which it occurs, and any order made therein, a nullity.
For these reasons, we allowed the appeal and set aside the garnishee order nisi dated 3 April 1986. In the circumstances, we considered that the appropriate order for costs was that the Bank be entitled to half the costs of the appeal and the court below.

(delivering the judgment of the court):The appellants were charged and convicted in the High Court of rape of one Orranuch Nilprang (the complainant). The first appellant was charged with and convicted of one count of rape; the second appellant two counts of rape; the third appellant two counts of rape, and the fourth appellant one count of rape. The first appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 years and 15 strokes of cane; the second appellant to a term of imprisonment of 13 years and ten strokes of cane on each charge, the sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently; the third appellant to a term of imprisonment of 12 years and ten strokes of cane on each charge, the sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently, and the fourth appellant to a term of imprisonment of ten years and ten strokes of cane. All the appellants appeal against their convictions and sentences.
The complainant is a Thai national and entered Singapore illegally sometime in July 1985 and at the material time was a prostitute. She occupied a room on the fifth floor of an uncompleted block of flats, Blk 172, Yishun Ave 7 and carried on her business on the fourth floor, and her customers were mainly Thai construction workers. The appellants at the material time were members of the police force attached to the Paya Lebar Police Station and were crew members of a police task force patrol team; the first appellant was the leader of the team with the second appellant as his deputy.
On the night of 17 October 1985 the complainant after entertaining two Chinese clients in the room on the fourth floor returned to her room on the fifth floor. There she found her two friends, Thai male construction workers; one was drinking and the other was sleeping on her bed. She changed and went to lie down on the floor beside the bed listening to her tapes.
At about 2am, on 18 October 1985, the four appellants went to Blk 172, Yishun Ave 7 and conducted a search on the uncompleted block of flats. They saw light from a room on the fifth level and they went up there to investigate. The complainant was in that room and so were the two male Thai workers. When the complainant heard a knock on the door and sensing that it was a police raid she scaled a window and hid herself on the window ledge clinging to the metal scaffolding. One of the male Thai workers then opened the door and the appellants entered and conducted a search. They found the complainant and ordered her to return to the room which she did. On returning to the room her purse which contained $60 and 5,000 Indonesian rupiahs slipped out of her pocket and fell on the floor. The first appellant picked it up and put it in his pocket. He then recorded on an envelope particulars of the two male Thais who had with them their work permits. The first appellant then handcuffed the complainant and detained her. The complainant was taken down to the car park where the police car was. There, the appellants, after a discussion among themselves, took the complainant into the car. The first appellant drove the car with the second appellant seated next to him, and the third and fourth appellants were seated at the back with the complainant between them. Once inside the police car one of the appellants removed her handcuffs. The first appellant drove the police car along Yishun Ave 7 and turned into Yishun Ave 2 and from there to an unnamed track until they reached a vacant hut, On arrival there, the appellants and the complainant all alighted from the car. Subsequently, the appellants each took turn to have sexual intercourse with the complainant in the hut; the second and the third appellants each had sexual intercourse with her twice. Thereafter, the complainant was brought out from the hut and the first appellant handed her a piece of paper on which was written the second appellant`s name and telephone number. The first appellant asked the complainant to telephone `Ali` (referring to the second appellant) at 11am later that morning.
The complainant was then driven back to the construction site at Yishun Ave 7 where the appellants left her near the foot of Block 172. The complainant proceeded to the fourth level of Block 172 and saw her friend AO Pantusavan (AO), to whom she related that she had been raped by the four policemen. She was crying in front of AO; her hair was in a mess and she was smelling of spermatozoa. Later she returned to her room on the fifth level where she washed and cleaned herself and then went to bed. She woke up at about 1pm and went to the fourth level again, discussed the matter further with her friend AO and decided to lodge a police report. Accompanied by her friend AO, she lodged a police report at the Criminal Investigation Department. The four appellants in consequence were arrested and charged, and were tried jointly.
The case of the prosecution was that the complainant was arrested and handcuffed on the fifth level of Blk 172, taken down to the car and brought to the desolate vacant hut at about 2.30am and was then raped by each of the four appellants in turn. The evidence of the complainant was that the first appellant took her into the hut, forced her to take off her clothes, and out of fear she submitted to having sexual intercourse with him. She said she was frightened. Thereafter, also out of fear, she submitted to having sexual intercourse with each of the other appellants in turn; in like manner, that is, out of fear, she submitted to having sexual intercourse a second time with the second and third appellants respectively.
All the appellants raised the defence of consent. They admitted that the complainant was brought to the vacant hut and that they each had sexual intercourse with her; the second and third appellants admitted that they each had sexual intercourse with her twice. But they said that the complainant consented to the acts of sexual intercourse. The consent, according to the appellants, arose out of a bargain made between the complainant and the first appellant. The first appellant said that when the complainant was alone with him on the fifth floor of the block of flats, she fondled his private part and spoke to him in a mixture of broken Malay and Thai and pleaded with him to release her. When she was brought down to the car park she offered him sexual favours in exchange for her release. Though her hands were handcuffed behind, she made sexual gesture with her fingers at the back, and when they all got into the car his colleagues released her handcuffs. That offer though made to the first appellant was made in the presence of the other appellants. At that time the first appellant had not decided to take up the offer; but while he was driving the car to the police station he decided to accept the complainant`s offer and he thereupon made a `U` turn and drove the car to the hut. There, after he had sexual intercourse with her, he asked her on behalf of the other appellants and she agreed to have sexual intercourse with them also. The second, third and fourth appellants said that they did not force her and that she consented to having sexual intercourse with them respectively; she smiled and laughed with them.
The learned judge at the conclusion of the hearing found the appellants guilty of the offences with which they were respectively charged and convicted them accordingly; he sentenced each of them to the term of imprisonment and caning as we have described.
The arguments put forward on behalf of all the appellants in the forefront of the appeal were directed not against the reasoning and finding of the learned judge in his judgment but against the incidents that took place during the trial. They complained that the learned judge throughout the trial persistently interfered with the presentation of their defences and interrupted their counsel excessively. The interventions were on such scale both numerically and in length and hostility that the appellants were deprived of a fair and impartial trial. Mr Fernando, who argued this ground of appeal on behalf of all the appellants, grouped the interventions of the learned judge roughly into three categories: 
 
 
(i) excessive interruptions by the learned judge in the examination and cross-examination of witnesses by counsel with the consequence that counsel were unduly hampered in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses and in the examination of their own clients; 
 
(ii) unfair and improper cross-examination by the learned judge of the appellants in a hostile manner including disallowing them to give evidence in their own way; and 
 
(iii) making adverse comments or observations which strongly indicated that the learned judge had closed his mind and predetermined the guilt of the appellants prior to considering all the evidence before him.
  
 
 
We now consider these categories of interventions seriatim. In respect of the interruptions complained of Mr Fernando drew to our attention the specific instances where, he said, the learned judge interrupted counsel in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses and the examination of the appellants. We have examined the transcripts and the interruptions referred to and also the relevant parts of the transcript leading to the interruptions, and are compelled to say that the counsel who conducted the defences before the learned judge must share substantially the blame. A considerable number of the instances, which we have examined, arose out of counsel delving on minuscule points, points of dubious relevance or points which had been covered by the questions asked by other counsel preceding. The learned judge`s interruptions on these instances, we find, were wholly justified. However, we agree that the interruptions by the learned judge were numerous - more than we would normally expect - and there were some occasions in which he should have refrained from interrupting. On the other hand, it must be appreciated that this was a fairly long trial which occupied about 18 days. The four appellants were separately represented by four counsel and each of them cross-examined the witnesses in turn. The case for the prosecution occupied seven and a half days and after the defence was called the trial continued for another ten days. The examination-in-chief of the complainant took two days and she was then cross-examined by the four counsel in toto for three and a half days - some of the questions were wholly irrelevant and there were overlapping in the areas of cross-examination of the complainant and other witnesses. It is therefore understandable that there were some occasional outbursts of impatience by the learned judge, which, in our view, were attributable to the tedium of a long trial. It should also be noted that some of these occasions were not really interruptions; the learned judge was taking down notes of evidence and he was merely repeating what the witnesses had previously said. Counsel had on some occasions in spite of the interruptions insisted on pursuing their points and were allowed to do so. On the whole, though we do not agree with or condone some of the interruptions of the learned judge, we are unable to accept the contention that the interventions by the learned judge, though numerous, had hampered counsel in examining or cross-examining the witnesses and rendered it impossible for them to present fairly the case for the defence.
In respect of the second category of intervention, Mr Fernando also listed out numerous instances where the learned judge asked questions of the witnesses and, in particular, of the appellants. We have examined the transcripts and are of the opinion that in quite a number of occasions the learned judge was entitled to ask the questions which he asked. Some of the questions were asked with a view to seeking clarification and some were asked in order to follow up the questions previously asked by the prosecution or the defence. It is true that there were questions which, in our view, he should refrain from asking, but here again we do not think these questions alone are sufficient to warrant a condemnation of this trial as unfair or a mistrial.
We now turn to the last category of intervention. Here again Mr Fernando pointed to numerous observations or comments made by the learned judge to show that the learned judge had failed to keep an open mind. We have examined these passages of the transcript referred to and found that a fair number of these observations or comments are truly innocuous; but there are some which cause us some concern. It is necessary to examine these parts of the transcript in some detail and in this connection it is necessary to set out these extracts verbatim.
The following passages from the transcripts give the impression that the learned judge at the early stage of the trial had made certain findings or reached certain conclusions on the facts which had yet to be established. During the cross-examination of the complainant by counsel for the second appellant, the learned judge in directing to counsel that the point he cross-examined was immaterial made the following remarks (at p 237 of the record of appeal): 
 
I have done rape cases where the woman took the rapist`s penis into her vagina because she was afraid she was going to be killed or injured by the rapist. You see what I mean? So that does not mean a thing. She was in the case completely in the power of the four policemen. You see what I mean? Carry on.
 
 
 
Later, during the cross-examination of the complainant by counsel for the first appellant the following exchanges took place between him and counsel (at p 353 of the record): 
 
Q: Now when you returned to your flat, after your visit to the fourth floor, can you remember what time it was?
A: About 11pm, sir. 
Q: And uncle Onsee was drinking? 
A: He was lying down - uncle Onsee. 
Q: Not drinking? 
A: I saw the bottle still lying around. 
Q: Was he drinking or not? 
His Lordship: Why do you worry about this, Mr Fernando? She has corroborated everything she said before up to now. 
Mr Fernando: All right. 
His Lordship: You see, this is the fourth time hearing it! All the other three went through this already. 
Mr Fernando: Thank you. 
His Lordship: And the more you ask her, the more she confirms so. I am dead certain that what she has been telling me is the truth, you see, so far. 
Mr Fernando: I want to know whether ... 
His Lordship: I know ... I mean you are making me realize that she`s a witness of truth because she has said the same thing four times.
 
 
 
Again, at a slightly later stage, during the cross-examination of the complainant by counsel for the first appellant on the question why she did not produce the pass to prevent arrest, the following exchanges took place between the learned judge and counsel (at p 364 of the record): 
 
His Lordship: Her hands were handcuffed behind her back.
Mr Fernando: She was busy doing something and later she indicated sixth floor by showing her hand. 
His Lordship: She said she could not point back because her wrists were handcuffed behind her back. 
Mr Fernando: Please my Lord. If you are being arrested, if the police are there asking you for the passport, couldn`t you say the passport is here? 
His Lordship: I am telling you I don`t believe the story about her showing the sexual sign with her fingers with her hands handcuffed behind her back. 
Mr Fernando: Since your Lordship doesn`t even believe it was possible or not ... 
His Lordship: Carry on.
 
 
 
It should be noted that at this stage of the trial the prosecution had not closed the case and the defence had not been called. Therefore the remarks by the learned judge to the effect that the complainant was `completely in the power of the four policemen` and that he was certain that what she had been saying was the truth, and his expression of his disbelief of the story that the complainant showed sexual sign with her fingers while her hands were handcuffed behind her were premature and unwarranted.
When the defence was called and the appellants gave evidence, there were occasions when the learned judge again prematurely expressed his disbelief of the appellants, and the following instances seem to demonstrate the point: 
 
 
(i) At a certain stage of the examination-in-chief of the first appellant, where the learned judge interrupted, the following exchange took place between him and the first appellant (at pp 473 to 474 of the record):
  
 
 
His Lordship: I know. If your son or your colleague tell you something, must you ask everybody, `Is it truth?` This, I believe, is just an exaggeration.
A: That is the truth, my Lord. 
Q: I know. Everybody tells the truth in this court. Nobody tells me any lie. 
A: That is why I made a request to swear on the Koran. 
Q: That is the more reason for me to disbelieve you because a Muslim never uses the Koran that way. That is why we had never used the Koran in the court for this purpose. 
A: That is right, but I am telling the truth. 
Q: I know, you are trying to impress me, you see. That is why you came and said, `I want the Koran`, you see. I always find that the people who pretend to be very religious are the biggest crooks there are. 
(ii) At a later stage of the examination the learned judge said of the first appellant (at p 557 of the record):
 
 
 
His Lordship: You see, Mr Roseli, that time nothing had happened yet.
A: That`s right, my Lord. 
Q: And you took down their names but why couldn`t you have written down their names either in your pocket book or in your log book unless, of course, you had intended from the beginning to rape this woman? That is why, isn`t it? 
A: But the point is that I did not know there was a woman. 
(iii) The second appellant at the commencement of the examination-in-chief requested to swear by the Koran which was rejected by the learned judge and the following exchanges took place (at pp 723 to 724):
 
 
 
His Lordship: I say no. I am no fool here. You are making this empty gesture. It is just an empty gesture because you are not a God-fearing man. If you were God-fearing you wouldn`t have committed adultery as you did.
Mr Kumar: He is not married. 
His Lordship: But in the Muslim faith it is adultery. If you don`t understand the Muslim faith, Mr Kumar, shut up. 
Second Accused: I am telling the truth. 
His Lordship: If you were a God-fearing man you would not have committed adultery with a prostitute. This man would not have stolen money from her with you. You would not have brought disgrace to yourself and to your uniform by having sexual act with female suspect with or without her permission, with or without her consent, so don`t try and bluff me that you are God-fearing and you want to swear on the Koran. It does not impress me because I understand these things. In any case it is a sin to swear on the Koran. All right, carry on. 
(iv) At a later stage the learned judge reprimanded the second appellant as follows (at p 774 of the record):
 
 
 
His Lordship: You must tell me the truth. I am not impressed by your humbug here. How could you enter into your log sheet the particulars if you did not carry your log sheet?
A: We can write it down in our pocket book. 
(v) Subsequently, at a slightly later stage, the learned judge questioned the second appellant thus (at p 780 of the record):
 
 
 
His Lordship: So if you lied to avoid disciplinary actions, you would lie even more to avoid a charge of rape, isn`t it?
Mr Fernando: My Lord, it is unfair. 
His Lordship: No, I am asking you. 
Mr Fernando: He doesn`t know it was raping.
 
 
 
We turn to another aspect of the complaint. The defence of the appellants was that there was consent on the part of the complainant and her consent originated from a bargain or understanding reached with her. The learned judge, however, appeared to have rejected such bargain or understanding even before the close of the defence. This is evident from following occasions: 
 
 
(i) During the cross-examination of the second appellant by the deputy public prosecutor the following took place between the learned judge and the second appellant (at p 806 of the record):
  
 
 
A: My understanding is that, my Lord, the offer was made to all of us.
Q: At the very most you imagined that the offer was made to you? It was your imagination? 
His Lordship: The truth is he never had such an understanding. 
DPP: I am coming to that, my Lord. 
A: The offer was made to all of us. 
His Lordship: Yes, that`s what you said. We are suggesting the truth is, there was no such offer and you never had such an understanding? 
A: She did make the offer. 
(ii) During the re-examination of the third appellant by his counsel the following exchange took place between the learned judge and counsel (at p 1005 of the record):
 
 
 
His Lordship: There was no such understanding because if there was rape, then you whistle your turn next but if you are having sexual intercourse, you don`t whistle for the next man to come!
Mr Vellupillai: There is no fix rule. 
His Lordship: We are all adults. We`ve got to think what actually happened, you see? 
Mr Vellupillai: That is precisely the thing we are trying to do. 
His Lordship: The whistling shows that it is unlikely to be an amicable sort of thing, you know? Carry on. Unless of course, you happened to be a pimp. 
Mr Vellupillai: Unfortunately all four of them had a sort of understanding. 
His Lordship: Carry on.
 
 
 
Again, the learned judge appeared to have formed his view that the second appellant had the intention of raping the complainant even before the close of the defence. At a certain stage during the re-examination of the second appellant the following exchanges between the learned judge and counsel took place (at p 863 of the record): 
 
Mr Kumar: Of course, my Lord, these two particulars were taken on a piece of paper because it was a dark flat and it was also dark downstairs where the car was parked.
His Lordship: I know but the position is this. When did he form the intention of raping this woman. You see what I mean? 
Mr Fernando: What I think my learned friend is trying to say is even if they made honest entries up to the time of the arrest, even of the girl in the log sheet, it would have made no difference because he could obtain a fresh one, re-write the false particulars and destroy the original honest entries. 
His Lordship: True, true but the point is, it proves that they had the intention of raping this woman from the very beginning.
 
 
 
In view of the remarks or observations which we have examined, it is doubtful whether the learned judge had fairly evaluated the evidence of the complainant and the appellants. They point very strongly to the unhappy fact that the learned judge did not keep an open mind throughout the trial and examine and weigh carefully the evidence of the complainant and that of the appellants. These unsatisfactory features of the trial were further compounded by the following passage of his judgment: 
 
At the end of her [complainant`s] cross-examination I was convinced that Orranuch Nilprang was a witness of truth and that she had submitted to the four of you under duress as she was afraid that you would either hurt or kill her.
 
 
 
On this, the learned judge, with respect, was clearly in error. We wish to repeat what Lord Diplock said in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
  (at p 51): 
 
... Whoever has the function of deciding facts on the trial of a criminal offence should keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of recollection of any individual witness, whether called for the prosecution or the defence, until after all the evidence to be tendered in the case on behalf of either side has been heard and it is possible to assess to what extent (if any) that witness`s evidence has been confirmed, explained or contradicted by the evidence of other witnesses.
 
 
 
It is true that the learned judge said that at the end of the case he scrutinized again the evidence adduced by the prosecution and that of the appellants. However, he ought not to have come to any definite conclusion, which he appeared to have done, on the credibility of the complainant - and that was purely on her own evidence - and on other matters which we have discussed until he had heard all the evidence adduced by the prosecution and evidence adduced by the defence. Only then would he be in a position to assess or evaluate fairly the evidence before him and make findings of facts and finally arrive at a conclusion.
We now turn to the final question whether the convictions in the circumstances can stand. This is far from being a case of a couple of isolated imprudent remarks made injudiciously by a trial judge in unguarded moments in the course of a long trial - such incidents we can well appreciate and understand. The instant case unfortunately is much more than that. The passages of the transcript which we have reviewed and in which are found definite views and findings of the learned judge on material issues - some of them at an early stage of the trial - are far too compelling: they indicate starkly that the learned judge had predetermined these material issues adversely against the appellants long before they had fully presented their case. With great reluctance, we have reached the unavoidable conclusion that the convictions should not be allowed to stand. Accordingly, we allow the appeal and quash the convictions and the sentences. We have considered whether we should now order a new trial. In our judgment, having regard to the long lapse of time since the alleged offence and the fact that the appellants have by now served a term of imprisonment of over three years it would be unfair to subject them again to a long trial on the same charges. We therefore do not propose to make such an order.
In view of the conclusion we have reached, it has become unnecessary to consider and deal with the other grounds of appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
Tay Chuan Beng and Esah bte Ibrahim each pleaded guilty before me, the charge against each being one under s 304 of the Penal Code read with s 34 thereof. Esah bte lbrahim appeals against the sentence she was given.
The appellant, aged 49 years, was a vagrant and prostitute operating in the Queen Street/Johore Road area. Her co-accused, Tay Chuan Beng (Tay), was a regular customer of hers and they looked upon each other as boyfriend and girlfriend. The charge against the two of them read as follows: 
 
You, Tay Chuan Beng and Esah bte Ibrahim, are charged that on or about 11 March 1987 at about 3.20am at the park at the junction of Rochore Road and Queen Street, Singapore, and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of one Lai Weng Leong, and you have hereby committed an offence punishable under s 304 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 Facts of the offence
 
The facts as stated by the prosecution and by the defence in the two respective pleas of mitigation were unchallenged. The charge arose out of the death of one Lai Weng Leong (Lai), a mute who was 44 years old at the time of his death.
On 10 March 1987 at about 10.30pm, Lai, who the appellant recognized, approached her for sexual intercourse. She agreed and after the intercourse, the appellant asked for payment of $6. Lai searched his pockets but found no money. He then grabbed the appellant`s bag which contained her clothes and some money. Upon her resisting, Lai punched her on the face several times. This attracted a crowd and Lai stopped beating the appellant, whereupon she fled.
She then slept on the pavement in Queen Street. About three hours later, Tay arrived and woke her up. She told him of what had transpired. She asked Tay to go and look for Lai. He went off and found him lying on a bench near the junction of Queen Street and Rochore Road. He returned to her and asked her to accompany him and the two proceeded to where Lai was. En route, Tay picked up an iron pipe 80cm long and 2cm in diameter.
On reaching Lai, the appellant confirmed to Tay that he was the one who had beaten her up. Tay hit Lai four times on the head as he lay sleeping on the bench. The appellant participated in the attack by using her fists. Lai died as a result of a fractured skull caused by Tay. He also had a number of lacerations and bruises.
The appellant acknowledged to the police that she wanted Tay to take revenge on Lai on her behalf for Lai`s earlier treatment of her. She also admitted she knew that Tay was going to use the iron pipe to hit Lai.
 Appellant`s background
The appellant had a very unhappy background. She was married to someone who took her to Bangladesh where she was badly treated by her parents-in-law who virtually forced her to return to Singapore, leaving her children there.
Both the appellant and Tay had a history of mental illness. She had two spells as an in-patient at Woodbridge Hospital, one of seven weeks in 1971 and the other of six weeks in 1982. The psychiatrist`s report by Dr Lim Yun Chin states: 
 
Her schizophrenic illness which had its onset in 1971 had relentlessly progressed to a chronic defect state characterized by impairment in her mental faculty and judgment. Her social behaviour also deteriorated. Such was her mental condition at the time of the alleged offence.
 
 
 
However, her condition did not amount to unsoundness of mind as she was capable of knowing the nature and consequences of her act ... Her schizophrenic illness constituted an abnormality of the mind to the extent of impairing her mental responsibility for her actions.
 Sentence and reasons
In assessing sentence, I took into account her background and also the psychiatrist`s report that while her schizophrenic illness constituted an abnormality of mind that impaired her mental responsibility for her action, she was capable of knowing the nature and consequences of her act.
In addition, and more importantly, were these factors: 
 
 
(a) it was on her request, if not her instigation, that Tay located and attacked Lai with her joining in; 
 
(b) her desire was revenge for what Lai had done to her; 
 
(c) she knew that Tay had a dangerous weapon in the form of an iron pipe 80 cm long; 
 
(d) she was not an inactive witness but participated physically in the attack on Lai although only with her fists; and 
 
(e) the attack on Lai took place about three and a half hours after the cause for her grievance against Lai.
  
 
 
In my view, this lapse of time was sufficient for reason to resume its seat, particularly in the light of the psychiatrist`s report that she was capable of knowing the nature and consequences of her act.
Taking into account her background and the above factors, my view was that eight years` imprisonment was an appropriate sentence. I therefore sentenced her to eight years imprisonment to commence from 14 March 1987, the date of her arrest.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The Public Prosecutor appeals against the order of acquittal of the respondent, Mustari bin Suri, by the District Court.
The respondent was jointly tried with two co-accused Rafrin bin Osman and Hasan bin Akbar on four counts under s 457 read with s 34 of the Penal Code(Cap 224) of housebreaking and theft by night between 14 November 1984 and 15 November 1984, by entering successively into four adjoining warehouses at Godown 404, Pasir Panjang Warehousing Complex. All the four offences were allegedly committed the same night with the common intention of two other accomplices, Suri bin Kachong and Samudin bin Salleh, who had both pleaded guilty and were convicted and sentenced by other courts earlier.
At the conclusion of the joint trial the respondent and co-accused Rafrin were acquitted and discharged on all the four charges, while the co-accused Hassan was convicted on all counts.
The Public Prosecutor is appealing against the order of acquittal of the respondent in respect of three of the charges: DAC No 5733, 5734 and 5735 of 1987.
It was not in dispute that the four adjoining warehouses were broken into on the night of 14 November 1984 and that properties were stolen from them.
Suri bin Kachong and Samudin bin Salleh gave evidence for the prosecution incriminating the respondent and the other two accused. Their evidence was strenuously challenged by the defence. The trial judge found that these two witnesses were unworthy of credit and that their evidence was wholly unreliable.
The respondent was arrested on 21 November 1984 at 9pm. The first statement from the respondent was recorded on 22 November 1984 at 4.35pm by Inspector Harbans Singh. In this statement (exh P57) he denied that he was involved in the offence of housebreaking Godown 404 on 14 November 1984. He stated that between 7.30pm and 10pm he was with his wife painting their new flat at Jurong West Ave 1 until 10pm and that he was assisted by Rausi bin Ahmad and returned home to Pandan Gardens at 10.35pm and went to sleep until the next morning when he left for work at 6am as usual. The defence did not object to the admissibility of P57 and it was admitted under s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68).
After the respondent had given his statement P57, he was interrogated by a team of seven detectives from 5.35pm to 7pm the same day, 22 November 1984. At 7pm on 22 November 1984 the respondent was brought again before Inspector Harbans Singh as the respondent had by then purportedly admitted to the commission of the offences. However, Inspector Harbans Singh did not immediately record a cautioned statement but he instead brought the respondent to the scene of the crime and it was only at 10.40pm did he commence the recording of the second statement under s 120 of the Criminal Procedure Code. After a voir dire on this statement, the trial judge did not admit it on the ground that it was apparently already prerecorded by Inspector Harbans Singh before the interpreter was called in to interpret it to the respondent.
The prosecution next tendered four cautioned statements by the respondent. One was made on 23 November 1984 in respect of DAC 5670 and three statements made on 27 November 1984 in respect of DAC 5733, 5734 and 5735 respectively.
The first cautioned statement made at 8.30am on 23 November 1984 was not admitted after a voir dire, again, because the interpreter merely interpreted to the respondent the statement which had been prepared and completed by the investigating officer.
A separate voir dire was conducted in respect of the other three cautioned statements of the respondent relating to DAC 5733, 5734 and 5735. The trial judge decided these statements were admissible as evidence as he was satisfied that they were voluntarily given by the respondent. In each of these three cautioned statements (exhs P58, P59 and P60), the respondent merely stated: 
 
I admit to the offence and ask for leniency as I have cooperated with the police.
 
 
 
The trial judge, after another voir dire, also admitted the statement made by the co-accused Hasan bin Akbar under s 120 of the Criminal Procedure Code(exh P66). In his statement Hasan implicated the respondent as the initiator of the break-in plans and as the driver of the lorry used by all the accused in going to and away from Godown 404. The respondent, however, was not implicated in the actual break-ins and thefts.
The prosecution also called Rausi bin Ahmad (PW 27) who said that he was at home the whole night on 14 November 1984. He said he did help the respondent to paint the respondent`s new flat but the work was completed on 13 November 1984.
At the end of the prosecution case, counsel for the respondent submitted that the only evidence against the respondent was his three cautioned statements wherein he admitted to the offence, but that no weight should be attached to these confessions, since they were at variance with the respondent`s first statement P57. The trial judge called upon the respondent to enter upon his defence, In his grounds of decision the trial judge said that he took into consideration Hasan`s statement P66 implicating the respondent in deciding that a prima facie case had been proved against the respondent.
In his defence the respondent testified that on 14 November 1984 he finished work at 5.30pm. He then drove his lorry to Rausi bin Ahmad`s house at 6.30pm with his uncle and his wife. When he did not meet Rausi he drove to his new flat as he had an appointment to buy a water-heater from a salesman at 7pm. From his new flat he drove to his mother`s house at Pasir Panjang. At 11pm he, his wife and children left his mother`s house and returned to his mother-in-law`s flat and went to sleep till the next morning. As regards his statement P47 he said that he made a mistake when he mentioned that Rausi was with him on 14 November 1984 as he was then in fear. Rausi, however, did assist him on 13 November 1984 but could not recall whether Rausi assisted him on 14 November 1984. The respondent denied committing the offences.
The respondent did not call any other witness in his defence. Rafrin, the co-accused, elected not to give evidence in his defence and he did not call any witness.
Hasan, the other co-accused, was the only witness in his own defence. He said that since he never kept a diary and had no witnesses he could not give clear evidence to defend himself; but he denied committing all the four offences. He refused to say anything else despite advice from the court. He was not cross-examined.
The trial judge in his grounds of decision said: 
 
After hearing the submission of the defence counsel and the prosecuting officer I took stock of the evidence before me and all the surrounding circumstances of the case in deciding on the weight to be given to Mustari`s three cautioned statements (P58, P59 and P60) and Hasan`s statement under s 121(5) (P66).
 
 
 
I had no hesitation in convicting Hasan on all the four charges. He had not only admitted to the offences in his cautioned statements but he had also given a detailed confession particularizing his role in the break-in and theft in his statement admitted under s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Furthermore, after electing to give evidence, he merely stated that he denied committing all the four offences (p 270 of the notes of evidence).
In respect of Mustari, there was no evidence left against him in respect of the first charge (PIA) after his cautioned statement `B` was not admitted. He was therefore acquitted and discharged.
As for the remaining three charges in DAC 5733, 5734 and 5735 of 1984, Mustari`s cautioned statements, whereby he merely admitted to the offences and pleaded for leniency, were evidence. However, I considered that these bare confessions were given on 27 November 1984, consecutively at 8.50pm, 9.15pm and 9.35pm, after he was first arrested on 21 November 1984 at 9pm. They were given while the accused was in remand for the past six days. I also took into consideration the detailed statement given by the accused less than 24 hours after his arrest (P57 recorded on 22 November 1984 at 4.35pm) whereby he completely denied being involved in the offences. As there were clear contradictions in the statements given by the accused, less credence could be given to these statements. What was more, the accused in his testimony further denied committing the offences and generally maintained the stand he took in his statement P57. I did not hold the statement in P57 (that PW 27 was with him painting his flat on 14 November 1984) against the accused since he had probably mistaken the date for 11 November 1984 to 13 November 1984. This further reduced the evidentiary weight of the three cautioned statements.
In respect of the co-accused`s statement P66, I had constantly borne in mind that in a joint-trial, the evidence on each charge against each accused must be considered separately and distinctly from the evidence against the others. Section 30 of the Evidence Act did not turn Hasan`s confession in P66 into substantive evidence against the accused Mustari. Although I had taken it into consideration, its `evidentiary` value as against Mustari is very weak. Considering the reduced weight of Mustari`s cautioned statements and the weak `evidentiary` value of Hasan`s confession together with the absence of any other independent evidence which implicated Mustari, I decided that it would not be safe to convict him on the three remaining charges. I therefore ordered that the accused Mustari be acquitted and discharged on all the charges against him as the prosecution had not proved, beyond any reasonable doubt, his guilt.
The submission of the appellant is that the trial judge erred in law and in fact (a) in not acting on the confessions of the respondent after they were admitted at the conclusion of three voirs dire; (b) in not taking into account the confession of the co-accused Hasan bin Akbar against the respondent when it implicated the respondent in the commission of the offences.
The trial judge held that the evidential value of the respondent`s confessions was weak for the following reasons: 
 
 
(a) the three cautioned statements were bare confessions admitting to the offences and pleading for leniency made while the respondent was in remand for six days, whereas the respondent`s detailed statement P57 was made less than 24 hours after his arrest in which he completely denied being involved in the offences; 
 
(b) the respondent in his defence had denied committing the offences and generally took the stand he took in his statement P57; 
 
(c) he did not hold the statement of the respondent in P57, that Rausi was with him painting his new flat on 14 November 1984, against the respondent as the respondent had probably mistaken the date.
  
 
 
The trial judge then sought corroborative evidence to support the confessions. He held that Hasan`s confession P66 implicating the respondent was not substantive evidence against the respondent. Although he took it into consideration he held that its `evidentiary` value as against the respondent was very weak.
The trial judge then concluded: Considering the reduced weight of Mustari`s cautioned statements and the weak `evidentiary` value of Hasan`s confession together with the absence of any other independent evidence which implicated Mustari, I decided that it would not be safe to convict him on the three remaining charges.
In 
 Osman & Anor v PP 
 
 
 
[1967] 1 MLJ 137
  the Court of Criminal Appeal in Singapore adopted the view of the law applicable to retracted confessions clearly stated by the Malayan Union Court of Appeal in the case of 
 Yap Sow Keong v PP 
 
 
 
[1947] MLJ 90
  in these words, at p 91: 
 
In our view the law as to the admissibility of retracted confessions made in evidence is clear, and put shortly it is that an accused person can be convicted on his own confession, even when it is retracted, if the court is satisfied of its truth. We do not agree with those Indian decisions which lay down that before a person can be convicted on his retracted confession there must be corroborative evidence to support it.
 
 
 
The trial judge in this case did not find that the confession was untrue. He appeared to be under the impression, quite wrongly, that a clear confession was not sufficient and that there must be some corroborative evidence and that was why he dealt with the evidentiary value of the statement P66 of the co-accused Hasan which implicated the respondent.
The trial judge did not give any reasons why he considered the evidentiary value of Hasan`s statement in P66 implicating the respondent very weak. I can see no reason why he should have come to such a conclusion.
The respondent`s alibi was based entirely on his own evidence. It was not corroborated. He did not call his wife or uncle. There was no evidence why they could not have been called. The respondent`s statement P57 was not true as it was contradicted by Rausi. The trial judge in fact did not deal specifically on the respondent`s evidence of alibi. The respondent`s alibi should have been rejected by the trial judge.
With the clear confession of the respondent and the statement of Hasan in P66 implicating the respondent, there was ample evidence before the trial judge to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondent had committed the offences and he should have found the respondent guilty and convicted him.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant, Goh Chong Ying, was charged and tried, with one Foo See Sun, on the following two charges: 
 
 
(1) You, Goh Chong Ying (m/34 years), NRIC 0138000/A, Foo See Sun (m/35 years), NRIC 2007088/I, are charged that you, between 27 July 1984 and 30 November 1984, at #12-03 Blanco Court, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, cheated the Housing & Development Board, Singapore, into believing that Anson Piling (S) Pte Ltd had, up to 26 August 1984, supplied and installed 81,688.25 metre tonnes of reinforced concrete piles valued at $76,215.13 at Block 513 and Block 541 of Bukit Batok Neighbourhood 5 Contract 6 site when in actual fact the reinforced concrete piles supplied and installed at the said two blocks of flats were only 57,471.25 metre tonnes valued at $53,620.67 and in consequence, dishonestly induced the Housing & Development Board to pay Anson Piling (S) Pte Ltd an additional amount of affairs, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 420 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103). 
 
(2) You, Goh Chong Ying (m/34 years), NRIC 0138000/A, Foo See Sun (m/35 years), NRIC 2007088/I, are charged that you, between 17 August 1984, at the site office of Bukit Batok Neighbourhood 5 Contract 6, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, did corruptly give a gratification of a sum of $1,000 (Dollars: One Thousand only) to an agent, namely, Pannirselvam s/o Pomman, a Clerk-of-Works in the employ of the Housing & Development Board, Singapore, through Ng Jwee Seng, the Administration and Finance Manager of Anson Piling (S) Pte Ltd, as an inducement for showing favour to Anson Piling (S) Pte Ltd, to wit, colluding with you in cheating the Housing & Development Board by inflating the penetration lengths of the reinforced concrete piles installed at Block 513 and Block 541 of Bukit Batok Estate, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 104) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
  
 
 
The appellant was also charged and tried on another charge: 
 
You, Goh Chong Ying (m/34 years), NRIC 0138000/A, are charged that you, on or about 14 December 1984, at the 2nd Home Restaurant and Lounge, Textile Centre, Singapore, did corruptly offer a gratification of a sum of $25,000 (Dollars: Twenty-five Thousand only) to one Tan Yong Kwang as an inducement for not reporting you for having cheated the Housing & Development Board by submitting false inflated paylengths of the reinforced concrete piles installed at Block 513 and Block 541 of Bukit Batok Neighbourhood 5 Contract 6, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 5(b)(c) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 104).
 
 
 
The appellant was convicted on all the three charges. The other accused, Foo See Sun, was acquitted on both the charges. The public prosecutor has not appealed against the order of acquittal.
The appellant was sentenced to 18 months` imprisonment on the first charge and to 12 months` imprisonment on each of the remaining two charges. The sentences on the first two charges were ordered to run consecutively. The appellant now appeals against his convictions and sentences.
The prosecution case was this. Anson Piling (S) Pte Ltd (the company) in 1984 were piling contractors. The appellant was the managing director and Foo See Sun was a director of the company. In March 1984, the company obtained the HDB Term Contract No 5 (the contract) under which it was to supply and drive, at HDB housing sites, a total of three million metre tonnes of reinforced concrete piles at $0.933 per metre tonne.
After obtaining the contract the company engaged Wee Sum Engineering (Wee Sum) as their subcontractors to carry out the piling works at the HDB building sites covered by the contract. The company supplied the reinforced concrete piles whilst Wee Sum provided the piling machines and the necessary labour to drive the piles.
The established procedure was for progress payments to be made by the HDB to its piling contractors on the basis of `paylengths` or the penetration lengths of the piles driven to the ground as calculated by the HDB clerk-of-works at the site. The penetration lengths of the piles were recorded daily by the HDB clerk-of-works on set papers and were then transferred to the piling records maintained by the clerk-of-works for the purpose of monthly progress payments. His duties included supervising the piling to ensure correct lengths of piles that were driven in and maintaining accurate records of pile penetration lengths. The HDB supervising engineer would verify the contractor`s claims of the piling works done according to the piling records maintained by the HDB clerk-of-works. These records would ultimately be sent to the HDB contracts officer for processing payments to its piling contractor.
The company was first engaged in piling works at HDB building sites under the Bukit Batok Neighbourhood 5 Contract 2 (N5C2).
Pannirselvam s/o Pomman (Pannir) was posted as the HDB clerk-of-works at N5C2 in early July 1984, Foo See Sun approached Pannir and told him that there was a lot of pile wastage during piling and in order to help cover losses from the wastage he asked Pannir to inflate the penetration lengths by one to two metres in his piling records. Foo promised to give Pannir $1,000.
Pannir agreed to Foo`s suggestion after Pannir had discussed the matter with his colleague Justin Lee Chee Leong, who had similarly helped Foo for a pecuniary reward.
Pannir inflated the piling lengths at N5C2 and he was subsequently paid $1,700 by the appellant at the company`s office where Justin Lee was also present.
In early August 1984, Pannir was posted to another site covered by the Bukit Batok Neighbourhood 5 Contract 6 (N5C6). He was the only clerk-of-works at that site. Piling works for Blocks 541 and 513 were being carried out. Pannir asked the company`s foreman Tan Yong Kwang how much inflation to the paylengths in the piling records was to be done. When Tan replied that he did not know anything about the inflation, Pannir telephoned the appellant, whom he knew was the managing director of the company.
Pannir asked the appellant how much to inflate. The appellant told Pannir to inflate the piles by two to four metres per pile. Pannir agreed to do so as he had done the same thing at N5C2 for reward.
Later when Tan Yong Kwang asked Pannir he was told that the inflation of the paylengths was to between two to four metres. Tan then went to see the appellant and told the latter what Pannir had told him and that he was not clear what was going on.
Tan Yong Kwang was told by the appellant that he (Tan) did not have to understand about this and that he was merely to copy Pannir`s piling records when he prepared Anson Piling`s records to be submitted to HDB.
On 30 July 1984, the appellant gave a note book (exh P14) to Tan Yong Kwang instructing him to record in P14 the figures of the actual piling done as those figures were to be the basis of payment by the company to Wee Sum.
Tan Yong Kwang maintained in his note book P14 details of the number, type and lengths of piles actually driven at the sites of Blocks 541 and 513. As instructed by the appellant, Tan prepared Anson Piling`s records (exhs P11 and P11A) according to the piling records maintained by Pannir which contained inflated paylengths of piles.
Pannir, as the clerk-of-works, kept daily piling records for Block 541 (exh P10) and for Block 513 (exh P10A). He inflated the penetration lengths of the piles driven into the site at Block 541, some by three metres and some four metres. He, however, inflated the penetration lengths of only a few of the piles driven into the site at Block 513 by two metres.
Pannir showed his inflated records to Tan Yong Kwang who copied these figures to form his own records. Pannir and Tan then initialled each other`s copy of these records (exhs P10, P10A, P11 and P11A).
Pannir submitted his inflated piling records to his supervising engineer Lim Teck Choy. No one saw that the records were inflated.
Around 17 August 1984, after Pannir had submitted his inflated piling records to Lim Teck Choy, Ng Jwee Seng, the manager of the company, came to the site office at Bukit Batok and handed an envelope containing $1,000 cash to Pannir.
Pannir was not satisfied with the $1,000. He expected a larger sum as he thought that the company had made a substantial profit from the inflated paylengths. At the end of August 1984, he telephoned the appellant at his office and asked for $5,000. The appellant quickly put the receiver down. Pannir then decided to forget the whole matter and did not try to contact the appellant again.
Tan Yong Kwang left the company on 14 December 1984, without surrendering the note book P14. Late that afternoon the appellant telephoned Tan at his home and arranged to meet him at the 2nd Home Restaurant and Lounge at the Textile Centre that night. At this meeting the appellant offered Tan $25,000 to keep the company`s secret that the HDB had been deceived by the submissions of inflated paylengths by the company. Tan was so surprised that he did not know what to say. The appellant told Tan to go back and think it over and the appellant left the lounge. Tan remained at the lounge and was joined by Ah Quee, the `boss` of Wee Sum, and a friend.
About 45 minutes later, Foo See Sun appeared, at the lounge with four or five of his friends and they sat at a nearby table. Foo came up to Tan and asked the latter to join him at his table. Tan then went over to Foo`s table. Foo accused Tan of trying to extort $25,000 from the appellant. Tan denied this. Foo threatened Tan with bodily injury and offered Tan a few thousand dollars instead. Foo told Tan to go back and think it over. Tan was very frightened and the next day he lodged a police report.
Tan Yong Kwang did not hear anything from the police for several weeks. He was then assisting his father as a hawker. On the night of 15 December 1984, Tan saw two of the four men who accompanied Foo See Sun on the night of 14 December 1984, near his staff. They walked up and down and stared at him and pointed warning figures at him and uttered something. On 16 January 1985, Tan went to a coffee shop near his stall and saw one of the two men. The man stared at him. Tan took his friend`s advice and reported the matter to the CPIB on 21 January 1985.
Following CPIB investigation, the appellant and Foo See Sun were arrested on 26 April 1985, and charged in court on the following day.
 The defence
The appellant was the managing director of Anson Piling (S) Pte Ltd and Foo See Sun a co-director. In January 1984 the company was successful in obtaining a term contract from the HDB to do piling works at various HDB building sites. The appellant`s duties were to liaise with the HDB. He had also to discuss with the subcontractors, suppliers and office staff how to embark on the project. In respect of HDB projects, he was in charge of overall administration. The company had Wee Sum Engineering as sub-contractors for piling works.
In 1984/85 the company had seven or eight foremen at the field. There were six other staff in the company, including Mrs Dolly Ang, the administrative executive, who was in charge of administration, HDB claims and correspondence; and Ng Jwee Seng, the administrative and finance manager.
The duties of a foreman were generally to carry out the field operations of the company - the physical execution of a project. Every site foreman was given a note book to record daily all the information at the site - information as to the progress of the piling project before the project began. The note book exh P14 was such a note book given to a foreman. The appellant could not remember if he personally gave P14 to his foreman Tan Yong Kwang. He denied having instructed Tan to record actual paylengths in P14 whilst maintaining Anson Piling`s daily piling records according to HDB clerk-of-works Pannir`s inflated figures.
Mrs Dolly Ang, the appellant`s administrative executive, would prepare the monthly claims to the HDB according to the daily piling records. The appellant`s only interest was in the total metre tonnes piled at various sites and in how much payment he would be getting from the HDB the following month. The appellant did not look at the monthly figures that Dolly Ang kept.
Wee Sum was paid on the basis of Anson Piling`s figures which were supplied to Wee Sum by the company`s accounts and general clerk, Miss Chiang Kwee Hong.
The appellant denied that he conspired with Pannir to inflate the penetration lengths of 170 piles at Block 541 or about half of the 46 piles at Blk 513. Pannir`s allegation that Pannir telephoned the appellant on 27 July 1984, and asked how much to inflate and the appellant told Pannir two to four metres was untrue. The appellant also denied that he had instructed his foreman Tan Yong Kwang to copy Pannir`s records of inflated paylengths. The appellant had not given Tan a note book with instructions to keep in it the actual penetration lengths.
The appellant denied that he gave Pannir $1,700 as a reward for Pannir and Justin Lee for inflating penetration lengths at N5C2. He further denied having received a telephone call from Pannir at the end of August 1984 asking for $5,000. Nor did he give Ng Jwee Seng any envelope containing $1,000 to be given to Pannir.
The appellant did not know that there were two sets of piling records, exhs P10 & P14. The first time he came to know of them was when he was shown Tan Yong Kwang`s note book P14 at the CPIB by the investigating officer, Yeo Peng Soon.
The appellant did not agree with Tan Yong Kwang`s version of his resignation. The appellant`s version was that in early December 1984 Steven Tay, the HDB site engineer at Bishan, telephoned the appellant and complained that Tan Yong Kwang had not been to the site for a number of days when there was so much work which had not been done. He then instructed Ng Jwee Seng to get a replacement foreman which was done. Ng informed the appellant of Tan`s resignation in early December 1984.
On 14 December 1984, Tan Yong Kwang telephoned the appellant in the evening and requested that they meet that evening for a discussion. Tan suggested a meeting at the top floor lounge of the Textile Centre. The appellant told Tan that after he had finished his discussions with Foo See Sun he would proceed to the lounge to meet Tan.
After the discussions with Foo See Sun, the appellant alone went to the lounge at the Textile Centre. There he met Tan who was there with three or four persons, one of them was introduced to the appellant as `Ah Seng`.
This was what happened at the lounge according to the appellant: 
 
Ah Seng asked me if I knew the UE (United Engineers) matter. UE was then under investigation for overclaims. Ah Seng did most of the talking. Ah Seng told me that as the boss I had ill-treated Tan. Tan then told me that he had done something at Bukit Batok. Ah Seng then said that as I was not steady they too were not steady. I asked him what they all wanted. I was looking at Ah Seng when I asked that. Ah Seng said that unless I paid $50,000 1 would have to be prepared and be careful. I told them I did not have the money. Tan told me I could borrow from Hooi`s brother-in-law.
 
 
 
The appellant bargained with both Tan and Ah Seng and the amount was reduced to $25,000. The appellant was given two weeks to raise this amount which was to be paid into Tan`s POSB bank account the number of which he copied in his diary and also on a piece of paper.
When the appellant returned home between 9pm and 10pm he paged for Foo See Sun who later telephoned him. He informed Foo that Tan Yong Kwang had tried to extort $50,000 from the company which he had reduced to $25,000. At about 2am on 15 December Foo telephoned the appellant and informed him that he and a few men had confronted Tan at the lounge at the Textile Centre and that Tan had apologized and that the matter had been settled.
A few days later the appellant was informed by his clerk Miss Chiang Kwee Hong that she had received two telephone calls. The first call was from a man stating that the company was collapsing and using vulgar language. The second call was also from a man asking for Foo See Sun and the man told her in vulgar language that the company would be taken care of. She did not know the callers. The appellant assumed that the callers were Tan Yong Kwang`s friend and that Tan wanted to `fix up` the company. The appellant did not know what to do, whether to pay Tan or not, but decided to delay payment.
Before the appellant went to Hong Kong at the end of December or early January 1985, he wrote on a piece of paper Tan Yong Kwang`s POSB bank account number and gave it to Ng Jwee Seng. He told Ng that Tan wanted some money and that he might call Ng to put money into Tan`s account.
The appellant made another trip to Hong Kong on 30 January 1985, and returned on 16 February 1985 at 2am. He was picked up by Yeo Peng Soon and other CPIB officers. The appellant`s house and office were searched. He was released at 11.30am the same day.
Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law in receiving as relevant and admissible the evidence of Pannir that when he was first posted to N5C2 early in July 1984, Foo See Sun approached him and asked him to inflate the penetration lengths of the piles by one to two inches in his piles record and that Foo promised to give him $1,000 and that he was paid $1,700 by the appellant at Anson Piling`s office and that Justin Lee was then with him.
It is clear from the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Poon Soh Har v PP 
 
 
 
[1977] 2 MLJ 126
  that evidence in respect of past criminal activities of an accused person is inadmissible.
Here the evidence of Pannir was plainly intended to show that the appellant had been guilty of a criminal act other than that with which he was charged, for the purpose of leading to the conclusion that he was a person likely from his past criminal conduct or character to have committed the offences for which he was being tried. It is to be noted that the evidence of Pannir did not implicate the appellant. It was Foo who approached Pannir and offered the bribe. The evidence of Pannir could not be said to be relevant to any of the issues in this case.
The trial judge had wrongly considered and improperly relied on Pannir`s evidence when he found as a fact, `established on the evidence adduced by the prosecution`, that Foo See Sun asked Pannir in July 1984 to inflate the penetration lengths of the piles and offered Pannir a bribe of $1,000 and that Pannir was subsequently paid $1,700 by the appellant at Anson Piling`s office in the presence of Justin Lee. Justin Lee, who was present at the trial, was not called by the prosecution. The wrongful admission of Pannir`s evidence had greatly prejudiced the appellant.
Counsel for the appellant says that on a number of significant matters the accomplices Pannir and Tan Yong Kwang contradicted themselves. It is submitted that the trial judge failed to take into proper consideration these contradictions and that he wrongly dismissed the contradictions he found as minor and insignificant.
The contradictions which counsel for the appellant refers to are these: 
 
 
(1) Pannir testified that when he first met Tan, Tan knew that he was inflating the paylengths of the piles, but Tan wholly contradicted Pannir as to his own personal knowledge when they first met.
  
 
 
The trial judge wholly ignored and failed to consider the conflicting evidence when he found as established, on the evidence of the prosecution`, that `when Tan did not know anything about the inflation Pannir telephoned the first accused (appellant)`. This finding is wrong in fact. 
 
 
(2) Pannir said that he did not at any time tell Tan the length per pile that he was inflating in his records. Tan contradicted Pannir on this. He said that after he had ascertained from his assistant Chua Kee Kon that Pannir was inflating the paylengths of the piles, he asked Pannir about it and Pannir told him that he (Pannir) had added between two and four metres.
  
 
 
The trial judge erred in fact in his finding that `Tan did not know anything about the inflation`.
 
 
(3) Pannir and Tan painted completely different pictures on the question of the amount the appellant was to pay as gratification and who was to ask and get the payment for Pannir. Pannir said that he had asked Tan to get $2,000 from the appellant for inflating the figures. He said he did not discuss with the appellant the amount of the payment but left it to the appellant. He had expected to receive $5,000. Tan, however, said that Pannir did not ask him to get $2,000 from the appellant and that Pannir told him that he had asked for $2,000 but was only given $1,000.
  
 
 
The trial judge clearly erred in fact in finding that `Pannir received $1,000 from the first accused (appellant)`. It ignores the contradiction of the accomplices on this point. There was absolutely no evidence that the alleged payment of $1,000 was from the appellant. The trial judge gave no consideration to Pannir`s evidence that `I thought it was from Goh`.
 
 
(4) The accomplices completely differed on what allegedly took place in the site office when payment was allegedly made by Ng Jwee Seng, the manager of the company.
  
 
 
The clear evidence of Pannir was that when Ng came and handed an envelope containing a $1,000 note he was alone. He said Ng did not tell him that the envelope contained money. At first he said that Ng did not say anything to him then but in cross-examination he said that Ng passed the envelope to him and asked him to check and walked away.
Tan Yong Kwang`s evidence was that when Ng came Pannir was with him at his table having a conversation. Ng came to Tan`s table and there handed an envelope to Pannir who opened the envelope in his presence. He did not know what was inside the envelope as Pannir and Ng walked away to Pannir`s table.
The trial judge held that the credit of Ng Jwee Seng was impeached as regards his evidence on the receipt of the envelope that he gave to Pannir. He had made a contrary statement to the CPIB.
The trial judge made a finding, `established on the evidence adduced by the prosecution`, that `around 17 August 1984, after he had submitted his pile records to his supervising engineer Lim Teck Choy (PW2), Pannir receive $1,000 from the first accused (appellant). The money was in an envelope which was handed to him at the site office at Bukit Batok by Ng Jwee Seng (PW10), the manager of Anson Piling.`
The trial judge did not give proper consideration to the respective evidence of Pannir and Tan. Had a proper consideration been made the trial judge could not have found as he did.
 
 
(5) It was the evidence of Pannir that he made proper entries in exhs P10 and P10A except for the entries of the lengths of paylengths which he said he had inflated. In all other respects he said his records in P10 and P10A were true and correct - the date when the pile was driven, the cut-off length of each pile, final set, pile number, total number of piles driven into the ground on a particular day, the length of each pile above or below ground.
  
 
 
The prosecution`s case was that Tan Yong Kwang merely copied Pannir`s records P1O and P1OA to form his own records exhs P11 and P11A. The exhs P10, P1OA, P11 and P11A are therefore identical in all these respects. Further, Tan said in evidence that the appellant gave him a note book exh P14 in which he maintained records of the actual paylength of each pile. Tan said that P14 was an accurate record of each day`s piling. Pannir said that he kept no record of how much he had inflated for each pile.
Using P14 as the sole basis, the prosecution arrived at the sum of $22,594.46 that HDB had been cheated of by showing the difference in the records of paylengths between P14, P10 and P10A.
The trial judge found that Tan had `diligently maintained` P14. He also found as a fact that the paylengths had been inflated. If P14 was in fact diligently maintained by Tan and P10 and P10A were true and proper in all respects except the entries on paylengths, there should be no material differences in respect of all other information in P10, P10A and P14. However, a careful and proper scrutiny of P10, P10A and P14 reveals inherent contradictory entries which Tan could not explain. When confronted with the differences Tan had said: `I do not understand`; `Yes, that was my error`; `I do not understand how he (Pannir) did that`; `I do not understand why he (Pannir) did that`; `I do not know why his (Pannir`s) records are wrong`; and `Yes, all of Pannir`s records are not accurate`.
The evidence regarding the `above ground` and `below ground` measurements to determine the lengths of penetration was that no two records of these measurements done by two different persons could be identical.
In P14, P10 and P10A absolutely identical measurements of the `above ground` or `below ground` measurements were recorded.
No reliance should have been placed on Tan Yong Kwang`s record P14. His evidence was that he based his record of what the actual penetration lengths for each pile was by he himself usually taking the measurements at the site of the length of pile above ground and he would also `speak to the workers as to the penetration lengths` and he would then prepare the entries for each day. He admitted that he was not at the site all the time. He also admitted that P14 had errors and mistakes. He admitted that there were errors in the calculation of penetration and paylengths in a number of cases.
Tan said that the appellant told him to record the measurements of the actual piling on to P14 and when the appellant handed P14 to him he was told that the company would pay the correct sum of money to Wee Sum based on his records in P14. In cross-examination, he agreed that in respect of an invoice of Wee Sum, dated 11 September 1984, for $13,968.84 (exh P33), Wee Sum was paid not according to his figures but Pannir`s.
Kang Gim Chye, a partner in Wee Sum Engineering Company, said in evidence that in respect of the invoice exh P33 and another invoice of his firm, exh P34, the company paid his firm according to the lengths that the company claimed from HDB.
According to Tan, he was in sole charge of both the contract sites at Blk 513 and Blk 541 until the evening of 13 December 1984. But the daily piling records exhs D4 and D5 clearly show that from 29 November 1984, the daily piling records were maintained by another foreman Hooi Ah Tee. When confronted with this evidence Tan agreed that he did not maintain the records from 28 November 1984 to 14 December 1984. He explained: 
 
At that time I did not maintain the records in this form and waited until end of December to copy from a note book into the daily record form. The note book is similar to the one in P14. This is because of a lot of work as I had to be in charge of two sites. When I left I handed the note book to Ng Jwee Seng.
 
 
 
When asked why he did not hand over P14 when he left the company on 14 December 1984, he said that they did not ask for it and `I did not think it important`.
The trial judge in his grounds of decision said: 
 
I gave the most careful consideration to the evidence adduced by the prosecution, particularly because it was pivoted on the evidence of the two accomplices Pannir (PW8) and Tan Yong Kwang (PW9). I treated the evidence of the accomplices with great caution as is required by the Evidence Act, s 116, illus (b); s 135. There were minor inconsistences in their evidence but neither witness could be faulted on any of the material aspects of his testimony despite being subjected to a gruelling cross-examination. I had no reason to disbelief any of the prosecution witnesses and their evidence was supported by the documentary exhibits that were tendered by the prosecution.
 
 
 
The trial judge relied entirely on the testimony of the two accomplices. He had wrongly admitted and relied on the evidence of the appellant`s allegedly past criminal act. He did not pay proper and careful consideration to the evidence of the accomplices. The many material inconsistencies, self-contradictions and discrepancies were serious and should cast grave doubts on the credibility of Pannir and Tan Yong Kwang. The trial judge failed to realize that one accomplice cannot corroborate another. The documentary exhibits do not support the accomplices` evidence.
I am, therefore, of the view that there is justification for interference with the decision of the trial judge.
The appeal is allowed, the convictions and sentences are set aside.

Whether evidence links appellant to charges of cheating
 
The appellant, a 36-year old male Chinese who described himself as a sub-contractor, a supplier of foreign workers and a foreman, was convicted of three charges of having cheated three Bangladeshi nationals in October and November 1984. The prescribed punishment for each conviction was imprisonment for a term which could extend to seven years and fine. He was sentenced to four months` imprisonment for each conviction. It was ordered that the sentences for the first and second convictions were to run consecutively and the third sentence was to run concurrently with the two. I have just concluded the hearing of his appeal against conviction and sentence.
The three Bangladeshi nationals gave evidence. Their evidence was to the effect that a Bangladeshi national, known as `Haque` who was not apprehended, had promised them lawful employment in Singapore if they would pay US$400 in one case and US$500 in each of the other two cases. Haque told them that they would be met in Singapore by the appellant who would procure the work permits and find them the employment. They said that when they arrived in Singapore, they met the appellant, whom they identified. As directed by Haque, two of them handed the required sums in US dollars, the passports and the air tickets to him and they saw him handing over the documents and money to the appellant. In the third case, they were handed to Haque in the presence of the accused. The appellant handed the two forged work permits to two Bangladeshi workers; the third forged work permit was given by Haque in the presence of the appellant. They were taken to worksites by the appellant, as arranged, to work. On 7 March 1985 one of the Bangladeshi nationals was arrested. The other two were also arrested. It was established that the three work permits purportedly issued were forgeries and that they were not employed by a construction company. They were therefore unlawfully working in Singapore. The passports were never returned to the three Bangladeshi nationals.
Abdul Halim Kader, an immigration officer, said in evidence that on 8 March 1985 he raided the appellant`s flat at Blk 7 Marsiling Drive #01-54 and arrested the appellant who led him to his briefcase which contained two round Bangladesh authority metal seals, two rubber stamps apparently belonging to the Bangladesh Immigration Department and a copy of a Singapore work permit. These were obviously the necessary paraphernalia which would or could be used for the kind of deception we are considering in this case. It was also proved that the appellant had procured employment for two of the foreign workers; he had planned this employment since September 1984.
The appellant was tried. The prosecution`s case against him was that together with Haque, and in furtherance of a common intention of them both, he did cheat the three Bangladeshi nationals by deceiving them into believing that they would be issued work permits lawfully permitting them to work in Singapore and had thereby induced them to deliver to the appellant their Bangladesh passports and the said three sums of money in US dollars which they would not have done if they had not been so deceived.
I now turn to the grounds of appeal. First, it was submitted that the learned district judge had misdirected himself on the nature and ingredients of the charges which were not charges of cheating simpliciter but were charges of cheating committed pursuant to a common intention. The learned district judge said in this connection: `The evidence showed clearly that the workers were brought by Haque to Singapore and the accused was there to receive them. This means that there was a prior arrangement between Haque and the (appellant) to cheat the workers by falsely representing to them that the (appellant) would be able to get work permits for them.`
That passage should not be looked at in isolation. In a later part of his grounds of decision, the learned district judge said: 
 
The accused admitted that he did go to Bangladesh to meet Haque and to get workers to come to Singapore. This showed clearly that he and Haque had acted in concert to import workers to Singapore by falsely representing to them that they would be able to obtain the work permit by paying a certain sum of money.
 
 
 
Secondly, all the prosecution witnesses gave more or less the same evidence. They were simple country folks landed in a foreign country in search of a job and they were therefore at the mercy of the unscrupulous men like Haque and the accused. I don`t see any reason for them to lie in court against the accused.
Thirdly, all the witnesses testified that they handed their passports, air tickets and money to Haque who handed them over to the accused. The explanation given was that the accused needed all those items to obtain the work permits, etc. If the accused was as innocent as he claimed to be, why did he gang up with Haque to go through the scheme to deceive the workers from a foreign country?
Fourthly, the exhs P3O-P33 found in the accused`s brief case. The purpose of these exhibits was to forge passports, etc. His explanation that they were left by Haque is indeed incredible. From his demeanour I was of the view that he was not a witness of truth.
It is true, as counsel for the appellant observed, the grounds of decision had reproduced the three charges of cheating simpliciter, without any reference to the common intention shared with Haque. Nor was there any reference to the acts of cheating which were committed in furtherance of the common intention. It was plain to me, and it is completely incontrovertible, that this reproduction was a mistake. In preparing the records of appeal, the learned district judge had in his certificate reproduced the correct three charges. Most importantly, I refer to the above passages from his judgment which contain correct and wholly warranted findings of fact that the appellant and his confederate, Haque, had planned together to cheat the three foreign workers by falsely telling them they would procure work permits for them and lawful employment when, in truth and in fact, they provided them with forged work permits.
Secondly, counsel for the appellant made what appeared to me to be the wholly unwarranted submission that there was no evidence linking the appellant to the cheating. He submitted that the evidence did not incriminate the appellant, that the appellant in his various involvements, was only returning the earlier favours done for him by Haque, that he did not know about the nature of the paraphernalia found in his briefcase which, he claimed, were left behind by Haque. It is not a matter of surprise that the appellant was not believed by the learned trial judge. Lastly, I refer to another astonishing submission of counsel for the appellant. He submitted that the said paraphernalia were inadmissible as evidence as the appellant was not facing a forgery charge and that they were highly prejudicial and not relevant to the charges of cheating. His proposition has to be stated in the light of the foregoing evidence to reveal its untenability. The modus operandi in this cheating case involved the tampering of the passports and the forging of the work permits. The Bangladesh seals and stamps, with their apparent official connotations, and the specimen work permit were the sort of things used in connection with this particular cheating. They were found in the briefcase of the appellant. The appellant had to explain. He tried and, not surprisingly, he was disbelieved by the learned trial judge. In my judgment, there was overwhelming evidence establishing beyond any reasonable doubt that he together with Haque set about cheating the three foreign workers in the way set out in the charge. They planned it and perpetrated the crime. The appeal against the three convictions is dismissed.
I asked counsel for the appellant to address me why the sentences should not be enhanced because of the gravity of the offences. Counsel submitted that the amount involved was small, that this was the appellant`s first offence and that Haque had played the dominant role. It was said that he had cooperated with the police. Well, the amounts were not insignificant to the foreign workers; in fact, in the case of one of them, he sold his land to raise the money and the expenses in the hope of working in Singapore. The appellant`s role at the Singapore end involved the passing on of the forged work permits, the accommodation and unlawful employment of the foreign workers. His claim that it was all Haque`s crime, with which he had nothing to do, was rejected by the learned trial judge. They cheated innocent workers who had to leave their kith and kin, home and country, to eke out a living as manual labourers. I have very little sympathy for the appellant. There is also a need to deter other like-minded people who may be tempted to prey on foreign workers and cause unnecessary problems for the administration in relation to foreign workers. However, there were two factors which I will mention and but for which I would have enhanced the sentences. First, I was satisfied that his wife in May 1985 suffered a miscarriage owing to the stress of the investigation and charging of the appellant. She has recently given birth in January 1989 to the second child, a daughter. Secondly, four years have elapsed since he first stood trial and, although he has been out on bail, he must have been under some mental anguish during the pendency of this case. For these two reasons, I did not enhance the sentences which, in all the circumstances, were not manifestly excessive.

Cur Adv Vult
 
On 24 July 1985 in the afternoon the appellant was riding his motorcycle along Sembawang Road towards the direction of the city when he lost control of his motorcycle, fell and sustained personal injuries. He said he was travelling in the extreme left lane of the road when a motorcar which was earlier travelling on his right suddenly swerved into his path. He had no choice but to apply the brakes and thus lost control of his motorcycle. He said that when the motorcar swerved into his path the distance between them was about three metres. In his cross-examination and re-examination he also admitted that the road was sandy and the condition was not very good.
The respondent, on the other hand, testified in the court below that during that relevant afternoon he was also travelling along the same direction in his motorcar along Sembawang Road. When approaching the junction of Sembawang and Jalan Mata Ayer, he saw two vehicles in front of him signalling to turn right. He turned on his signal to filter into the inner lane. He also looked into his rear view mirror and saw no vehicles behind him. After passing the junction of Jalan Mata Ayer he looked again at his rear view mirror and noticed that one motorcyclist had fallen. He then stopped his motorcar to render assistance. He also called the ambulance. The two vehicles had not come into contact with each other.
The learned district judge in the court below having heard the evidence found that the respondent`s motorcar was some distance away from the appellant`s motorcycle when the appellant lost control of his motorcycle. He also found that the respondent did not cause the appellant to apply the brakes of his motorcycle. He dismissed the appellant`s claim with costs.
The appellant appealed before me. The only question of fact in this appeal is whether the respondent had swerved into the path of the appellant at a short distance of three metres. Counsel for the appellant has argued that the learned district judge should have accepted the evidence of the appellant that the respondent`s motorcar must have swerved into the path of the appellant which caused him to lose control of his motorcycle. This is purely a question of fact. The sketch plan drawn up by the police after the accident offers little help to the case. The scratch mark caused by the motorcycle on the road is evidence of a skid which does not go to show whether the vehicle that swerved into the appellant`s path was that of the respondent`s neither does it throw any light on the distance between the two vehicles at the point of time just before the appellant lost control of his motorcycle.
From the evidence, I am of the view that the appellant has failed to prove any negligence on the part of the respondent. I therefore dismissed the appeal with costs.

s 351(1) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
The appellant, Michael Raymond Taylor, was served with a summons issued by a magistrate on 11 January 1988, requiring him to attend court on 18 January 1988 to answer to two charges under s 402(1)(c) of the Companies Act (Cap 50). On the return date of the summons the appellant appeared before a magistrate. The charges were read to the appellant who pleaded not guilty. The proceedings were then adjourned for three weeks and the appellant was released on bail of $150,000 in one surety. The appellant appealed against the magistrate`s order ordering him to furnish bail. At the conclusion of the hearing of the appeal I dismissed the appeal. I now give my reasons.
The main contention of the appellant is that the magistrate has no power to require the appellant, who appeared before the court on a summons, to furnish bail for his release. This appeal concerns the magistrate`s jurisdiction over accused persons in cases commenced by summons, specifically the magistrate`s power to release the accused on bail under s 351 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the Code). Section 351 of the Code provides when a person may be released on bail and it reads:
 
 
(1) When any person other than a person accused of a non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without warrant by a police officer or appears or is brought before a court and is prepared at any time while in the custody of the officer or at any stage of the proceedings before the court to give bail, that person shall be released on bail by any police officer in such cases as are specified in orders issued by the Commissioner of Police or by that court. 
 
(2) The police or the court, if he or it thinks fit, may, instead of taking bail from that person, discharge him on his executing a bond without sureties for his appearance as hereinafter provided.
  
 
 
It is clear from the last section of Sch A to the Code headed `Offences Against Laws Other than the Penal Code` that for the offences with which the appellant is charged (1) that the police shall not arrest without a warrant; (2) that a summons shall ordinarily issue in the first instance; (3) that the offences are bailable of right. In this case a summons was issued by the magistrate in the first instance.
The arguments and submissions of counsel for the appellant are these. It was left to the appellant to attend court at the appointed date and time in obedience to the summons. The appellant, who had appeared in court in obedience to the summons, does not come within any category of persons set out in s 351 who is to be released on bail, after his appearance, by the court. It is only if the appellant has failed to appear that the magistrate may issue a warrant for his arrest under s 54(b) of the Code and may endorse on the warrant a direction regarding the furnishing of bail. It is submitted that there is no provision for sanction in s 351 in the case of the person who `appears` before a court who is not prepared to give bail. He, therefore, cannot be placed in custody but must be released. The liberty of the subject being the norm any restraint on it must be expressly provided for by law. There can be no question of a magistrate having power by necessary implication to remand a person to custody. The magistrate can remand a person to custody only when he has express power to do so (
 Ram Chandra v State of Uttar Pradesh 
 [1977] Cr LJ 1783 at p 1787 para 15). The conception of `bail` is to set at liberty a person, arrested or imprisoned, on security being taken for his appearance in court. It is submitted that a person who is under no previous restraint does not need any order of bail as he is free to move about as he likes. Mr Khoo in support of his submissions cited a number of Indian cases. To put it shortly Mr Khoo`s argument is that as far as the appellant is concerned s 351 is applicable only if he has been arrested or a warrant for his arrest has been issued. So much for Mr Khoo`s arguments and submissions.
The magistrate was correct in his interpretation and application of Sch A of the Code and was correct in holding that s 402(1)(c) is a bailable offence. The appellant concedes that but submits that he was wrong in holding that because it was a `bailable offence` therefore s 351 applied. Section 351 covers several categories of persons. It applies to all cases of persons accused of bailable offences. In 
 State v Santokh Singh 
 AIR 1960 Punjab 31 the court in dealing with s 496 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code (which is in pari materia with our s 351) held (at p 31): 
 
Thus the substantive portion of s 496 applies to all persons except those accused of non-bailable offences. Furthermore, the provisions of this section are applicable not only to persons who are arrested or detained by an officer in charge of a police station, but also to persons who appear or are otherwise brought before a court.
 
 
 
The contention of the appellant is that his appearance before the court is not within the context of s 351. He further argues that though he is entitled to bail, his release need not be secured by bail or personal bond.
The magistrate was correct in his view that a person who is served with a summons and in obedience thereto `appears` in court comes within the meaning of s 351. This construction is supported by a reading of the form of a summons, Form 1 of Sch B, where the words used are `You are hereby required to appear`. But in relation to the issuance of a warrant, Form 2 of Sch B, the Commissioner of Police is directed `to arrest the said.... and to produce him before the court.` Judicial interpretation of `appears` also supports the magistrate`s view that `appears` is `appears in answer to a summons` (see 
 R v Tottenham Juvenile Courts 
 [1982] 2 All ER 321 at p 326). In 
 Bhramar v State of Orissa 
 [1981] Cr LJ 1057 PK Mohanti J referring to s 437 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, when bail may be taken in case of non-bailable offence, stated (at p 1059) that the expression `is brought before a court` is used in relation to the issue of a warrant, while the expression `appears` is used in relation to the issue of a summons. A similar view was expressed in 
 State v Dallu Punja 
 [1954] Cr LJ 1052 at p 1053. It was held in 
 PP v Manikya Rao 
 1959 Andra Pradesh 639 at p 641 that the words `is brought before a court` involve the idea that the `accused is produced before a court` and the word `appear` that the accused has surrendered himself in obedience to a process of court. This would obviously include a summons.
Appearing before a court in obedience to a process of the court constitutes a form of restraint since his liberties are no longer unfettered. In 
 Bhramar 
 [1981] Cr LJ 1057 PK Mohanti J said (p 1059): 
 
A person, knowing that a warrant or summons has been issued against him, may voluntarily surrender, and thus, submit himself to the jurisdiction of the court. Evidently in such cases, the accused is under a restraint and he appears and moves for being enlarged on bail.
 
 
 
A person who `appears` before a court in obedience to a summons surrenders himself to the custody of the court. In 
 Niranjan Singh v Prabhakar Rajaram 
 AIR 1980 SC 785 the Supreme Court of India held that: 
 
Where the accused had appeared and surrendered before the sessions judge, the judge would have jurisdiction to consider the bail application as the accused would be considered to have been in custody within meaning of s 439. Custody, in the context of s 439, is physical control or at least physical presence of the accused in court coupled with submission to the jurisdiction and orders of the court.
 
 
 
He can be in custody not merely when the police arrests him, produces him before a magistrate and gets a remand to judicial or other custody. He can be stated to be in judicial custody when he surrenders before the court and submits to its directions.
It was held in 
 State of Uttar Pradesh v Kailash 
 AIR 1955 Allahabad 98 at p 99 that when a person appears in court, his very physical presence results in his placing himself in the custody of the court.
The magistrate, therefore, did not err in law when he held that: 
 
in the case of a person who appears in court in obedience to a summons, his presence in court places him in the jurisdiction of the court ... ;
 
 
 
and that: 
 
It is my view that the accused in the present case was under a restraint as he had appeared before the court in response to a summons which had been issued against him ...
 
 
 
The appellant seeks to restrict the operation of s 351 by confining the order of the court to furnish bail only to persons who have been arrested or where a warrant for arrest has been issued. There is no express requirement that an arrest is a precondition for bail in bailable offences. This condition is inferred from the Indian cases relied upon by the appellant. No reliance can be placed on the dicta of the Indian cases that assume such a requirement. Those Indian cases dealt with s 438(1) of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code where it is provided that: 
 
When any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section, and that court may, if it thinks fit, direct that in the event of such arrest, he shall be released on bail (anticipatory bail).
 
 
 
We do not have a similar provision in our Code. The facts in those Indian cases were that the applicants under s 438(1) had not been arrested but had reason to believe that they might be arrested on an accusation of having committed a non-bailable offence. The preponderance of judicial opinion in India is in favour of the view that no such anticipatory bail could be granted. The reason is that it is implied in the very definition of the word `bail` that a person must be under some sort of restraint and the order of releasing a person on bail would set free a person who was under arrest, detention or under some kind of restraint by taking security for his appearance (see 
 State of Gujarat v Govindal 
AIR 1966 Gujarat 146).
If it was intended that s 351 should apply to bailable offences where arrest had been effected prior to his appearance in court, then the legislature would not have employed the disjunctive word `or`. If prior arrest was intended to be a necessary precondition then s 351 should read: 
 
When any person other than a person accused of a non-bailable offence is arrested or detained without a warrant by a police officer and appears and is brought before a court ...
 
 
 
Section 351 contains a few limbs. The relevant portion of the section reads as follows: 
 
is arrested or detained without warrant by a police officer or appears or is brought before a court ...
 
 
 
The magistrate gave the right construction by noting the use of the disjunctive `or` when he said in his grounds of decision: 
 
In my view, the employment of the word `or` in the quoted lines makes it clear that each limb must be read disjunctively so that this provision must be read as referring to a situation where a person is arrested without warrant or is detained, or a person who is served with a summons and, in obedience thereto, `appears` in court. He may also `appear` in court after he has been arrested, where, after his arrest, he has been released on bail by the police. The word `appears`, therefore, will cover both the latter instances.
 
 
 
The magistrate was right in his view that s 351 of the Code `does empower the court, in order to secure the future attendance of a person who has appeared before it in obedience to a summons, ordering his appearance thereto, to order such a person to furnish bail. The court`s discretion to impose bail under s 351 of the Code should not be impeded simply on the ground that the offences were non-seizable (ie no arrest without warrant).`
The magistrate has to exercise his discretion judicially. In my view he has properly exercised his discretion in the present case in requiring bail of $150,000 in one surety. A charge under s 402(1)(c) of the Companies Act is a grave one. In this case it concerns furnishing misleading statements to the Securities Industry Council with intent to deceive. It carries a penalty of a fine not exceeding $10,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years or both. Furthermore the appellant is not a local citizen. For these reasons the appeal was dismissed.

This is an application by Elite Wood Products (Australia) Pty Ltd and Peter Bazos (collectively called the applicants) for an order of certiorari to quash the authorization of the Minister of Law (the Minister) given in writing on 23 May 1988 (the authorization) in exercise of his power under s 43(1) of the Extradition Act 1968 (the 1968 Act). The authorization was in the following terms:

Whereas the attached letter of request dated 8 April 1988 was received from the first assistant secretary, Criminal Law and Law Enforcement Division, Attorney General`s Department, Canberra, Australia, for the evidence of certain persons to be taken and particularly, for certain documents now situate in the Republic of Singapore to be received in evidence.
 
 
 
And whereas the evidence requested is for the purposes of a criminal matter pending before the local court of New South Wales which is not a matter relating to offences which are, by their nature or by reason of the circumstances in which they were alleged to have been committed, offences of a political character.
Now therefore I, pursuant to s 43(1) of the Extradition Act (Cap 103) thereby authorize you or 
 such other district judge or magistrate as you may nominate 
 to take the evidence of the said witnesses as referred to in the letter of request and thereafter to submit the certified notes of the evidence and the documents received in evidence to me. [Emphasis added.]

Upon receipt of the authorization, the senior district judge himself did not proceed to take the evidence but, acting under its terms, appointed another district judge to take the evidence of the witnesses named in the letter of request, which evidence was required by the Australian government in connection with the prosecution in Australia of the applicants for certain offences under the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 and for forgery of documents deliverable to the Commonwealth.
The applicants have challenged the validity of the authorization on two main grounds: (1) the Minister did not have any power to make the authorization under s 43(1) of the Extradition Act 1968; and (2) if he did, he exceeded his power by delegating it to the senior district judge. The senior state counsel representing the Minister and counsel for the Commonwealth of Australia contend that the Minister had the power and that it was exercised properly.
The rival contentions on the first point concern the extent of the power of the Minister under s 43 of the 1968 Act. To determine which contention is correct, it is necessary to trace the legislative history of Parts II, III and IV of the 1968 Act and also s 43 as they originated from different sources of legislation for different purposes.
 Extradition between Singapore and Commonwealth countries
Singapore was a British colony until 15 September 1963 when it became independent as a constituent state within the Federation of Malaysia. As a British colony, Singapore`s arrangements relating to the surrender of fugitive offenders with other parts of the British Possessions (which expression will be used to describe Her Britannic Majesty`s Dominions in its pre-1931 sense) were settled by the Imperial Parliament under the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 (the 1881 Act). Both Australia and the Straits Settlements were British Possessions in 1881.
The scheme of the 1881 Act has been adequately summarized by Thompson LP in 
 PP v Anthony Wee Boon Chye 
 
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 189 
 where the Federal Court of Malaysia in an appeal from the High Court of Singapore held that the 1881 Act and the Order in Council of 2 January 1918 (which grouped together certain British Possessions including British India, Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, the Federation of Malay States and Hong Kong) remained as part of the existing law of Singapore on 15 September 1963 even though Singapore ceased, politically, to be a British possession on that day. The court held that the expression `British Possessions` in the 1881 Act must be given a geographical meaning drained of any content implying any political relationship between the United Kingdom and Singapore. The decision in

 5 in relation to another Imperial statute, viz the Copyright Act 1914. The 1881 Act contained no provision for the taking of evidence of witnesses in one British Possession for use in any judicial proceedings in another British Possession.
 Extradition between Singapore and a foreign state
Similarly, extradition arrangements between Singapore as a British colony and any foreign state were settled by the Imperial Parliament under the Extradition Acts of 1870 to 1935 (the 1870-1935 Acts). The 1870 Act was extended to the Straits Settlements pursuant to s 17 thereof by Order in Council dated 11 July 1877. In general, the scheme of the 1870 Act was similar to that of the 1881 Act in that it only applied in relation to certain specified offences, except that in the 1870 Act there was no right of extradition for offences of a political nature. In the 1870 Act, the expression `foreign state` meant any sovereign state other than the United Kingdom and its possessions, ie the British Possessions.
 Taking of evidence for criminal proceedings in foreign courts
The first Imperial statute which made it possible for the taking of evidence in the United Kingdom or any part of the British Possessions for criminal proceedings in the courts and tribunals of a foreign country (ie other than the United Kingdom and the British Possessions) was the 1870 Act which by s 24 extended the operation of the Foreign Tribunals Act 1856 (the 1856 Act) to such proceedings. Section 24 provided as follows: 
 
The testimony of any witness may be obtained in relation to any criminal matter pending in any court or tribunal in a foreign state in like manner as it may be obtained in relation to any civil matter under the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act 1856, and all the provisions of that Act shall be construed as if the term civil matter included a criminal matter, and the term cause included a proceeding against a criminal: Provided that nothing in this section shall apply in the case of any criminal matter of a political character.
 
 
 
The object of the 1856 Act was to afford facilities for taking evidence in British Possessions in relation to civil and commercial matters only. For this purpose, the 1856 Act authorized the judges of certain superior courts in the United Kingdom and any of the British Possessions, on application being made to them on behalf of any foreign court `before which any civil or commercial matter is pending`, to attend before, and to be examined by, such persons as shall be named in the order, and the examiners were empowered to administer all necessary oaths.
The power conferred by s 24 of the 1870 Act was subsequently extended by s 5 of the Extradition Act 1873: s 5 provided for the taking of evidence in the United Kingdom and any part of the British Possessions for the purpose of any criminal matter in any court in a foreign state. Section 5 reads as follows: 
 
A Secretary of State may, by order under his hand and seal, require a police magistrate or a justice of the peace to take evidence for the purpose of 
 any criminal matter pending
 in any court or tribunal in any foreign state; and the police magistrate or justice of the peace upon the receipt of such order, shall take the evidence of every witness appearing before him for the purpose in like manner as if such witness appeared on a charge against some defendant for an indictable offence, and shall certify at the foot of the depositions so taken that such evidence was taken before him, and shall transmit the same to the Secretary of State; such evidence may be taken in the presence or absence of the person charged, if any, and the fact of such presence or absence shall be stated in such deposition. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Provided that nothing in this section shall apply in the case of any criminal matter of a political character.
It is to be noted that the procedure for invoking the jurisdiction of the courts under s 5 of the 1873 Act was very different from the procedure provided by s 1 of the 1856 Act as extended to the 1870 Act by s 24 thereof. Under s 5 of the 1873 Act, the Secretary of State had the power to direct a police magistrate or a justice of the peace to take the evidence whereas under s 1 of the 1856 Act, the procedure was by way of an application to the court by the party who desired such evidence to be taken. The second point to note is that the 1870-1873 Acts applied only as between (i) the United Kingdom and the British Possessions and (ii) foreign states, and not amongst the United Kingdom and the British Possessions inter se, for which, the 1881 Act was the relevant statute.
 Taking of evidence for criminal proceedings in British Possessions
The first Imperial statute which made it possible for the taking of evidence in the United Kingdom and any of the British Possessions for use in proceedings in another part of the British Possessions was also limited to civil matters only. This was the Evidence By Commission Act 1859 (the 1859 Act) which, after reciting that it was expedient to afford facilities `
 for taking evidence 
 
 in, or in relation to, actions, suits, and proceedings pending before tribunals of Her Majesty`s dominions, in places in such dominions out of the jurisdiction of such tribunals 
`, went on to provide that whenever any court in the British Possessions should have authorized, by command, order or other process, the obtaining of the testimony of any witness out of its jurisdiction, in relation to any action, suit or proceedings pending in such court, certain judges enumerated in the 1859 Act were empowered to command the attendance of any witness living within the jurisdiction to attend before appointed commissioners, to order his examination and to give all necessary directions on the subject (see s 1). Here, the procedure to take the evidence was by way of commission. Section 1 of the 1859 Act was the counterpart of the 1856 Act (relating to foreign courts).
The 1859 Act was amended by the Evidence By Commission Act 1885 (the 1885 Act) in two important respects: firstly, it extended, by s 3, the power to take evidence for use in criminal proceedings and secondly, the procedure was changed to enable the court or the chief judge to whom the commission was addressed to nominate another judge of the same court or a judge of an inferior court to take the evidence. The taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings was therefore not by way of commission (notwithstanding the short title of the 1885 Act) but by an order from one court or judge to another court or judge. Section 3 of the 1885 Act laid down the procedure as follows: 
 
Where in any criminal proceeding 
 a mandamus or order
 for the examination of any witness or person 
 is addressed, to any court, or to any judge of a court
, in India ..., or 
 the Colonies
, or elsewhere in Her Majesty`s dominions, 
 beyond the jurisdiction
 
 of the court ordering the examination
, it shall be lawful for such court, or the chief judge thereof, or such judge, to nominate any judge of such court, or any judge of an inferior court, or magistrate within the jurisdiction of such first-mentioned court, to take the examination of such witness or person, and any deposition or examination so taken shall be admissible in evidence to the same extent as if it had been taken by or before the court or judge to whom the mandamus or order was addressed. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The Evidence By Commission Acts 1859 and 1885 were, by their terms, applicable to Singapore as a British colony. Like the Extradition Acts 1870-1935 and the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881, and the Foreign Tribunals Act 1856, the Evidence By Commission Acts 1859 and 1885 remained in full force and effect in Singapore as part of the existing laws of Singapore on 15 September 1963 when it ceased to be a British colony: see 
 PP v Anthony Wee Boon Chye 
 
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 189 
; and continued to be in full force and effect in Singapore on 9 August 1965 when it became an independent sovereign republic: see 
 Ng Sui Nam v Butterworth & Co (Publishers) 
 
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 5
  in so far as the Malaysian Parliament had not legislated otherwise, in respect of such matters, for Singapore as a constituent state of the Federation.
 Legal position in Singapore as at 9 August 1965
Thus, when Singapore became an independent sovereign republic, there was still a clear division in its written laws that were applicable vis-a-vis what were originally the British Possessions (but today geographically part of and generally known as the Commonwealth countries) and vis-a-vis foreign states in relation to matters of extradition and the taking of evidence for use in proceedings, both civil and criminal, before foreign courts and courts in Commonwealth countries. The legal position as at 9 August 1965 may be summarized as follows: 
 
 
(1) Extradition arrangements between Singapore and any foreign state were governed by the Extradition Acts 1870-1935. 
 
(2) Extradition arrangements between Singapore and what is now geographically a former British Possession (generally a Commonwealth country) were governed by the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881. 
 
(3) The taking of evidence in Singapore for use in criminal proceedings in a court in a foreign state (ie generally a non-Commonwealth country) was governed by s 5 of the Extradition Act 1873. 
 
(4) The taking of evidence in Singapore for use in criminal proceedings in a Commonwealth country was governed by the Evidence by Commission Act 1885 read with the Evidence by Commission Act 1859.
  
 
 
 
 The 1966 Commonwealth scheme
 
From 26 April to 3 May 1966, the Commonwealth Law Ministers (including the Attorney General of Australia and the Minister of Law, Singapore) met in London (the meeting) to review the arrangements for the extradition of fugitive offenders within the Commonwealth in the light of the constitutional changes which had taken place since the passing of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881. A scheme (the scheme) was formulated and agreed to. The following extract from the communique issued at the conclusion of this meeting explains the purpose of the scheme: 
 
The meeting considered that Commonwealth extradition arrangements should be based upon reciprocity and substantially uniform legislation incorporating certain features commonly found in extradition treaties, eg a list of returnable offences, the establishment of a prima facie case before return, and restrictions on the return of political offenders.
 
 
 
The meeting accordingly formulated a scheme setting out principles which could form the basis of legislation within the Commonwealth and recommended that effect should be given to the scheme in each Commonwealth country. The scheme does not apply to Southern Rhodesia.
It is not necessary to set out the principles of the scheme here. But two observations need to be made: firstly, the meeting was concerned with the review of the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 and not the Extradition Acts 1870- 1935. Secondly, the scheme did not include any principle or guideline in relation to the taking of evidence of witnesses for use in or criminal proceedings in another Commonwealth country.
 (a) Australian legislation
The Commonwealth of Australia gave effect to the scheme by enacting the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966 and repealing the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881. At the same time, the Commonwealth of Australia also enacted another statute along similar lines to deal with extraditions with foreign states, viz the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 (which Act repealed the Extradition Acts 1870-1935). These two Acts, although containing similar provisions, make a clear division between extradition arrangements with Commonwealth countries on the one hand and with foreign states (ie other than Commonwealth countries) on the other hand. Singapore was declared a Commonwealth country for the purpose of the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966 in 1969.
In regard to the taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings in Commonwealth courts, it is also relevant to note that (a) s 32AB of the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966 provides as follows: 
 
 
(1) Where a request is made by a declared Commonwealth country that evidence be taken in Australia for the purposes of a criminal proceeding in a court or tribunal of that country other than a proceeding relating to an offence that is, or that is by reason of the circumstances in which it is alleged to have been committed, an offence of a political character, the Attorney General may, by writing in accordance with a form prescribed for the purposes of this subsection, authorize the taking of the evidence.
  
 
 
and (b) that in relation to foreign states, the Extradition (Foreign States) Act 1966 contains a corresponding provision in s 27, with the expression `foreign state` being substituted for `declared Commonwealth country`. The legal position in Australia on this point is absolutely clear. The taking of evidence in Australia for use in criminal proceedings in the courts of Commonwealth countries and of foreign states is governed by two separate Acts.
 (b) Singapore legislation - The Extradition Act 1968
Singapore gave effect to the scheme by enacting the Extradition Act 1968. Following the Commonwealth of Australia, Singapore also enacted new provisions to regulate the arrangements for the extradition of fugitive offenders to foreign States. However, Singapore did not follow the Australian model of having two statutes to regulate extradition arrangements with Commonwealth countries and foreign States separately. Instead, Singapore enacted the 1968 Act to cover both sets of arrangements. For this reason, the 1968 Act, by s 46, repealed the Extradition Acts 1870-1935 and the Fugitive Offenders Act 1881 at the same time. The Commonwealth of Australia was on 22 February 1969 declared a Commonwealth country in relation to Part IV thereof by subsidiary legislation No S52 of 1969.
The 1968 Act is divided into Parts I to VI. Part I deals with definitions and other preliminary matters. Part II deals with extradition
 to 
 foreign States (an expression which is statutorily defined). Part III deals with extradition from foreign States. Part IV deals with extradition to and from declared Commonwealth countries (an expression which is also statutorily defined). Part V deals with extradition to and from Malaysia and Part VI deals with miscellaneous matters.
As the application before me does not concern extradition but the taking of evidence in Singapore for criminal proceedings in Australia, I do not propose to examine the provisions of Parts II, III, IV and V. It is however necessary to reproduce below (i) certain provisions in Part I and Part VI and in particular the definitions of `declared Commonwealth country` and `foreign State` and (ii) s 43(1). In s 2 of Part I: 
 
 
(a) the expression `declared Commonwealth country` as defined means:
  
 
 
a country declared to be a Commonwealth country in relation to which Part IV applies. 
(b) the expression `extradition treaty` is defined as:
 
 
 
a treaty or agreement made by Singapore with a foreign State relating to the extradition of fugitives, and includes any treaty or agreeing relating to the extradition of fugitives made before 9 August 1965 which extends to, and is binding on, Singapore. 
(c) the expression `foreign State` is defined as:
 
 
 
a foreign State between which and Singapore an extradition treaty is in force.
 
 
 
The last relevant provision is s 43 which provides as follows: 
 
 
(1) The Minister may, by notice in writing, authorize a Magistrate [which, as defined includes any district judge] to take evidence for the purposes of a 
 criminal matter 
 pending in a court or tribunal of a 
 foreign State 
other than a matter relating to an offence that is, by its nature or by reason of the circumstances in which it is alleged to have been committed, an offence of a political character. [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
It is to be noted that s 43(1) refers specifically to criminal proceedings pending in a court or tribunal of a foreign State and makes no mention whatever to a declared Commonwealth country.
 Taking of evidence for foreign courts
The next legislative development in Singapore concerning the taking of evidence for use in foreign courts and tribunals was the enactment of the Evidence (Civil Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions) Act 1979 (the 1979 Act) to give effect to Singapore`s accession to the Hague Convention on the Taking of Evidence Abroad in Civil or Commercial Matters of 1968. The 1979 Act replaced and repealed the Foreign Tribunals Act 1856, the Evidence By Commission Act 1859 and the Evidence By Commission Act 1885 in relation to civil proceedings. Unlike these Imperial statutes, and, prima facie, s 43(1) of the Extradition Act 1968, the 1979 Act applies uniformly to requests from Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth countries.
Section 7 of the 1979 Act is significant. It provided for the repeal of the said Imperial statute in these words: 
 
 
(1) The Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act 1856, and the Evidence by Commission Act 1859, shall cease to apply to Singapore. 
 
(2) The Evidence by Commission Act 1885, shall, 
 in so far as it applies to civil proceedings, cease to apply to Singapore 
. [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
The effect of s 7 was that the taking of evidence for use in civil proceedings in courts in the United Kingdom and the former British Possessions was governed by the 1979 Act but that in relation to 
 criminal proceedings 
 in such courts, it left undisturbed the existing law, which was s 3 of the 1885 Act.
 Current position in Singapore re extradition and taking of evidence
The current state of the law in Singapore in relation to the extradition of fugitive offenders and the taking of evidence in Singapore for use in Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth tribunals may be stated as follows: 
 
 
(1) Extradition arrangements between Singapore and a foreign State are governed by Parts II and III of the 1968 Act. 
 
(2) Extradition arrangements between Singapore and a Commonwealth country (excluding Malaysia) are regulated by Part IV of the 1968 Act. 
 
(3) Extradition arrangements between Singapore and Malaysia are regulated by Part V of the 1968 Act. 
 
(4) The taking of evidence for use in civil proceedings abroad, whether in a Commonwealth or non-Commonwealth country is governed by the 1979 Act. 
 
(5) The taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings in Commonwealth courts and tribunals (ie those countries which were formerly British Possessions) continues to be governed by s 3 of the Evidence By Commission 
 
Act 1885 (see, by analogy, the decision of 
 Panthalu 
 
 v Ramnord Research Laboratories 
 
[1966] 2 QB 173
 where the Court of Appeal agreed that the Evidence by Commission Act 1859 rather than the Foreign Tribunals Evidence Act 1856 continued to apply to India in 1966 although India was then a Republic). 
 
(6) The taking of evidence for use in criminal proceedings in a foreign state is governed by s 43 of the 1968 Act.
  
 
 
Before I consider the submissions of counsel, it is relevant to note the way in which the United Kingdom has legislated on these two matters, ie the scheme and the taking of evidence. The United Kingdom gave effect to the scheme by enacting the Fugitive Offenders Act 1967 and repealing the Fugitive Offenders Act of 1881. Extradition arrangements between the United Kingdom and foreign states continued to be governed by the Extradition Acts 1830-1932. As regards the taking of evidence, the UK Parliament enacted the Evidence (Proceedings in Other Jurisdictions) Act 1975. This Act, as can be seen from its short title, applies to proceedings, civil and criminal. Sections 1, 2 and 3 deal with civil proceedings and s 5 applies ss 1 to 3 to criminal proceedings. The result is that a court in the United Kingdom has power to assist in obtaining evidence for civil and criminal proceedings in overseas courts. In the event, s 8(2) of the 1975 Act repealed the Foreign Tribunals Act 1856, the Evidence by Commission Act 1859, s 24 of the Extradition Act 1870, the Evidence by Commission Act 1885 and the Foreign Jurisdiction Act 1890.
It is clear from a comparison of the Australian, Singapore and the United Kingdom legislation on these two matters, that only Singapore, by enacting the 1979 Act in the manner it has done, has apparently chosen to retain s 3 of the Evidence By Commission Act 1885 as the machinery whereby Singapore courts may assist in obtaining evidence for criminal proceedings in the courts or tribunals of the United Kingdom, its possessions and countries which were formerly part of the British Possessions (ie Commonwealth countries). Why Singapore should have retained the machinery set up by an Imperial Act for this purpose and not a new scheme similar to that adopted by either Australia or the United Kingdom is somewhat puzzling. In the context of Singapore`s status as an independent and sovereign state, the s 3 machinery is wholly inappropriate as it enables any superior court in any of the Commonwealth countries to issue a mandamus or order to the Chief justice of Singapore to nominate any judge of the Supreme Court of Singapore or any district judge or magistrate to take such evidence.
I turn now to the arguments of counsel. The correctness of the summary I have given of the current state of the law in Singapore is not disputed by counsel. However, in relation to the sixth proposition, both senior state counsel representing the Minister of Law and counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Australia, contend that the expression `foreign State` therein includes Australia. I shall examine their arguments in due course.
Counsel for the applicants, on the other hand, contends that s 43(1) means when it says, ie the expression `foreign State` has its defined meaning and that Australia is not a foreign State but a declared Commonwealth country. He says that s 43(1) cannot possibly apply to Australia for the following reasons: 
 
 
(a) Australia is not a `foreign State` as defined, and moreover, there is no extradition treaty between Singapore and Australia; 
 
(b) in any case, since Australia has been declared a Commonwealth country for the purpose of Part IV, it cannot, at the same time, be a foreign State under the same Act; 
 
(c) the 1968 Act makes a clear division between Commonwealth countries and foreign states in all its relevant provisions and these provisions, except for s 43, use both expressions whenever it is intended that they apply to both groups of territories, eg ss 2(2), (3), (4) and (5), 40, 41, 42; similarly the provisions of Parts II and III refer only to foreign states and the provisions of Part IV refer only to declared Commonwealth countries; 
 
(d) the legislative history of the 1968 Act and s 43 supports this submission.
  
 
 
The submissions of senior state counsel (which have been adopted by counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions, Australia) are as follows: (a) the expression `foreign State` in the context of s 43(1) means any sovereign state other than Singapore, and alternatively (b) that Australia, even though declared a Commonwealth country, is also for the purpose of that section, a foreign State.
The arguments put forward by senior state counsel in support of proposition (a) are as follows: 
 
 
(i) the definition of `foreign State` applies unless the context otherwise requires (see s 2) and in s 43(1), the context so requires; it so requires, because otherwise it would lead to an absurdity; 
 
(ii) the object of s 43(1) has no connection whatever with the extradition of fugitives which is permitted only if certain conditions are satisfied; 
 
(iii) if s 43(1) does not allow Singapore to render assistance to Commonwealth countries but only non-Commonwealth countries, it would result in an absurdity as more stringent procedures apply to extradition to and from foreign states than extradition to and from Commonwealth countries, with which the arrangements are more liberal and flexible; 
 
(iv) given the legislative history and the purpose for which s 43 was enacted, `foreign State` must be given its plain and ordinary meaning to refer to any sovereign state other than Singapore: reference was made to the decision of 
 Mangin v IRC 
[1971] AC 739
 where the Privy Council restated the rules of interpretation which fell to be applied in that case, viz (a) words in a statute are to be given their ordinary meaning; (b) one has to look merely at what is clearly said; and (c) the object of the construction of a statute being to ascertain the will of legislature, it may be presumed that neither injustice nor absurdity is intended; 
 
(v) as the 1968 Act was enacted in accordance with and to give effect to the scheme, which formulated a basis for substantially uniform legislation among Commonwealth countries, it could not be the intention of Parliament that Commonwealth countries should be excluded from the scope of s 43; 
 
(vi) the possibility that a Commonwealth country may still be able to obtain assistance from Singapore in regard to the taking of evidence for criminal proceedings under s 3 of the Evidence By Commission Act 1885 does not affect or weaken the argument as parallel procedures for extradition also exist between Singapore and Malaysia; 
 
(vii) in any case, as only s 3 of the 1885 Act remains in force in Singapore, if it remains in force at all, it is an `inchoate` provision and therefore Parliament could not have intended to retain that provision to enable a Commonwealth country to seek the assistance of a Singapore court for the purpose of taking evidence for criminal matters; 
 
(viii) the expression `foreign State` in s 43 is capable of being used in its natural and ordinary sense, ie its non-defined sense and it is also used in a non defined sense; this is supported by its use in the definition of the expression `extradition treaty`; if the expression `foreign State` as used in the expression `extradition treaty` as defined means a foreign State as defined, it would lead to a circuitous and therefore absurd state of affairs; 
 
(ix) the legislative history of s 43 supports the above arguments.
  
 
 
In support of proposition (b), senior state counsel contends that (i) Australia is a `foreign State` within the meaning of that expression in the expression `extradition treaty` as defined, and that (ii) on this basis, there is an extradition treaty between Singapore and Australia within the meaning of `extradition treaty` as defined.
It can be seen from the above summary that the contentions of counsel for the applicants are simple and straightforward and involve making no assumption whatever as to the intention of Parliament in enacting s 43 of the 1968 Act in the form as it has done. They merely require the court to give effect to the plain words thereof whereas the contentions of senior state counsel require the court to say that Parliament did not mean what it has said in s 43 and also, as we shall see, did not intend what it has actually done. For this reason, it is more likely than not that the contentions of counsel for the applicants are correct. But it is necessary for me to consider the somewhat convoluted arguments of senior state counsel which I now proceed to do.
Firstly, there is nothing in the context of s 43, however one reads it, which remotely suggests that the expression `foreign State` as used therein has a meaning other than its defined meaning. The result of giving the expression its defined meaning in s 43(1) does not result in any absurdity as generally understood by the courts. An absurdity is a result which is manifestly inconsistent with the terms or defeats the object of the section or the statute, or a result which is manifestly nonsensical. In my view, s 43 works perfectly well if `foreign State` is given its defined meaning and it causes no injustice whatever to anyone. So interpreted, it leads to no absurdity but to a result which is, in the instant case, merely inconvenient to the Commonwealth of Australia. The principles of interpretation as restated in 
 Mangin v IRC 
 
[1971] AC 739
 even if applicable to the present case, are of no assistance to senior state counsel. It should also be noted that in that case, the meaning of a statutorily defined expression was not in issue.
Secondly, the argument that Singapore, having agreed to, and did put into legislative effect the scheme, could not have intended to deprive declared Commonwealth countries of the benefit of s 43, does not stand up to scrutiny. The scheme was concerned solely with the extradition of fugitives and not with the taking of evidence for use in Commonwealth countries which participated in the scheme. The enactment by Australia of s 32AB of the Extradition (Commonwealth Countries) Act 1966 and the declaration of Singapore as a Commonwealth country under that Act did not necessarily require Singapore, in order to discharge its reciprocal obligations to Australia, to enact a corresponding provision in the 1968 Act as that concerned a matter outside the scheme. In any case, any reciprocity in that direction in favour of Australia was already, in 1966, fulfilled by the Evidence By Commission Acts 1859 and 1885 which were part of the law of Singapore at that time. Parliament must be deemed to have been aware of this legal position in 1968 when it enacted s 43 of the 1968 Act; in any case, it certainly was fully aware of such legal position in 1979 when it enacted s 7 of the 1979 Act which expressly repealed the Evidence By Commission Act 1859 and the Evidence By Commission Act 1885 in so far as those Acts applied to civil proceedings. In effecting such partial repeal, Parliament must have intended to preserve the 1885 Act in so far as it applied to criminal proceedings. Senior state counsel has pointed out in the course of his submissions that by repealing the whole of the 1859 Act and retaining only those provisions of the 1885 Act in relation to criminal proceedings, Parliament appeared to have emasculated (counsel described the 1885 Act standing by itself as `inchoate`) the power of the Singapore courts under s 3 of the 1885 Act as that power could not be exercised effectively in the absence of the power to command the attendance of witnesses to attend court for the taking of their evidence, a power which was vested in the courts by the repealed s 1 of the 1859 Act. For this reason, senior state counsel was constrained to argue that Parliament must have, in s 43 of the 1968 Act, empowered the courts to do what they could have done if s 1 of the 1859 Act had been retained as part of or together with s 3 of the 1885 Act. I cannot accept an argument which requires me to convert what was probably an inadvertence (ie the repeal of s 1 of the 1859 Act) into an intention of Parliament to transfer the machinery into s 43 of the 1968 Act.
The argument of circuitous reference between the expression `extradition treaty` and `foreign State` is, in my view, confused and confusing. Senior state counsel, by interpolating the definition of the second expression into the definition of the first expression, reads `extradition treaty` to mean, in his words, `a treaty or agreement made by Singapore with (a foreign state between which and Singapore an extradition treaty is in force) relating to the extradition of fugitives`. It is then argued that the circuitous requirement (of a treaty or agreement) can never be fulfilled as Singapore and that foreign State must first have an extradition treaty in force. In my view, this approach to the construction of a defined expression in a section (or, as here, in a definition) is of doubtful validity. In 
 No 20 Cannon St v Singer & Friedlander 
 [1974] Ch 229 at p 240 Megarry J said: 
 
... I do not think that statutory definitions require you bodily to substitute the definitions for the words defined so as to enable you as a matter of grammar to treat words in the definitions as being antecedents of words actually appearing later in the statutory provision. The definitions explain what the expressions mean in the statutory provision, but they remain outside that provision and for grammatical purposes leave unchanged in the provision the actual words that are there, even though they have become freighted with their statutory meanings. At all events, with no authority to assist me on the point, that is what appears to me to be the principle.
 
 
 
In the context of the instant case, I am of the view that counsel has dressed up his arguments as one of circuity and absurdity when it amounted to no more than saying that the statutory definition of `extradition treaty` is tautologous. The definition may be slightly awkward because of its apparent tautology but it makes absolutely good sense. It should also be noted that the definition of `foreign State` itself as `a foreign State with ...` is also tautologous. It should have been `a foreign state with ...`, but notwithstanding, this definition also makes perfect sense. Furthermore, it is an inconsequential argument for these reasons: firstly, for the purpose of s 43(1), the relevant expression is `foreign state` and not `extradition treaty`. The latter expression does not appear in s 43(1). Secondly, even if the definition of `extradition treaty` becomes circuitous or absurd unless the expression `foreign State` therein refers to any sovereign state other than Singapore, then what follows is not that in the context of s 43 `foreign State` must mean a sovereign state other than Singapore, but that in the context of the definition of `extradition treaty` a `foreign State` has that meaning. The argument of senior state counsel on this point is a red herring.
In regard to the legislative history of s 43, the argument of senior state counsel runs as follows: although s 43 is indirectly derived from s 5 of the Extradition Act 1873, the expression `foreign state` in s 5 was not defined; therefore the meaning of the expression `foreign State` in s 43 of the 1968 Act should not in any way be affected by the meaning of the original expression. In my view, it is clear beyond doubt that the expression `foreign state` in s 5 of the 1873 Act meant any sovereign state other than the United Kingdom or any of the British Possessions. The 1873 Act was an integral part of the 1870 Act enacted to facilitate the extradition of fugitive offenders between the United Kingdom and the British Possessions on the one side and foreign states on the other side. Accordingly, the legislative history of s 43 supports the applicants` case rather than the reasoning of senior state counsel. There is one more bit of evidence which, in my view, concludes the point against senior state counsel. Both the first letters of the words `foreign state` in s 5 of the 1873 Act were enacted in the lower case. If, as senior state counsel appears to have suggested, the expression might have been referable to any country, whether a British Possession or otherwise, other than the United Kingdom itself, and that the Singapore Parliament had intended to adhere to that meaning, s 43 should have been enacted with those words in the same format. Instead, Parliament has intentionally used the first letter in the word `State` in the said expression in the capital case, consistently with the expression as statutorily defined. Since it has not been suggested that this is a printing error, it is, to my mind, the clearest evidence of the intention of Parliament.
Against the legislative background of the 1968 Act and the 1979 Act, there is, in my view, a simple if not obvious explanation for the wording of s 43 of the 1968 Act. It was enacted intentionally to apply to foreign States as defined because it was unnecessary to apply it to Commonwealth states, there being in existence at that time a statutory machinery for the same purpose.
I turn now to the alternative contention of senior state counsel that there is an extradition treaty as defined (ie including an agreement) between Singapore and Australia and therefore Australia is a foreign State. The argument here is that since Australia and Singapore have in turn given effect to the scheme by enacting uniform legislation and each has declared the other a Commonwealth country within the terms of its own legislation, an extradition agreement has been constituted between Singapore and Australia. This argument also has no merit. Firstly, senior state counsel has conceded that Singapore`s agreement to the scheme is not a binding agreement in a contractual sense. That being the case, there is no other basis for a binding agreement. Reciprocity need not be necessarily based on any prior binding agreement between the two countries. Secondly, even if there were an agreement between Australia and Singapore, it would not be an agreement for the purpose of the definition of `extradition treaty`. It is not disputed that the word `agreement` used as an alternative to the word `treaty` in the definition of extradition treaty refers to an agreement between states that creates obligations in international law and not under the domestic laws of the countries concerned. In other words, such an agreement has to be governed by international law as distinct from municipal law: see DP O`Connell, 
 International Law 
 at p 211. Therefore, the alternative argument must also fail.
 Ultra vires
The next ground of challenge to the validity of the authorization is that the Minister has acted ultra vires in delegating his power of appointing a magistrate (as defined) to the senior district judge. It is not disputed that the maxim delegatus non potest delegare applies to the exercise by the Minister of the power under s 43 of the 1968 Act. Senior state counsel contends however that the authorization was entirely proper as s 43 only requires the Minister to authorize a magistrate, ie any magistrate to take the evidence, which he has done, and that the nomination of another district judge by the senior district judge to take the evidence was an administrative act which was, in the circumstances, best left to the senior district judge to make as he was the administrative head of the subordinate courts and would know the best person to nominate. It is also suggested that so long as the Minister has authorized the taking of evidence, which he did, that would be sufficient to comply with s 43.
In my view, and here I also agree with counsel for the applicants, administrative efficiency or convenience is not a valid reason in law for the Minister or any decision-making body in whom a statutory power is vested to delegate such power. Secondly, s 43(1), unlike s 32AB of the 1966 Act (Australia), does not authorize the taking of evidence but a magistrate to take the evidence. Section 30 of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) prescribes the mode in which a power to appoint or name a person to have and to exercise any power may be effected. The Minister may either appoint that person by his name or by his office. In the instant case, the authorization was effectively in two parts. The first part appointed the senior district judge, which was entirely correct, as it was an appointment of a person by his office, there being only one such office. The second part appointed `such district judge or magistrate as you (the senior district judge) may nominate`. If the senior district judge had taken the evidence, the second part of the authorization would not have taken effect. But it took effect because the senior district judge nominated another district judge to take the evidence which the appointee proceeded to do until the proceedings were stayed by an order of this court. In my view, it is unarguable that on the facts the Minister did not make the appointment but the senior district judge did, in accordance with the direction of the Minister. This is not a case of the senior district judge recommending to the Minister the district judge to be appointed to take the evidence, and of the Minister accepting the recommendation and appointing the nominee. Accordingly, the Minister did delegate his power to make the appointment, which is not permitted by law.
For the above reasons, I am of the view that the authorization was bad in law on both the grounds advanced by counsel for the applicants. Accordingly, I allow this application with costs and order that the authorization be quashed.

Whether sentences appropriate
 
Teo Heng Chye, the accused, faced two charges before us. They were that he on or about 22 March 1985 at about 12.49am at Plaza Bowl, Textile Centre, 200 Jalan Sultan, Singapore: 
 
 
(1) did commit murder by causing the death of one Lim Nam Hoe and he had thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) and, 
 
(2) did commit murder by causing the death of one Koh Tong Kwee and he had thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
  
 
 
At the end of the prosecution`s case, we were of the view that the evidence led by the prosecution justified our calling upon the accused for his defence. We accordingly did so and he gave evidence but did not call any witnesses. After hearing his evidence and the submissions of his counsel and that of the deputy public prosecutor, we found him guilty of the lesser offence of culpable homicide under s 304(b) on each of the two charges of murder on which he was before us. After having heard his counsel`s plea of mitigation, we sentenced him to eight years` imprisonment on the first charge involving Lim and to six years` imprisonment on the second charge involving Koh. We also ordered the two sentences to run consecutively commencing from the date of his arrest, 22 March 1985. He now appeals against the sentences on the ground that they are manifestly excessive.
The evidence adduced before us showed that the charges arose out of events in the concourse of the Plaza Bowl shortly before 1am on the morning of 22 March 1985. The Plaza Bowl is a bowling alley in a building complex called the Textile Centre in Jalan Sultan, Singapore. A level above the Plaza Bowl and with easy access to and from it is an establishment called the Second Home Restaurant and Cocktail Lounge (the lounge), primarily a bar and nightclub.
On the evening of 21 March 1985, the accused had been drinking with some friends in the lounge. There was a confrontation between the accused and his friends on the one hand and another group of five customers at another table at the lounge on the other. A girlfriend of the accused, Miss Poh Peng Hoi, nicknamed `Siow Huay`, was with him. Among the events that took place between this group and the accused was an attempt by the group to turn the accused`s table over. A question was addressed by Koh (the second deceased who was nicknamed Ah Kwee) to the accused. The question was in Hokkien and a literal translation is, `Are you heavy enough?` In the jargon of frequenters of the lounge and perhaps other similar establishments, this question is virtually a challenge to a fight. Richard Sim (Sim), shareholder in the lounge, and a manager assisting him did their best to calm down the parties. According to Sim, Koh responded to Sim`s efforts, listened to him and calmed down.
There was also evidence that one person from each group later shook hands with the other. As a result of this confrontation, the accused asked Siow Huay to go and look for a friend of his called Richard Lee (Lee). Sim described Lee and the accused as close friends. Lee frequented the Plaza Bowl and lived in a room in a flat on the 18th level of the Textile Centre. The accused said he sent Siow Huay to summon Lee because some people were rushing towards him. The evidence also is that he asked Siow Huay to get into his car which she had earlier parked on the road beside the Textile Centre and to wait for him. According to her, the accused had told her that on locating Lee, she was to tell him he was upstairs, (ie in the lounge), that he had a `problem` there and to ask Lee to go up to the lounge. She met Lee in the bowling alley where he was at the tail end of a bowling game. She gave Lee the accused`s message, telling him he had a problem in the lounge and that he wanted Lee to go upstairs. Lee wanted to finish the bowling game he was playing before he went up. She then went to the accused`s car, drove it, did a U-turn and parked it on the far side of the road from the Textile Centre so that it faced North Bridge Road. This meant it could head towards North Bridge Road without having to make any turn. She remained waiting in the driver`s seat.
Whilst Sim and his manager were in the process of calming down the two groups, Lee, according to Sim, whom we believed, came up to the lounge. (The accused, however, said he went down and met Lee in the bowling alley concourse.) He stood beside the accused. Sim saw Lee whispering something to the accused but was unable to hear what was said. The accused and Lee then left the lounge. According to the accused, he told Lee that a group of people wanted to beat him up and the two of them went up to Lee`s flat, he going, according to him, because Lee told him, `Follow me.` In Lee`s flat, to which he had been a number of times before, Lee gave him an object which Lee got from a bathroom. The accused claimed not to know what it was but described it to us as an object with a wooden handle and with a sharp point at the other end. In fact, it was a bearing scraper. He described the object as similar to the exhibit tendered by the prosecution as the weapon used to inflict injuries on Lim and Koh. This bearing scraper was in fact handed over to the police by the accused.
The accused and Lee came down in the lift and went towards the concourse of the bowling alley. In the meantime, Sim had continued pacifying Koh and his friends and advising them that it was best they left the place. They accepted his advice and on the way out, Koh in fact shook hands with Danny Tan, who earlier had been in the accused`s company at his table in the lounge. Sim followed Koh and his four friends, one of whom was Lim. Another friend of Koh`s, Goh Meng Hua (nicknamed Ah Meng) was still unruly and Sim was trying to pacify him when they were in the concourse of the bowling alley on their way out. It was at this point that Sim saw the accused coming up the staircase towards the concourse of the bowling alley. Anticipating a further problem, Sim opened the door and rushed towards the accused. He told him, `Everything has already been settled. Why are you here?` Unfortunately, Sim tripped and fell down the staircase, losing his glasses in the course of doing so. Whilst on the floor, he heard the footsteps of more than one person going up the staircase towards the bowling alley. He recovered himself and entered the concourse. He heard the accused say in Hokkien words to the effect of, `You want to know how heavy I am`. This is jargon for `you can have a try`. This was addressed to Lim, Koh and his three friends.
Ah Meng was still unruly and Sim made a further effort to pacify him. Things happened very fast after this with people running around and next, Sim saw Koh going towards the accused, wanting to land a punch on him. When he turned round from pacifying Ah Meng, Koh was on the verge of collapsing and soon after that, Lim also collapsed. There was then in Sim`s graphic words, `A sudden pause, silence, sudden silence. Everything was somewhat like a standstill and when I looked at the accused, he was standing there holding something in his hand`. Giving evidence on this point, Sim raised his right hand to his shoulder to show the level at which the accused`s hand was. It was also gripping something. Sim identified the object as something like the bearing scraper tendered in evidence. In the course of the melee, the two deceased were severely injured. The evidence is that Lee had no weapon which could inflict the injuries of the type found on the deceased. Further, the serious injuries on each were in the unchallenged opinion of Dr Wee Keng Poh, forensic pathologist of the Singapore General Hospital, consistent with those caused by the bearing scraper produced in evidence.
The bearing scraper was throughout the time from the accused leaving Lee`s flat till he handed it over to the police at the CID in the accused`s possession. The accused and Lee then went to the ground level of the Textile Centre and crossed the road to where Siow Huay was waiting in the accused`s car. The accused`s walk was unsteady and he needed Lee`s assistance. En route, the accused had greeted a person called Allan Lee and wished him good night. The accused sat in the front seat of his car. Siow Huay was in the driver`s seat and Lee in the back seat. According to the accused, he told Siow Huay to go to the CID. This was because, according to him, in the car he realized his hand was stained with blood and he knew he had fought with someone and he desired to make a report. On the way to the CID, Lee asked that he be dropped off. Before leaving the car, he told the accused not to implicate him in whatever he told the police and that he was to take responsibility for what happened. To this, the accused`s response was that he was a gentleman. Lee has not been heard of since but according to the information of the investigating officer, he is in prison in Taiwan on a murder-cum-kidnapping charge.
The police evidence is that at the CID, the accused told the policemen that he wanted to make a report but in his evidence he could not recall having said this. In many ways, in his evidence, he seemed to be able to recall all facts that were neutral or favourable to him but not facts which were unfavourable, attributing this to inability to recall or lack of knowledge. This, he claimed, resulted from his being `tipsy` or `shocked`. At the CID, he handed to the police the bearing scraper he had brought with him from the Plaza Bowl.
He had been drinking in the lounge and the evidence is that he was under the influence of liquor but our finding was that his intoxication was self-induced, not rendering him insane at the relevant time and not to the extent required by s 85(2) of the Penal Code to constitute a defence to a criminal charge. However, we were of the view that the degree of intoxication was such that it should be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the accused had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty of the charges he faced as provided in s 86(2) of the Penal Code.
On the facts we decided that the degree of intoxication was such that he could not have formed any of the intentions required for murder. We were, however, of the view that his actions were done with the knowledge that they are likely to cause death and, giving him the benefit of every doubt, without any intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death. In view of this, we found him guilty under s 304(b) of the Penal Code on each of the two charges that he faced. We sentenced him to eight years` imprisonment for the culpable homicide of Lim and to six years` imprisonment of the culpable homicide of Koh.
In determining sentence, we had regard to all the facts of the case, the fact that the intoxication was self-induced and the nature of the respective injuries on each deceased. We also took into account the fact that the accused of his own volition went immediately to the CID after the attack on the two deceased. This last fact carried only a little weight as a mitigating factor. The accused was a frequent patron and was well known to the management and other customers at both the Plaza Bowl and the lounge. There were eye witnesses to his earlier confrontation with the deceaseds` group in the lounge and to the attacks he made on the deceased persons. He must have realized that it was virtually impossible for the arm of the law not to reach him before very long. Further, he agreed not to implicate Lee, his accomplice, to give him the most innocent label.
In considering all the facts of the case, we took into account Sim`s successful efforts at pacifying the other group and getting them to go away whereas the accused with the help of his good friend, Lee, went with him to the latter`s flat and came down to the concourse of the bowling alley with the bearing scraper. The accused could easily have remained in his flat or got away from Textile Centre. The inference is irresistible that the accused came back with Lee to resume the confrontation, now armed with the bearing scraper. This resulted in two deaths. As will appear hereafter, two of the three fatal wounds on Lim were on the back of his chest. So was the single fatal wound on Koh. This clearly shows each had his back to the accused when these wounds were inflicted by him.
We will now set out the injuries on the two deceased. According to Dr Wee, the wounds on the deceased Lim were as follows: 
 
 
(a) Five linear scratches, punctures and abrasions on the head. 
 
(b) A superficial stab wound cutting only the posterior muscles of the chest wall. 
 
(c) A triangular shaped stab wound in the left lower anterolateral chest wall with tips measuring 2.2 by 2 by 2 cm. It was 101/2 cm deep. It penetrated the full thickness of the left anterolateral chest wall into the leural cavity through the sixth rib and the sixth intercostal muscles, cutting through the left diaphragm into the left lobe of the liver. The direction of the wound was from front to back, downwards and medially. 
 
(d) A stab wound on the right upper chest wall, triangular in shape with tips measuring 2 by 2 by 2 cm and 11 cm in depth. It penetrated the posterior muscles of the chest into the right pleural cavity through the posterior border of the right fourth rib and cutting the right lower lobe of the lung. In direction, it was back to front, downwards and medially. 
 
(e) A triangular shaped stab wound in the lower right posterolateral chest wall below the level of the shoulder tip. It was 13 cm deep and penetrated the full thickness of the right lower posterolateral chest wall into the right pleural cavity through the ninth rib and right diaphragm and into the right lobe of the liver. In direction, this injury too was on the back, going towards the front, downwards and medially.
  
 
 
In the opinion of Dr Wee, any one of the three injuries (c), (d) and (e) was sufficient by itself in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. It was also Dr Wee`s opinion that the three fatal wounds on Lim could have been by the bearing scraper produced as an exhibit.
The injuries on the deceased Koh were as follows: 
 
 
(a) 1/2 cm diameter circular puncture wound on right forehead. 
 
(b) A small laceration and two scratch abrasions on various parts of the face. 
 
(c) A stab wound 2 cm by 1 cm and 3 cm deep cutting the skin and floor of the left side of the jaw with no penetration into the mouth. This wound was back to front, upwards and towards the middle. 
 
(d) Slash wound on left shoulder 41/2 cm deep and 11/2 cm wide. This wound cut the skin and the muscles of the left-shoulder tip. 
 
(e) A stab wound on the back of the left mid-chest wall. This wound penetrated the chest wall into the left pleural cavity through the posterior segment of the fifth rib cutting the thoracic aorta at a tangent and the left lower lobe of the lung near the apex into the hilum of the left lung. It also cut into the left pulmonary artery at the base of the pericardial sac. This wound ran from back to front medially and slightly downwards.
  
 
 
The last listed wound (e) was described by Dr Wee as the fatal wound. It was also Dr Wee`s opinion that this fatal wound on Koh could have been caused by the bearing scraper produced as an exhibit.
Besides the factors stated earlier, the nature of the injuries and the principal ones being inflicted on the respective backs of Lim and Koh warranted the sentences of eight years and six years respectively. In our view, the repeated stabbings producing three fatal injuries on Lim justified the eight-year sentence in respect of Lim compared to the six-year sentence in respect of Koh who received only one fatal wound.
The next question that arose was whether the sentences were to run consecutively or concurrently. Undoubtedly, the two deaths were the result of `a series of acts as to form the same transaction`. It was this that led him, under s 170(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, to be tried at one trial for both offences. The Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code give no direct guidance as to consecutive and concurrent sentences. That the High Court has jurisdiction to make sentences for convictions for different offences at the same trial consecutively cannot be challenged (see s 17 and 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code).
The only Singapore case where the principles involved in consecutive and concurrent sentences is 
 Marimuthu Balikrishnan v PP 
 
 
 
[1974] 2 MLJ 145
 . The appellant in that case was convicted by the district court of two offences under the Firearms and Ammunition (Unlawful Possession) Act (Cap 100, 1970 Ed). The learned Chief Justice upheld the district judge`s sentence of three years` imprisonment on each charge to run consecutively. On appeal, it was argued that the appellant took out the gun and five rounds of ammunition from the same place and sold them to a police officer acting as agent provocateur. The learned Chief Justice held that the consecutive sentences were not wrong in principle. In effect, he dismissed the appellant counsel`s submission that the two offences arose out of the same transaction and instead considered the appropriateness of totality of the sentences. This latter principle was the principle used in the case of 
 R v Faulkner 
 (1972) 56 Cr App R 594; [1972] Crim LR 577.
Whilst on general principle and on the particular facts of this case, we regarded consecutive sentences as appropriate, we also derived support for our view from the two illustrations to s 71 of the Penal Code. They read: 
 
 
(a) A gives Z 50 strokes with a stick. Here A may have committed the offence of voluntarily causing hurt to Z by the whole beating, and also by each of the blows which make up the whole beating. If A were liable to punishment for every blow, he might be imprisoned for 50 years, one for each blow. But he is liable only to one punishment for the whole beating. 
 
(b) But if, while A is beating Z, Y interferes and A intentionally strikes Y, here, as the blow given to Y is no part of the act whereby A voluntarily causes hurt to Z, A is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to Z, and to another for the blow given to Y.
  
 
 
Both illustrations deal with multiple occurrences of the same offence. The distinguishing factor between the two illustrations is that in illus (a) although there are 50 offences and they take place in the same transaction, there is one victim. In illus (b) on the other hand, there is still one transaction but there are two victims of the accused on whom he voluntarily caused hurt. The illustration provides that the accused is liable to one punishment for voluntarily causing hurt to one victim and to another for the blow given to the other victim. This clearly means consecutive sentences. In our view, illus (b) to s 71 is applicable to the case before us. In view of this, we made the two offences run consecutively.
On the use of illustrations in statutes, we need only refer to two Privy Council cases. The first is an appeal from Penang, then part of the Straits Settlements, and concerns the Evidence Ordinance (now Act). In 
 Mahomed Syedol Ariffin v Yeoh Ooi Gark 
 
[1916] 2 AC 575
 at p 581, the Judicial Committee said that: 
 
... it is the duty of a court of law to accept, if that can be done, the illustrations given as being both of relevance and value in the construction of the text. The illustrations should in no case be rejected because they do not square with ideas possibly derived from another system of jurisprudence as to the law with which they or the sections deal. And it would require a very special case to warrant their rejection on the ground of their assumed repugnancy to the sections themselves. It would be the very last resort of construction to make any such assumption. The great usefulness of the illustrations, which have, although not part of the sections, been expressly furnished by the legislature as helpful in the working and application of the statute, should not be thus impaired.
 
 
 
In the other case, 
 Lala Balla Mal v Ahad Shah 
 AIR 1918 PC 249, the Judicial Committee was even more direct and brief. This was an appeal from India and turned on interpretation of the Contract Act. At p 250 (right column), the Judicial Committee said: `Four illustrations (to s 16) are given. These are to be taken as part of the statute.`
We also considered the totality of the two sentences which is 14 years. In this, we were following the words of the Lord Chief Justice of England in 
 R v Faulkner 
 (1972) 56 Cr App R 594 at p 596 where he said, `However, at the end of the day, as one always must, one looks at the totality and asks whether it was too much.`
We asked ourselves this question and felt that having regard to all the facts of the case as referred to by us, the totality of 14 years was not `too much` and in our view, entirely appropriate. Our order was that the sentences were to run from the date of arrest of the accused, 22 March 1985.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal by the plaintiffs against the decision of the district judge dismissing the plaintiffs` claim against the defendant for damages for personal injuries suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of a collision between a pick-up van No GF 6713Y driven by the defendant and a motorcycle No AZ 3705 ridden by the second plaintiff with the first plaintiff as pillion rider.
The collision occurred along Clementi Road on 28 August 1982 at about 4.30pm near the entrance to Ngee Ann Technical College (NATC). At that junction, Clementi Road was a dual carriageway with three lanes going towards Bukit Timah Road and the other three lanes going in the opposite direction. Both the second plaintiff and the defendant reported the accident separately to the traffic police a few hours after the accident. The second plaintiff`s report was as follows: 
 
On 28 August 1982 at about 1630 hours at Clementi Road, I was riding my motorcycle carrying one pillion (tel: 4684659), at a speed of about 60 km/h, travelling at the left lane of the road behind a pick-up GF 6713 when it turned without giving signal and I could not avoid but collided onto the front left side of the pickup.
 
 
 
The motorcycle fell and my pillion was injured. Ambulance conveyed us to Alexandra Hospital. Nobody was injured in the pick-up. The pick-up was dented slightly on the left front part. No rain and visibility clear. That is all.
The defendant`s report was as follows: 
 
On 28 August 1982 at about 4.15pm, I am driving along Clementi Road intending to make a left turn to Ngee Ann College. Whilst driving, before I made a left turn to Ngee Ann College, I switched on my left signal indicator, suddenly a motorcycle AZ 3705C came on my left side, whilst I was about to turn, the said motorcycle grazed onto the left side of my motor pick-up. As a result the motorcyclist`s pillion was injured, on the hand and right leg. My motor pick-up left side was damaged, the side mirror broken.
 
 
 
At the trial, the testimony of the second plaintiff was substantially the same as what he had said in his police report save for the elaboration that the traffic was moderate and that the pick-up van was travelling in the middle lane of the three-lane road going towards Bukit Timah Road when the van turned suddenly into the entrance into NATC. He also said that he was not trying to overtake the van and that he could not remember which part of the van he collided into. He was asked to mark (which he did) the point of impact with an `X` on the police sketch plan of the scene of accident. The first plaintiff, in his testimony, corroborated the evidence of the second plaintiff. He remembered seeing a blue shadow suddenly moving across the path of the motor-cycle.
The defendant testified that when he was approaching NATC, he signalled, looked at the rear view mirror and then turned left into the entrance to NATC, that as he was doing so, the motorcycle collided into his van. He also said that before he made the turn, he was travelling on the innermost left lane. Under cross-examination, he claimed (a) that he was travelling on this lane all the way after turning into Clementi Road from Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim; (2) that he switched on the indicator light about four to five car lengths from the entrance into NATC; (3) that on looking at his rear mirror he saw a motor car, but not the motorcycle, behind him travelling in the same lane; and (4) that he did not look at the left wing side mirror before he turned. The defendant had two passengers in his car at the time of the accident. One of them appeared as a witness to testify (1) that the van had travelled for about two miles on the extreme left lane whilst keeping to the centre of the lane; and (2) that the defendant did signal before turning left into NATC as he heard a `tick tick` sound.
At the end of the trial, the district judge found that the defendant was not negligent and that the second plaintiff was wholly to blame for the collision. In his grounds of decision, he gave the following reasons for his finding: 
 
The plaintiffs and defendant told conflicting stories. Each party was trying to put the blame on the other. In order to verify the evidence the court had to rely on evidence such as the police report. The second plaintiff stated in his report that he was travelling on the left lane of the road behind a pick-up GF 6713Y. The vehicle turned without giving signal. The defendant said that while he was about to turn the motorcycle grazed his left side. He had switched on his left indicator.
 
 
 
From the above it clearly showed that the second plaintiff was following behind the defendant. Both he and the defendant were travelling on the left lane. While the defendant was turning the plaintiff must have grazed him and then landed in the position marked `M`. There was a scratch mark leading to position `M`. The second plaintiff confirmed under cross-examination that the collision took place at the point marked `X`. Obviously, the second plaintiff was trying to overtake the defendant on the left side. From the point of impact and the scratch mark the collision could not have happened in the way described by the second plaintiff, otherwise on a head to side collision the motorcycle would remain at the point of collision. This confirmed that the defendant did not suddenly swerve left from the centre lane to the left lane as alleged by the second plaintiff. Hence, the second plaintiff was the sole cause of the accident. He must have tried to overtake the defendant who was turning to its left, then grazed the defendant`s vehicle and landed on point marked `M`.
Counsel for the plaintiffs have submitted that the findings of fact of the district judge were inferential findings and that he was in error in making such findings. It is well established that an appellate court will not normally disturb the findings of fact of the trial judge based upon an evaluation of the oral testimonies of the parties and their witnesses as he is a far better position to assess their credibility having seen and heard them. However, where the findings of fact on which the decision is based are themselves inferences from primary facts, the appellate court `is in as good a position, or as bad a position, as the trial judge to form a view as to what happened`(per Thomson CJ in 
 Foong Yit Yoon v Yap Tiam & Anor 
 
[1963] MLJ 104
 at p 108).
Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted before me that the district judge`s finding that the defendant was not negligent was based not on his assessment of the truth or otherwise of the parties who gave evidence, he being unable to come to any conclusion as to whom to believe, but primarily on inferences drawn from the police reports of the second plaintiff and the defendant.
I agree. The extract I have quoted from the trial judge`s grounds of decision shows that the findings of the trial judge upon which he found the second plaintiff was solely to blame for the collision were as follows: (1) the pick-up van was on the extreme left lane of the road and the second plaintiff was following it on the same lane; (2) the collision occurred at the point `X` on the sketch plan as marked by the second plaintiff; (3) from the point of impact and the scratch mark leading to the final position of the motorcycle, `M`, the collision could not have happened in the way described by the second plaintiff, ie on a head to side collision, as the motorcycle would have stopped dead at the point of collision; in other words, it was not a head to side collision; (4) from this, it would follow that the motorcycle must have been trying to overtake the pick-up van; and (5) therefore the van did not suddenly swerve left from the centre lane.
Every single finding of fact set out above is an inferential fact. This court is therefore in as good a position as the trial judge to assess the correctness of these findings of fact. The trial judge did not believe the second plaintiff`s version of how the collision occurred primarily because it could not have occurred in the manner described by him having regard to the point of impact as marked by him on the police sketch plan. In my view, the trial judge was wrong in accepting as correct the point of impact as marked by the second plaintiff. The trial judge should have, in the light of the other objective evidence, considered whether the second plaintiff`s account was consistent with the other objective evidence. The second plaintiff obviously had a faint recollection of an event which had occurred more than five years earlier. This is proved by his candid admission in his evidence in chief that he could not even remember where his motorcycle had collided into the pick-up van.
To make it easier to follow my analysis, I annex hereto a copy of the sketch plan. In my view, the point marked `X` could not be the point of impact because it is well beyond the point at which the van was damaged. According to the report of the traffic police who inspected the scene of the accident as well as the two vehicles immediately after the accident, the pick-up van was damaged in three places, viz (1) the front rearside door dented; (2) front rearside bumper dented; and (3) rearside wing mirror dented. It must therefore follow that the point of impact was at a spot before the spot marked `X`. The position of the van as shown in the sketch plan merely showed its position after and not before the collision. The van had come to a stop after the collision but it is a scientific fact that no moving force like a motor vehicle in motion can stop dead unless it meets an irresistable force, even if its brakes are 100% effective. The second plaintiff`s marking should have been rejected as an obvious error. It follows that the second plaintiff`s description that the collision was a head to side collision was consistent with the objective evidence. In fact, and this was also ignored by the district judge, the defendant in his police report had also, like the second plaintiff, made a tick against the printed description `head to side` collision.
On this basis, how did the collision occur? It could only have happened if the van turned into the path of the motorcycle. That this was how the accident occurred was confirmed by all the witnesses including the parties to the action. The question is whether the second plaintiff attempted to overtake the defendant, as found by the district judge, or whether the defendant turned his van suddenly into the entrance of NATC.
In my view, any finding on this is dependent on the relative probabilities of the testimonies of the parties and their witnesses in the light of such other objective evidence as may be relevant. At the entrance to NATC, the width of the three-lane road was 3.90m. The width of the van was 1.60m. The motorcycle was not measured but its width must have been one to two feet. If, as was alleged by the defendant`s witness, the van had been travelling in the centre of the left lane all the way from Jalan lbrahim up to the point of collision, that would leave to a vehicle following the van a free passageway between the curb of the road and the van of about 1.15m. Therefore, if the second plaintiff had been trying to overtake the van, he was doing an extremely hazardous and reckless act. There is no basis for coming to this conclusion. If he had wanted to overtake, it would have been easier and safer to overtake on one of the other two outer lanes.
However, the district judge in effect came to this conclusion by finding that the defendant was travelling on his innermost left lane because the second plaintiff had stated in his police report that prior to the accident, he was travelling behind the van. This inference is not irresistible. If X says that he is travelling on the left lane behind Y who says that he is travelling on the left lane, both X and Y would be travelling on the left lane if both are found to be telling the truth. In this case, the second plaintiff testified that the defendant was travelling in the centre lane. The defendant, of course, denied this and said that he was travelling on the left lane. But, the district judge made no finding as to who was telling the truth. He merely inferred from these two statements that both the second plaintiff and the defendant were travelling on the same lane.
Now, of course, the word `behind` is ambiguous when used to describe, without more, a vehicle following another vehicle on a road with more than one lane going in the same direction. In the present case, it was used by an English speaking constable in interpreting the words of the second plaintiff spoken in a different language. In court, the second plaintiff had explained what he meant when he testified that he was behind the van which was travelling in the centre lane. There is no inconsistency between this statement and what he had said in his police report. The district judge should have made a finding as to where the defendant was travelling just before the collision.
What then was the probability, on the evidence of the defendant having been travelling on the innermost left lane as he had alleged? Here, the district judge has failed to take into account the evidence of the defendant on a related point. The defendant admitted that when he looked at the rear mirror he never saw the motorcycle. There are only two possible reasons to explain why he did not see the motorcycle. The first is that he never looked into the rear mirror at all before turning. The second is that he looked but since the motorcycle was travelling on his left, he could not see the second plaintiff. If the first explanation is correct, the defendant was lying. If the second explanation is correct, the more probable inference would be that the defendant was then travelling on the centre lane and the second plaintiff on the inner lane. That would explain why the defendant never saw the motorcycle. In my view, that is certainly a more probable explanation than to infer that the second plaintiff was doing a dangerous act by riding side by side the defendant`s motorvan and trying to overtake the defendant.
For these reasons, I have come to the conclusion that the correct inference to draw from the evidence was that, on a balance of probabilities, the defendant had suddenly swerved left from the middle lane into the entrance of NATC and caused the second plaintiff to collide into the van. In my view, the defendant was in breach of r 74 of the Highway Code. He was wholly to blame for the accident.
The appeal is allowed with costs here and below. There will be judgment for the plaintiffs. As the trial judge has not assessed damages, I remit the case back to him for such assessment.

In December 1982, one Ng Tian Hock, the plaintiff in Suit No 2241 of 1984 (Suit 2241) was lawfully riding motor cycle AZ 961OG together with one Tan Seou Geok as the pillion rider along Sims Avenue East in the direction of Changi Road when they met with an accident with motor car ER 6822B which was being driven by one Ng Swee Kin, the defendant in Suit 2241, along Sims Avenue East in the direction of Changi Road. The plaintiff commenced legal proceedings against the defendant (Suit 2241) on 10 April 1984 for damages for personal injuries and consequential loss suffered by him caused by the negligence of the defendant in the driving of the said motor car along Sims Avenue East on or about 7 December 1982. The plaintiff alleged that the said accident was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant, the particulars of which were set out in para 2 of the statement of claim.
On 22 May 1984, the said pillion rider, Tan Seou Geok, started an action, Suit No 3292 of 1984 (Suit 3292), against both the driver of the said motor vehicle and the rider of the said motor cycle for damages for personal injuries and consequential loss suffered by her and caused by the negligence of the first defendant in the driving of the said motor car and by the negligence of the second defendant in the riding of the said motor cycle or alternatively by the negligence of one or other of them in the driving of their respective vehicles along Sims Avenue East on or about 7 December 1982.
On a summons-for-directions heard on 29 October 1984, it was ordered that the action in Suit 2241 be consolidated with the action in Suit 3292. The consolidated suit came on for hearing before me on 4 and 5 July 1988 and on 11 and 18 November 1989. During the course of the hearing before me, it was agreed by counsel for the parties in the consolidated action that I was only to deal with the question of liability in the consolidated action and that on my finding on the question of liability, the matter would then stand referred to the registrar on the question of the assessment of damages, it having been agreed by all counsel that all or any of the evidence recorded by me on the question of damages would go before the registrar and would be treated by him as if such evidence had been recorded by and before him. It was further agreed that, if necessary, the parties were to be at liberty to adduce further evidence before the registrar on the question of damages. At the end of the hearing before me, I reserved judgment on liability.
The evidence of the plaintiff in Suit 2241 (hereinafter referred to as the rider) with regard to the accident was as follows: 
 
On 7 December 1982, I was riding my motor cycle AZ9610G. I had Miss Tan Seou Geok as my pillion rider (identified). We were on our way to Changi from Jalan Eunos for supper. This was after midnight. As I was travelling along Sims Avenue East, I was involved in an accident. Sims Avenue East is a one-way road. It has four lanes. Road surface was dry. Visibility was good. Street lights were on. We were not in a hurry. I was in the first lane on the left, close to second lane. We were travelling at about 40-50 miles per hour. Traffic was light. No other vehicles on the road other than mine.
 
 
 
While I was travelling on a straight course, I was suddenly hit from behind by something. That was the first impact I knew. At that time I did not know what hit me. As a result of the collision, my motor cycle and I fell down. My motor cycle fell down first. I fell on the road. My head hit the road and I became unconscious.
The defendant in Suit 2241, (hereinafter referred to as the car driver), in his examination-in-chief, testified as follows: 
 
On 7 December 1982 at 12.45am, I was travelling along Sims Avenue towards Upper Changi Road. I was the driver of ER6822. I was alone. No passenger. The weather was dry. No rain and visibility was good. The street was well lit and traffic was light. After passing the traffic lights at Jalan Eunos, my car was involved in a collision with a motor cycle AZ9610.
 
 
 
Q: How did this collision occur?
 
 
 
A: When I started from the junction of Jalan Eunos and Sims Avenue East I was in the second lane from the left. When I had travelled 100m from the junction, there was a car on my left on the first lane. That car was driving very slowly. At that moment, when I tried to overtake the car I beard a noise of a collision between a motor cycle and my car. That motor cycle had tried to overtake the same car that I had tried to overtake by squeezing through the car on my left and my car. That resulted in the collision between my car and the motor cycle. At that moment I was quite shocked. It happened so suddenly. So when I stopped my car, I saw two persons lying on the road in front of my car. At that moment I drove my car to my left and parked it at the junction of Lorong Sarina and Sims Drive.
 
 
 
The car driver further stated: 
 
Other than the car on the left, I saw no other vehicle either in front or behind. I did not see the motor cyclist that was involved in this collision. There were some other vehicles behind me which stopped at the junction and when I moved off they started to move. I did not see the motor cycle. It was not in front of me. I did not see the motor cycle just prior to the accident. The point of contact between my car and the motor cycle is between the front left of my car and the right side of the motor cycle. I was travelling at 50 kmph. The car on my left was travelling at a speed slower than that of mine.
 
 
 
Cross-examined by Mr Chellam, the car driver stated: 
 
I stopped at the junction about 100m from the scene of accident. I did not pay much attention if there was a motor cycle at the junction. There were few vehicles at the junction. I did not pay much attention as to whether the slow-moving car on my left was at the junction. Obviously this slow-moving car must have come from Jalan Eunos as I did not see it at the junction. As I left the junction, I was the first vehicle to leave. The other vehicles were following me behind. I was travelling faster than the others. Between the junction and the scene of accident, I did not notice the motor cycle. As I was on my way straight on my second lane after getting off from the junction, I saw the slow-moving vehicle turning left into Sims Avenue from jalan Eunos but I did not see the motor cycle.
 
 
 
He further testified (1) that the motor cycle fell in front of his vehicle on his left; (2) that the rider and pillion rider were thrown a few feet in front of his car towards the right; (3) that when he was travelling on the second lane there was no car by his side on his right; (4) that the motor cycle cut into his lane and in the course of overtaking the slow car on his left struck him on the left front side of his car; (5) that after the accident the motor cycle was in front on his left and the injured persons were in front from the right.
The evidence of the police sergeant (PW2) was to the effect that the motor cycle had fallen on its right and that part of the damage to it was due to the collision and other due to the fall of the motor cycle and that the only damage to the car was to its front left and that there was no damage to the car to its front centre or to its front right.
I find it difficult to believe the evidence of the car driver. His story that the accident occurred when he (in the second lane) was passing the slow-moving vehicle (in the first lane) and the motor cycle at the same time was trying to squeeze past him and the slow-moving vehicle does not, on the evidence as deposed, seem possible. His evidence is that as he was moving off ahead of all other traffic from the traffic light junction at Sims Avenue East and Jalan Eunos, he saw the slow-moving vehicle turning left into Sims Avenue East from Jalan Eunos (but he did not see the motor cycle). According to him, he was travelling much faster than the slow-moving vehicle. If this were so, he would have been well ahead of the slow-moving vehicle when it had fully turned left and entered Sims Avenue East from Jalan Eunos. The scene of the accident was 100m from the said traffic light junction. By the time the car driver travelled the said 100m, he would have been several metres ahead of the slow-moving vehicle and so it would not have been possible for the accident to have occurred in the manner deposed to by the car driver.
I accept the evidence of the rider that he was hit from behind by the car driver. It seems to me that the accident occurred because the car driver was not keeping a proper lookout. I therefore find that it was a total lack of care on the part of the car driver that caused the accident. I therefore enter interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff in Suit 2241 on the basis that the car driver, the defendant, was wholly to blame for the accident.
So far as the pillion rider is concerned, there has been no suggestion by any of the two defendants in Suit 3292 that she was to blame in any way for the accident. There will therefore be an interlocutory judgment for the plaintiff in Suit 3292 against the first defendant on the basis that he is fully responsible for the accident. The consolidated action will now stand remitted to the registrar for him to assess damages suffered by the plaintiffs in both actions. Costs in Suit 2241 to the plaintiff and to be paid by the defendant. Costs in Suit 3292 to the plaintiff and to be paid by the first defendant. There will be no order as to costs for the second defendant. There will be no order on the question of interest.
 Order accordingly.",1989-11-30 00:00:00,SG High Court

This is an appeal by the appellants against a decision of the High Court where the appellants were ordered to pay damages totalling $2,590,729 plus costs, to the respondents on two distinct bases. The first was pursuant to a cross- undertaking given by the appellants to the court on the grant on 9 December 1981 of an interim injunction and the second was for losses suffered by the respondents pursuant to certain alleged malicious falsehood uttered by the appellants in two letters to the Ministry of National Development.
This action was instituted by the appellants to restrain the respondents from encroaching on the appellants` land. An interim injunction obtained by the appellants against the respondents, was partially discharged subject to a condition. Following that the appellants wrote two letters to the Ministry of National Development which formed the subject of the counterclaim of the respondents.
The main grounds advanced by the appellants to challenge the High Court`s decision to award damages against the appellants on the cross-undertaking was that the learned trial judge has failed to correctly appreciate the facts. Highly relevant facts have been overlooked or glossed over. He has also failed to give adequate consideration to the reasons set out in the affidavits filed in support of the interim application. As regards the counterclaim based on malicious falsehood, the appellants contended that nothing in the two letters were false; far less was there any malice. The trial judge has read the letters in a manner which is not warranted.
Accordingly, this appeal turns on a proper consideration of the facts. Therefore, it is essential that we should first set out the pertinent facts. This we now do.
 Background to the case 
Both the appellants and the respondents were housing developers. They were at the relevant time the owners of three adjoining pieces of land - lot 104-1, lot 103-6 and lot 103-5 pt (which was subsequently renumbered lot 634), all of town subdivision XXVIII. These lands were situated along Newton Road. Lot 104-1 was landlocked and had no direct access to Newton Road except by way of a right of way of 51/2 m wide through lot 103-6. The relative positions of the three lots are shown in exhs D12A and 12B.
The respondents became the owners of lot 104-1 in 1975. In 1977, the respondents embarked on a project to develop the land into a condominium. Plans were submitted to the Development Control Division of the Public Works Department of the Ministry of National Development. Soon thereafter the respondents commenced construction works on the land.
The appellants bought lot 103-6 from the previous owner, Tan Kiem Tie Pte Ltd (TKT) in December 1979. Prior to this date the respondents negotiated with TKT to enlarge the width of the right of way over lot 103-6. This resulted in the execution of a deed between TKT and the respondents dated 10 November 1979, under which the right of way over lot 103-6 was enlarged from 51/2 m to 11 m from point A to point B as shown in exhs D12A and 12B. Point A was the beginning point of the right of way and point B was the point at which it was thought that this access roadway would meet the proposed widened Newton Road, as will be elaborated in the next paragraph. The respondents also covenanted to construct the extended roadway at their own expense.
Lot 103-5 abuts on Newton Road. In 1976, it was acquired by the government for the widening of Newton Road. It appears that subsequently the government changed its mind as to the extent of lot 103-5 which it would require for road widening. As a result, lot 103-5 was sub-divided into two separate lots, known as lot 634 and lot 635. Only lot 635 was required for road-widening. For convenience, lot 634 will hereinafter continue to be referred to by its previous number, lot 103-5 pt.
Also in December 1979, the appellants approached the Land Office offering to purchase from the government lot 103-5 pt (which government no longer required for road-widening) so that they could amalgamate it with lot 103-6 for a comprehensive development project. In August 1980, the Land Office replied indicating its in principle approval of the alienation of the lot to the appellants. The title to the lot was eventually transferred to the appellants on 25 April 1981.
In the meantime the respondents proceeded with their development quite unaware that the government had decided not to widen Newton Road to the full extent of lot 103-5. It was only in September 1980 that the respondents learned through their consulting engineers, Messrs Houkehua Consulting Engineers, that part of the previous lot 103-5 (now lot 634) had been acquired by the appellants from the government. This turn of events had a direct impact on the respondents. This would mean that the 11 m access roadway proposed for lot 104-1 had to be extended beyond point B for it to meet Newton Road. To do that the respondents would require a right of way over a portion of lot 103-5 pt in order to enable them to construct the 11 m roadway all the way out to the revised Newton roadline.
Consequently, the respondents approached the Land Office on 13 September 1980 offering to purchase that portion of lot 103-5 which would enable them to so construct the 11-metre roadway right up to the revised roadline of Newton Road. On 27 November 1980, the Land Office informed the respondents that lot 103-5 pt had already been alienated to the appellants. It suggested to the respondents to negotiate with the appellants to secure the access the former required. Following that, the respondents wrote to the Building Control Division. At about the same time on 9 December 1980, the respondents also wrote to the appellants with a view to acquiring a right of way over that portion of lot 103-5 pt in order to construct the 11-metre roadway. On 22 December 1980, the appellants gave an interim reply to the respondents saying that the matter had been referred to their architects and they would revert to the respondents in due course.
According to the evidence at the hearing and which was accepted by the trial judge, soon after the receipt of the letter of 22 December 1980, Mr Wong Kim Chan (Wong), the respondents` director and general manager, spoke to one Mr John Lai (Lai) of the appellants over the telephone and the latter informed the former that the appellants were considering the respondents` proposal to purchase the required portion of lot 103-5 pt. Wong was also informed that the appellants were required to build a similar roadway for the appellants` proposed development on lot 103-6 and lot 103-5 pt. Lai asked Wong to send him the respondents` survey plan. This was complied with in February 1981. Subsequently there was another telephone conversation between Wong and Lai where Wong was asked to send to the appellants the respondents` proposed access road plans. Accordingly, on 9 April 1981 nine sets of the respondents` access road plans (exhs D7A and 7B) were sent to the appellants for their signature as owners of lots 103-6 and 103-5 pt. These plans depicted an 11 m wide access road from lot 104-1 passing through lots 103-6 and 103-5 pt; there was no provision for any retaining wall. However, in view of the difference in ground levels, the plans showed that the land on lots 103-6 and 103-5 would be cut and sloped in order to stabilize the embankment.
Two weeks later Wong called Lai and was informed that the plans were being considered by the appellants` directors. Wong was requested to call back a few days later. In May 1981, Wong called Lai again and was advised that the appellants would not sign the plans and neither would they sell that portion of lot 103-5 pt in order to enable the respondents to construct the 11-metre roadway out to the revised roadline of Newton Road. Then Lai offered to buy the respondents` development at cost since the respondents could not comply with the requirements of the authorities to construct the access roadway.
This intimation from Lai to Wong caused a sense of desperation on the part of the respondents as this would effectively mean that their development would be stuck and they would be at the mercy of the appellants. The respondents consulted their then solicitor, Mr David Gerald. In late May 1981, David Gerald, writing on behalf of the respondents (undated but received by the appellants on 26 May 1981), asked the appellants to return the nine sets of plans duly completed. He further stated: 
 
Our clients are looking forward to your kind cooperation and would like to avoid resorting to legal redress. However, if we do not hear from you within seven days from the date hereof, our clients will be left with no other alternative but to resort to legal proceedings to enforce their rights.
 
 
 
On 28 May 1981, David Gerald wrote to the Development Control Division enquiring whether planning approval had been given to the appellants to develop lot 103-6 and 103-5 pt and if so whether it had been given subject to the condition that `the written permission (was) granted without prejudice to any existing right of way`. On 13 June 1981, the Development Control Division replied to say that an in-principle planning approval was granted to the appellants to develop lots 103-6 and 103-5 pt and the division reiterated that the written permission would be granted `without prejudice to any existing right of way`.
On 29 May 1981, M/s Foo & Quek, writing as solicitors for the appellants, made the following two points: 
 
In our view nothing in the deed (between the respondents and TKT) makes it obligatory on our clients as successors in title of the property known as lot 103-6 ... to sign the plans your clients have submitted and in any event, it is beyond question that the deed has nothing to do with lot 103-5.
 
 
 
On the next day the nine sets of plans were returned by the appellants to the respondents unsigned. In passing we would observe that the points made by M/s Foo and Quek were correct as nothing in the deed gave the respondents any right of access over lot 103-5.
On 2 June 1981, the respondents` solicitor, Mr David Gerald, approached the Commissioner of Lands asking him to intervene in the matter. He requested the Commissioner of Lands, that if the title to lot 103-5 pt had not yet been issued to the appellants, to `impose a condition in the alienation allowing [the respondents] the right of way and the right to construct the road over lot 103-5 ...`. The letter further made the point that because the alienation of lot 103-5 pt was made without regard to the position of the respondents, this put the respondents `at the mercy of Hong Leong Holdings because so long as Hong Leong Holdings does not develop lot 103-5 [the respondents] will not be able to complete the necessary access road through lot 103-5 to lot 104-1. The delay will cause enormous expenditure ...`.
On 8 June 1981, David Gerald wrote to M/s Foo & Quek raising two points none of which was valid. He also stated that he had referred the matter to the Commissioner of Lands for the latter`s necessary action but added he believed `that this matter could still be amicably resolved by us`.
Then on 19 June 1981, M/s Foo & Quek replied to say that the appellants would be `happy to resolve this matter amicably with your clients. Perhaps you would let us know what proposal your clients have in mind`. This invitation brought about a response from David Gerald dated 3 July 1981 which was hardly in consonant with the spirit of the occasion. The relevant part of the letter reads: 
 
... we are awaiting instructions from our clients who we believe are in the process of computing the special damages suffered by them as a result of your clients` refusal to grant our clients the right of way.
 
 
 
The respondents were clearly asking for a favour and yet they, through their solicitor, had the audacity to make a threat of that kind.
On 10 July 1981, David Gerald forwarded to M/s Foo and Quek nine sets of plans for the appellants` signature and in that letter, David Gerald also said: 
 
We have forwarded the nine sets of plans on the basis that our clients will not be prejudiced for their claims for damages as a result of your clients` early refusal to sign these plans. We shall revert to you on the full extent of our clients` claim at a later date.
 
 
 
These plans were the same as those returned by the appellants to the respondents in late May 1981.
On 22 July 1981 M/s Foo & Quek, inter alia, questioned David Gerald`s assertion that the appellants were obliged to endorse on the respondents` plans without any qualification. They said it was `not possible at this stage to endorse [the respondents`] plans willy-nilly without reference to their own plans. It is surely unimaginative at this stage to demand that your clients` plan be endorsed without qualifications and to threaten legal proceedings if our clients did not comply with such demand without first establishing your clients` right of demand.` M/s Foo & Quek returned the plans with the remark that `the said plans 
 as presently drawn 
 cannot and will not be endorsed by our clients.` (Emphasis added.)
On 23 July 1981 a meeting was convened by one Mr S Narayanaswamy of the Land Office and attended by the solicitors of the parties. On the next day, M/s Foo & Quek wrote to David Gerald stating that the appellants were agreeable to have a meeting with the respondents on the condition that the respondents withdrew their threat to commence legal proceedings against the appellants. The solicitors emphasized: 
 
This condition is made necessary by the tenor of your letters of 3 and 7 July 1981 and we are instructed to emphasize that whereas our clients have no intention of being obstructive, they do not intend to be intimidated.
 
 
 
This offer by the appellants to meet was very much in line with the general understanding reached at the conciliatory meeting held at the Land Office. This was what Mr Narayanaswamy wrote in his letter of 6 August 1981 addressed to M/s Foo & Quek and copied to David Gerald: 
 
As I explained at our meeting on 23 July 1981, I called the parties together in the context of M/s David Gerald`s application for a right of way over your clients` land from lot 104-1 to Newton Road. At our meeting, we noted, inter alia, that a right of way over lot 103-6 gives access to Newton Road, already exists in favour of lot 104-1 and is not disputed by your clients. Your clients are willing to discuss with M/s Sunbird Pte Ltd the question of your clients` endorsement of their plans, which plans involve construction of access road not only over part of lot 103-6 but also over part of lot 103-5 recently alienated to your clients ...
 
 
 
In the circumstances, I have left it to the parties concerned to come to an amicable settlement over the matter without the intervention of the Land Office ...
 
 
 
This offer by the appellants to meet brought no further response from the respondents. Instead, on 6 August 1981, the respondents approached an officer (one Mr Kwan Tai Hua) of the Road Branch of the PWD and related to the officer the problems they encountered in getting the access road plans being endorsed by the appellants. It would appear that at that meeting the Road Branch was prepared to consider a revision of the plans, subject to certain undertakings being given by the respondents. The revised plans (exhs D12A and 12B) would require the respondents to build the access road from point A to point B, to a width of 11 m. From point B up to Newton Road, the access road would be narrowed down to 51/2 m, falling entirely within the original right of way of 51/2 m over lot 103-6, so that the respondents would not have to encroach onto lot 103-5 pt.
In their letter of 7 August 198 1, the respondents gave the following undertakings to the Roads Division:
 
 
(i) the respondents would widen that portion of the access road from 51/2 m to 11 m in the event that they acquired a right of way over lot 103-5 or such a right was available to the respondents to construct the 11 m access road; 
 
(2) that the respondents would be responsible for the maintenance at all times of the whole of the access road from Newton Road to lot 104-1 on completion.
  
 
 
On 18 November 1981, the Road Branch of the PWD granted approval to the respondents with regard to the revised access road plans - exhs D12A and 12B. Under those plans, a retaining wall would be constructed running from point A to point B. This was made necessary because of the difference in the levels of the proposed access road and the ground of lots 103-6 and 103-5 pt.
At this juncture, we should mention that there was a building on lot 103-6, known as No 11 Newton Road and which was occupied by a tenant, one Ng Foon Koo (Ng). By a written consent dated 5 November 1981, Ng confirmed that he had no objection to the respondents constructing the access road and cutting down trees on lot 103-6 for that purpose. On 2 June 1981, the appellants commenced an action in the district court to regain possession of the premises from Ng. As of 5 November 1981, that action was still pending.
Sometime in mid-November 1981, the contractors of the respondents commenced construction of the access road. On 4 December 1981, M/s Foo & Quek wrote to the respondents in these terms: 
 
We are the solicitors for M/s Hong Leong Holdings Ltd and have been instructed that you have carried out road construction on our clients` land (lot 103-6 TSXXVIII) to such extent that such road construction encroaches on our clients` property as well as affects the land profile of our clients` property causing instability to the embankment. We are instructed that though you have a right of way on our clients` property you do not have a right to construct the road in the manner aforesaid. We are instructed to and do hereby give you notice to forthwith cease the road construction otherwise we shall institute legal proceedings against you, your servants and agents without further notice.
 
 
 
A letter to a similar effect and dated 4 December 1981 was also sent by M/s Foo & Quek to the respondents` contractors.
On 7 December 1981, M/s Foo & Quek wrote to the Development Control Division complaining that the respondents` road construction had encroached onto lot 103-5 pt. From this letter it is clear that the appellants were unaware of the revised access road plan - exhs D12A and 12B. They were under the impression that what had been approved were the road plans which they had refused to sign and returned to the respondents. This letter stated: 
 
... It appears clear to us that Sunbird`s building plans should not have been approved since their plans include a roadway which encroaches onto lot 103-5 ... (now belonging to our clients) and which plans of Sunbird were never endorsed by our clients ...
 
 
 
Having regard to the above, we shall be pleased if you will take immediate steps to stop Sunbird from further proceeding with the construction of the roadway.
 
 
 
On 8 December 1981, M/s Shook Lin & Bok (who had by then taken over the matter from Mr David Gerald) wrote on behalf of the respondents to M/s Foo & Quek in response to the latter`s letter of 4 December 1981. This letter reads: 
 
We are instructed that the road is being constructed in accordance with the requirements of the planning authorities in Singapore. There is no other manner of constructing any road in any development except in accordance with such requirements.
 
 
 
We are also instructed that the road construction has not encroached on your clients` property. Our clients would go further and say that they have an implied right to have temporary access to your clients` land in order to do the framework for construction of and 
 to construct the retaining
 wall so long as the retaining wall, when completed, will not encroach on your clients` land. The retaining wall is for your clients` benefit as much as ours in that it will give the necessary support to your clients` property. This implied right is derived from your clients` obligation to allow our clients to construct the road as undertaken by them in a deed dated 10 November 1979.
 
 
 
Finally, we would add that the new road will certainly enhance the value of your clients` land and that your clients` attitude in this matter is absolutely unreasonable. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
For the first time the appellants were informed of the construction of a retaining wall. It would be recalled that in accordance with the original access road plans (exhs D7A and B) which the appellants had returned to the respondents, there was no provision for a retaining wall. In those plans what was provided for was that the embankment beyond the 11 m right of way would be cut and sloped. This letter did not expressly inform the appellants that the respondents had modified the original plans and had submitted revised plans (exhs D12A and D12B) to the authorities, which were eventually approved.
On the same day M/s Foo & Quek replied to M/s Shook Lin & Bok to say that `our clients do not agree that your clients have an implied right to have temporary access to our clients` land as stated in para 3 of your letter. In any event, we have commenced an action in Suit No 4695 of 1981 and have arranged for the writ to be served directly on your clients.`
However, on the day before, 7 December 1981, the appellants filed the present suit, No 4695 of 1981, in the High Court. On 9 December 1981, the appellants applied to court ex parte for and obtained an interim injunction restraining the respondents from carrying out and continuing the road construction work which encroached or trespassed upon lots 103-6 and 103-5 pt. Two affidavits were filed by the appellants in support of their application. The affidavits were sworn by Lai and one Mr Freddie Ong, a surveyor, on 7 December 1981. The pertinent portions of Lai`s affidavit were the following: 
 
4 ... On or about 3 or 4 December I was informed by Mr Freddie Chong that the defendants through their servants or agents had in the course of excavation works in connection with the construction of the said roadway cut into the plaintiffs` lot 103-6 going beyond 11 m wide and had also further trespassed onto lot 103-5.
 
 
 
 
(5) I believe that the defendants are developing lot 104-1 and their building plans in connection with the same development have been approved. I know, however, that the defendants` plans were not endorsed by the plaintiffs and though they might have been endorsed by the former owners ... the defendants are not entitled to excavate and or construct a roadway beyond 11 m wide as they have done nor do the defendants have the right to excavate or construct the roadway so as to encroach and trespass onto lot 103-5 which never belonged to the former owners of lot 103-6. 
 
(8) Annexed hereto ... are two letters written by the plaintiffs` solicitors to the defendants and their contractors requesting them to immediately cease further carrying on the construction of the roadway. 
 
(9) For the reasons above-mentioned I am advised and verily believed that the defendants are not entitled to construct the said roadway in the manner described ... I believe that if the defendants are not urgently restrained as prayed they would proceed further with the said construction of the roadway which will cause the plaintiffs irreparable damage in that the plaintiffs` own development of lot 103-6 would be severely affected.
  
 
 
In his affidavit Freddie Chong confirmed that he carried out a survey on site and stated that `the excavation of earth in connection with the construction of the roadway extends beyond 11 m wide on lot 103-6 ... and extends and encroaches upon lot 103-5.`
On 14 January 1982, the respondents applied to discharge or suspend the interim injunction on the ground that though the appellants were the owners of lot 103-6, they were never and were not at the relevant time in possession thereof. The respondents stated in their affidavit affirmed by Wong that as the appellants were not in possession, they could not maintain an action for trespass against the respondents.
By an affidavit affirmed by Lai on 19 January 1982, the appellants contended that so long as the `trespass has caused a permanent injury to the land` the owner, though not in possession, could commence an action at once. Lai also stated that the appellants had been advised by their consulting engineers, M/s Tan Ee Peng & Partners, that the excavation works carried out by the respondents had created a `steep and exposed high embankment which is not structurally stable and if action is not taken to protect, prop and stabilize the said embankment, slippage and collapse of the embankment may occur which would endanger the movement of people and vehicles along the roadway.`
By an affidavit filed on 21 January 1982 for the respondents, Wong said that the exposed embankment was only temporary as a retaining wall would be built as required by the competent authority. The respondents denied that what they had done by way of excavation had caused permanent injury to lot 103-6.
On the respondents` motion to discharge the interim injunction coming up before the Chief justice on 22 January 1982, the injunction was discharged in so far as lot 103-6 was concerned subject to the respondents` undertaking to build a retaining wall. The injunction over lot 103-5 pt was affected. The parties were also given liberty to apply.
Pursuant to this liberty to apply provision, the appellants applied to court praying that the court would direct the respondents to furnish the appellants with the detailed plans of the retaining wall which the respondents were constructing. This arose because the appellants were concern that the construction of the retaining wall might interfere with the appellants` plans to develop lot 103-6. A written request made earlier, on 28 January 1982, by the appellants` solicitors, M/s Foo & Quek, to the respondents` solicitors, M/s Shook Lin & Bok, for the respondents` plans did not bring about any result until 27 February 1982. In the meantime, on 25 February 198 2, the appellants wrote to the Registrar, Supreme Court, requesting that the matter be restored before the Chief Justice.
This application was scheduled to be heard on 1 March 1982. But by mutual consent it was adjourned to 5 March 1982 for their technical advisers to meet. The Chief Justice orally indicated that in the meantime the respondents should suspend all works on the construction of the retaining wall. The application was further adjourned to 12 March 1982 on which day the Chief Justice made an order requiring the parties to execute a supplemental deed in terms of the draft annexed thereto. The effect of this supplemental deed was to permit the appellants, if it were necessary in the course of developing lot 103-6, to demolish or alter the retaining wall constructed by the respondents provided that the appellants should ensure that the respondents would have the use and enjoyment of the right of way from point A to point B. The supplemental deed was eventually executed between the parties on 29 April 1982 after some hitches regarding the scope of the order of 12 March 1982 had been resolved.
In so far as the court proceedings were concerned, there the matter rested. But on 3 March 1982 the appellants wrote a letter to the Minister of National Development, which formed the subject of the counterclaim of the respondents for damages for malicious falsehood. It is necessary to set out the contents of this letter in full: 
 
We crave leave to write to you, Honourable Minister, on the carrying on of certain construction works on our above-mentioned property by the adjacent landowner without our company`s consent.
 
 
 
Our company is the owner of the land known as lots 103-5 and 103-6 TS XXVIII at Newton Road. We advise that in- principle approval was granted to us in June 1980 for the above-mentioned proposed condominium development (ref DC 25/80/C) and we enclose herewith a copy of the site proposal plan for your kind reference.
 
 
 
The owners of the adjoining lot 104-1 TS XXVIII are carrying on a housing development on their land and they have been granted a right of way over lot 103-6 from the point A (on the common boundary of lots 104-1 and 103-6) to a point B as shown in the enclosed plan. The right of way in fact runs along a road reserve and the effect of the right of way is to widen that road reserve from a narrow track to a width of 11 m. We would assume that the owners of lot 104-1 were able to obtain approval for their proposed housing development by virtue of the above-mentioned right of way granted to them. However, notwithstanding such right of way, we maintain that the owners of lot 104-1 should not be entitled to carry on any construction work on our property, without first obtaining our company`s consent.
 
 
 
Our company has discovered that the owners of lot 104-1 are presently carrying on construction works of a retaining wall on our property along the road reserve described above. We would like to point out that such construction works on our land are being carried on without our company`s consent and further without consideration for our approved condominium development. With reference to the enclosed proposal plan, it can be seen that the construction of the retaining wall (denoted in pink) if allowed to remain would impose an obstruction to our architect`s proposal which has been approved.
 
 
 
We wish to admit that we acknowledge and do not deny the above-mentioned right of way granted to the owners of lot 104-1 over our land, but we strongly feel that any construction works on our land should not be permitted without our company`s consent.
 
 
 
Under the above circumstances, we are made to believe that the owners of lot 104-1 may be carrying out construction works without obtaining the necessary or proper approval from the relevant authorities or where such approval.
 
 
 
Sir, we seek your kind attention in the above matter.
 
 
 
As a result of this letter of complaint, the Development and Building Control Division (DBCD) of the PWD orally instructed the architects of the respondents to cease all works on the access road. On 13 March 1982, that division wrote to the respondents` consulting engineers, Houkehua, asking them to explain why the respondents had signed the access road plans as owner. Pending such clarification, Houkehua were required to stop all works. On 18 March 1982, Houkehua wrote to DBCD explaining the problem they encountered (with some inaccuracies) in obtaining the signature of the appellants to their access road plans. They said they had not misled DBCD.
On 23 April 1982, M/s Shook Lin & Bok wrote to M/s Foo & Quek regarding the letter of complaint of 3 March 1982. In view of the orders of court, M/s Shook Lin & Bok requested the appellants, through their solicitors, to withdraw the complaint. On 28 April 1982, M/s Foo & Quek informed M/s Shook Lin & Bok that the appellants would be writing to the Ministry of National Development informing them, inter alia, of the order made by the Chief Justice on 12 March 1982 as well as enclosing a copy of the order.
Accordingly, on that very same day the appellants wrote to the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of National Development, which was the second letter upon which the respondents` counterclaim on malicious falsehood was based. We will again set out the entire letter even though the objectionable part was only in the last paragraph. 
 
With reference to my letter of 3 March 1982 addressed to the Honourable Minister for National Development, I feel compelled to state the following:
 
 
 
(a) When the owners of lot 104-1 began constructing the 11 m roadway and the retaining wall, we instructed our solicitors to apply for an ex parte injunction which they got in respect of lot 103-6 and lot 103-5 pt (now know as lot 634) but on hearing of a motion on the application of the owners of lot 104-1, the injunction in respect of lot 103-6 only was discharged with liberty to the parties to apply to the court. A copy of the court order dated 22 January 1982 is enclosed. The injunction in respect of lot 103-5 continues.
(b) Subsequently, our solicitors applied under the liberty to apply provision of the order above referred to and the parties appeared before the Chief Justice. Affidavits were filed by both parties and copies of which will be supplied if necessary. 
(c) Eventually, the order of court dated 12 March 1982 was made by the Chief Justice, an approved draft copy of which order is enclosed. The sealed copy is not at present available. 
(d) Enclosed also is a copy of our solicitors` letter dated 9 March 1982, and addressed to the solicitors for the owners of lot 104-1.
 
 
 
Notwithstanding the above, I nevertheless think that in constructing the 11 m roadway referred to in my letter of 3 March 1982, which roadway stretches from lot 103-6 to lot 103-5 pt, the owners of lot 104-1 may have an implied consent over lot 103-6, but they do not however have our consent whatsoever to construct the 11 m roadway along lot 103-5 pt.
 
 
 
As soon as Houkehua received a copy of the order of court of 12 March 1982 and the supplemental deed, they forwarded the same to the DBCD and requested for permission to recommence work on the access road. Following that request, DBCD wrote to the appellants on 17 May 1982 asking `in view of the settlement, we wish to enquire if you have further objection to the construction work pertaining to the access road on lot 103-6.` On 26 May 1982, DBCD pressed the appellants for an early reply. On 1 June 1982, the appellants replied to DBCD enclosing a copy of their letter of 28 April 1982 addressed to the Ministry of National Development and drew DBCD`s particular attention to the last paragraph of that letter.
On 11 June 1982, the respondents wrote to DBCD urging the latter to permit the respondents to recommence work. By a letter of 17 June 1982, DBCD advised the respondents, through their consulting engineers, Houkehua, to `get consent from the owner of lot 103-5 for the recommencement of the work pertaining to the access road.`
On 7 July 1982 Wong and Mr William Seet of the respondents met with officials of DBCD and proposed that the construction of the access road be divided into two stages. Stage I was from point A to point B and Stage II was from point B to Newton Road. The respondents asked for permission to proceed with stage I and undertook not to construct stage II until clearance was subsequently given.
Then on 19 August 1982, M/s Shook Lin & Bok wrote to M/s Foo & Quek saying that the respondents had been advised by DBCD to obtain the appellants` signature to the approved plans for the proposed roadworks and forwarded three sets of plans for the appellants` signature. On 1 September 1982, M/s Shook Lin & Bok sent a reminder. The appellants replied on 20 September 1982 and indicated that they would only consent to a retaining wall being erected from point A to point B but not beyond point B to Newton Road. In view of the fact that the appellants were only prepared to give a limited consent, on 21 September 1982 M/s Shook Lin & Bok requested M/s Foo & Quek to return the plans.
In the meantime, on 6 September 1982, DBCD gave permission to the respondents to commence stage I. On 14 September 1982, M/s Shook Lin & Bok wrote to DBCD explaining the position: that the respondents had an extended right of way of 11 m from point A to point B and a narrower right of way of 51/2 m from point B to Newton Road over that strip of lot 103-6 linking to Newton Road. On 11 October 1982, DBCD gave permission to the respondents to commence stage II works provided that the works did not encroach onto adjoining lots. When the action came up for trial, counsel for the appellants told the court that they were no longer seeking the reliefs prayed for in the writ. However, the respondents had given notice that they wished to pursue their claim for an inquiry into the damage suffered by the respondents arising out of the ex parte injunction obtained by the appellants on 9 December 1981 and their counterclaim against the appellants for malicious falsehood.
 Damages on the interim injunction 
The above are the pertinent facts. We will now turn to examine the issues and the grounds of appeal. The first issue is whether the High Court ought to have ordered an inquiry and awarded damages to the respondents. The trial judge held that, on the evidence in court of Chow, who said that the excavation and cutting into had caused a collapse of the embankment, the appellants obtained the interim injunction for a reason which did not exist, ie the collapse of the embankment. The trial judge said this was raised as an afterthought. He held that the intention of the appellants in obtaining the interim injunction was to frustrate the development of the respondents. In coming to this finding he took into account the events prior to July 1981 and, in particular, the few conversations which took place between Wong and Lai, wherein Lai informed Wong that the appellants would refuse to sign the plans exhs D7A and 7B and that the appellants were prepared to buy over the respondents` project at costs.
It will be recalled that the plans in exhs D7A and 7B show that the access road would be one of 11 m wide from point A to Newton Road. In other words, a certain part of that roadway would intrude into lot 103-5 pt which then belonged to the appellants and in respect of which land the respondents had no right of way whatsoever. Those plans had been returned unsigned by the appellants after the respondents` solicitors threatened legal proceedings.
It seems to us that while the trial judge gave ample consideration to the events up to May 1981, he did not give adequate consideration to the subsequent events. The later correspondence between the parties` solicitors show that the respondents` solicitors kept harping on the point that they would sue the appellants for damages for their refusal to sign the plans knowing full well that the respondents had no right of way over lot 103-5 pt. This eventually led to a meeting at the Land Office between the parties` solicitors and Mr Narayanaswamy of that office. As we have stated above in outlining the salient facts, the outcome of that meeting was that the parties would try to resolve the matter amicably. Following that meeting, and without any delay, M/s Foo & Quek wrote to David Gerald requesting the respondents to withdraw their threat of legal proceedings so that discussions could proceed. Such prompt follow-up action at least demonstrated the good faith of the appellants. There was, however no further communication from the respondents` solicitors to that request. As of that stage, for whatever reasons, it was the respondents who chose not to accept the offer to discuss and resolve the matter amicably. Yet the trial judge did not give any consideration to this aspect at all. It was glossed over. In our judgment, the trial judge has erred in his appreciation of the facts by placing too much reliance on the events in May 1981 and none at all or very little on the events in July/August 1981.
Indeed, as soon as this was pointed out to counsel for the respondents, he submitted that whatever it was, the events prior to August 1981 were quite immaterial to the question whether or not Hong Leong had properly obtained the interim injunction in question. Mr Patten submitted that there was material non-disclosure on the part of the appellants when on 9 December 1981 they went before the judge-in-chambers on an ex parte application. He said the appellants had failed to refer to the earlier communications between the parties on the question of the access road. He contended that there was material non-disclosure in that the appellants` affidavit filed in support had failed to exhibit to the court the letter of 8 December 1981 written by M/s Shook Lin & Bok, in reply to M/s Foo & Quek`s letter of 4 December 1981. He said it would have made a significant difference to the judge hearing the application if those facts were brought to his attention. Mr Patten relied on the often quoted case 
 R v Kensington Income Tax Commissioners 
[1917] 1 KB 486
 in support of the proposition that any material non-disclosure would lead to the discharge of the interim injunction and the consequential award of damages against that party on its undertaking which it has given to the court.
It seems to us important to examine what was actually stated in the affidavits filed in support of the application for the interim order. Lai, in his affidavit filed on 7 December 1981, first referred to the respective ownership of the three lots in question. He then referred to the deed of 10 November 1979 wherein the previous owner of lot 103-6 granted a right of way to the respondents to construct a roadway of 11 m wide from point A to point B. He then went on to say (this part has been quoted in extenso above) that on 1 December 1981 after receiving the information that the respondents had begun construction of their access road, he instructed Freddie Chong, a chartered surveyor, to carry out a survey. A few days later, Chong told Lai that the respondents` servants or agents had in connection with the construction of the access road `cut into the plaintiffs` lot 103-6 going beyond 11 m wide and had also further trespassed on to lot 103-5`. His main complaint was that `the defendants are not entitled to excavate and or construct a roadway beyond 11 m wide as they have done nor do the defendants have the right to excavate or construct the roadway so as to encroach and trespass onto lot 103-5`. He then concluded his affidavit by saying that `by reason of the said excavation works, the defendants have trespassed onto the plaintiffs` lots 103-6 and 103-5 and I believe that if the defendants are not urgently restrained as prayed they would proceed further with the said construction of the roadway which would cause the plaintiffs irreparable damage in that the plaintiffs` own development in lot 103-6 would be severely affected.` Chong in his affidavit confirmed what was stated by Lai that `the excavation extends beyond 11 m wide of lot 103-6 and extends and encroaches on lot 103-5.`
Both the affidavits nowhere refer to the collapse of the embankment. The trial judge seems to have relied solely on the evidence in court of Chow who said that he instructed the application of an interim injunction because he was informed that the embankment had collapsed. That might be what Chow thought. In his evidence Chow said he had never visited the land. But the important consideration for this court in determining whether the injunction was properly obtained must surely be the grounds put forward to the court in the affidavits themselves and not what a witness thought some five years later. It seems to us that this mistaken belief of Chow should not have been held to convert an otherwise proper application into an improper application. All the more so if, as the trial judge has found, this allegation of the collapse of the embankment was an afterthought on Chow`s part.
The facts as set out in the affidavits of Lai and Chong were consonant with the fact situation on the ground. It was not disputed that the excavation had intruded well beyond the 11-metre right of way in so far as lot 103-6 was concerned. This was admitted in the letter dated 8 December 1981 of M/s Shook Lin & Bok. It was not denied that there could have been consequential intrusion into lot 103-5. A land owner who has not given permission to another to enter into his land to carry out any works beyond the permitted limit is surely entitled to come to court to restrain that other person from infringing his rights as owner. It must be borne in mind that at the relevant time the appellants were totally in the dark as regards the revised plans (exhs D12A and 12B). The appellants would not have known how the retaining wall was to be constructed and to what extent: the letter from M/s Shook Lin & Bok of 8 December 1981 made no elaboration. But what the appellants saw was a massive invasion into their land, well beyond the 11 m right of way and also onto lot 103-5. The earlier plans (exhs D7A and 7B) did not envisage the construction of any retaining wall.
Though we think that the letter of 8 December 1981 was certainly relevant to the matter in issue, we do not think that this non-disclosure is so severe that, even if it were disclosed, the judge hearing the application would not have granted the order altogether. We note that the trial judge did not place any significance on the non-disclosure of this letter at all. We would observe that this letter, other than stating that a retaining wall would be built in accordance with the plans approved by the relevant authorities, did not forward the plans in question. In this letter the respondents had argued that they were entitled, as a matter of necessity, to a temporary right of access to the adjacent land just for the purposes of constructing the retaining wall. This argument was accepted by the trial judge. In our opinion this argument overlooked the fact that even the respondents` own consulting engineer, Dennis Ong (DW9), admitted that the retaining wall could be constructed by another means without having to intrude beyond the 11 m limit. One method was by the use of steel sheet piles (see evidence of PW1, Mr Tan Ee Peng). Another was by the driving of tantalized piles; in fact this was the method eventually used by the respondents. It was only a question of higher cost and a little more time. That being the case, we fail to see how it could validly be argued that the intrusion was a necessity for the purposes of constructing the wall.
The trial judge also held that the excavation was only temporary and would be back-filled after the retaining wall had been constructed. That may be so. But it was no less a trespass. He then went on to say that there was no evidence that the respondents had caused any permanent injury to lot 103-6. Perhaps the evidence of PW1 had been overlooked. PW1 had said that the plan to build the retaining wall would cause the greatest amount of disturbance to the land because: 
 
considerable extent of the existing embankment slope would be required to be excavated. Eventually if our proposed development proceeds then those buildings which would be near the embankment slope on which we intend to build without piles would now require piling because the original soil strength and soil properties would have been weakened by the excavation.
 
 
 
Even the engineer of the respondents, Dennis Ong (DW9), could only say the back-fill would reinstate the embankment `almost full to its original condition.`
In our judgment it is vitally important to view the situation then in its proper perspective. What emerged was that the respondents had excavated beyond the 11 m right of way on the appellants` land without the appellants` permission. They had also intruded into lot 103-5 pt. There was no knowledge on the appellants` part as to how far that intrusion would go. Faced with that situation of a massive invasion it seems to us clear that the land owners were entitled to come to court to ask the court to give them the necessary protection.
In this regard and in determining whether damages on the cross-undertaking should be awarded against the appellants, we think it is also pertinent to look at the conduct of the parties subsequent to the grant of the interim injunction. First, the respondents did not make an immediate application to have the order set aside. It was only made more than a month later, on 14 January 1982. Second, and more importantly, the reason upon which the respondents sought to have the interim order set aside was not on any ground of material non-disclosure but on the very technical ground that as the land in question was at the time in the occupation of a tenant, the appellants, as residual owners, were not entitled to come to court to ask for the injunction. Even in the second affidavit filed on behalf of the respondents to support the discharge of the interim injunction, nothing on material non-disclosure was raised. And when the application for discharge came before the court on 22 January 1982, the interim order was discharged in so far as it related to lot 103-6 and was on condition that the plaintiff would build a retaining wall.
We appreciate that in awarding damages in favour of the respondents pursuant to the appellants` cross-undertaking the trial judge was exercising his judicial discretion and that an appellate court should only interfere with the exercise of that discretion if it were based on a misunderstanding of the law or the evidence before him. For the reasons which we have given above, we think, with respect, that the trial judge had failed to correctly appreciate the evidence before him. Considering the circumstances as a whole, we do not think that any damages should be awarded against the appellants on their cross-undertaking. Accordingly we would set aside the damages of $701,718 awarded in favour of the respondents.
 Malicious falsehood 
We turn next to consider the counterclaim of the respondents based on malicious falsehood. As stated hereinbefore, this claim arose because of the two letters written by the appellants on 3 March 1982 and 28 April 1982. These two letters have been set out in extenso earlier.
The trial judge in his judgment (at p 48) said that paras 4 and 6 of the letter of 3 March 1982 conveyed to the minister the following: 
 
(i) the [appellants] have suddenly discovered that the retaining wall was being built on their property along the road reserve;
 
 
 
 
(ii) the retaining wall was being built without the appellants` consent and without consideration for the [appellants`] proposed development on lot 103-6 and the retaining wall if allowed to remain would obstruct the [appellants`] development; 
 
(iii) the [respondents] were carrying out construction works without proper approvals from the relevant authorities to grant to the [respondents] such approvals.
  
 
 
He held that these statements were untrue and misleading.
We will now examine each of the statements in turn. Mr Price submitted that these statements were not untrue. Taking (i) he said that the letter of 3 March 1982 did not contain the word `suddenly`. Though on 8 December 1981, the appellants were informed by M/s Shook Lin & Bok`s letter of that date that the respondents were constructing a retaining wall, the appellants were not given any further details of the retaining wall until 27 February 1982 when the plans were furnished by M/s Shook Lin & Bok to M/s Foo & Quek. Only on that day were the appellants aware of the kind of retaining wall which the respondents were constructing on lot 103-6. Only then did the appellants truly come to know that the retaining wall was being built along the road reserve. This letter complained of was written four days later. We accept the submission that (i) was not untrue.
As regards the alleged statement in (ii) there are three parts in it. The first is that the retaining wall was being built without the appellants` consent. That is undoubtedly true. While the respondents had a right of way, the appellants had not consented to the construction of the retaining wall as set out in the revised plans - exhs D12A and 12B. The appellants did not have sight of the revised plans until 27 February 1982. The second is that the retaining wall was being constructed without consideration of the appellants` proposed development on lot 103-6. This is again true. There was no consultation with the appellants when the respondents` consultants drew the revised plans. The third is that the retaining wall if allowed to remain would obstruct the appellants` development. This is a natural consequence of what was stated immediately before and is again true. The fact that the appellants even asked for a right to alter or demolish the retaining wall in the event that their development so required, which right was incorporated in the supplemental deed, clearly reinforced what they said.
As regards (iii), we are unable to agree that the second last paragraph of the letter of 3 March 1982 could fairly be construed to mean that which the trial judge had suggested. For convenience we could quote that paragraph again: 
 
Under the above circumstances, we are made to believe that the owners of lot 104-1 may be carrying out construction works without obtaining the necessary or proper approval from the relevant authorities or where such approval has been granted it may have been granted erroneously.
 
 
 
We think this paragraph clearly sets out a belief of the appellants, ie that the respondents may be carrying out the construction works without obtaining the necessary or proper approval; and if approval was in fact given the appellants expressed the belief that it might have been granted erroneously. There was no suggestion in that paragraph that the respondents had misled the authorities in granting the approval and none should be so implied. We note the use of the word `erroneously`. More importantly, the last paragraph of the letter must not be overlooked as it sought the `kind attention` of the minister. That was plainly a request to the minister to look into the matter. We do not think anything more could fairly be read into that paragraph.
Whatever the motives of the appellants might be in writing that letter, it seems to us clear that there is no false statement in that letter. It might very well be that the appellants were unhappy that the respondents went behind the back of the appellants in obtaining the approval to the revised plans without so much as letting the appellants know about it. But to succeed in an action based on malicious falsehood it must be shown that the defendant utters falsehood; motive alone will not do.
We come next to the letter of 28 April 1982, where the objectionable part is in the last paragraph. For convenience we will set that paragraph out again: 
 
Notwithstanding the above, I nevertheless think that in constructing the 11 m roadway referred to in my letter of 3 March 1982, which roadway stretches from lot 103-6 to lot 103-5 pt, the owners of lot 104-1 may have an implied consent over lot 103-6, but they do not however have our consent whatsoever to construct the 11 m roadway along lot 103-5 pt.
 
 
 
The trial judge held that this paragraph was misleading and malicious as it would `suggest to the ministry that the [respondents] were going to build an 11 m roadway over lot 103-5 without the [appellants`] consent.` Mr Price contended that no such suggestion was made in that letter; it did not say that the respondents intended to construct the 11 m roadway on lot 103-5 pt. All it stated was that the respondents did not have the appellants` consent to construct an 11 m roadway on lot 103-5 pt.
In our view, this letter of 28 April 1982 cannot be viewed in isolation and must be read together with the letter of 3 March 1982. While it was wrong for the appellants to have stated in the letter that the `roadway stretches from lot 103-6 to lot 103-5 pt`, a reference which Mr Price conceded was unfortunate, we do not think this error per se was sufficient to found an action based on malicious falsehood. Chow said that their aim was to emphasize to the ministry that the respondents had no right to construct an 11 m roadway on lot 103-5 pt. He explained during cross-examination in this way: 
 
According to the advice of Mr Tay Soo Tee, since the court order was made on 12 March 1982 it was possible that the authorities might misunderstand that there was already a full settlement, the authorities might misunderstand that the whole length of the roadway from [respondents`] lot right down to Newton Road would be 11 m wide road ... it could be better for us to write to the authorities to make clear our position.
 
 
 
The trial judge held that the paragraph was `misleading and malicious`. But as we have pointed out when dealing with the question of the cross-undertaking on damages, he has not correctly appreciated all the material facts. He has also wrongly construed the first letter of 3 March 1982. Those errors had obviously influenced his perception of his second letter. In our judgment there was no real evidence to suggest that there was malice. Even the correspondence of the respondents and their consultants contained errors. This occurred in the letter dated 18 March 1982 of the respondents` consulting engineers, Houkehua, para 2 of the respondents` letter of 9 July 1982 to DBCD and para 3 of the respondents` solicitors` letter of 14 September 1982 to DBCD.
In our view it is crucial that the two letters should be viewed in their correct context. Here you have a land owner writing to the minister setting out certain facts (which are correct) relating to an adjacent development and asking the minister to look into it to see if there was an irregularity in the approval granted. How the ministry and the relevant department would react to that was for them to decide. The ministry and DBCD were in possession of all the relevant plans and how the retaining wall was to be constructed. A slight error in the letter of 28 April 1982 can hardly be sufficient to form the basis of an action based on malicious falsehood.
In the result we would allow the appeal of the appellants and set aside the orders of the trial judge. Leave is given to the appellants to withdraw the action. Costs of the hearing on the cross-undertaking on damages and on the counterclaim before the High Court and of this appeal before this court shall be borne by the respondents. There shall also be the usual consequential orders.

This was an appeal against the judgment of LP Thean J who dismissed the plaintiff`s claim for damages for negligence against the first defendants. The grounds relied upon by the plaintiff on appeal were the same as those canvassed before and rejected by LP Thean J in his judgment: see 
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 297
 . At the conclusion of the hearing before us, we dismissed the appeal.
The plaintiff had obtained judgment against the second defendant for damages for negligence in failing to provide a safe and proper system of work and exposing him to this risk of damage and injury. That judgment had not been satisfied when the action against the first defendants was heard.
The facts were not in dispute. The first defendants were the owners of the site on which the building now known as Peninsula Plaza stands. They had engaged SA Shee & Co Pte Ltd (SA Shee) as the main contractor to erect the building under the terms of a building contract dated 20 October 1976 which incorporated the standard SIA conditions of contract. They gave possession of the vacant site to SA Shee sometime in October 1976 to carry out the building works. M/s Alfred Wong were appointed by the first defendants as architects for the development. The second defendant was the scaffolding sub-contractor of SA Shee. The plaintiff was an employee of the second defendant.
On 8 August 1979, while the plaintiff was working on the construction site, tying poles with rattan on the third floor of the partially completed building, a brick fell from the upper floors and hit him on the head. He sustained serious injuries as a result.
In his statement of claim, the plaintiff averred that the first defendants were negligent in the following manner:
 
 
(a) Failing to take any or any reasonable care to see that the plaintiff would be reasonably safe in using the said premises. 
 
(b) Exposing the plaintiff, while he was engaged upon the said work, to a risk of damage or injury from falling brick of which they knew or ought to have known. 
 
(c) Failing to take any or any adequate or effective precautions to ensure that the brick from the upper floors of the said premises would not fall and strike the plaintiff. 
 
(d) Causing or permitting the said premises to be or to become or to remain in an unsafe and dangerous state, in that the said brick was likely suddenly to fall therefrom.
  
 
 
Before the judge, the liability of the first defendants was put on two grounds: (1) they were occupiers of or had control of the site in that they had engaged architects, a site engineer and a clerk of works to supervise the construction works and the architects had considerable powers to give instructions to SA Shee in relation to the works under the building contract, including the power to instruct the dismissal of workers; (2) the first defendants were liable for the negligence of SA Shee as the duty of care to the plaintiff was one which was not, in the circumstances, delegable.
With respect to the first ground, it was not disputed that the architects had the powers as alleged, and that the first defendants had also engaged an engineer on site to supervise the mechanical and electrical works and a clerk of works to look after the building works. LP Thean J held that these activities did not make the first defendants in law and in fact the occupiers of the site or give them control of the site. The first defendants` supervisors were only there to see that the work was properly done in accordance with the terms of the contract. He held that the occupiers were SA Shee. We agree with this finding for the reasons given by him. SA Shee were the main contractors in possession of the site. They had possession of and full control over the site and it was they who invited the second defendant and his employees to come onto the site. The architects were independent contractors and not agents of the first defendants: see 
 AMF International Ltd v Magnet Bowling 
 
[1968] 1 WLR 1028
, and any control which they might have by virtue of their position could not be said to be the control of the first defendants.
Counsel for the plaintiff had relied on the decision of the Federal Court in 
 Lembaga Kemajuan Tanah Persekutuan v Mariam 
 
 
 
[1984] 1 MLJ 283
  as authority for the proposition that in certain circumstances the owner of land could still be regarded as the occupier. Thean J distinguished the case on grounds which we fully endorse. Counsel for the plaintiff also relied on the following passage in the judgment of Lord Denning in 
 Wheat v E Lacon & Co Ltd 
 [1966] 1 All ER 582 at p 595: 
 
Fourthly, where an owner employed an independent contractor to do work on premises of a structure, the owner was usually still regarded as sufficiently in control of the place as to be under a duty towards all those who might lawfully come there. In some cases he might fulfil that duty by entrusting the work to the independent contractor: see 
 Haseldine
 
 v
 
 Daw & Son Ltd
 
[1941] 2 KB 343
 and s 2(4) of the Act of 1957. In other cases he might only be able to fulfil it by exercising proper supervision himself over the contractor`s work, using due diligence himself to prevent damage from unusual danger (see 
 Thomson
 
 v
 
 Cremin
 [1953] 2 All ER 1185 as explained by Lord Reid in 
 Davie
 
 v
 
 New Merton Board Mills Ltd
 
[1959] AC 604
 at pp 642-645. But in addition to the owner, the courts regarded the independent contractor as himself being sufficiently in control of the place where he worked as to owe a duty of care towards all persons coming lawfully there. He was said to be an `occupier` also (see 
 Hartwell
 
 v
 
 Grayson, Rollo and Clover Docks Ltd
 [1947] KB 901 at pp 912, 913), but this is only a particular instance of his general duty of care (see 
 AC Billings & Sons Ltd
 
 v
 
 Riden
 
[1958] AC 240
 at p 250 per Lord Reid).
 
 
 
In our view, this passage was of no assistance to the plaintiff. We do not think that Lord Denning was stating a principle that in all cases where employers had engaged independent contractors to erect a building for them and for that purpose delivers possession of the site to the contractors, the employers remain as occupiers or in control of the site. We agree with the finding of LP Thean J that this was a case where the first defendants were entitled to and did discharge their duty of care to third parties who come on to the site by employing SA Shee as independent contractors and making them liable in respect of personal injury to or the death of any person arising out of or in the course of or by reason of the carrying out of the works: see cl 18 of the building contract. This case comes within the principle applied in 
 Haseldine v Daw 
 
[1941] 2 KB 343
.
With respect to the second ground, LP Thean J held, and we also agreed with this finding, that the plaintiff was not injured by reason of any defective and unsafe condition of the premises, but either as a result of current operations being conducted on the site or an unsafe system of work which caused the brick to fall. The evidence established that the current operations were then carried out by SA Shee as the building was partially completed. The first defendants could not be responsible for any negligence arising from these operations as they were not, unlike those in 
 Honeywill & Stein v Larkin Bros 
 
[1934] 1 KB 191
, unusually dangerous or extra hazardous. Accordingly, even if the first defendants were in occupation, they would not be liable on this ground as the first defendants` occupation would not, ipso facto, make them liable for the injury to the plaintiff: see the two passages from the judgments of Lord Keith and Lord Goff in 
 Ferguson v Welsh 
 
[1987] 1 WLR 1553
 which were relied upon by LP Thean J. If the injury arose as a result of an unsafe system of work, then, in the words of Lord Keith in 
 Ferguson 
 `s case (at p 1560): 
 
It would not ordinarily be reasonable to expect an occupier of premises having engaged a contractor whom he has reasonable grounds for regarding as competent, to supervise the contractor`s activities in order to ensure that he was discharging his duty to his employees to observe a safe system of work. In special circumstances, on the other hand, where the occupier knows or has reason to suspect that the contractor is using an unsafe system of work, it might well be reasonable for the occupier to take steps to see that the system was made safe.
 
 
 
For the reasons given above, we dismissed the appeal with costs.

This is an unusual case in that it involves a collision between two motor boats whilst travelling in opposite directions on a river which has since been reclaimed by the government.
The plaintiff is the mother of one Lim Boon Seng (`the deceased`) who died as a result of the collision. On 3 July 1981, Lim was navigating motor boat no SF9469 along Serangoon river and proceeding towards the village of Kangkar. In other words, he was going inland. He had a passenger, one Lek Seng Thiam, who was sitting at one end of the boat facing him. Lim was sitting at the other end of the boat where the engine was. Thus, Lek was not in a position to see anything coming in front of the boat since his back was to the front of the boat. Lim would have been able to see what was coming in front of him but since he died without giving a statement to the police, no one knows what he saw or what he did just before the collision.
The collision occurred when another motor boat, ie SF9537, came from the opposite direction and the two boats collided into each other. SF9537 was then being navigated by Lim Choi Chay, the defendant.
As a result of the collision, Lek was thrown onto the base of the boat but Lim Boon Seng was thrown into the river. He was in the river for a short while and was then pulled up onto SF9537 by the defendant. SF9537 then proceeded to Kangkar where the police was informed of the accident. Lim Boon Seng had a laceration of 9cm on the right front parietal region but appeared to be all right when he reached Kangkar. He was then taken to hospital where he died on 11 July 1981. The cause of death was certified as `bronchopneumonia due to drowning`.
Lek later made a report to the police at 2.40pm on the same day. His report was as follows: 
 
I, Lek Seng Thiam on 3 July 1981 at about 0600 hrs whilst I steer my m/sampan SF 9469 proceeding in Serangoon River, suddenly collision happen between my m/sampan and other m/sampan SF9537 which was proceeding out of the river. My boat crew by the name Lim Boon Seng m/27 was fell in the river during the collision, he was save by me and other m/sampan personal, after that I sent him to Tan Tock Seng hospital as his forehead was injury. The collision also caused serious damage to my m/sampan on s/board side. I came to police station to lodge this report. That`s all.
 
 
 
The defendant made a report to the police at 10.16am on the same day. His report was as follows: 
 
On 3 July 1981 at about 0600 hrs at sea off the end of Serangoon Rd whilst my craft no SF9537 proceeding out of Serangoon river the other sampan was proceeding in the river. Suddenly the collision happened between my sampan and his, one of the man on other sampan was fall into the sea. I jumped in the river and save him, after that the man was sent to hospital due to injury of the forehead, I do not know the number of other sampan and the injury person`s name, my sampan cause slight damage on s/board side. I came to police station just for report. That`s all.
 
 
 
It is to be noted that both reports referred to the collision as sudden but neither stated where exactly on the river it occurred or how it occurred.
One Inspector Soh (PW2) investigated the accident. He testified that he visited the scene and instructed photographs to be taken of the boats. Unfortunately he did not take photographs of the river at the point where the accident occurred. The result was that material objective evidence concerning the directional course of the river was not before the court. Here I should interpose to say that Lek`s testimony on this point was directly the opposite of the defendant`s testimony as both of them had alleged that the river was flowing towards the right at the place where the collision occurred.
Inspector Soh also testified that at low tide there was sufficient space in the channel of the river for not more than three boats to pass one another at the same time. As he was referring to the types of boats similar to those involved in the accident, each of which was about four feet wide, the channel would be about 18-20 ft wide, taking into account any clearance space required. Lek`s testimony supported this estimate of the width of the channel at low tide. He said it was about 12 to 15 ft and wide enough for four small boats to pass one another at the same time. He also said that the accident occurred when it was low tide. The defendant did not deny that the accident occurred at low tide but said that the channel was about 34 ft wide. He, however, admitted that the channel of the river was narrow at low tide. In these circumstances, I find as a fact that the navigable channel of the river was about 18 to 20 ft at low tide when the collision occurred and not 34 ft as claimed by the defendant.
Both Lek and the defendant also agreed that at low tide it was not safe for a boat to travel near either the bank of the river because of the shallow draught near the banks and also because of debris floating near the banks. According to Lek, the accident occurred at about 5am but according to the defendant it was about 6am. However, both agreed that it was dark and visibility was poor. The defendant claimed that there was a red light on the bow of his boat. In my view, this made no difference whatever to the physical conditions then prevailing.
The other unusual feature about this case is that SF9469 was damaged on its starboard side about two feet from the bow. The damage was on the top part of the boat where a small section of timber had been gouged out of the boat and a long piece of timber dislodged. This damage could only have been caused by the sharp bow of SF9537 ramming into SF9469 at an angle. Now, a collision between two boats on a channel of river of this width which caused the kind of damage to one of the boats as I have described could only have happened in any one of the following circumstances: 
 
 
(1) SF9496 was travelling on its correct side of the river and SF9537 came from the opposite direction on its wrong side; 
 
(2) SF9537 was travelling on its correct side of the river and SF9469 came from the wrong side; 
 
(3) both the boats were travelling in the middle of the river and collided as both were fuming at the bend of the river.
  
 
 
Not unexpectedly, the evidence of Lek was to the effect that the first scenario took place whilst the evidence of the defendant was that the second scenario took place. I have considered their evidence and I do not accept their oral accounts of how and where the collision occurred. In my view, neither Lek nor the defendant was aware of how it occurred. Lek could not see any oncoming traffic as he was facing the deceased who was steering the boat. As it was a dark night and visibility was poor, I also find that the defendant could not see what was coming round the bend of the river. In my view, the truth of the matter is found in both the reports which were made to the police on the day of the accident. The reports clearly show that neither Lek nor the defendant knew the location of the boats or where on the river the collision occurred. No doubt both of them must have heard the sound of engines but by the time the deceased and the defendant became aware of the presence of each other`s boat bearing down on the other, it was either too late to take avoidance action or they took the wrong avoidance action.
So, I find that there is no evidence as to the respective positions of the two boats on the river immediately before or how they collided into each other or how one collided into the other.
In these circumstances, how should liability be determined? It is, of course, trite law that the plaintiff must prove that the defendant is negligent and that if he fails to do so, his claim must be dismissed. Counsel for the defendant has submitted that on the plaintiff`s evidence such is the position here or alternatively, on the defendant`s evidence, the deceased was the negligent party. Counsel for the plaintiff, on the other hand, has submitted that on Lek`s evidence, the defendant was wholly to blame, but that if the court is in doubt as to which version is the more probable one, both parties ought to share the blame. Counsel referred me to three road traffic cases which have, he submits, established the principle put forward by him. These cases are: 
 Baker v Market Harborough Industrial Co-Operative Society 
 
[1953] 1 WLR 1472
, 
 W & M Wood (Haulage) Ltd v Redpath 
 
[1967] 2 QB 520
 and 
 Davidson v Leggett 
 113 Sol Jo 409.
Of course, the mere collision between two motor vehicles does not mean that there is no longer any burden on the party who seeks to blame the other to prove his case: see Megaw LJ in 
 Knight v Fellick 
 [1977] RTR 316 at p 325. In each of the three cases cited by counsel for the plaintiff the collision had taken place on or near the centre of the road and there was no other evidence on which the court could say who was to blame. The principle is stated correctly in the headnote to the report of 
 Baker 
`s case 
[1953] 1 WLR 1472
 which reads as follows: 
 
Where the evidence established that a collision between two motor vehicles proceeding in opposite directions occurred in the centre of a straight road during the hours of darkness, when both drivers were killed, the inference, in the absence of any other evidence enabling the court to draw a distinction between them, was that each driver was committing almost the same acts of negligence - failing to keep a proper lookout and to drive his vehicle on the correct side of the road - and accordingly both were equally to blame.
 
 
 
In 
 Howard v Bemrose 
 [1973] RTR 32 at p 38, Buckley LJ summarized the principle as follows: 
 
The principle of (
 Baker
`s case) is that when, after all available evidence has been heard, it is clear that on the balance of probabilities there has been negligence on the part of somebody but when, on that evidence, and again on the balance of probabilities, the court is unable to say whether the negligence is that of one party or the other, or of both parties, then it is open to the court - once again on the balance of probabilities to say that the negligence was the negligence of both parties, and then, being without further information enabling the court to apportion the blame, the court will conclude that the parties contributed equally to the accident.
 
 
 
In the present case, I am left in doubt as to where on the river the two boats collided. Given that both the deceased and the defendant were experienced boatmen with some knowledge of the physical conditions of the Serangoon river, I do not think that I can safely postulate scenario one or scenario two as having occurred as that would, in the absence of direct evidence, imply that one of them was grossly negligent. I think that scenario three is more probable taking into account the fact that the collision occurred at about 5 to 6am when it was still dark and when there would be little traffic on the river and it was not safe to travel near the banks. In such conditions the natural inclination would be for the deceased or the defendant to keep to the centre of a narrow channel. Accordingly, I find that the principle in 
 Baker 
`s case 
[1953] 1 WLR 1472
 applies in this case.
Even if my finding that the two boats were probably travelling in the centre of the river when they collided were wrong, my finding on liability would be the same on another ground. It should be recalled that the damage to SF9469 was inflicted on its starboard side. This means, in the absence of any other evidence, that both boats were travelling on their wrong sides. As there is no such other evidence, both must be held to blame, and since I am unable to determine the degree of blameworthiness of each of them, both are equally to blame.
The defendant has, in this case, failed to plead contributory negligence in his defence. His counsel has, at the conclusion of this case, applied to amend the defence to include a plea of contributory negligence. Counsel for the plaintiff has objected to the application, but not too strongly. As I believe that the omission to plead contributory negligence on the part of counsel for the defendant was due to inadvertence rather than confidence, I allow his application.
In the result, there will be judgment for the plaintiff for damages in the sums of $25,250 being half of the agreed quantum and half of the agreed funeral expenses with interest at 3% pa on $17,600 from 20 January 1984 to date hereof and 6% on $1,250 from 20 January 1984 up to today and costs to be taxed on the High Court scale.

This is an appeal by the public prosecutor against the acquittal of the respondent on two charges of corruption under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 104, 1970 Ed) (the Act).
On the first charge (DAC 1487/87) the respondent was charged: 
 
that you, on a day in August 1986 at Temple Estate Contract I worksite, Singapore, being an agent, namely, a clerk-of-works in the employ of the Housing and Development Board, did corruptly attempt to obtain for yourself a gratification of an unspecified amount from one Choo Chin Mun, the project co-ordinator of Evan Lim & Co (Pte) Ltd, as an inducement for showing favour in relation to your principal ` s affairs by agreeing to supervise beyond official working hours the work undertaken by the aforesaid Evan Lim & Co (Pte) Ltd in respect of Temple Estate Contract I, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corrup tion Act (Cap 104).
 
 
 
On the second charge (DAC 1488/87) the respondent was charged: 
 
that you, on a day in August 1986 at Temple Estate Contract I worksite, Singapore, being an agent, namely, a clerk-of-works in the employ of the Housing and Development Board, did corruptly attempt to obtain for yourself a gratification, to wit, a tiling works sub-contract at Temple Estate Contract I valued at $986,477.80 (nine hundred eight-six thousand four hundred and seventy-seven dollars a nd eighty cents) from Evan Lim & Co (Pte) Ltd for Star-Tile General Contractor as an inducement for forbearing to show favour in relation to your principal` s affairs by being lenient in the supervision and thereby ensuring that the work in respect of Temple Estate Contract I could go on smoothly, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 104).
 
 
 
On both charges, the prosecution` s case was based almost entirely on the evidence of Choo Chin Mun, the project co-ordinator of the contracting company, whose evidence was corroborated by the evidence of Evan Lim Lam Hong, the managing director of the contracting company, who was also therefore Choo Chin Mun` s boss.
In the learned judge` s grounds of decision for dismissing both charges against the respondent, it is clear that he formed a poor opinion of these two witnesses. He was greatly influenced in his opinion of them by what he considered to be two material discrepancies in Choo Chin Mun` s evidence. In addition, he was critical of the demeanour in court of Choo Chin Mun, and came to the conclusion that he was not a witness of truth and should be disbelieved. This in turn adversely affected his opinion of the evidence of Evan Lim Lam Hong. 
 
In the court` s view, these discrepancies in Choo` s evidence about his boss` s reaction and the date he reported the incident to his boss seriously raises the question whether such an incident regarding his conversation with Poh as alleged by Choo actually took place. In the court` s view, these discrepancies could not be due to a mere lapse of memory on Choo` s part as the evidence were given within a short period of time.
 
 
 
In the circumstances, the court had serious doubts whether Choo` s evidence that Poh had told him that if Choo could not give this job to his friend ` I don` t think we can work smoothly` is true, and that as this pertains to a vital ingredient of the prosecution` s case the court accordingly acquitted and discharged Poh of this charge. 
 
There is some general final observations which this court must record. Throughout the whole of the prosecution` s case the court had closely observed the demeanours of three prosecution witnesses whilst they were giving evidence. These witnesses are Tan Tian Huat, Choo Chin Mun and Evan Lim Lam Hong.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
As regards Choo Chin Mun, reference has already been made to his two material discrepancies earlier by the court. Apart from that, his demeanour also leav es much to be desired. He did not appear to the court to be a frank and honest witness. Indeed, as exhaustive cross-examination in the later stages of the prosecution` s case revealed, Choo was found to have been given shares by his boss, Evan Lim, in the c ompany Evan Lim & Co (Pte) Ltd and his answers in cross-examination regarding his interest in Evan Lim & Co (Pte) Ltd appears to the court to be unnecessarily vague and evasive:
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
In the court` s view, this is most significant and distur bing as this happened about a month after Evan Lim was called up by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau to give a statement regarding this whole episode. It is also significant that by then Poh himself had lodged a report to the CPIB on 12 September 1986 (see exh P12) alleging, inter alia, that Choo had offered a bribe to him on behalf of this boss.
 
 
 
Seen in the light of these facts, what is even more disturbing to the court is that both Choo and his boss, Evan Lim, could not agree as to why the said substantial amount of shares were allotted to Choo. Whilst Choo stated under cross-examination that he had been given these shares by Evan Lim and even had the gall to deny that he was grateful to Evan Lim for these shares (at p 206 of notes of e vidence), Evan Lim chose not to say why the 150,000 shares were given to Choo. Clearly Choo has an interest to serve, viz that of his boss.
 
 
 
In particular, as will be noted from the above, the learned judge appears to have been over-influenc ed by what he considered to be the unsatisfactory evidence of these two witnesses on the subject of their shareholdings in the contracting company, which was not strictly relevant to the issues before him, almost to the exclusion of consideration by him of the question before him, which was that of determining the weight of the other evidence relevant to the charges which were before him. In my opinion, this led to serious weaknesses in his findings of fact.
In considering an appeal, an appellate court is bound by s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which provides as follows: 
 
No judgement, sentence or order of a District Court or Magistrate` s Court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or agai nst the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
It is also well-settled law that, when a trial judge makes findings of fact based on the credibility of witnesses whom he has had the opportunity to see and assess, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion which the trial judge has formed. An appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge` s decision, must not merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is wrong.
In this connection, counsel for the respondent has also referred the court to the leading cases of 
 Caldeira v Gray 
 
 [1936] MLJ 137 
 and Thomas v Thomas [1947] 1 All ER 582 which have often been cited in these courts. 
But this principle of law, nevertheless, is not absolute and inflexible. The headnote to 
 Caldeira v Gray itself states: 
 
... the appellate court cannot, merely because the question is one of fact, and because it has been decided in one way by the trial judge, abdicate its duty to review his decision, and to reverse it, if it deems it to be wrong.
 
 
 
This is a principle which has long been supported by authorities in our own courts of law and in Malaysia. The appellant` s counsel has cited to me some of these local authorities: 
 Chia Han Kiat v R 
 
 
[1937] MLJ 261
 ; Lee Sang Cheah v R 
 
 
[1946] MLJ 22
 ; PP v Ma` arif 
 
 
[1969] 2 MLJ 65
 ; Loh Jue Tee & Anor v Low Chick Sum 
 
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 332
 . 
In this case, the first charge was attempting to obtain a gratification of an unspecified amount. This attempt was made verbally, payment was not in fact made, and apart from the evide nce of Choo Chin Mun and Evan Lim Lam Hong, there was nothing to support this charge. At the end of the prosecution case, the respondent was called upon to enter on his defence. He did not do so, and chose to remain silent. It was then open to the learned judge, following the principles in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 
 
[1981] 2 MLJ 49
 , to consider the credibility of the prosecution witnesses and, if he was not satisfied as to their credibility, it was open to him to come to the conclusion that the charge against the res pondent had not been proven beyond reasonable doubt. This is what he did. The learned judge having come to this conclusion, the respondent was acquitted. In the circumstances, in reviewing the decision, an appellate court would not be justified to reverse it, and the appeal against the acquittal must be dismissed. 
In the case of the second charge, however, there is clear evidence that an attempt was made by the respondent to obtain a tiling sub-contract for his brother-in-law` s company. A written quot ation (P7) was in fact handed over with a grossly inflated price, and that part of Choo Chin Mun` s evidence as to the repeated follow-up queries by the respondent, as to whether a decision had been made on awarding the sub-contract, was not seriously chall enged. The defence suggested that either the contracting company, or Evan Lim Lam Hong as managing director, brought the allegations against the respondent because of the failure of the pile-cap inspection, and because they therefore wanted the respondent to be transferred by the Housing and Development Board from this contract. This could not be so, however, because from the date in the quotation the attempt by the respondent to procure the tiling sub-contract for his relative was made very much earlier.
At the end of the prosecution case, the respondent was called upon to enter on his defence. This meant that the court had found that a case had been made out against the respondent which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. The respondent chose to remain silent. It is true that, even though the respondent had chosen to remain silent, the court could still decide to acquit him if, having then reviewed the evidence against him, the court should come to the conclusion that the case against him wa s dependent on the evidence of witnesses, and that the credibility of these witnesses had been seriously impugned. In this case, however, there was other evidence, including documentary evidence in the shape of the quotation (P7), and the evidence of Wong Shyr Ling, the respondent` s assistant, and Leong Sui Lam, a partner of his brother-in-law, all of which needed explaining away, and it was incumbent on the respondent to do so. He having declined to do so, the evidence against him remained, and an adverse inference should have been drawn against him. In my judgment, the evidence on this charge was not adequately considered by the judge and, if it had been, he should have come to a different conclusion, that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. In not doing so, his decision is clearly wrong on the evidence, and should be reversed.
In the circumstances, the appeal on the first charge is dismissed. The appeal on the second charge is allowed, and the acquittal is substituted by a conviction under s 6(a) of the Act. [The court heard the respon ` s mitigation plea on 6 November 1990 and sentenced him to six months` imprisonment and to a fine for $10,000, in default another three months` imprisonment.]

This is a motion by the applicant for extension of time to file the petition of appeal in DAC 10514/87. The applicant was charged and tried together with one Ranjeet Singh, the first accused, in a joint trial for two offences under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1985 Ed) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Ed). The first charge was: 
 
That you, Ranjeet Singh and Anuar bin Othman are charged that you, on 22 July 1987, at Spring Season Pte Ltd, 301 Upper Thomson Road, #02-98/12, Singapore, being agents to wit, higher hawkers liaison officer and hawkers liaison officer respe ctively attached to the Hawkers Section, Ang Mo Kio Area Office, Housing and Development Board, Singapo re, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, did corruptly obtain from one Tan Siang Kim, a hawker assistant, a gratification in the form of a lunch treat valued at forty six dollars and ninety cents ($46.90), as a reward for showing favour to the said Tan Siang Kim in relation to your principal` s affairs by assisting him in getting approval for his application to be employed as hawker assistant of stall #01-47 Block 453A, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The second charge was: 
 
That you, Ranjeet Singh and Anuar bin Othman are charged that you, on 22 July 1987, at Spring Season Pte Ltd, 301 Upper Thomson Road, #02-98/12, Singapore, being agents, to wit, higher hawkers liaison officer and hawkers liaison officer respectively attached to the Hawkers Section, Ang Mo Kio Area Office Housing and Development Board, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of both of you, did corruptly obtain from one Tan Siang Kim, a hawker assistant, a gratification in the form of money as a reward for showing favour to the said Tan Siang Kim in relation to your principal ` s affairs by assisting him in getting approval for his application to be employed as hawker assistant of stall #01-47, Block 453A, Ang Mo Kio Avenue 10, Singapore, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(a) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Both the applicant and Ranjeet Singh were on 30 June 1988 acquitted of the second charge after they had entered their defences, but were convicted on the first charge and were each fined $800, in default two months` imprisonment. Both accused were also ordered to pay a penalty in the sum of $15.63, in default three days` imprisonment.
Both the applicant and Ranjeet Singh filed notices of appeal against their conviction. The applicant filed his notice personally. In his affidavit, he has stated that he was unable to engage a solicitor as he had exhausted all his funds, including his children` s savings, to pay solicitor`s fees in connection with the trial on the two charges.
On 23 August 1988, the applicant was served with the grounds of decision and notes of evidence, but he did not know how to prepare the petition of appeal and also did not realize that it had to be filed within ten days from the receipt of the grounds of decision. He did nothing further as he claimed he was ignorant of the procedures and had insufficient funds to engage a solicitor.
Some time in 1989, the applicant read in the newspapers that Ranjeet Singh`s appeal against conviction had been allowed by the High Court. The applicant has now raised sufficient funds to pursue his appeal on the ground that he had been wrongly convicted. The DPP has objected to this application on the ground that it is only in exceptional cases that an extension of time should be given: see 
 R v 
 Moona Mohamed Hussain Marican 
 
 
[1936] MLJ 29
  at p 31. The DPP also referred me to the decision of the Court of Appeal of Brunei in 
 Zulkifli bin Puasa & Ors v PP 
 
 
[1985] 1 MLJ 461
  where the court said at p 462: 
 
There are two factors to be considered upon an application for an extension of time, (1) the length of the delay and whether it can be satisfactorily explained, and (2) whether the out of time application is likely to succeed.
 
 
 
The DPP has submitted that the delay of more than 18 months is inordinate, that the applicant must show that he has an arguable case and that the fact that Ranjeet Singh, his co-accused, has succeeded in his appeal does not necessarily mean that the applicant would also be successful.
I accept the grounds given by the applicant for the delay in making this application as excusable. He was only employed as a hawker liaison officer.
With regard to the second objection that the applicant must show that he has an arguable case, I am not ready to agree with the general proposition that the fact of the setting aside of the conviction of the co-accused does not in itself show merit. In my view, it depends on the facts of each case. In 
 R v Rigby (1923) 17 Cr App R 111, where the appellant was convicted together with a co-accused of stealing and receiving a motor car, Hewart LCJ said at p 113: 
 
In this case it is clear that the appellant never thought that he had any ground for appealing until he heard that Spinney` s conviction had been quashed. In itself the mere fact that a fellow prisoner` s conviction has been quashed is no ground for extending the time for appealing of another prisoner.
 
 
 
It is, however, to be noted that in the present case the applicant did file a notice of appeal in time and so it could not be said against him that he had never thought that he had no ground of appeal even before Ranjeet Singh`s conviction was quashed.
In order to determine whether the applicant has an arguable case, I decided to look into the merits of this case as if I were hearing the appeal as it was the most convenient course to take in the circumstances. Because this was an unusual course to take, I indicated to the DPP and counsel for the applicant that this was what I intended to do and I received no objection from them. I accordingly asked for and have heard full arguments based on the grounds of decision and the notes of evidence to ascertain whether or not the applicant had an arguable case.
The prosecution`s evidence against the second accused on the first charge was as follows: PW1, the approving officer with the HDB, received from the stallholder in July 1987 a letter (P3) for Tan Siang Kim (TSK) to be employed as an assistant. Following that, the stallholder filled up an application form (P4), which was a standard form issued by the HDB to all applicants. P4 required the particulars of the stallholder and of the assistant to be filled in. They were so filled in in a handwriting which the prosecution had not identified at the end of this case. At the bottom of the form, there was a notation that declarations in the form had been explained by Anuar bin Othman, the applicant, on 19 July 1987. On the reverse of the form were two entries which read: 
 
(a) Seen NRIC of Asst.
 
 
 
 
(b) MC attached.
  
 
 
PW1 said that he approved the application on 21 July 1987.
PW4, the general coordinator of the HDB Ang Mo Kio Office, Hawker Section, testified that the accused was in one of his teams of hawker liaison officers and that the said officers were responsible for processing applications by stallholders for the employment of hawker assistants. They also had to ensure that the stallholders had complied with the conditions of their licences.
TSK (PW3) testified that the licensee was his grandmother but that his mother was the registered assistant. Between June and July 1987, a complaint was lodged against the stall for employing TSK without a licence. After that, the applicant and Ranjeet Singh approached him and asked whether he had the application letter (P3) and two photographs. He did not have them. Two days later, the two of them came again and TSK handed to them P3 and two photographs. The second accused then told him that there would be some difficulties in his application. They mentioned that the weather was hot and asked him if he was free in the afternoon. When he replied that he was free, they told him to meet them at the ground floor of Ang Mo Kio area office at 1.30pm. He met the second accused at the ground floor at the appointed time and when the first accused arrived, they got into the first accused` s car. They then took him to Thomson Yaohan where they went into a coffee house where they ordered beer, chilli prawns, fish and chips for lunch. They talked during lunch. TSK asked whether the stall licence could be transferred to his mother`s name or to his name and the two accused told him that that was impossible and that they would have to wait until his grandmother passed away and when that occurred, they would help him to make the arrangements. They also told him that his application to work as a stallholder had been approved and that they had great difficulty in getting this done.
TSK then said that the first accused showed him a certificate but did not give it to him. Subsequently, the second accused told him that they had given help to him and asked whether he could help them. He thought they were asking for money. So he asked them how much they wanted and they in turn asked how much he could give. They carried on with their lunch and after lunch, he paid the bill. The rest of the evidence of TSK was in respect of the second charge.
TSK identified the certificate as P8 and said it was given to him on 24 July 1987. He also said that when P4 was given to him, the second accused filled up the form in the presence of the first accused.
That, in substance, was the case for the prosecution on the first charge. Counsel for the first accused made a submission of no case to answer. Counsel for the second accused made no submission. The district judge called for the defence and both accused gave evidence.
In his grounds of decision, the district judge made the following findings: 
 
In respect of the application (P4) the blank of this form had been handed to PW3 by the second accused sometime before 21 July 1987 in order that he could, inter alia, get his grandmother to affix her thumbprint to it. According to PW3 the first accused was with the second accused when the form was handed to him. After the form had been duly completed by the second accused with particulars supplied by PW3, it was forwarded together with other supporting documents by the second accused to PW1 through the first accused and after PW1 had approved the application on 21 July 1987 the file with the application was returned to the first accused. PW3 eventually received the certificate which officially identified him as a hawker assistant (P8) on 24 July 1987.
 
 
 
The day after the application (P4) had been approved, ie 22 July 1987, PW3, the first accused, and the second accused had lunch together at the Spring Season coffee house at Thomson Plaza.
 
 
 
After referring to the charge, the district judge said: 
 
It is to be noted that in the above charge the ` favour` shown by the two accused to Tan Siang Kim has been particularized, viz ` assisting him in getting approval for his application` . In this case this was done when the forms were brought to PW3 and filled in for him and then submitted to PW1, ie acts that were part and parcel of the jobs of the two accused. It was not the allegation of the prosecution from the facts adduced that the two accused had shown any partiality in favour of PW3. Such being the case that part of the charge which read as ` as a reward for showing favour to the said Tan Siang Kim in relation to your principal` s affairs` could perhaps have been made clearer by wording it as follows: ` as a reward for doing an act in relation to your principal` s affairs` .
 
 
 
I did not at the close of the prosecution case amend the charge because in spite of the wording chosen by the prosecution it was quite clear from the particulars given in the charge and the facts adduced in the prosecution case as to what exactly was being alleged by the prosecution against the two accused.
 
 
 
Having found that the two accused had obtained a gratification in the form of a free lunch, the district judge went on to determine whether or not the gratification was received corruptly. He held as follows: 
 
However from what I have been able to deduce from the submissions of the defence it would appear that it was the case for the defence the gratification was not corruptly obtained in this case because there was no evidence of the two accused favouring PW3 in any way in the process of PW3` s application to be an approved hawker assistant, ie everything was aboveboard and no impropriety was suggested against the two accused. The submission was not a novel one and Wee Chong Jin CJ in the case of 
 Wee Toon Boon v PP had the following to say in respect of a similar submission:
 
 
 
` ... It is submitted that all the acts relied on by the prosecution were in truth commonplace, harmless acts of the kind the appellant as a Member of Parliament was doing all the time for all sorts of people and that the doing of the acts alleged in the charges did not amount to any wrongdoing of the kind which can come within the meaning of the expression ` corruptly` in the Act. In my opinion the fact that the evidence showed that the acts done by the appellant may well have been commonplace acts which members of Parliament here ordinarily do for members of the public who seek their assistance is immaterial. The real question is, and on this the onus is on the appellant to prove the contrary, did the appellant corruptly accept the gratifications as a reward for the acts he had done ... One of the mischiefs aimed at by the Act was to prevent a public officer or public servant from accepting gifts in cash or in kind from a member of the public except in circumstances in which he will be able to show clearly that he has legitimate reasons for doing so.`
 
 
 
From the facts of this case I found that not only had the two accused failed, on a balance of probabilities, to prove that they had not accepted the gratification corruptly but that it had also been proved beyond a reasonable doubt that they had accepted it corruptly. They were accordingly found guilty and convicted.
In my view, the district judge has erred in several aspects in the conduct of the trial and in his reasoning. Firstly, having found that the prosecution had adduced no evidence to sustain the charge of ` showing favour to TSK in relation to their principal` s affairs by assisting him in getting approval for his application to be employed as a hawker assistant` , he should have acquitted the two accused as he was required to do under s 180(f) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC).
Secondly, the act of ` showing favour` was construed by the district judge to mean the ` doing of an act` . I do not think that he was entitled to make such an equation in a criminal charge for a serious offence like corruption, as the fact that the applicant had done an action in relation to the affairs of the HDB was not, as the district judge recognized, necessarily a showing of favour. If they expressed different ideas, I am unable to see how the expression ` showing favour` could have been made clearer by submitting the expression ` doing an act` .
Thirdly, and following from the second reason, it was also not correct for the district judge to say that ` it was quite clear from the particulars given in the charge and the facts adduced in the prosecution case as to what exactly was being alleged by the prosecution against the two accused` . Although the particulars referred to the lunch on a certain date, etc, the most essential particular of the charge was still the 
 showing of favour by assisting TSK in getting approval. The particulars of the charge did not allege that the favour was the filling up of P4. From the applicant` s point of view, he would not have understood that this was the favour for which he was rewarded. There was nothing sinister in the fact of the applicant` s name appearing on that form as he had signed it to signify that he had checked the particulars of PW3. This was a duty of the applicant, again as the district judge had recognized in his grounds of decision. I am una ble to see how the applicant could have known from the particulars of charge and the evidence that he was being charged for helping PW3 in filling up P4 and bringing it to PW1, and subsequently obtaining a lunch from PW3. 
Fourthly, the district judge failed to articulate his line of thinking to counsel for the two accused. He called for the defence without giving any reason. In this situation, how could counsel and their clients have known that the defence was called on a joint charge of ` doing an act` and not ` showing favour`? Of course they did not know. Nor did the prosecutor. The notes of evidence show that counsel did not put to the applicant and Ranjit Singh questions on the specific acts they did by way of assistance to PW3, nor did the prosecut or cross-examine them on these acts with respect to the charge as clarified by the district judge. The cross-examination was substantially in relation to the second charge. In my view, the applicant did not have a fair trial on the charge on which he was convicted.
Fifthly, if the district judge had adopted the normal course of amending the charge pursuant to his powers under s 180(h) of the CPC, defence counsel might well have objected to the legality of the trial continuing on the amended charge on the ground that the Public Prosecutor had not given his consent thereto under s 31 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241). This might have been a fatal objection.
For the above reasons, I hold that the applicant has shown more than an arguable case that his conviction was wrong in law. Counsel for the applicant has advanced other arguments that the conviction was wrong, including the contention that on the evidence the element of common intention was not proved. I do not propose to deal with these arguments, as on the basis of what I have said above, the application to file the petition of appeal out of time will be allowed. His bail is extended on the same terms until the hearing of the appeal against conviction.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff was an Italian seaman. He was first engaged in Singapore in February 1969 by a predecessor company of the first defendant to serve on board its vessel as a second officer. In 1970, the plaintiff was again engaged, but this time in Italy. In ac cordance with the standard procedure and practice of the first defendant and its predecessor, an agreement of engagement was entered into whenever the plaintiff was engaged to serve on board a vessel. All subsequent agreements of engagement would appear to have been executed in Singapore.
From 1969 until his services were terminated on 5 February 1982, the plaintiff had signed numerous agreements of engagement. These agreements were signed by the second defendant as agent for the first defendant. The last such agreement was dated 12 November 1981 when the plaintiff signed up to take command of Esso Chawan. Throughout the entire period of service with the first defendant and its predecessor (hereinafter referred to as ` Esso` ), the plaintiff` s employment was negotiated with and carried out by the second defendant.
The plaintiff has been married to a Singaporean since 1972 and has practically resided here ever since, except for his voyages on board Esso vessels. He was promoted by the second defendant to the rank of captain in 1973 and was given the status of a career master in 1979. The significance of being made a career master was that there would be enhanced benefits, including the payment of wages in between assignments. His wages had always been in Italian lires.
 Events leading to the claim 
On 27 August 1980 Esso Chawan left Singapore under the command of the plaintiff. On 9 September 1980, as the vessel was approaching Port Dickson (approximately two hours before reaching Port Dickson), he felt giddy and was vomiting and had abdominal pains. His condition was such that he could not even be on the bridge to accompany the port pilot to bring the vessel into port. On docking, the plaintiff was brought by the local agent of Esso to see a doctor who after examining him suggested that he be hospitalized. The next day Capt Arrivo called from Singapore (who must have been informed by the agent at Port Dickson) on the phone to inquire about his condition and the plaintiff, being dedicated to his duty, told Capt Arrivo that he would try to take the vessel on to the next port, Penang. He did not tell Capt Arrivo that the doctor had suggested that he should be hospitalized. He merely told Capt Arrivo of his giddiness and upset stomach. Of course at that point the plaintiff did not know what exactly was wrong with himself and I would say not even the doctor at Port Dickson knew the real cause.
The vessel arrived at Penang on 11 September 1980. The plaintiff was admitted into the Penang Medical Centre. His main complaints to the doctor there were giddiness and some weakness in his upper limbs, particularly on the right side. Another feature was his abnormal laughter. He was still being investigated there when at the insistence of the wife of the plaintiff (who had in the meantime arrived in Penang from Singapore) he was on 12 September 1980 brought back to Singapore for further medical treatment. On returning to Singapore the plaintiff was admitted into Jurong Hospital.
On 14 September 1980 the plaintiff was referred to and was examined by a neurologist, Dr Michael Yap (PW6). On Dr Yap` s recommendation the plaintiff was on 15 September 1980 transferred from Jurong Hospital to Mount Elizabeth Hospital. From then until 3 October 1980, the plaintiff was under the care of Dr Yap. The diagnosis of Dr Yap then was that it was likely that the plaintiff had multiple bilateral cerebral emboli.
From 3 October 1980 the plaintiff was convalescing in Jurong Hospital. He was complaining of giddiness and nausea with upper abdominal discomfort. He was otherwise alert, rational and able to walk by himself although slightly unsteady. On 18 November 1980, the plaintiff was certified fit for discharge from hospital for further convalescence at home. At that time his condition had improved, both in terms of motor power and coordination although there was a slight weakness in his right lower limb. He was alert and was conversing sensibly.
On 11 December 1980 the plaintiff returned to Dr Yap for a reassessment as he was feeling restless at home and wanted to return to work. Dr Yap noted that the plaintiff had made a very remarkable recovery and his mental condition was quite normal. He had minimal right hand paralysis and limped slightly in his right leg. Accordingly, Dr Yap recommended to Dr Catherine Ng, who was the general physician to Esso, that the plaintiff might be permitted to do light duties on shore for two months, at the end of which Dr Yap would see him again before he resumed his previous job as a ship captain.
On 22 January 1981, Dr Catherine Ng put the plaintiff through a treadmill test to assess the plaintiff` s cardiac function. No symptoms emerged until stage IV when the plaintiff complained of tired thigh muscle and was unable to continue because of ` dragging of right leg` . Dr Catherine Ng noted that while the plaintiff had recovered gradually from the cerebrovascular accident that occurred in September 1980, there was at that point residual weakness in the right leg.
On 2 February 1981 the plaintiff returned to consult Dr Yap again as he was anxious to get back to sea. Dr Yap, in his report (1PB7) to Dr Catherine Ng dated 10 February 1981, stated that the plaintiff was ` well now ` and ` back to his usual self` . He recommended that the plaintiff be allowed to return to work on board a ship. But having considered the responsibilities of a captain of a vessel he added a proviso that ` in view of his recent severe illness from which he has made an excellent recovery, it is best that he should work with the assistance of either another captain or a first-mate with a master` s certificate for one month or one round trip ... in order to ensure that he is able to function in his previous capacity` . Dr Yap explained to the court that he suggested that precautionary measure to test the plaintiff` s functions; he was concerned about the plaintiff` s ability to make judgment. Dr Yap added that in a sense he was bending backwards to accommodate the plaintiff` s desire to go back to sea.
On 12 February 1981 Dr Catherine Ng certified the plaintiff fit for work and added that the recommendation of Dr Yap should be followed. As it turned out, the plaintiff was in March 1981 sent to take charge of Esso Tumasik at Guam. Esso did not follow the recommendation of Dr Yap. The trip took him from Guam to Singapore. Then in April 1981 he was assigned to take command of Esso Jurong, which sailed to Phuket, Rangoon and Bombay. It was alleged that on the way to Bombay, the vessel encountered stormy weather as it was the monsoon season. The plaintiff` s wife had to threaten Esso in order to make sure that the plaintiff was sent back to Singapore. He flew back from Bombay on or about 20 August 1981.
On 12 October 1981 the plaintiff went for a pre-employment medical examination by Dr Catherine Ng who certified that the plaintiff was fit for employment. In another report dated 19 October 1981 she made the conclusion that the `neurological findings are consistent with an old cerebrovascular accident with good functional recovery` .
On 12 November 1981 the plaintiff signed an agreement of engagement for the purpose of again taking command of Esso Chawan. On 4 January 1982, while the vessel was under pilotage and navigating through the Singapore Straits, it collided with a beacon. On 11 January 1982, he was sent to see one Dr Powell at M/s Bain and Partners, who certified that there had been ` no adverse change in Capt Pancini` s physical condition since previous examinations by Dr Catherine Ng and Dr Michael Yap` . Dr Powell considered him ` fit to continue with his normal duties` . The plaintiff said that it was only at Bain`s clinic that he obtained his whole medical file. On 2 February 1982 the second defendant, on behalf of the first defendant, terminated the plaintiff`s contract of employment of 12 November 1981, with effect from 5 February 1982 (1PB22). It is clear that the plaintiff` s employment was terminated because of the collision. Mr Teddy Yap (DW2), a port captain in charge of services with the second defendant, said so to the court.
On 5 February 1982, the plaintiff consulted Dr VK Pillay, an orthopaedic surgeon in private practice, to determine his physical condition. In his report (1PB11) dated 8 February 1982, Dr Pillay stated the following conclusion: 
 
There is no doubt that this patient is what is termed a right hemiplegic. Though he has recovered to a large extent in cerebral function, there is still residual weakness and marked spasticity in both the right upper as well as the right lower limb. The right ankle clonus troubles him when he wants to put his foot on the ground and on some occasions the whole lower limb would go into jactitation. He cannot be passed as medically fit to assume the position of ship` s captain for his locomotor system is badly affected ... .
 
 
 
On 16 February 1982 the plaintiff went to Dr Loong Si Chin, a consultant neurologist in private practice, who in his medical report (1PB12) stated that: 
 
Neurological examination on 16 February 1982 showed that he had slight spasticity in his right upper limb (forearm pronators) and mild weakness of his right hand (wrist extension, finger extension and finger abduction). He could write legibly although somewhat slowly. In contrast to his right upper limb, the right lower limb was extremely spastic with clonus at the knee and ankle ... .
 
 
 
This patient has a residual right hemiparesis. Recovery in the upper limb can be considered good or even excellent. However, the function of the right leg remains unsatisfactory, due mainly to the severe spasticity which has developed since the stroke ... .
 
 
 
On 16 June 1983 the plaintiff went before the Permanent Medical Commission of the Port Master of Imperia, the authority in Italy which was in charge of private merchant marine. The commission, after examination, declared that the plaintiff was ` permanently disabled for the services of navigation` .
On 22 May 1987, the plaintiff went for a reassessment by Dr VK Pillay who stated in his report (1PB13) that though the plaintiff had shown ` marginal improvement he is still a right hemiplegic with an abnormal gait` . There was still spasticity on the right side especially in the lower limb. Dr Pillay also sent him for a further neurological examination by one Dr Nei I-Ping, who reported that (1PB14): 
 
Mr Pancini has signs of residual right hemiparesis which are likely to be permanent. He will have difficulty with running and climbing. He has some loss of finger dexterity resulting in difficulty with writing. The degree of partial permanent disability is about 40%. He is unfit to be a ship captain. He may be able to perform a sedentary job which does not require too much writing.
 
 
 
In his evidence in court, the plaintiff said that prior to his seeing Dr Pillay on 5 February 1982 no one told him that he had a stroke or damage to the brain. Dr Pillay informed him that he was a hemiplegic. Prior to that he did not realize how serious his illness was. If he had been told what he had suffered he would not have asked to be sent back to sea.
 Bases of the claim 
In this action the plaintiff` s claim falls broadly under two heads - first, for damages on the ground of negligence on the part of Esso and/or the second defendant; and second, for the benefits which are rightfully due to him under the terms of the agreement of engagement.
As the terms of the agreement of engagement would appear to incorporate some aspects of Italian law, the parties have each called an expert on Italian law to testify on his/its behalf. It may be appropriate for me at this juncture to state that it is clear, having heard the evidence of the two Italian experts, that an Italian seaman is entitled to ent er into contracts abroad on terms mutually acceptable to him and a foreign shipowner. There is no question of Italian law applying unless the parties agree that Italian law should apply. The contract signed would govern their relationship (see NE 84: the e vidence of the plaintiff` s Italian expert).
For a better understanding of the issues, I will now set out the relevant provisions of the agreement of engagement dated 27 August 1980, which was the contract in force when the plaintiff fell ill at Port Dickson. 
 
Article VIII - Sickness and Accident Insurance - Pensions - Welfare Assistance
 
 
 
The company shall arrange for sickness and accident insurance providing conditions similar to those applying to the private Italian merchant marine.
 
 
 
In the event of sickness or accident during vacation the company must be notified within three (3) days after certification of disability and vacations will be interrupted only if disability exceeds seven (7) consecutive days.
 
 
 
Notification of disability shall be made to the manning agent.
 
 
 
The company will make contribution to the National Pension Fund according to what is provided for the Italian seamen serving onboard vessels flying a foreign flag withholding from wage the employee` s share of the contribution.
 
 
 
Article XIII - Documents Required
 
 
 
It is a condition of employment that an employee has certain documents appropriate to his rank.
 
 
 
Therefore an employee called for assignment on board shall carry with him the following documents:
 
 
 
- Italian seamen` s book bearing evidence of valid bennal visit by Cassa Marittima, of the professional grade pertinent to rank and, if subject to military service of the permit by port authority to serve on board a foreign flag vessel.
 
 
 
 
- Valid passport. 
 
- International vaccination certificate for smallpox and cholera. 
 
- Liberian licence valid for the rank to be served on board. 
 
- Panamanian certificate of competence valid for the rank to be served on board.
  
 
 
The company shall reimburse the employee for the cost of certificates, photos taxes necessary to obtain the release or the renewal of the following documents and passport:
 
 
 
- vaccination certificate
- Liberian licence 
- Panamanian certificate of competence.
 
 
 
If an employee called for assignment on board does not have the above listed required documents, he cannot be enlist ed and therefore he has no right to reimbursement of living expenses and of travel costs to and from his home. His position will be considered as unavailable for service. If after enlistment, for any cause, the employee is not able upon request because of his negligence, to show the Liberian licence or the Panamanian certificate of competence which entitle him to serve in the rank for which he has been enrolled, the company has the right to consider him as dismissed because of his fault.
 
 
 
The last agreement of engagement which the plaintiff signed with the first defendant was dated 12 November 1981. In the agreement, the printed art VIII therein was cancelled and in its place was inserted a new art XIV which reads as follows: 
 
The company will arrange for coverage under Esso Singapore Pte Ltd`s medical insurance plan. The company will pay for the total insurance premium payable to the insurance company for Plan EIC (Family Certificate). The employee shall comply with and be bound by the terms and conditions of the plan as may be annulled from time to time except as to the employee` s liability to contribute to the insurance premium.
 
 
 
I would state right away that I do not think the agreement of 12 November 1981 has any bearing on the issues in this action. It seems to me clear that the relevant contract was the one that applied in September 1980, when the plaintiff fell sick at Port Dickson. The evidence unequivocally shows that the disabilities, which the plaintiff now suffers, resulted directly from the event that occurred at Port Dickson in September 1980.
Although art VIII of the agreement of engagement dated 27 August 1980 prescribes that Esso would arrange for sickness and accident insurance providing for coverage similar to those applying to the private Italian merchant marine, this was not done. I n fact for quite a long while the second defendant was not sure whether there was an insurance cover taken out for the plaintiff: see 1PB29, 1PB32, 1PB39 and 1DB61 . It would appear that for the period 1 January 1975 to 30 June 1981, Esso was self-insured and assumed the risk itself. Mr Teddy Yap (DW2) has now so confirmed in court. The sort of insurance cover which applies to the private Italian merchant marine is s et out in exh ` P1` , a translation of it into English is found in 1BD9-26.
 Medical evidence 
Dr Pillay (PW1) testified for the plaintiff. His evidence in court basically amplified what he said in his medical reported dated 8 February 1982.
Dr Robert Don (PW2), a medical specialist in private practice dealing in the treatment of stroke patients, also gave evidence for the plaintiff. Based on the medical reports of Dr Thuraisingham of the Penang Medical Centre, Dr Yap, Dr Choo of the Jurong Hospital and Dr Catherine Ng (1PB1-8), Dr Don said that the plaintiff had serious multiple strokes. The plaintiff` s brain, which has no regenerative power, is permanently damaged. In Dr Don` s experience, most stroke patients` memory impro ve with time but there will always be residual problems. There would be perceptual disorders and a person who suffers such a disorder will not appreciate distance and spatial circumstances. In his opinion the plaintiff is not fit to be a captain of a ship.
Of greater significance is the evidence of Dr Yap who told the court that he is now of the opinion that it is highly unlikely that the heart caused the emboli which choked up the brain of the plaintiff; instead he now feels that the plaintiff was su ffering from virus encephalitis, a virus attack brought about by mosquito bites. Though in his clinical notes (exh ` P9` ) Dr Yap did refer to encephalitis, this was never mentioned in his medial reports. He said the residual disability of spasticity which t he plaintiff now suffers is a general degeneration of the condition of September 1980. As Dr Yap was the specialist engaged by Esso to treat the plaintiff from the very start of his illness, his opinion must be given very great weight and which I accept. I would add that it was only when Dr Yap testified in court, or shortly before then, that the plaintiff learned that his condition could have been caused by virus encephalitis.
 Governing law of contract 
This is no real dispute between the parties as to the law that governs the agreement of engagement. The statement of claim does not say anything about it. The defence states that the governing law is that of Panama, the flag state. Mr Mazzochi is of the view that strictly Panamanian law governs the agreement. On the other hand, Mr Cavallari is of the opinion that Singapore law applies. Rather ironically, the plaintiff` s counsel in his final submission said that the proper law of the contract is Italian law. Be that as it may, bo th parties are prepared to proceed as if Singapore law governs the contract of engagement. I may add that the defendants have not introduced any evidence on Panamanian law.
 Claim in negligence 
I will first deal with the claim based on negligence. In my mind there is no doubt that the second defendant, as the agent of the first defendant, had acted with less than reasonable care in sending the plaintiff on board Esso Tumasik without complying with the requirements imposed by Dr Yap and endorsed by Dr Catherine Ng, ie there should be a first officer with a master` s certificate or another captain to assist him and to observe how he functioned as a master. I have noted Mr Teddy Yap` s (DW2) evidence that the recommendation was not practical. If that were indeed the reason I would have expected the second defendant to further consult Dr Yap to ascertain whether it was prudent to send the plaintiff back to sea at all. Dr Yap said he was never consulted on that. In fact he said he never saw the plaintiff again until 1987. Mr Teddy Yap was unable to produce any evidence of further consultation with the company` s doctors.
Further, at that time, the plaintiff was also taking the drug Warfarin, which had the effect of thinning the blood. If the plaintiff should fall or have a cut, he could die from uncontrollable bleeding. Thus, Dr Yap said that he had suggested to the second defendant that the plaintiff should be asked to serve on board a vessel which ply within close proximity to Singapore so that if help were ever required he could be brought back to Singapore quickly.
While it seems clear to me that the defendants had acted with less than the requisite prudence in sending the plaintiff to command Esso Tumasik at Guam, thereby putting at risk the plaintiff` s life and the safety of the vessel, fortunately nothing untoward happened on that voyage.
However, for a claim to succeed it must be shown that the negligence has caused damage or injury or further injury. In response to a specific question put by the court, Dr Yap said that sending the plaintiff back to sea where he encountered rough wea ther would not aggravate his medical condition. Stress could affect his judgment but not his physical state. According to Dr Yap, the spasticity which the plaintiff now suffers is the natural development from the event which occurred in September 1980 (1DB72). This is also very much the view of Dr Don, who stated that what happened between 1981 and 1982 was the gradual development of spasticity in the right upper and lower limbs of the plaintiff following the strokes suffered by the plaintiff in September 1980. It would have been quite a different matter if the plaintiff had received a cut and was then on board a vessel in distant waters and serious injuries were caused to him as a result. But, as I have said, fortunately nothing like that happened.
Another aspect of negligence alleged by the plaintiff is that he was not allowed to be hospitalized in Port Dickson but was instead required to take the vessel up to Penang. The doctor at Port Dickson who saw the plaintiff suggested that he be hospit alized, presumably to keep him under observation. The doctor did not make any diagnosis. But when the plaintiff spoke to Capt Arrivo the next morning, he did not inform the latter of what the doctor at Port Dickson suggested. Neither did he inform Capt Arrivo that he felt he was not fit enough to take the vessel up to Penang. In fact, he said he would try. I note the point made by the counsel for the plain tiff that the company must have realized the seriousness of the injury, otherwise they would not say that they would send a person to relieve the plaintiff at Penang. I think this fact of sending a relief to Penang is quite neutral. It could very well indi cate a concerned employer. I agree that the plaintiff himself did not know and could not have known what was actually wrong with himself. But in the circumstances, I would not be inclined to think that it was negligent of the second defendant to allow the plaintiff to take the vessel to Penang. In any event, there is no need for me to make a definitive finding on this point (and I make no such finding) as there is no evidence to suggest that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff were aggravated as a result of his taking the vessel from Port Dickson to Penang. All the more so when the court is now informed by Dr Yap that the injuries were more probably due to virus encephalitis.
Accordingly, the claim based on negligence must fail. For completeness I may add that the plaintiff` s counsel has also made a number of other allegations of negligence against the defendants. But they do not alter the basic conclusion I have reached on this aspect of the claim.
 Claim based on contract 
I turn next to consider the claim based on art VIII of the agreement of engagement. The first issue I have to decide is: what are the insurance benefits which apply to private merchant marine in Italy and which are incorporated into the contract by vi rtue of art VIII? In my judgment what is incorporated by art VIII is not just the insurance law for seamen in Italy. That would be the minimum. It is the insurance scheme normally applicable to the Italian merchant marine, which could well be above the minimum prescribed by law. To assist the court, the parties have called attorney Egisto Cavallari (PW4) and attorney Maurizio Mazzochi (DW1). Both experts, who specialize in maritime law, agree that Decree No 1124 of 30 June 1965 is one such law which would be incorporated by art VIII. This decree requires an employer to take out insurance for each employee (including a seaman) against injuries sustained on the job and occupational illnesses.
What they disagree on relates to ss 2043 and 2087 of the Italian Civil Code. Section 2043 (a translation into English is in exh ` P6` ) provides that: 
 
whatever fact, fraudulent or negligent, which causes to other parties a damage, compels the one who has committed such an act to reimburse damage.
 
 
 
Section 2087 (a translation into English is in exh ` P7` ) provides that: 
 
the employers are compelled to adopt all necessary means according to the specific requirements of the type of employment and experience which are necessary to ensure the physical existence and wellbeing of the employees and their moral dignity.
 
 
 
An action based on these two provisions is in Italy known as ` danno biologico` . Mr Cavallari is of the view that these two provisions relate to insurance law and are incorporated by art VIII. Mr Mazzochi thinks otherwise. Here, I accept the opinion of Mr Mazzochi that these two provisions have nothing to do with insurance. It seems to me clear that s 2043 provides for what is the equivalent of civil liability for torts (due to negligence or deliberate wrong doing); and s 2087 requires an employer to provide a safe system/place of work for his employees. Even Mr Cavallari has to concede that a claim under s 2043 is not in contract but in tort.
The parties are in agreement that the illness and accident scheme set out in exh ` P1` is the scheme which was applicable to the plaintiff when he suffered the injuries in September 1980. It covers, and here Mr Mazzochi agrees, more than what is required of Esso under Decree No 1124. Clauses B(3) and B(4) of ` P1` (as translated in 1DB18) read as follows: 
 
(3) In the case of permanent, total disability due to injury sustained on the job or some occupational illness:
 
 
 
 
The seaman must supply the Company with suitable medical certificates, which will be passed on to the insurance company. The latter must follow up with adequate checks. Subsequently, the insurance company will compensate the seaman to the tune of the sum of 6 years` salaries. 
 
(4) In the case of permanent, total disability due to injury sustained during vacation leave, or while awaiting embarkation: 
 
The compensation due the seaman, and the documents he must produce are the same as those indicated in paragraph 3. This is as long as the circumstances are covered by the Company` s Group Accident Insurance Policy, which includes those risks which in Italy, are normally covered by a Group Policy for accidents occurring outside of the place of work.
  
 
 
I must emphasize that these two clauses are not clauses in an insurance policy but just broad statements of the scheme of things for the benefit of seamen like the plaintiff. Clause B(3) broadly covers injury sustained on the job and cl B(4) covers injury sustained on leave or prior to embarkation. Both the Italian law experts disagree on what would strictly in Italian law constitute injury sustained on the job; they also disagree on what is occupational illness within cl B(3). Mr Cavallari is of the view that a heart attack would fall within both concepts. He even disagrees with the definition of occupational illness promulgated by the authority in Italy which is in charge of merchant marine and deals with seamen` s claims, Cassa Marittima Tirrena (CMT). CMT defines occupational illnesses as illnesses (at 3DB 44-45): 
 
which are caught during the enlistment and directly caused by the carriage, working and handling of matters and substances which for their particular feature may cause these illnesses.
 
 
 
I accept this definition of CMT, which is in line with the common understanding of the term ` occupational illness` . To qualify as such, it must be shown that the illness is peculiar to the job. There is no evidence presented to me to show how a heart attack is in any way peculiar to the job of a seaman. There is no evidence of any such special linkage.
As regards ` injury sustained on the job` within the meaning of Decree No 1124, both the Italian experts agree that to constitute such an injury there must be some external violent cause. But they disagree on what constitutes external violent cause. As stated above, Mr Cavallari is of the opinion that a heart attack per se is a violent cause. On the other hand, Mr Mazzochi has produced Italian case law to support his view that a heart attack per se cannot be an injury sustained on the job because there is no violent cause in a heart attack as such. He said that violent cause is an ` event external to the worker capable of producing harmful effects with an intense action concentrating in a very short period of time` . To render a heart attack as an injury sustained on the job, something more by way of violent external force must be present which brings about the heart attack, eg a fall or being struck by an object. He cited 
 Lupi` s case (at 3DB101) in support of his view. 
For reasons which should have been apparent, the initial case of the plaintiff was that the injuries were caused by a heart attack. This was based on the earlier medical reports. However, as I have indicated above, when Dr Michael Yap was called by the plaintiff to testify in court he said that it is more probable that the injuries which the plaintiff suffered were caused by virus encephalitis, which was brought about by mosquito bites. This new element is significant in considering whether there was any violent cause in the context of the injuries which the plaintiff sustained.
The authorities cited by both experts are in some instances not easy to follow; and part of the reason is that the translation of the Italian text does not come out quite so clearly. The following reports appear interesting and relevant: 
 
in this case the court admitted as injury on the job the death of the worker who, already suffering from arteriosclerosis and hypertension, had got such an emotional stress in consequence of a dispute with his superior as to cause him a mort al outcome about an hour later (at 3DB55).
 
 
 
In order to qualify a damaging event as violent cause of an injury on the job, pursuant to ... N1124, it is necessary and, at the same time, sufficient for this event to damage the worker` s organism, acting 
 ab extrinseco through a determined and quick action, while the requirements of extraordinariness, casualness or unexpectedness of the damaging fact are not essential as, being not referred to in the law provisions, they are pure occasional aspect of them, not characterizing, although frequent or even usual ... (at 3DB51).
 
 
 
The violent cause, provided by art 2, N1124 as a genetic fact of the injury on the job covered by the relevant insurance is a determined, quick and intense action which caused injuries to the workers` organism. (at 3DB53)
 
 
 
Exhibit ` P13` contains a translation in English of a treatise on social security written by one Beneditto Bussi. The following statement in ` P13` dealing with microbial causes is, I think, pertinent: 
 
A violent cause is not a violent occurrence which causes an injury, but an occurrence which is a violent cause of injury, which means, at the commencement of the insurance, implied that the defeat of the interpretation which was designed to restrict the accident insurance only to traumatic violent causes. For the case in question, therefore, it is absolutely irrelevant that the way of penetration of the pathological germs into the human body, since the violent cause is only the biological power which penetrated into the body. Most typical cases are tetanus ... virus hepatitis.
 
 
 
Another publication, exh ` P14` (a collection of court cases), as translated, reads as follows: 
 
The onset of a seaman` s pneumococcus meningitis who is working in a tropical climate, can indeed be considered as an accident at work, since we have to consider the specific climatic conditions as a violent cause and the circumstance to be a t work as the necessity to be exposed to the tropical climate. Environmental conditions, known to everybody, in the case in question, don` t require to be specifically proved, the same can be said for the scientific knowledge.
 
 
 
Lupi` s case (see 3DB148) which is very much relied upon by the first defendant has a few distinguishing features. There Lupi had been suffering for a long time from ` arterioschlerosis and obliterative arterioscopy of the lower extremities` . The court found that he died in his cabin from natural causes and that he did not die from an injury sustained on the job. There was an allegation that Lupi suffered great stress for two days prior to his death because of foul weather. But his death only occurred 18 hours after the storm had subsided.
Mr Mazzochi agrees that a mosquito bite might be sufficient to constitute the external force. He has told this court that ` violent cause can consist of virus` . I think that must be so. But he has further explained (when shown ` P14` ) that for an injury or disability which is caused by a mosquito bite to fall within the ambit of injury sustained on the job ` there must be a specific risk of the [plaintiff by virtue of the] job being exposed to mosquito bites, not a risk which everyone is exposed` . He is of the view that a mosquito bite is not per se connected with or related to the job. It may happen to any person outside the job.
On the other hand, Mr Cavallari says that, ` violent cause is the biological power which penetrates into the body - it does not matter whether it is a log of wood or a mosquito ... Any virus action is violent cause ... .` He also says that whatever injury a seaman sustains on board a ship, that injury is sustained on the job. This is because a seaman is on the job 24 hours, starting from the moment a voyage commences. Even specific climatic conditions may be considered as a ` violent cause` .
In short, while Mr Mazzochi agrees that a mosquito bite could constitute the external force, he is saying that is not all. There must be an added factor: that the job as such exposed the plaintiff to the specific risk of being bitten by mosquitoes, like going to a mosquitoes infested area. Turning to Mr Cavallari` s argument I see it is attractive up to a point. He says a seaman goes wherever the vessel takes him. A seaman is exposed to all kinds of environment with diverse risk, some known and some unknown. That may be so. But t here is no evidence that the plaintiff had gone to a mosquitoes infested area, exposing him to some peculiar risks which the plaintiff would not otherwise be exposed. Otherwise there would be nothing to link the injury with the job.
I am inclined to accept Mr Mazzochi` s view that it has not been shown that the plaintiff` s injuries were sustained on the job within the meaning of Decree No 1124. But that does not conclude the matter. There is still the scheme under ` P1` to consider. Clause B(3) in ` P1` should be read together with cl B(4). They are complementary. If one were to take the narrow view in considering cl B(3), then it would mean that the mosquito bites (and the consequential injuries) sustained by the plaintiff were not injuries sustained on the job and thus did not fall within that clause; yet if the same mosquito bites were shown to have been sustained by the plaintiff before embarkation, then his claim would (subject to what I am going to say on the proviso to cl B(4) in the next paragraph) fall within cl B(4) and he would be entitled to the compensation provided therein. To take another example. A seaman was standing on the top deck while the ship was at the dock. A naughty boy threw a metal piece at him and struck him on the head, causing a fatal injury. Certainly, that injury had nothing to do with his work as a seaman. Yet if he were on leave and standing at the wharf and a similar injury should be sustained by him, he would be covered by cl B(4). Such a result would not be in consonant with good sense. It seems perverse. Considering the essential nature of such an illness and accident scheme as in ` P1`, I do not see any logic why an injury sustained by a seaman on leave should be covered and yet the same injury if sustained while he was at work would not be covered. I would have thought that the rationale for covering such an injury sustained while at work is even stronger. In this regard, I recall the evidence of Mr Mazzochi who said that the benefits set out in ` P1` are better than those required to be provided under Italian law. Quite clearly the scheme of things provided under ` P1` stands on its own as it has gone well beyond the basic requirements of Italian law. An interpretation based exclusively on Decree No 1124 is not conclusive as to the scope of ` P1` . Decree No 1124 is the equivalent of our workmen`s compensation. I would reiterate that art VIII of the agreement of engagement does not incorporate just the Italian insurance law for seamen. It incorporates the sickness and accident insurance scheme which normally applies to the private Italian merchant marine. As the court now understands it, ` P1` is the sort of insurance scheme that applies. So even if under the strict Italian law of Decree No 1124, the injuries suffered by the plaintiff could not be considered to be sustained on the job, I would hold that they are covered by ` P1`, either under cl B(3) or B(4). There is no evidence before me to show whether the plaintiff was bitten before or after he embarked on Esso Chawan on 27 August 1980. All we know is that encephalitis has an incubation period of 4 to 21 days (see exh` P10` ). Since the benefits under cl B(3) and B(4) are the same, it makes no difference. Otherwise I might have to consider recalling the parties to establish, if possible, the more likely period when the plaintiff was bitten by the mosquitoes.
There is one other aspect in relation to cl B(4) which I must address as it has a direct bearing to the reasoning in the immediately preceding paragraph. It concerns the proviso to cl B(4). The proviso reads: 
 
This is as long as the circumstances are covered by the company` s group accident insurance policy, which includes those risks which in Italy, are normally covered by a group policy for accidents occurring outside of the place of work.
 
 
 
Esso has not produced any company`s group accident insurance policy to show the scope of its coverage. Esso had not taken out any policy to cover the plaintiff even though art VIII and cl B(3) and B(4) of ` P1` clearly contemplate the taking out of such a policy or group policy. By default Esso became self-insured. In the absence of such a group policy, I am inclined to think that there is no scope for the proviso to apply. Even if I were wrong to take that view, then in the context of cl B(4) it is for Esso to show that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff fall outside those risks which in Italy are ` normally covered by a group policy for accidents occurring outside the place of work` . They have not produced any group policy, whether of their own or of any other shipowners/employers, to illustrate what is the norm. Esso should not benefit from its own default in not taking out a policy or group policy. On the other hand, there is evidence from Mr Cavallari(NE 98) who says that big companies in Italy do take up insurance cover for their top executives even for heart conditions, which is above their legal obligations. Mr Cavallari has also referred to a collective agreement which provides that if a ship is over 3,000 tonnes, the coverage would extend to more risks and the amount insured would be greater. It is pertinent to note that under cl A(4) of ` P1` (see 1DB17) compensation is even paid for illness caused by venereal disease. And when it is intended to exclude a specific illness or injury, ` P1` is also explicit: see cl A(5) on illness caused by alcoholic abuse. Indeed Mr Mazzochi has conceded that ` P1` covers ordinary illness.
In the light of the above, I find that the injuries suffered by the plaintiff come within either cl B(3) or cl B(4) of ` P1` and he is entitled to the compensation prescribed therein.
 Quantum of damages 
I now come to the question of quantum. The plaintiff claims damages under three heads:
 
 
(i) insurance benefits under art VIII of the agreement of engagement; 
 
(ii) damages under s 2087; and 
 
(iii) retrenchment benefits - one month for each year of service, plus an additional five months under exh ` P15` .
  
 
 
For the reasons which I have given above, the claim based upon s 2087 cannot succeed. As regards retrenchment benefits, Esso does not dispute that the plaintiff is entitled to 13 months` pay for 13 years` service. This amounts to 30,365,114 lires (2,335,778 lires [times ] 13). ` P15` is a ` Collective National Work Agreement for Master Mariners in command of ships in Free Commission` . But the agreement was concluded on 30 October 1981, well after the event which is the subject of this action. Accordingly, the benefits provided thereunder can have no application to the present claim.
There is, however, a difference of view between Mr Cavallari and Mr Mazzochi as to the amount payable under the insurance claim. Exhibit ` P8` sets out the calculatio n of Mr Cavallari. The calculation of Mr Mazzochi is to be found in 3DB163. Mr Cavallari` s calculation is as follows: 
 
2,335,778 x 12 = 28,029,336 lires
 
 
 
1 Amount payable to Capt Pancini 28,029,336 x 9.899 = 227,462,397.00 lires(multiplier of Cassa Marittima)
 
 
 
 
(2) Amount payable in respect 28,029,336 x 9.655 = 13,531,161.95 lires 
 
of Mrs Pancini (division of 20 
 
Cassa Marittima) 
 
(3) Amount payable in respect 28,029,336 x 6.05 = 8,478,874.14 lires 
 
of Capt Pancini` s son (division of 20 
 
Cassa Marittima) 
 
Total: 299,472,433 lires
  
 
 
Mr Mazzochi` s calculation is as follows: 
 
maximum conventional annual wages: 11,549,000
 
 
 
 
injured 40 years 10,616 
 
time elapsed 0 + 0,458 
 
11,074
  
 
 
11,549,000 x 11,074 = 127,893,626
 
 
 
wife 40 years 9,454
 
 
 
 
time elapsed 0 + 0.458 
 
9,912
  
 
 
11,549,000 x 1/20 x 9,912 = 5,723,684
 
 
 
son 8 years 5,008
time elapsed 0 + 0,15 
5,158
 
 
 
11,549,000 x 1/20 x 5,158 = 2,978,487
 
 
 
136,595,797
 
 
 
At this junction, I would observe that while cl B(3) and B(4) specify that the compensation payable shall be six years` salaries, the manner in which both Mr Cavallari and Mr Mazzochi have worked out the claim shows something quite different from a simple calculation of the monthly wages multiply by 72 months. The method used by them has three components, ie for the plaintiff himself, his wife and his son. According to Mr Mazzochi, CMT will pay whichever is more favourable to the seaman, ie either a straight six-year calculation or based on this special formula (NE 112).
It will be noted that the most significant difference between the two calculations relates to the annual wages. Whereas Mr Cavallari used the actual monthly wages multiplied by 12 to obtain the annual wages of the plaintiff at 28,029,336 lires, Mr Mazzochi adopted the maximum conventional annual wages of 11,549,000 lires. Mr Cavallari agreed (at NE 85) that Italian law does provide for maximum conventional wages but explained that taking into account the exchange rate it would work out to about the same figure. Mr Cavallari also said that the figure 11,549,000 lires represents the minimum and not the maximum annual wages. Mr Mazzochi produced to court a ministerial decree issued on 3 July 1980 (exh ` D4`) to show that for senior marine officers the maximum limit is 11,549,000 lires. In so far as the multipliers are concerned, those adopted by Mr Mazzochi are generally more favourable to the plaintiff. The ironical thing about both these two calculations is that though they are different, they have both been approved by senior staff of CMT as being correct!
Be that as it may, I find that the calculation adopted by Mr Mazzochi in 3DB163 is more likely to be correct, particularly having regard to exh ` D4` . I accept that 136,595,797 lires is the correct sum. But there is a further aspect to this question. As a straight calculation of six years` wages amount to 168,176,016 lires, which is more than 136,595,797 lires, I hold that the sum due to the plaintiff is 168,176,016 lires, being the more favourable of the two. This will also be in accord with what is provided in cl B(3) and B(4).
There is one other point of dispute between Mr Cavallari and Mr Mazzochi. Whereas the former is of the opinion that the compensation payable should be 100% the latter thinks it should be 40% only. This difference arises because in term of a whole person, both parties agree that the disability which the plaintiff now suffers amounts to only 40%. But what Mr Cavallari contends is that in so far as being a seaman is concerned, the disability which the plaintiff now suffers is 100%; he will never be able to be a seaman again. I accept Mr Cavallari`s views as being correct. We are here concerned with an insurance scheme for the benefits of a seaman. And if he can never be a seaman again, the disability, in so far as that vocation is concerned, must be 100%.
 Miscellaneous issues 
There remain two other issues which I must address. First, does art XIII impose an obligation on the employer to ensure that the plaintiff undergo his biannual check in Italy. Mr Mazzochi expresses the opinion that art VIII does not impose any obligation on the shipowners. Instead, that provision imposes an obligation on the employee to have the biannual check done and entitles the employer, if this is not complied with by the employee, to refuse his enlistment and not to reimburse the travel costs incurred by the employee to reach the port of embarkation. However, Mr Cavallari contends that there is a duty on both the shipowner and employee to obtain the biannual clearance. In my judgment, this issues involves a pure question of construction of art XIII. I do not think that the article, which is to be construed according to Singapore law, could reasonably be read to mean that the contract has incorporated all the Italian laws relating to the biannual check. All it means is that without the biannual check, the employer has a discretion not to engage the seaman. In the context of the present case, I accept the plaintif f` s contention that being a career master, he could not just leave his station on his own to go for the biannual check without first obtaining permission (and perhaps the necessary air passage) from the defendants. By not granting permission or providing t he air passage, Esso had in effect waived the need for biannual check. In any event, the question of biannual check is really quite immaterial for the present proceedings for two reasons. First, in September 1980, Esso was effectively self-insured. We are not here concerned with a cover administered by the CMT, though it is recognized that the CMT would not have covered a seaman who did not have a current biannual check endorsed on his seaman` s book. Second, the injuries suffered by the plaintiff in September 1980 were not due to any inherent disease of the plaintiff which could have been detected on a biannual check. We have now heard from Dr Yap that the injuries were caused by virus encephalitis, brought about by mosquito bites.
The second question is whether the plaintiff is right to have sued the second defendant; was there a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the second defendant. Initially the plaintiff sued only the second defendant. But in the light of the defence filed by the second defendant, the first defendant was added as a party. From the various agreements of engagement, it is quite clear that at all times the second defendant was acting as an agent for the first defendant. It is true that throughout the entire period the plaintiff was dealing directly with the second defendant. It was the second defendant` s fleet evaluation committee that promoted him to be a career master. But the fact remains that the second defendant had at all material times acted as agent and manager of the first defendant in all these matters. The fact that under their mutual arrangements, the first defendant had accorded wide discretion to the second defendant in the recruitment and management of staff on board its vessels did not render the second defendant any less an agent. I am conscious of the reasons the plaintiff is contending so strenuously that his contractual relationship was with the second defendant. The plaintiff is concerned that there might be difficulties in enforcing this judgment against the first defendant, a company incorporated outside Singapore. Indeed, during the course of the hearing of this case, the identity of the first defendant has changed. It was previously Esso Eastern Marine Ltd incorporated in Bermuda. Now that is replaced by Esso International Shipping (Bahamas) Co Ltd. I do not believe that a multinational of the stature of Esso (and here I am using Esso in the widest sense as a group) would, under the guise of corporate structure, deny the plaintiff his just due under this judgment. I am confident that this concern is misplaced. I accordingly find that the person liable to the plaintiff is the first defendant and not the second defendant.
In the result, I order that judgment be entered against the first defendant in the total sum of 198,541,130 lires, made up of 168,176,016 lires in respect of the insurance claim and 30,365,114 lires in respect of retrenchment benefits, with interest to be calculated at 6% from 10 June 1982, the date the writ was issued. Counsel for the plaintiff urged upon me to convert the sum due to the plaintiff into Singapore dollars at the rate of exchange prevailing in 1982. As is well known, exchange rates fluctuate. They could go up; they could also come down. In the present case, I appreciate that the Singapore Dollar has in the intervening years strengthened vis-Ã -vis the Italian lires. But I think it is only fair that the risk of exchange rate fluctuation be borne by the parties. The claim against the second defendant is accordingly dismissed. I will now hear the parties on costs.

This is an action for damages made under ss 8 and 12 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed) in relation to the death of one Lim Kim Tong (LKT) following an accident on 19 December 1981 at a construction site which was, at the material time, occupied by the second defendants. The claim against the first defendants (who were the owners of the site) was, by consent, discontinued at the conclusion of the hearing of this action.
The second defendants were building contractors who were constructing a 25-storey block of flats (the building) for the first defendants. The site of the building was bounded on one side by a large canal, viz the Alexandra Canal and on the opposite side by Ganges Road, and on one side by a school, viz the Delta West School, which was fenced off from the site, although there was a gate leading into the site, and on the opposite site by another road, viz Delta Road.
On the date of the accident, the second defendants had already completed the entire structure of the building and were in the course of hacking the uneven walls in preparation for plastering them. During the construction of the building a safety net had been strung across the walls to catch any falling stones and debris. A gondola was used to hack the 25 floors of the building. It was hanging beside the wall on the 14th level at the time of the accident. Also, during construction, the public was prevented from having access to the works by a wooden fence or hoarding. Both the safety net and the fence was also taken down after the completion of the structure.
There was located on the ground floor of the building at the material time a coffee stall. This stall was operated by a licensee of the second defendants from the beginning of the construction works to cater to the needs of the workers. There is a conflict of evidence as to whether members of the public were disallowed from buying drinks and food from this stall. The plaintiffs have produced three witnesses who testified that members of the public had full access to the stall and frequented the stall as it was the only coffee stall within the surrounding area. The second defendants` witness, the supervisor, said that the stallholder was allowed to sell drinks and/or food to the workers and no one else. Having heard the witnesses, I believe the evidence of PW1 and PW2 and find that there was no restriction whatever against the stallholder selling drinks and food to any person who patronized it. The coffee stall was accessible to members of the public. There was no conceivable reason for them to do so since the second defendants claimed that they had put up adequate fencing/hoarding to prevent members of the public from going into the construction site. In any case, the important point was whether at the material time, the site and the coffee stall were accessible to the public. In my view, the evidence clearly establishes that both were accessible to the public.
The question is whether the second defendants were negligent as regards LKT, who was a member of the public. LKT was then living at Block 79, Indus Road which was situated next to the building site. He was then 18 years old. His friend, Lim Hang Huat (PW2), testified that on the afternoon of 19 December 1981 at about 1pm, he and LKT went to a nearby kampong to catch spiders. It began to rain about half an hour later. They wanted to look for shelter in the building as well as have a cup of coffee. They ran to the building, went under it on the ground floor on one side of it and continued to run towards the coffee stall. To reach the coffee stall by the most direct route, they have to cross an open space between two sections of the building. As they were crossing this space, LKT who was running ahead, was struck by something falling from above. PW2 heard the sound of a stone or a lump of cement. LKT fell on the ground. Something also fell on PW2`s thigh but he was not injured. LKT began to bleed and appeared unconscious. PW2 dragged him into the covered section of the building. The Indian stallholder and some workers came to look. PW2 ran to inform PW1, the father of LKT.
PW1 testified that upon being informed of the accident, he ran to the site. He found LKT lying on the ground and bleeding. It was raining heavily. He carried his son to the side. LKT was conscious and `struggling` and shouting that someone threw a stone at him. Later the ambulance arrived and took him to hospital. He fell into a coma in hospital and died on 25 December 1981.
The post-mortem report on LKT disclosed that he died from a fracture of the skull. His skull had `a large burr hole at right parietal bone 8 x 7 cm. There was a fracture of the right temporal bone 8cm with extradural haemorrhage.` The coroner found and I agree with him that the injury was caused by a hard object falling on the head of LKT.
I also find as a fact from the evidence adduced by the defence witness that the hard object was probably a stone or a lump of hardened cement which had fallen from the side of a wall or the gondola which was hanging in the air next to the wall. The profile of a `burr hole` in the skull would suggest, most likely, a piece of hardened cement. Whatever it was, it either came off the wall or fell from the gondola. I have already mentioned that at this time the defendants were hacking the uneven walls of the building, and it may therefore be inferred that the falling object was a lump of uneven hardened cement.
The next issue of fact on which I make a finding is that on the evidence adduced before me there was insufficient reason for the second defendants` workers to remove the safety net in order to do the hacking work. DW2, the site foreman, testified that the net was removed because it impeded access to the gondola. I cannot agree. He was unable to explain why the net could not have been strung up in a way which allowed access to and from the gondola. In fact, he said that the safety net was taken off because it was their practice to do so. If the netting had not been taken off, this particular tragedy would not have happened. I think that the workers failed to appreciate the hacking work would pose a risk of injury to members of the public by falling lumps of cement.
It was also a fact in issue whether the defendants had placed warning signboards on the building to warn the public to keep out of the site. The plaintiffs called two witnesses to testify on this issue. One of them (PW4), the brother-in-law of the deceased, who was also living in Block 79, testified that he went to the scene of the accident at about 2pm to take a look. He saw a pool of blood at the spot where LKT had fallen. He did not see the signboard (as shown in P9 which photograph was taken sometime after the accident. Since it was taken by the police in daylight, it could only have been taken on the following day at the earliest). After that he went home, and shortly after that he saw a red car stopping near the place of the accident and three or four men taking out signboards from the boot of the car. The men then nailed the signboards to the building. He, of course, would not see P9 being marked to the building. He also said that he informed his wife, who was LKT`s sister, and also other members of LKT`s family what he had seen the following day.
The second witness was PW3, a reporter with the 
 Sin Chew Jit Poh. 
He testified that he received a telephone call from PW1 on the day of the accident. He and his photographer went to LKT`s house but were told that PW1 was at the hospital. They went to the hospital and met PW1 who told them about the condition of LKT and the nailing of the signboards after the accident. On the following day, he went to the site with PW1 who repeated his allegation concerning the signboards. PW3 and his photographer took a look at P9. He observed that the nails were new and not rusty. He and the photographer agreed with PW1`s allegation about the signboards having been put up very recently. They then wrote a report about the accident which was published in the newspaper the following day.
The defendants called three witnesses to testify on this issue. The first, DW1, was a sergeant then attached to the Tanglin Police Station. He was informed about the accident at about 5.05pm but he did not visit the scene until about 7pm-7.30pm when it was already dark. [In his evidence at the coroner`s inquiry, he said he arrived at the scene at about 7.40pm]. He said he saw P9 and another signboard. However, this other signboard was not shown in any of the photographs tendered in court. In my view, DW1`s evidence was wholly inadequate and was insufficient to prove that P9 had been there before the accident.
The second witness for the defence was DW2. His evidence was that there were signboards on all sides of the building prior to the accident. He said that they were put up after the completion of the ground level of the building, and that the signboards were in three languages.
The third witness, DW4, was a former safety officer employed by the HDB whose job was to inspect all the sites where the HDB had buildings under construction. He was in charge of more than 100 sites. He said he saw warning signboards on the building when he visited the site about two months before the accident. However, he could not mark them correctly at the locations he said he had seen them. In my view, the evidence of DW4 was also of no assistance to the defendants.
The only independent witness in relation to P9 was PW3. He was a reporter who had been informed of the accident and he went there to investigate. I accept his evidence that when he looked at P9 he found that the nails were new and not rusty. Since DW2`s evidence was that P9 had been there since the completion of the first storey, it was impossible for the nails not to have been rusty. Accordingly, I find that P9 was put up immediately after the accident before the arrival of PW3.
To summarize my findings of fact: at the material time, (a) the building was not fenced off; (b) it was accessible to the public; (c) the coffee stall next to it was also accessible to the public, members of which patronized it; (d) hacking work was going on; (e) there was no safety net to prevent falling debris from injuring any person who happened to be at that spot; (f) a gondola was left hanging in the air between the walls; and (g) there was no signboard warning people not to go to the site or walk through the building. The question is whether the defendants were negligent in these circumstances.
The submission of counsel for the defendants was that the defendants owed no duty of care to LKT as he was a trespasser who had also been warned by signboards of the dangers of entering the site. He also submitted that even if there were no signboards, LKT, by reason of his age, ought to have known of the dangers and therefore the duty of care owed to him was an attenuated duty. Counsel relied on the House of Lords decision in 
 British Railways Board v Herrington 
[1972] AC 877
 as laying down the principle that an occupier only owed a `duty of ordinary humanity`, which was `at once more demanding than a duty merely to avoid reckless or intentional injury [which was the law before 
 Herrington 
 `s case], but less demanding than a duty to take reasonable care.` See 
 Clerk and Lindsell on Torts 
 (15th Ed) at para 12-52 [635].
Counsel for the plaintiffs relied on the decision of the Federal Court in 
 Lembaga Letrik Negara v Ramakrishnan 
 
 
 [1982] 2 MLJ 182 
 where it was decided, following 
 Herrington 
`s case and 
 Southern Portland Cement Ltd v Cooper 
[1974] AC 623
 that `the duty owed to trespassers arises when the occupier knows of facts which show a substantial chance that they may come to a place where there is danger which he has created or knows about, and that the duty is discharged by the occupier taking such steps to avoid it in acwith the dictates of common humanity and in the light of his own circumstances and financial limitations`.
In my view, the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs shows that at the material time members of the public had full and unrestricted access to the site to patronize the coffee stall, which was run by a licensee of the defendants. There was no evidence whatever, apart from a mere assertion, that the stallholder was not allowed to sell food and/or drinks to people other than the workers. There was then no fence around the site, and people were allowed to come and go. On this evidence, I do not think that LKT and PW2 were trespassers. They sought shelter at the site when it was raining and they did so because they also wanted to have a drink. Since Block 79, which was where he lived, was just behind the building, LKT could have run home or sought shelter in some other buildings nearby. There was evidence that there was no other coffee-stall in the vicinity. I find that LKT and PW2 were licensees in the sense that they were free to patronize the coffee stall. In any case, even if they were trespassers, the defendants ought to have foreseen such trespassers coming to the coffee stall to patronize it: see 
 Clerk and Lindsell 
 at para 12-55 [640] where the principle is stated, which I accept, that: `[T]he occupier ought in principle to be liable to a trespasser who is injured by the occupier`s breach of duty towards his lawful visitors, if there are any; but, as a substantive rule of law - a qualification upon 
 Herrington 
`s case - an occupier ought not to be so liable to an adult who tresknowingly and without any reasonable excuse for doing so.` In the present case, LKT did not know of the danger and he had a reasonable excuse to come into the site.
Stones and debris falling from the high floors of building sites are common occurrences. This is particularly so when the work involved is hacking of the walls. Bits of the hacked wall are likely to fall onto the gondola or down to the ground. I think that the works created a danger and there ought to have been a safety net at the second level to catch falling debris. There was such a safety net but, it was reasoned by the second defendants` workers for the wrong reason. I think that they followed past practice and could not be bothered to exert the extra effort to put up the safety net in a manner which did not impede the operation of the gondola. The defendants, for no good reason, removed the safety net, and his reason for doing so was that it was their practice to do so.
On the evidence before me, I find that the second defendants owed a duty of care to all those who came to the site to patronize the coffee stall, that they accordingly owed a duty of care to LKT, that they breached their duty of care in not putting up a safety net where and when their employees were hacking the walls of the building. The works created a danger and LKT was a foreseeable victim. Accordingly, I find for the plaintiffs on the question of liability. There was no question of contributory negligence on the part of LKT.
I now assess damages. LKT`s employer, PW6, at the material time testified that LKT was assisting him at his hawker stall selling turtle soup. LKT was paid $15 per day with $4 allowance for meals. As PW6 was also a wholesaler of turtles which were imported from Indonesia, he would also send LKT to the airport twice a week to take delivery, for which LKT was paid $20 per trip. LKT worked six days a week. On this basis, LKT`s annual earnings would be $19 per day x (365-52) = $5,947 + $2,080 ($40 x 52) = $8,027 per year. PW6 did not say that LKT was paid any CPF. PW6 also said that some of his assistants had opened their own stalls selling turtle soup and that he himself was earning net about $3,000 to $5,000 per month selling turtle soup.
The defendants called an investigator, DW3, to investigate the earnings of LKT. He said that he visited PW6`s stall twice, but managed to meet a man who said that he was the boss of LKT and that LKT was being paid $8 per day. I am not able to admit this evidence as PW6 was not cross-examined on this point nor was DW3 asked to testify PW6. Without identification, this evidence was hearsay.
The plaintiffs also called LKT`s mother as a witness and she testified that LKT was giving her about $300 per month.
Special damages have been agreed at $3,457. I award $7,000 for loss of expectation of life and $1,500 for pain and suffering during the short period LKT was conscious.
This is a claim for lost years. I find it impossible to assess the prospective earnings of LKT. He was 18 years old when he died. He left school at primary five. He was then a hawker assistant, earning very good wages, compared with his two previous jobs. But his job was precarious. Counsel for the plaintiffs has suggested that I should assess his maximum earning during his lifetime, had he lived, at $4,000 since PW6 was earning $3,000 to $4,000 per month on the basis that he might have become a turtle soup seller and earning that amount. I find no basis for making an assumption that LKT might have become a turtle soup seller or that he might have earned between $3,000-$4,000 net per month. He might have gone through life as a hawker assistant or as an unskilled worker. Accordingly, I will assess his earnings as at about $8,500 pa. As for the available surplus, I would find that it would be in the region of 40%, having regard to the fact that he was giving his mother $330 per month. The multiplier is agreed at 15.
On this basis, the damages for lost years would be $8,500 x 15 x 40% = $51,000. The total damages are $51,000 + $3,457 + $7,000 + $1,500 = $61,415. There will be judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $61,415, with interest at the rate of 6% pa from the date of the writ to the date of judgment and costs to be taxed.
 Order accordingly.",1990-12-27 00:00:00,SG High Court

This was an appeal by the first and second defendants (the first and second appellants herein) against a decision of the learned magistrate who held that the first defendant was responsible to the extent of 85% for a motor accident which occurred on 30 November 1986 along Dunearn Road. The third party was held to be liable only for 15%. I allowed the appeal and held that the third party (the respondent in this appeal) was wholly responsible for the accident. I ordered that the third party indemnify the defendants to the extent of 100% of the damages and costs which the defendants were ordered to pay to the plaintiffs. I also ordered the third party to pay the defendants` costs here and below. I now give my reasons.
The accident happened on 30 November 1986 at about 2.30pm. One Yeo Kong Boon (the third party) was driving motor car EL 8689M along Dunearn Road when at a spot just immediately after the junction of Rifle Range Road/Dunearn Road, it stopped and was collided into by motor bus TIBS 259D driven by the first defendant. Motor car EL 8689M belonged to the plaintiff, who had brought this action to recover compensation for the damage caused to the motor car. By a third party notice, the defendants sought indemnity/contributions from Yeo Kong Boon.
The defendants contended that the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in holding that the third party` s action only played a relatively small part in the accident. They submitted that the magistrate failed to draw the proper and necessary inferences or make the proper findings from the circumstances of the case and further failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that the third party had breached five important rules in the Highway Code.
I was conscious of the principle that an appellate court should not disturb a finding of fact by a lower court or its apportionment of liability unless it erred on a matter of principle, or had wrongly appreciated the facts or the finding was contrary to the weight of the evidence: see Denning MR in 
 Kerry v Carter 
[1969] 1 WLR 1372
 at p 1376 and the most often cited passage of Lord Thankerton in Watt vT homas 
[1947] AC 484
 at p 488. The position would be different if the point in dispute relates to the proper inference to be drawn from proved facts; in that situation an appellate court is generally in as good a position to evaluate the evidence as the trial judge - see Lord Reid in Benmax v Austin Motor Co [1955] 1 All ER 326 at p 329. 
At the hearing before the magistrate, quantum was agreed at $3,495. The evidence for the plaintiff was given by the third party, Yeo Kong Boon, the driver of EL 8689M. His evidence was that at the material time he was driving along Dunearn Road in the direction towards the city. He had a passenger sitting next to him. He intended to pick up a friend (one Lee Kok Keong - hereinafter called Lee) who was waiting for him immediately after the junction of Rifle Range Road/Dunearn Road. He gave a left-hand signal and stopped the car. Lee opened the rear nearside door of the car, stepped into it and was about to close the door when Yeo felt a vehicle collide into his car from the rear. The collision pushed his vehicle forward and his friend Lee fell ` onto the road from inside the car` . Lee was injured, with bleeding from the head, and was taken to hospital.
Though at that time it was raining, the third party said that ` part of the (road) surface was dry because before the rain it was hot` . He insisted that the road surface was not wet. He also said the traffic was light and that when he looked through his rear mirror ` other than the bus other vehicles were far away` . When he was confronted with his police report where he stated that it was raining and the ground was wet and the traffic was heavy he tried to wriggle out of it by saying that the accident happened a long time ago. He then agreed that the road was wet. As regards the traffic condition, he explained that he ` now had the impression the traffic was light` . He said he remembered there were vehicles on his right and the bus was behind him though he ` could not be sure how many vehicles were behind` . He agreed that the stretch of Dunearn Road had a speed limit of 70 kmph. He estimated that it must have taken a minute for his friend to get into the car before the collision occurred.
The plaintiff and the third party also called the investigating officer (PW1) to testify on their behalf. However, as PW1 was not an eye-witness to the accident, I did not think anything he said was of assistance to me in determining how the accident happened. But PW1 did say that when he arrived at the scene the road was wet.
In his evidence the first defendant told the court that he was driving the bus on the first lane next to the side of the road. It was a three-lane carriageway. It was raining and the traffic was heavy. Counsel for the third party even put to the first defendant that the traffic was not heavy. I seriously doubted the propriety of that assertion when the third party himself told the court that he could no longer remember whether the traffic was heavy or light. The first defendant stated that he was aware of EL 8698M, which was three to four car lengths in front of him. He did not expect EL 8698M to stop so suddenly, without giving any signal, and at a spot which was just after the junction of Dunearn Road/Rifle Range Road and marked with double yellow lines and close to a bus stop. He quickly jammed his brakes but could not avoid the collision. He could not swerve to the right because of the traffic on the second lane. The first defendant said that at the point of impact, the friend (Lee) whom the third party was about to pick up was in the act of opening the rear nearside door. He was positive that Lee had not yet stepped into the car.
The first defendant said that immediately prior to the accident he was only travelling at 50 kmph. He could not have travelled at a higher speed because a passenger had already given signal that he wanted to get down at that bus stop. The first defendant conceded that at that time he did not look at his speedometer to see if his speed was in fact 50 kmph: his assessment of the speed was based on his experience. The case put by the third party` s counsel to the first defendant was that, based on the brake marks of 24.4m, the latter was speeding. That was also the case made by the respondent` s counsel in his final submission before the magistrate. I should add that the same counsel appeared for both the plaintiff and the third party in the court below.
The learned magistrate in his grounds of decision held that the first defendant was ` clearly negligent in failing to notice the presence of the plaintiff` s motor car on a straight road when visibility was so clear`. That was all the reason he gave. But that was not the case of the plaintiff or the third party. It was never put to the first defendant that he had failed to notice the car in front. His evidence that he saw the car in front was never challenged. The case for the plaintiff and the third party was that the first defendant was speeding. Perhaps implied in that assertion was the allegation that the first defendant was following too closely behind EL 8698M. Whatever it was there was no basis for the magistrate to find that the first defendant had failed to notice the respondent` s car which was in front of his bus.
It seemed to me that the learned magistrate had failed to correctly appreciate the evidence and the issues put before him. He made no findings whether the third party did stop EL 8698M abruptly without giving any signal; whether the road was wet and the traffic heavy; whether at the point of collision Lee had got into the car; whether the first defendant was speeding; and whether the first defendant was following too closely behind. If nothing at all the 24.4m brake marks, which ran parallel to the side of the road, indicated that the first defendant had noticed the car. It was a different question altogether whether the brake marks indicated excessive speed or following too closely behind.
Having examined the evidence of the third party, I found him to be an untruthful and unreliable witness. On two material points which, in my view, were crucial to the case, it was shown that the third party would not hesitate to say something different to help his own case: whether the road surface was wet and whether the traffic then was heavy. If he had forgotten he should have said that he could not recall. Instead he told the court the opposite of what he had stated in his police report, which was made a day after the accident. He insisted that the road surface was not wet. This went to show that he would not hesitate to tell a lie in order to shift blame on to the other party and save his own skin. In my judgment, his credit had been impeached. No weight should be given to his evidence.
An issue which was crucial to the determination of liability was the question of the exact position of Lee at the time of collision between the two vehicles. Had Lee got into the car as alleged by the third party? The court did not have the benefit of hearing Lee who would have been a most crucial witness. The third party` s counsel told the court below that Lee` s employer would not release him to attend court that day. I must say that I thought this excuse seemed flimsy. Even without drawing any adverse inference against the third party on this account, the fact remained that as the credit of the third party had bee impeached, the court was left with only the evidence of the first defendant, the police sketch plan and the two police reports of the first defendant and the third party. In so far as the evidence of the first defendant was concerned, it was clear. The third party had stopped EL 8698M abruptly without giving any signal, just past the junction of Rifle Range Road/Dunearn Road. He did not expect the car to stop there. He braked but could not avoid a collision. The bus was three to four car lengths behind the car. His speed was approximately 50 kmph. He was in fact going to stop at the bus stop just a little distance further as a passenger had already given signal to alight at that bus stop. As I saw it, there was no question of the first defendant not noticing the car in front of him. What the first defendant did not anticipate was the sudden stopping by EL 8698M. I accepted the evidence of the first defendant that when the collision took place, Lee was just opening the rear nearside car door. The car must have stopped at the place where Lee stood or very close to him and he must have rushed forward to open the car door. I may add that the third party` s evidence on this aspect was also not entirely consistent. During examination-in-chief he said that Lee was seated in the car and was about to close the door when the collision occurred. In re-examination he said ` Then (Lee) closed the door. The bus knocked from behind.`
I will next consider the 24.4m brake marks. The Highway Code shows that on a wet surface a vehicle travelling at 55 kmph requires, besides reaction time, a braking distance of 25m. Further, as a matter of physics, I believed a heavy vehicle like a bus would probably require a slightly longer braking distance.
Therefore, brake marks of a length of 24.4m were certainly consistent with a speed of 50 kmph or less. On a main roadway like Dunearn Road, with three lanes, a speed of 50 kmph could not in the circumstances be considered to be excessive. Of course exceeding speed limit is not per se negligence, though that may constitute an offence: 
 Barna v Hudes Merchandising Corp (1962) 106 SJ 194. In my judgment there was no evidence that the bus was speeding. Neither was there any evidence that the bus was following too closely behind. 
In my view the sole cause of the accident was the sudden stopping of the car by the third party without giving any signal whatsoever. The road was wet, and traffic heavy. Indeed, in so stopping to pick up Lee, the third party had clearly breached the following rules of the Highway Code:
 
 
(i) Rule 88 - before stopping to look into the mirror to make sure it is safe and to give clear signal that you intend to do so; 
 
(ii) Rule 89 - signal must be given in good time; 
 
(iii) Rule 91(d) - no stopping of a vehicle on a main road or on a road carrying fast moving traffic; and 
 
(iv) Rule 91(b) - no stopping near any roadside which is marked with double yellow lines.
  
 
 
There was also some evidence that the third party might have infringed r 91(i) - stopping within 6m of a junction. He admitted that he stopped within 6m of the junction.
Section 112(4) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) expressly provides that a failure on the part of any person to observe any provisions of the Highway Code may in any civil or criminal proceedings be relied upon by any party to the proceedings as tending to establish or to negative any liability which is in question in those proceedings.
In my judgment, the third party must be held solely responsible for the accident. By stopping abruptly on a main roadway without giving any signal, he had created a dangerous situation which was the cause of the accident. The first defendant took the only evasive step possible in the circumstances, ie by braking; yet the accident could not be avoided. It does not follow that in a case of a front-to-back collision the vehicle that followed behind must necessarily be negligent to some extent.
Finally, there was a point of procedure which I ought to mention. The notice of appeal filed by the first and second defendants was only against the decision of the learned magistrate in the third party proceedings and not against the whole decision in the action. Thinking that the appeal was against the entire decision of the magistrate in the action, and in the light of my finding that the third party was solely to blame for the accident, I initially set aside the judgment obtained by the plaintiff against the defendants. Subsequently, when my attention was drawn by the parties to the limited scope of the notice of appeal I altered the original order and ordered that the third party indemnify the defendants to the full extent of the judgment granted against the defendants in the main action.

This was an action for damages for injuries suffered by the plaintiff on account of a motor accident. The plaintiff was, on 6 March 1986 at 10.15pm, a passenger in motor vehicle EE 4667, which was being driven by the defendant along Cornwall Garden when it collided into motor lorry YB 5299, which was parked by the side of the said road. Interlocutory judgment was, on 21 September 1987, entered against the defendant, with damages to be assessed by the registrar.
At an assessment held on 19 November 1988, the assistant registrar awarded the plaintiff a total sum of $148,899 as damages, made up as follows: 
 
General damages
 
 
 
(i) Pain and suffering $ 15,000.00
 
 
 
(ii) Cost of future operation (with antecedent pain) $ 6,000.00
 
 
 
(iii) Loss of future earnings $ 108,000.00
 
 
 
 
 
Special damages
 
 
 
(i) Agreed $ 7,019.00
 
 
 
(ii) Loss of earnings ($230 per day for 56 days) $ 12,880.00
 
 
 
Total $ 148,899.00
 
 
 
The assistant registrar also awarded interest at 6% on the $15,000 for pain and suffering and on the $19,899 for special damages from the date of the issue of the writ to the date of judgment.
The defendant appealed against the whole decision of the assistant registrar. I heard the appeal and reduced the amount for pain and suffering from $15,000 to $12,000 and the amount for the cost of future operation from $6,000 to $4,000. However, I maintained the amounts awarded by the assistant registrar for loss of earnings and loss of future earnings. No argument was made by counsel for the defendant against that part of the order of the assistant registrar relating to interest. The defendant has now appealed to the Court of Appeal against those two items plus the item on the cost of future operation.
 Injuries suffered
The plaintiff, who was aged 39 on the date of assessment, is a dental surgeon by occupation. As a result of the accident, he suffered the following injuries: 
 
 
(i) open and crushed wound of the interphalangeal joints of the left thumb; 
 
(ii) complete division of the exterior pollicis longus tendon; and 
 
(iii) laceration over the ulnar aspect of the front left wrist.
  
 
 
The plaintiff was operated upon for the injuries and was hospitalized for five days. He was away from work for 56 days. The injuries on the left thumb has since healed. The residue disabilities were described in these terms by Dr Chang Wei Chun, orthopaedic and trauma surgeon, in his report of 27 June 1988: 
 
He complained of pain and stiffness of the interphalangeal joint of his left thumb. He was unable to put any protracted pressure on the thumb. This affected his occupation as a dental surgeon as he was unable to hold any instruments between the thumb and index for long. At times he would get spasms of pain in the interphalangeal joint causing him to drop the instrument he was holding.
 
 
 
He also complained of weakness of his left middle, ring and little fingers.
Clinically, the interphalangeal joint of the left thumb was painful to pressure. Flexion was restricted from 0 to 30 degrees compared to 80 degrees on the right side. The left middle, ring and little fingers were weak resulting in weakness of opposition between the thumb and fingers.
Radiologically, there was established degenerative osteoarthritic changes of the interphalangeal joint of the left thumb. 
 
Conclusion:
 
 
 
The above-named had severely injured the interphalangeal joint of his left thumb in this accident. Osteoarthritis had set in and he had permanent pain, weakness and restriction of motion of the joint. If his symptoms worsen, he may require an arthrodesis of this joint.
 
 
 
The weakness of his left middle, ring and little fingers is due to an old neuropraxic injury to his ulnar-nerve when he sustained his laceration on the wrist. This will not improve at this point of time.
In his evidence before the assistant registrar, Dr Chang said: 
 
Osteoarthritis has set in. It will continue to deteriorate - the interphalangeal joint of the left thumb. As it degenerates, the pain will become more and more severe. Purely based on estimation, I feel it would be five years before the patient suffers loss of use of the thumb. If the patient feels sufficiently pain(ful), he could go for an operation to convert the painful stiff joint to painless stiff joint.
 
 
 
Dr Chang estimated that at the time of the assessment, taking into account the condition of the thumb and the weakness in the three fingers, the plaintiff had a permanent incapacity of 30% of the left hand, with 20% attributable to the thumb and 10% to the three fingers. In five years time as the thumb deteriorated, the permanent incapacity would increase by 10% to 40%.
The plaintiff, in his evidence, stated that he still suffered pain in his thumb. He was not able to move his thumb - loss of flexion. In his work, he had to use two hands. When he did extractions or fillings and had to bend his thumb, he could hear `the bones cracking`. In his dental practice, one third of his work involved operations, one third bridging and one third general dentistry. He could not carry on at the pace he used to work. When the pain got severe, he had to stop. He could not do two extractions continuously. He could not do more than one operation a day.
The plaintiff practised in partnership with two others in a dental surgery. The evidence was quite clear that his capacity to work had been reduced. He could not see and treat as many patients as he could before. The difference in the net profits which the firm earned in 1985 and 1986 was the sum of $20,000. The plaintiff explained that the net profits of the firm did not drop significantly because his partners worked harder and did not go on leave. But that could not go on forever. Moreover, from February 1989, and because of the plaintiff`s injury, the partners would be having a new arrangement. Under this new arrangement, it was likely that he would be earning less as income division would be tied up with earning capacity. The plaintiff said that before the accident, his average daily gross collection was $1,000 a day.
 Loss of earnings
As stated above, for loss of earnings, the assistant registrar assessed the amount at $230 per day for 56 days making a total of $12,880. This amount would appear to be based on a computation set out in the defendant`s counsel`s written submission. The plaintiff`s income tax assessment for 1987 showed that he earned $86,223 in 1986. The tax payable was $11,948. His net income was therefore $74,275 which worked out (taking into account the 56 days he was on medical leave and not paid) to be $7,185 per month and approximately $230 a day.
The defendant attacked this item on two grounds: 
 
 
(i) by his partnership arrangement, the plaintiff was entitled to draw from the firm notwithstanding his being out of work on account of the injuries; the plaintiff had, on his own volition, waived his rights and thus could not claim against the defendant for the loss; and 
 
(ii) the amount awarded failed to take into account the tax which the plaintiff would be liable to bear.
  
 
 
The evidence of the plaintiff relating to this item was as follows: 
 
 
Q: Between time of accident and today, your share of the partnership has not changed? 
 
A: No. It is according to contract but for the two months on medical leave, I forfeit my pay. 
 
Q: Although under the contract, the same amount was due? 
 
A: Yes - the same percentage.
  
 
 
From the above it did not appear entirely clear to me whether the plaintiff was saying that he was entitled to the two months pay but gave it up voluntarily, or that he forfeited it because of his absence and thus was not entitled to it. In the context, his answer to the second question quoted above seemed to relate more to the fact that from the date of the accident to the date of the assessment, his share in the partnership remained the same.
In any event, even assuming that it was the plaintiff who, on his own volition, did not wish to insist on his rights and draw his share of the income from the partnership, I did not think that that should preclude the plaintiff from claiming the income loss as damages from the defendant. Indeed, until quite recently, the rule had been that `the damages to be awarded to a physically injured plaintiff for the loss of his earning capacity were not to be reduced because part of his loss had been or would be recouped by reason of benefits conferred upon him by third parties with whom the defendant had nothing to do`: see 
 McGregor on Damages 
 (14th Ed) para 1116. Inroads began to appear in the no-deduction rule in respect of, inter alia, payments to the plaintiff by way of salary. As Lord Denning stated in 
 Browning v War Office 
 
[1963] 1 QB 750
 at p 759: 
 
... the injured person must, I think, give credit for any sums which he receives as of right in consequence of his injury. Take wages, for instance, that his employer pays him during his incapacity, being under an obligation to do so. The typical case is the policeman who is entitled to his full wages whilst disabled. He gets them from his employer and he cannot claim the self-same wages again from the wrongdoer. He cannot be allowed to get them twice over. He must give credit 
 for the wages he received and is entitled to receive
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The cases established that a plaintiff who has been paid his wages should not be allowed to claim his wages, all over again, against a defendant tortfeasor. But I did not see the cases as having established a rule that a defendant tortfeasor was entitled to insist that a plaintiff exercised his contractual rights in order to reduce the damages which the defendant tortfeasor was obliged to pay under general law. The defendant referred to the case of 
 Ong Jin Choon v Lim Hin Hock 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 137
 as authority for the proposition that a plaintiff who was entitled to be paid his wages suffered no loss. I think the decision in 
 Ong Jin Choon 
[1988] 3 MLJ 137
 must be viewed in the context. There the plaintiff was in fact paid by his companies in which he was a director. Nevertheless, the court there held that as the payments were made by the companies on their own volition and 
 not as a matter of contractual obligation 
, no credit should be given for the payments received by the plaintiff in assessing his loss of earnings. I did not see 
 Ong Jin Choon 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 137
  as an authority for the proposition that a defendant was entitled to take advantage of the contractual rights of a plaintiff against a third party so as to reduce the damages payable by the defendant, even though the plaintiff had decided not to claim those contractual rights.
It must be remembered that in a situation like the present, it is the defendant who is responsible for the injuries. It is one thing to say that a plaintiff should not be paid twice over; it is another to say that a defendant is entitled to insist that a plaintiff must exercise his contractual rights against a third party in order to enable the defendant to enjoy the benefit of having to pay a lesser amount of damages. Take the example of an employee who is injured and is hospitalized, and his term of employment provides that his employer shall bear his hospitalization expenses, whatever be the cause. I do not see any rule which precludes the employee, for whatever reasons, paying the hospital bill himself and claiming what he has paid against the tortfeasor. For these reasons, I did not think there was any merit in the first objection.
As regards the second objection, the sum of $230 adopted as the loss per day was already a net amount. It would be recalled that the tax liability of $11,948 was deducted from the gross income of $86,223 in computing the daily rate of $230.
 Loss of future earnings
The defendant stated that compared with 1984, the firm`s income had already dropped in 1985. He argued that the drop in 1986 was part of a trend. I would have thought that it was something quite natural that the income of a professional firm would fluctuate. I did not think it was realistic for anyone to say that a firm`s income must rise year after year.
The basis of the plaintiff`s claim under this head was for loss of earning capacity. Counsel for the defendant did not deny that there was such a loss. The physical disabilities suffered by the plaintiff were clearly described by Dr Chang and they are set out above. The plaintiff said that on account of the disabilities, his working capacity as a dental surgeon had been affected. He could not treat as many patients as before. He had become slower in his work. This evidence was not disputed.
The defendant argued that because of the partnership arrangement, the only adverse effect the disabilities had was that the plaintiffs rate of work was slower but this did not mean that he had lost patients and thus income. Before the assistant registrar, counsel for the defendant made the following observation in his written submission: 
 
If at all, the loss to the plaintiff is that it will now take him longer to earn the same amount of money, ie he is being kept out of his money (which, as the evidence goes, will eventually come his way) for some time. The claim, if any, would be for a sum representing this withholding of income, ie interest.
 
 
 
I was unable to accept that contention. I would have thought that, to a professional man, time loss means money loss. The lesser the number of patients you see, or the lesser the number of operations you do, the less you earn: there being only so many working hours in a day. That should be obvious. It is not a question of being kept out of money. Time is lost for good and thus money. The fact that the plaintiff was in partnership with two others could not alter that fact. Furthermore, from February 1989, the partnership arrangement had been altered such that a partner`s share of the income would depend on his collections. That this should come about should not be at all surprising, as a partner whose performance (due to physical disabilities) was obviously not on par with the others should not continue to draw equal pay. He could not expect the others to carry him indefinitely. The extent of the plaintiff`s disabilities was reasonably clear. It was an existing loss. One need only ask, what if the partnership were dissolved, to realize that the loss to the plaintiff was real. In general a partnership could be dissolved at any time.
The issue of loss of earning capacity was addressed by Browne LJ in 
 Moeliker v Reyrolle 
 
[1977] 1 WLR 132
 at p 140 as follows: 
 
As I have said, this problem generally arises in cases where a plaintiff is in employment at the date of the trial. If he is then earning as much as he was earning before the accident and injury (as in the present case), or more, he has no claim for loss of future earnings. If he is earning less than he was earning before the accident, as in 
 Nicholls v National Coal
 
 Board
 [1976] ICR 266, he has a claim for loss of future earnings which is assessed on the ordinary multiplier/multiplicand basis. But in either case he may also have a claim, or an additional claim, for loss of earning capacity if he should ever lose his present job.
 
 
 
In 
 Underwood v Ong Ah Long 
 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 246
  a plastic surgeon suffered a permanent disability (tremor of the left thumb) resulting in him being unable to use his left hand satisfactorily to perform major plastic surgery. The Privy Council awarded him both pretrial loss and post-trial loss; and for the latter, the Privy Council estimated the loss which the plaintiff would suffer and applied a multiplier of six years (the plaintiff there was then 52 years old).
Reverting to the present case, using the income earned for 1986, which worked out to $7,185 per month, the loss of $1,000 per month assessed by the assistant registrar (which is equivalent to about 14%) could not, by any standard, be considered excessive. Dr Chang had stated that the left hand suffered a permanent disability of 30%. It would become 40% in five years` time. A multiplier of nine years which the assistant registrar applied was also, in my view, fair and reasonable, considering that the plaintiff was only 39 years of age at the date of the assessments. He would in the normal course have another 21 years of working life left, if not more.
The defendant argued that a case like this, a lump sum should be adequate - counsel suggested $10,000. I felt that they would be grossly inadequate. It would be very unfair to the plaintiff. In my view, the defendant grossly underrated the adverse effect the disabilities of the thumb would have on the plaintiff`s practice as a dental surgeon. It is common knowledge that the work of a dental surgeon is extremely delicate. He needs all his faculties to carry out his work efficiently. A reduced rate of work must necessarily mean reduced income.
As no ground was shown that the sums awarded for the two items stated above were wrong, I maintained the awards of the assistant registrar.
 Cost of future operations
Lastly there remains a very minor item. Dr Chang, in his evidence, envisaged that the plaintiff would have to go for an operation in five years` time when the pain in the joint of the left thumb would become intolerable. In his evidence, Dr Chang said that the operation at present cost $3,000. From the evidence, it was not clear whether the figure he gave included hospitalization charges. The assistant registrar awarded a sum of $6,000 to cover cost of operation and antecedent pain. Even taking into account inflation and rising costs and the antecedent pain, I felt that doubling the estimate given by Dr Chang did appear excessive. The defendant submitted that the court should only award $3,000. I felt that a sum of $4,000 should be fair and adequate as payment would be made in advance. I reduced it accordingly.
 Costs
On costs, as the defendant had succeeded only on the relatively small items and failed on the main items, I thought it was only just that he should pay half the costs of the appeal before me.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was convicted on the following charge: 
 
You ... are charged that you, on or about 13 August 1983, at about 12.30am, near the entrance of Golden House Mid-Night Music Lounge, 306 Geylang Road, Singapore, did voluntarily cause hurt to one Yeo Cheow Fatt, by means of a cutting instrument, which when used as a weapon of offence, is likely to cause death, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 324 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. He has appealed against conviction and sentence.
The facts as found by the trial judge were as follows: 
 
 
(a) that on 13 August 1983 at about 12.30am at the entrance of the Golden House Mid-Night Lounge, PW1 had an argument with the accused and another male person in respect of a waitress who worked in the said lounge; 
 
(b) that on the same date and around the same time the argument between PW1 and the other two persons had progressed to an exchange of blows between them; 
 
(c) that during the exchange of blows, PW1 had been dealt with blows, with fists, to his face and body and had also been inflicted with three stab wounds to his stomach and back; 
 
(d) that during the exchange of blows, referred to in paras (b) and (c) above, a sharp instrument with a cutting edge, or edges, had been used by the accused to inflict one or more of the three stab wounds sustained by PW1; and 
 
(e) that during the exchange of blows, referred to in paras (b) and (c) above, PW1 had not used any implement to attack the accused and the other male person who had both confronted him.
  
 
 
Of the three wounds, one was inflicted in the stomach frontally and the other wounds were inflicted in the back of the body. The two back wounds were tri-radiate in shape and were very deep, they having reached the bone. They were too deep to have been caused by the jagged edges of a broken bottle, as alleged by the appellant. The trial judge found that the two wounds were more like stab wounds caused by a bearing scraper. He also found, on the evidence, that the said wounds were probably caused by the other male person and not the appellant. However, he found that the stomach wound was caused by the appellant and that it was caused by a cutting instrument such as a knife and not the broken points of a broken bottle.
The appeal before me turns on the cause of the stomach wound and the exact circumstances in which it was caused. It is the appellant`s case that he had stabbed the complainant in the stomach with the jagged edges of a broken bottle in self-defence. In a s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code statement to the police, the appellant had admitted to this `fact`. In his testimony at the trial, he reiterated this `fact`.
In his grounds of decision, the trial judge gave the following reasonings for his finding that the stomach wound was not caused by the broken bottle: 
 
From the evidence of Dr Hweena Ng (PW2), it can be seen that the possibility for the three stab wounds to have been caused by the jagged points of a broken bottle or broken glass, as suggested in the defence, was unlikely while the fact that they were caused by something other than such objects (ie a broken bottle or broken glass) was almost a certainty. In that respect Dr Ng (PW2) had opined that in respect of the frontal stomach stab wound its shape was `fairly straight` and `not identical in shape to the tear in the shirt` of PW1, which was `a jagged tear, like an L-shaped but not entirely so and also like a T` (vide: p 32, notes of evidence). It was also due to a sharp object (vide: p 11, notes of evidence) and it was `more likely that a knife could have caused this injury` (vide: p 12, notes of evidence). For these reasons given by Dr Ng (PW2), which I accepted, I was accordingly satisfied and found as a fact that this (frontal) stab wound in PW1`s stomach was caused by a cutting instrument, such as a knife, and not by the jagged points of a broken bottle as claimed by the accused.
 
 
 
In discounting a broken bottle as being the cause for this stab wound, Dr Ng (PW2) had given cogent and convincing reasons which were, additionally, not disturbed in cross-examination. I was aware that no knife, or cutting instrument, for that matter, had been recovered from the scene by the police.
The evidence in chief of PW2 in relation to the stomach wound was as follows: 
 
The wound in the front was three cm long and very deep.
 
 
 
Underlying muscles were cut with a lot of bleeding. There was a superficial laceration on the front of surface of the left lobe of the liver. This laceration was about 1.5 cm long. It was not bleeding actively. ...
The stab wound in front could be due to the broken edge a broken bottle.
In cross-examination, PW2 said: 
 
 
A: The depth of this wound is against the suggestion that it could be caused by a broken bottle because it was very deep and had cut through all the layers of the muscles and lacerated the liver. Only if it was a long sliver of glass could a broken bottle be responsible for this. There were no other accompanying cuts and scratches at the entrance of this wound to support the suggestion that a bottle was used to cause it. In my opinion it was more likely that a knife could have caused this injury. 
 
Q: The opening of the wound - was it straight or curved? 
 
A: I have recorded in my notes that it looks fairly straight.
  
 
 
It would appear that up to this stage, PW2`s evidence was not sufficiently clear as PW2 was recalled later. Her testimony, in question and answer form, was as follows: 
 
 
Q: Please look at exh P12 - could any of these pieces have been responsible for any of the stab wounds? 
 
A: There is a piece measuring about 3.5 inches in length and with a point. It may or may not be responsible for the stomach wound. I should say I am not an authority on injuries caused by glass. 
 
Q: Regarding the stomach wound you stated there were no other injuries accompanying the entrance of the wound in question - if the patient was wearing clothing over that part would this not have prevented the other expected cuts from being caused? 
 
A: It is not likely. If glass can cut through one part the other parts would be cut through, particularly if the same force was exerted at that area. (Exhibit P14 is shown to the witness. She is shown exh LKL/A/83.) 
 
Q: Any other tears around this entry tear on the shirt? 
 
A: There is only a single jagged tear on the front right side of the shirt, with no accompanying cuts or tears. 
 
Q: Is it a straight tear or is it curved? 
 
A: It is a jagged tear, like an L-shaped but not entirely so and also like a T. It has three corners. It looks tri-radiate also. 
 
Q: Is it possible that the piece of glass you referred to earlier could have caused such a tear too? 
 
A: It is possible. I really cannot tell. 
 
Q: Was the stomach injury on PW1 in that shape as shown by the tear on the shirt? 
 
A: I can`t remember but as recorded and drawn in my notes it is fairly straight. It is not identical in shape to the tear in the shirt.
  
 
 
I have made a careful inspection of the tear on the front right side of the shirt and have compared the shape of the tear with the shape of the broken bottle and pieces of glasses. The two shapes fit each other. The shape of the tear in the shirt is more curved than tri-radiate and it certainly does not look like a T. It also does not look like an L. However, PW2`s evidence was that the tear looked like an L and also a T and also tri-radiate and that it did not correspond to the shape of the wound `as recorded and drawn in my notes it is fairly straight`.
Although PW2 opined that it was more likely that a knife could have caused the stomach injury, she had also said three times that the wound could have been caused by glass from a broken bottle and that she was not an expert on injuries caused by glass. Her opinion that a knife had caused the wound was, in my view, probably influenced by her having recorded the wound as `fairly straight`. Could she have been wrong in her recording? In this regard, it has to be pointed out that at the end of her evidence in chief (at p 12) she corrected her report (P9) to say that the front wound was not tri-radiate and when she was later recalled to clarify her evidence, she then said that `it looks tri-radiate also`.
I am of the view that her evidence on the nature of the weapon that was used raised a reasonable, if not serious, doubt as to the validity of the opinion having regard to the following facts: (1) the complainant was wearing the shirt during the fight; (2) the tear in the shirt was indisputably caused by a stab by a sharp instrument; (3) the instrument which cut into the shirt in that way must have also cut into that part of PW1`s body; (4) the shape of the tear corresponded more with the shape of a piece of glass from a broken bottle; (5) the location of the tear on the shirt corresponded to the location of the only serious wound in the stomach. As there was no other wound in the stomach, I must conclude that there was high probability that the wound was caused by the same instrument that made the tear in the shirt. This conclusion however does not accord with the shape of the stomach wound as recorded by PW2. If then the tear has a curved shape, how could the wound have a `fairly straight` shape unless PW2 was not being precise in her language? That, in my view, was entirely probable when she made her notes as she could not have known, at 2am that night, that the precise cause of the wound would assume significance at the trial. In my view, the evidence on this point on the shape of the tear was at the lowest contradictory and at the highest unsure.
The trial judge gave as an additional reason for accepting the opinion of PW2 on the probable cause of the stomach wound that no sharp instrument with a cutting edge was recovered from the scene. I do not think that this fact made it any the more probable that the appellant had used such an instrument. The same reasoning was applicable to the broken bottle as there was no evidence that all the pieces of glass from it were recovered from the scene. What I am suggesting here is that there is more than a reasonable doubt as to the cause of the stomach wound and that the appellant ought to have been given the benefit of that doubt. Accordingly, I differ from the trial judge on this finding of fact.
I find it necessary to embark on a careful examination of the probable cause of the stomach injury as it is related to the appellant`s defence, which was that he had stabbed PW1 in the stomach with a broken bottle during the scuffle in self-defence as PW1 was bigger than he was. In his s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code statement, the appellant had admitted to stabbing PW1 in the stomach by that means. The appellant`s evidence was that it was PW1 who attacked him with a bottle, that PW1 dropped the bottle and the appellant then picked it up and hit PW1 on the head, that the bottle broke and then in the scuffle PW1 was stabbed with the broken bottle. The trial judge rejected this evidence and with it the plea of self-defence as he believed that PW1 had been stabbed in the stomach with a sharp instrument like a knife and that the appellant had lied about how the two wounds on the back had been caused to mask the fact that another person had wielded a weapon. In short, the trial judge found that PW1 was attacked by the appellant and one other person with fists and weapons when PW1, who was more or less drunk, was not in a position to defend himself.
I agree that the plea of self-defence must fail on the facts of this case. But, it seems to me that it was not necessary for the trial judge, in order to reject the plea of self-defence, to find that `weapons with cutting edges` were used. As PW1 was more or less drunk and was in no position to defend himself against two persons, the use of a broken bottle to stab PW1 must have exceeded whatever right of self-defence that the appellant might have had in the circumstances.
I come now to the sentence. This was how the trial judge dealt with it: 
 
Before sentence was passed it was submitted, in mitigation, that in complying with his superior`s instructions to investigate into the quarrel between PW1 and the waitress the accused had become embroiled in the fight with PW1, which had erupted spontaneously. He had also voluntarily surrendered himself to the police and had, in admitting to the infliction of the stomach wound on PW1, co-operated with the police. He was also extremely sorry for what had occurred and pleaded for leniency.
 
 
 
I accepted the fact that the fight had erupted spontaneously but could not ignore the fact that weapons had been used by the accused and another in inflicting such dangerous and terrible injuries on PW1 who was, relatively, in a disadvantageous position against his opponents. Although his voluntary surrender to the police did mitigate his actions on the night in question, for which he was probably genuinely remorseful, I could not ignore the fact that the offence for which he was charged was a grave one indeed which called for stern punishment. Accordingly, in the circumstances, I sentenced him to serve a term of six months` imprisonment and also ordered that he receive three strokes of caning.
It is clear from the above passages that the trial judge in passing sentence, was unduly influenced by the `dangerous and terrible` injuries suffered by PW1 and the manner by which they were caused. I have found that the stomach wound was probably caused by the broken bottle and less likely by a knife. This finding has a bearing on another finding of the trial judge as to the cause of the fight. The trial judge appeared to have found, although this is not clear from the grounds of decision, that it was the appellant and another person who set upon PW1 with weapons.
In my view, the trial judge did not give sufficient consideration to the fact that the fight occurred in a bar in the early hours of the morning involving a customer, PW1, who was more or less drunk and who was trying to take a waitress home. PW1`s version was that the waitress was willing to go home with him but he was stopped by two persons who assaulted him. Why the appellant and one other person had decided to assault PW1 in that circumstance was never explained. The appellant`s version was that the waitress was not willing to go home with PW1 who began to pester her, and that when the appellant told him to leave the premises, that was when PW1 became aggressive and the fight started. In these circumstances, given a drunken and `obstreperous` customer trying to take a waitress home, I would have thought it more likely that the waitress had not agreed to go home with him. If the waitress had decided to leave with PW1, there was no conceivable reason for the appellant to have assaulted PW1. The appellant was then working as a cashier and not as a bouncer; the bar had two bouncers. In my view, this must raise a reasonable doubt as to who started the fight.
There is another factor which the trial judge appears to have taken into account in sentencing which he should not have done. Having found that the other two injuries on PW1`s back were not caused by the appellant but by another person who joined in the fray, the trial judge should not have taken these two injuries into account for the purpose of punishing the appellant. He did not cause these injuries and the appellant was not charged on the basis that he had a common intention with the other person to voluntarily cause hurt to PW1.
For the above reasons, I am of the view that the sentence of six months` imprisonment and three strokes of the cane was manifestly excessive. I bear in mind that the stomach injury sustained by PW1 was admittedly serious but as against that, there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of premeditation that the appellant had when he inflicted the wound. There was a reasonable doubt as to how the stomach injury was caused. It could have been by the sharp edge of a broken bottle during the fight which was also probably caused and started by PW1. The appellant was 29 years old and supporting a wife and a child of 11 months and an ageing mother; his wife was expecting another at the time of the trial. He had no criminal record. He surrendered himself to the police and admitted to stabbing PW1 with a broken bottle, albeit by way of self-defence. He was genuinely remorseful. He was working as a fitter earning $800 per month at the time of his conviction. The appellant was, apart from this incident, a useful citizen. I do not see the need to send him to prison (and much less to impose caning on him) for an offence committed in circumstances which did not necessarily prove that he had propensity to acts of violence. He no longer works in a bar. In my view, he should be given another chance. Accordingly, I shall set aside the sentence of imprisonment and caning and substitute therefor a fine of $5,000 and in default two months` imprisonment. The appeal against conviction is dismissed and the appeal against sentence is allowed to the extent aforesaid.

The plaintiffs are the manufacturers and suppliers of Deutz marine engines and spare parts. Their claim against the defendants is for the sum of $42,953.60 being the price of a new top part of the injector pump (NTP) supplied by the plaintiffs to be used on the main engine of the defendants` motor vessel United Glory.
The defendants maintain that on or about 8 August 1980, the NTP was properly fitted onto the main engine of the United Glory at Newcastle, Australia, by the ship`s chief engineer and thereafter the vessel set out to sea but unknown to them the NTP was defective in that it had therein four oversized springs. On or about 14 August 1980, on the voyage from Newcastle, Australia, to Lae in Papua New Guinea, due to the oversized springs in the NTP, the main engine was extensively damaged and the vessel was crippled and placed in a position of peril. The repairs. After the temporary repairs, the vessel left for Gladstone, Australia, where permanent repairs were effected. The defendants were put to considerable loss and expense and they claim damages against the plaintiffs.
At the outset of the trial, the parties agreed to have the issue of liability in the counterclaim of the defendants to be tried first. The main issue is whether the consequential loss suffered by the defendants could be attributed to the supply of `oversized springs` in the NTP supplied by the plaintiffs which the defendants alleged are defective and not fit for the purpose.
The short facts are these. The vessel United Glory was built in 1955 and fitted with a Deutz eight-cylinder diesel main engine. The defendants purchased the United Glory in 1973. The main engine`s fuel pump consisted of two injector pumps, each of which supplied four cylinders. The first pump was driven by the main engine and it, in turn, drove the second pump to which it was coupled at one end. The top part of each injector pump carried a combination of short springs (72mm) and long retainer nuts (32mm). The injector pump in question in these proceedings is the second pump. Between December 1979 to November 1980 the master of the United Glory was Capt Willy Fabricius and the chief engineer was Radar B Karlsen (DW7).
As the second fuel injector pump`s top unit was wearing out, the defendants on 24 July 1980, by telex requested the plaintiffs to supply the United Glory a new top unit identified and described in the catalogue for Deutz spare parts as Part No 01117-606. The plaintiffs on or about 8 August 1980, supplied the NTP to the United Glory.
The evidence adduced by the defendants is shortly this. When the chief engineer received the NTP at Newcastle, the unit came assembled and ready to be fitted on to the lower part of the second pump. The existing top part was taken off and replaced with the NTP. The chief engineer had no problem fitting the NTP. After that the main engine was tested. It was working properly.
On 9 August 1980, after the repairs had been completed, the chief engineer got the engine ready for the voyage to Lae. The vessel was tested alongside the wharf. The vessel left Newcastle at about noon on 9 August 1980. On the first day everything was normal. On 14 August 1980, at around 0200 hours, the vessel`s main engine began to fail: the engine speed had dropped down by about 50 revs, ie about one-third and also the exhaust temperature had risen.
The engine was stopped and an investigation was carried out. It was found that: 
 
 
(a) the adjustment ring in the coupling in front of the first pump, which drove the camshaft that operated both the first and the second pumps, was broken; and 
 
(b) the groove for the key on the camshaft had widened from its original size of 8mm to 14mm. The key itself was damaged.
  
 
 
On the same day, the master informed the defendants of the breakdown and the underwriters were informed. Emergency repairs were carried out. The adjustment ring was replaced and a new key was made. The engine was started at 1930 hours on 16 August 1980 and the voyage continued.
At 0730 hours on 17 August 1980, the engine speed started to drop again. The main engine was stopped and an investigation carried out. It was the recurrence of the same problem with the same coupling giving way. Temporary repairs were carried out. They were able to get the engine started. Sometimes it was for a few hours, sometimes for a few minutes. During this time, on 18 August 1980, the chief engineer decided to search the whole system when the coupling continued to give way.
Upon opening the first and second pumps, the chief engineer noticed that the springs in the NTP were longer and thicker than the springs in the corresponding top unit of the first pump. The long springs in the NTP were 102mm long, 4.8mm in diameter and 10 turns (coils) whilst the short springs of the first pump were 72mm long, 4mm in diameter and 73/4 turns. Both sets of springs had the same serial number `0117-762`.
The chief engineer reported this to the master. As the chief engineer was uncertain as to which of the two sets of springs were of the correct size, the master contacted Bernt Forsell (DW3), the defendants` managing director. Forsell was asked to confirm with the plaintiffs the correct size of the springs bearing the serial number `0117-762`. When Forsell telephoned the plaintiffs` spare parts department to verify, he was informed that the springs` correct size was 72mm, of 4mm diameter and 7 3/4 turns. The master was accordingly informed on 19 August 1980.
The chief engineer carried out further repairs. This continued until 28 August 1980, when the main engine could not be restarted any more. The master then called for assistance and the vessel was towed into Lae on 30 August 1980. On 8 September 1980, Ronald Arthur Rannard (DW1), a consultant engineer, surveyor from the London Salvage Association, boarded the United Glory at Lae, to ascertain the cause, nature and extent of the damage suffered by the vessel.
When the pumps were opened up in Rannard`s presence, it was noted that the camshaft of the second pump had sheared at the drive coupling between the first and the second pumps. On stripping down the second pump it was found that the NTP had springs that were 30mm longer than the springs in the corresponding unit of the first pump and that they were made of a heavier and thicker material than those in the first pump`s top unit, although all the retainer nuts were of the same length. In other words, whilst the top unit of the first pump had 72mm springs with 32mm retainer nuts, the NTP had 102mm springs with retainer nuts also of 32mm.
Rannard ascertained the exact measurement of the lift or movement of the pump. He found that the springs in the top unit of the first pump compressed to 47mm, while the springs in the NTP of the second pump when fully compressed had an overall length of 48mm, ie the springs became solid cylinders. This meant that there was insufficient free space in the cylinders of the NTP for the springs to compress fully without becoming solid cylinders and exerting pressure on the cam of the camshaft (see exh D13).
Rannard then advised that the long springs in the NTP be cut to reduce their length to 72mm as a temporary repair so that the vessel could proceed to the next loading port of Gladstone in Australia. The defendants were consulted and they agreed. The springs from the NTP were cut by Rannard and the chief engineer to 72mm and later taken ashore to an engineering firm to have the cut ends ground as flat as possible. The cut springs, however, were not used at all because they were made of a thicker material. That would affect the tension of the springs. More power would be needed to compress the new thicker springs even if they were cut down to 72mm. The chief engineer had found an old fuel injector pump top unit in the ship`s stores and installed the four old springs of 72mm into the NTP.
After undergoing the necessary repairs and tests at Lae the vessel departed for Gladstone on 13 September 1980.
After leaving Lae for Gladstone, everything was working as normal with the main engine. On 15 September 1980 the chief engineer stopped the main engine to inspect the fuel injector pumps and found them in good order and functioning normally. The pumps were not dismantled for detailed examination.
On 18 September 1980, however, the chief engineer found that the lower part of the second injector pump was hotter than normal. The main engine was stopped for investigation. He found the shaft for the roller follower broken; the bush bearing holder broken and another bush bearing holder cracked. The broken shaft was replaced as there was a spare on board the vessel. Nothing could be done as regards the bush bearing holders; they were part of the body of the pump itself and could not be repaired. Cylinders 6 and 7 of the second pump were immobilized. The vessel continued the voyage at reduced speed as only six cylinders were operating. The vessel managed to reach Gladstone on 19 September 1980.
Rannard was again instructed by the London Salvage Association to proceed to Gladstone and examine further the second pump. He reported: 
 
An examination of the damaged pump revealed that the roller follower shaft had broken between the second and third roller aft. This failure has caused the vessel to be minus No 6 and No 7 cylinders and the vessel had proceeded into port with the assistance of tugs on Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 cylinders with 5 and 8 cylinders being below power.
 
 
 
Rannard reported other damages sustained: 
 
 
(1) Fuel pump cam shaft damaged beyond repair. 
 
(2) Set collars broken between No 1 and 2 pumps. 
 
(3) Two rollers indented. 
 
(4) Bearings for shaft heavily worn. 
 
(5) Two left bodies broken.
  
 
 
The second pump was stripped down and spare parts were ordered for the pump from the plaintiffs. The pump was repaired. On 4 October 1980, the engine was tested in the presence of the Bureau Veritas surveyor. It was working satisfactorily and was approved by the Bureau Veritas.
On 7 October 1980, the United Glory left Gladstone for Port Moresby and from Port Moresby to Banjarmasin and returned to Singapore on 4 November 1980. This final voyage from Gladstone to Singapore took about 18 sailing days. During this voyage there was no trouble with the engine or the pumps.
After the United Glory returned to Singapore, Forsell telephoned the plaintiffs. When the plaintiffs` representative visited him in his office, he complained that the plaintiffs had put in the wrong springs in the NTP. But the plaintiffs` representative told him that he was wrong and showed him a larger spring (exh D17) which he claimed to be the correct one.
Forsell then asked his shipowners` association in Sweden to buy from Svenska Deutz the plaintiffs` office in Sweden, a helical spring bearing the serial number `0117-762`. The association bought the spring and sent it to Forsell (exh D16). In December 1985, Forsell himself went to the plaintiffs` office at Gothenburg, Sweden, and bought a helical spring for the fuel pump. He gave the storekeeper the engine model number and the serial number of the spring `0117-762`. He was given a spring (exh D21).
Upon comparison it was found that the two springs D16 and D21 were identical and were the same as the springs which were in the top unit of the first pump, ie of 72mm length, 4mm thickness and 7.75 turns. Rannard gave the following opinion: 
 
In my opinion the only probable logical cause of the damage could be due to overstressing caused by the fitting of heavy springs, ie the springs which I found in the second pump in Lae. In my opinion this overstressing was in all likelihood caused at the time of running with the heavy springs from Newcastle to Lae had not manifested itself until close to or near Gladstone. Not to my knowledge that the damage was not caused by the springs. The pumps and other parts of this engine are constructed in such a way that repair can take place to any part of the machine by replacement with spare parts, this is the normal method used. I would say that it is not a complicated task to fit the top part of the pump to the bottom part of the pump and the whole pump fitted to the engine.
 
 
 
The plaintiffs pleaded that after the receipt of the defendants` order for the NTP, the NTP was specially assembled in Germany and that the four springs in the NTP of 105.5mm were essential components of the NTP for it to perform its function to run the main engine of the United Glory.
Dieter Schorn (PW1), the regional service controller with Deutz MWM Far East Pte Ltd, an amalgamation of the plaintiffs and another company, gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiffs. He is a marine engineer and has been employed by Deutz MWM for the past 25 years and has 25 years experience with diesel engines. He has been regional service controller since 1982 and is responsible for the entire diesel engine range up to 10,000 bhp. The NTP is an improved model of the old top part and has been made since September 1955. Schorn in evidence said: 
 
The top part was supplied according to the order contained in the telex. The top part that was supplied was suitable for use on the `United Glory`. This top part will function properly if fitted properly by the ship`s engineers. The top part that was supplied was not defective in any way.
 
 
 
He then went to explain why the improvement was made. He said: 
 
The new top part differs from the old top part in that the springs and ... the retainer nuts are of different design. The dimensions of these are also different. The combination of the new top part is a retainer nut of 22mm with spring of 105mm as against a 32mm retainer nut and a 72mm spring in the old top part.
 
 
 
The new top part with this combination ensures even compression. The purpose of the longer and stronger spring is to improve the roil on and roll off effect of fuel pump components on the camshaft. The shorter spring would not follow the camshaft smoothly. Because of the uneven contact of the cam damages to camshaft and to components were experienced. The change in design was to extend the life of those prematurely worn out components.
This modification of the new top part has been in existence for many years. This is the first time a complaint has been made that a long spring had been used and subsequently caused all the damages alleged by the defendants.
The main question which I have to decide is: what caused the main engine of the United Glory to fail on 14 August 1980? Was it due to longer springs in the NTP supplied by the plaintiffs and installed by the chief engineer on the second pump, or was it caused by some pre-existing defect in the main engine itself, or by the improper fitting of the NTP by the chief engineer.
In his submissions counsel for the plaintiffs raised the question of the admissibility of the vessel`s official log-book marked as exhs D26A, B and C for identification. It is submitted that at the conclusion of the hearing, no proper evidence has been adduced by the defendants for the admission of these exhibits in that they failed to produce: 
 
 
(1) The maker of the documents, ie the master, Capt Fabricius. 
 
(2) Evidence to support that the log-book was kept by the master in accordance with the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 172, 1970 Ed).
  
 
 
Counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the log-book was not kept in accordance with s 140(4) of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 172, 1970 Ed) (the Act) which provides: 
 
An entry required by this Act in an official log-book shall be made as soon as possible after the occurrence to which it relates, and if not made on the same day as that occurrence shall be made and dated so as to show the date of the occurrence and of the entry respecting it; and if made in respect of an occurrence happening before the arrival of the ship at her final port of discharge shall not be made more than 24 hours after that arrival.
 
 
 
There are discrepancies in the recording of dates of occurrence and dates of entry in the log-book. For example: 
 
 
(a) Occurrence of 12 August 1980, appears at p 2 of D26B and the date of entry was 13 August 1980. Occurrence of 12 August 1980, appears again at p 23 of D26B, with date of entry 12 August, 1980. 
 
(b) In the log-book D26B, occurrences of 15 August 1980 to 20 August 1980 were not entered until September 1980. Occurrences of 21 August 1980 to 31 August 1980 were not entered until September 1980. 
 
(c) Occurrence of 18 August 1980, appears at p 4 of D26B and date of entry was 2 September 1980. Occurrence of 18 August 1980 appears again at p 17 of D26B with date of entry 8 September 1980, after the occurrence of 3 September 1980. 
 
(d) Occurrence of 19 August 1980, appears at p 4 of D26B and date of entry was 2 September 1980. Occurrence of 19 August 1980 appears again at p 17 of D26B with date of entry 8 September 1980, after the occurrence of 3 September 1980.
  
 
 
It is further submitted that s 140(5) and s 143 of the Act have not been complied with.
Section 140(5) provides that: `Every entry in the official log-book shall be signed by the master and by the mate or some other member of the crew.` Section 143 provides: 
 
 
(1) The master of every ship for which an official log-book is required by this Act shall, upon the discharge of the crew, deliver the official log-book of the voyage to the Superintendent. 
 
(2) Any master of a ship who fails without reasonable cause to comply with this section shall be subject to a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars.
  
 
 
At the hearing on 14 October 1987, counsel for the plaintiffs applied for the official log-book of the United Glory to be produced by the defendants. Counsel for the defendants informed the court that it was with the Marine Department, Singapore, and that he would request for the log-book to be produced. On 15 October 1987, counsel for the defendants informed the court that he had made arrangements to pick up the log-book and that it should be in court shortly but it was not produced. At the continued hearing on 29 March 1988, counsel for the defendants informed the court that he had received the log-book from the Marine Department and he tendered it and it was marked exh D26A, B and C for identification. No official from the Marine Department, Singapore, was to testify that they received D26A, B and C from the master of the United Glory.
The defendants say that the master Capt Willy Fabricius signed off the vessel in December 1980 in Singapore and that the vessel was sold in late December 1980 and that they have not been able to contact the master. Each entry in the log-book bears only one signature. No attempt was made by the defendants to identify that signature. There is no evidence that it is the signature of the master. The chief engineer cannot attest to the truth or accuracy of the contents of the log-book D26A, B and C. The chief engineer has even criticized the master for errors and failure in the recording of the log-book. Section 140(6) provides that `every entry made in an official logbook in the manner provided by this Act shall be admissible in evidence`. In the premises the log-book D26A, B and C is not admissible in evidence.
The plaintiffs suggested that the cause of the failure of the vessel`s main engine was the existing poor condition of the engine itself which was installed in 1955.
The evidence of the chief engineer was that when he joined the United Glory in December 1977, he checked the engineer`s log-book for the previous year and was satisfied that the engine had been properly maintained. There had been no major breakdowns; there had been no report of any damage to the coupling, cam shaft or injector pump top part. After he joined the vessel in December 1977 up to August 1984, there was no major breakdown of the engine. The engineers carried out normal maintenance work and overhauling of pistons. No one had opened up the coupling. The second pump was the older of the two pumps and the process of wearing out was an on-going one from the time the pump was newly installed a long time ago. He had informed the owners that the second pump needed to be replaced in May 1980. The main engine with the old second pump continued to function satisfactorily and the vessel sailed without any problems during the two months until the NTP was fitted and the engine broke down about 107 hours after that. When the NTP was fitted there was no interference with the coupling.
The plaintiffs also suggested that the chief engineer had failed to calibrate or make the necessary adjustments when fitting the NTP and contended that the damage to the pump was due to the `inexperience, inability and shoddy repairs` on the part of the chief engineer and his crew.
The chief engineer first started work in ships` engine rooms in 1955 and had worked his way up from engine boy to chief engineer. He obtained his engineer`s certificate in 1968 and at present he holds a chief engineer`s licence for motor ships and a first class licence for steamships. The chief engineer said that although this was the first occasion he had worked on a Deutz engine, in principle the Deutz engine was the same as the other engines and he had no problems handling the pumps on the United Glory. From the time he joined the United Glory until 14 August 1980, when the engine broke down, he had no problems handling the engine of the vessel. He also said that he had experience in replacing the top units of fuel injector pumps and that he had done this many times previously. On the other occasions the engine had not failed.
As regards the fitting of the NTP and the adjustment screw (calibration), the chief engineer said that not all engines had the same procedure for adjustment, but in this case he followed the instructions in the Deutz manual book in adjusting the screw. He was aware what would happen if the adjustment was not correctly done: the performance of the engine would be reduced and if the adjustment was too far out it could damage the fuel injector pump. That would be noticeable when he started the engine. He said that after he had installed the NTP at Newcastle there was no problem with the engine.
 Cause of damage 
The chief engineer said that, when compressed, the longer springs of 102mm needed more power to compress fully. The free space (the distance from the set collar to the retaining nut when the plunger is in the top position) was about 46mm. When the engine was at full speed, the plungers moved up and down at the rate of 175 times a minute. This would be affected by the longer springs. As the longer springs, when fully compressed, measured about 48mm, there was not enough free space and the springs were then forced sideways. The effect of this on the camshaft was that extra load was needed to lift the plungers to the top centre. The extra load adversely affected the camshaft which, in turn, caused the engine`s speed to slow down.
Tests were carried out on the two lengths of springs by Det Norske Veritas (South East Asia) Pte Ltd to determine load displacement properties (exh D18). According to the test results, in the case of the longer spring, it required about three times more power to lift the plunger to the top centre.
The chief engineer said that as a result of the extra load needed to lift the plungers due to the long spring, there was more load on the coupling, causing the coupling-key groove to become widened. The consequence of this was that the injection of fuel from the plungers to the cylinders was delayed, thereby delaying the start of firing in the main cylinder, resulting in the loss of power in the main engine.
Since the coupling drove the camshaft, the extra load exerted on the coupling by the longer springs was transferred to the small key whose function was only to keep the camshaft from slipping out of the groove.
At Lae, the chief engineer tested the alignment and bearing of the pumps by removing their springs and found that, after the drive shaft between the pumps and the engine was dismantled, the pump shaft could be turned freely. This showed that there was nothing wrong with the alignment or the bearing.
Schorn agreed that such loss of engine performance would not lead to the type of engine damage which the United Glory suffered. Schorn agreed that the break down after 107 hours of operation did not occur due to high exhaust temperature. When it was put to him that that would confirm that the adjustment was correctly made, Schorn replied that if it was correctly made `then one can only speak of luck that due to all these installation errors the measurement turned out to be correct`. Schorn also confirmed that the Deutz manual book contained detailed information of all the steps to follow.
A test was also carried out at Lae by the chief engineer before the longer springs were cut. And the springs were taken out of the two pumps. The camshaft could be turned freely by hand. The short springs were put in the first pump. The camshaft could be turned freely by hand. Then the short springs were removed from the first pump and the long springs were put in the second pump. The result was that the camshaft could not be turned manually because there was insufficient free space for the long springs when fully compressed.
Although the long springs were cut on the advice of Rannard, the chief engineer did not install the cut springs in the second pump. He installed four 72mm springs from an old fuel injector pump which he found in the vessel`s store because more power would still be needed for the thicker springs to be compressed. After the substitution of the springs in the second pump, the main engine was functioning properly.
The vessel then left Lae on 13 September 1980 for Gladstone. When the chief engineer stopped the main engine on 15 September 1980 and checked the fuel injector pumps, he found them to be in good order and functioning normally. However, on 18 September 1980 the chief engineer found that the lower part of the second pump was hotter than normal. When he stopped the engine and investigated the cause of this, he found that the shaft for the roller follower was broken, one bush bearing holder was broken and another bush bearing holder was cracked.
The necessary repairs were carried out but as the bush bearing holders could not be removed for repairs as they were parts of the body of the pump itself, he immobilized cylinders 6 and 7, which were parts before and after the broken bush bearing holders.
The vessel then sailed on six cylinders at reduced speed and reached Gladstone on 19 September 1980. After effecting the necessary repairs and passing the survey, the United Glory left Gladstone on 17 October 1980, for Port Moresby, from there to Banjarmasin and returned to Singapore on 4 November 1980. During this last voyage, which covered 18 sailing days, there were no further problems with the main engine or the pumps.
The chief engineer was of the opinion that the cause of the breakdown from Newcastle to Lae was the long springs in the NTP which were purchased from the plaintiffs and which were fitted to the second pump. He said: 
 
The cause of the breakdown from Lae to Gladstone in my opinion is that the bearing bush holder was cracked during the first breakdown. The other damages also were caused during the first breakdown. It was not discovered in Lae because the crack had been in a place where it is not easy to see. You can`t see if the top part of the pump is taken off.
 
 
 
The opinion of Rannard, who went on board the United Glory at Lae and Gladstone to survey and ascertain for the London Salvage Association, the cause, nature and extent of the damages suffered by the vessel, was that `the only probable logical cause of damage could be due to overstressing caused by the fitting of heavy springs, ie the springs which I found in the second pump at Lae.` He was also of the opinion `that overstressing was in all likelihood caused at the time of running with the heavy springs from Newcastle to Lae (which) had not manifested itself until close to or near Gladstone. Not to my knowledge that the damage was not caused by the springs.`
Rannard said that the pump would not operate if it was built for a larger spring and a smaller spring was used in its place. He had no doubt at all that the proper spring for the second pump would be the shorter spring. Schorn agreed that the longer springs would exert greater pressure on the camshaft than the shorter springs would. Rannard also was of the opinion that it was not a complicated task to fit the top part of the pump to the bottom part of the pump and the whole pump fitted to the engine.
Rannard, when told in cross-examination that the NTP was a modified version and that it had a 22mm retainer nut instead of the 32mm retainer nut found in the old unit said: `It may possibly be a new modification; it only reduces the height of the spring by 10mm not the 30mm required.` He did not agree that the modified top part of the pump could function either independently or together with an old top part pump.
Rannard also said that it was possible that even a reputable firm of manufacturers of diesel engines including Deutz could include the wrong parts.
Schorn during cross-examination was asked how the top unit was assembled in the factory. He said single components were taken and assembled on to the top part. The person assembling the top unit would pick up the various component parts following the given serial number for each part. He said both the longer springs and the old shorter springs had the same serial number. He agreed that in 1980 the shorter springs were still being supplied by some authorized suppliers. He also said that a ship owner had the option to purchase the longer or the shorter springs. The 22mm retainer nuts and the 32mm retainer nuts also had the same serial number. He agreed that it was possible for the person who assembled the top unit, through carelessness, to put in the shorter retainer nuts and the long springs.
The plaintiffs suggested that the cause of the breakdown could be attributed to the coupling between the first and second pumps not being properly assembled. The chief engineer said that when he fitted the NTP to the bottom part of the second pump at Newcastle he did not have to remove the bottom part and there was no interference with the coupling.
As for the series of breakdowns which occurred since 14 August 1980, Rannard noted that the main problem was with the coupling of the first pump and not the injector pump. He said: 
 
In this case the key of the first pump coupling, which is a drive section of the coupling, kept failing and the initial failure was in my opinion caused by excessive cam pressure from the second pump which was caused by the necessity to compress the longer springs and heavier springs a longer distance.
 
 
 
In cross-examination, Rannard was asked if the damage to the camshaft could be attributed to the coupling being badly installed, and he replied: `It could be but I did not find it in that way.` He explained that the failure of the coupling which was the weakest part, was caused by fatigue brought on by excessive loading.
He concluded that `the cause of this problem - too much pressure applied to the camshaft of the second (pump) which was transferred, as is normal, to the driven coupling of the first pump`. Referring to the damage which occurred subsequently during the voyage from Lae to Gladstone, Rannard said that it could not be caused by the use of the cut springs. When asked if the damage could be caused by the camshaft and key way being slack, Rannard said: 
 
I said it could be a cause. It is not a probable cause in this case. As there was no damage to the driven coupling on the second pump it would mean that all the forces required to move the second, ie torsional forces were transmitted to the driving coupling on the first pump which would be normal; in other words, the driving coupling normally takes more of the forces involved than the driven coupling.
 
 
 
Rannard agreed that incorrect seating of the coupling hub could result in damage to the hub. But in this case he did not attribute it to incorrect seating. He said: 
 
The hub itself is a machined part and I don`t know if Deutz used manual or not but the bore of the hub and the tapered section of the shaft are supplied by manufacturers ready to be fitted together without further machining or fitting.
 
 
 
When it was suggested to Rannard that wrong alignment could be a possible cause of the engine breakdown he replied: 
 
In this particular case it is not probable, it is possible. When the new top half of pump was fitted at Newcastle, the bottom part was said not to have been removed, in which case the coupling would not have been touched or disturbed.
 
 
 
I saw the chief engineer reassemble the complete pumps No 1 and 2 at Lae and fitted on to the engine at Lae. It was done correctly.
During the trial the plaintiffs produced a complete injector pump exh P4. Schorn said: 
 
Exhibit P4 is a complete pump. This pump was assembled with standard components; in addition, the spring and retainer nut combination was varied to show the court the possibilities of using long and short, short and long, the different combinations, which we marked as A, B, C and D.
 
 
 
In A combination of 22mm retainer nut and 109mm spring. A represents the new modified version.
B has a combination of 32mm retainer nut and spring of 72mm. This represents the combination of the ... original top part of the second pump in the United Glory.
C has the combination of 22mm retainer nut with a 72mm spring, short and short.
D has a 32mm retainer nut and 105mm spring, long and long.
Exhibit P4 was examined by Rannard and the chief engineer. In the course of the cross-examination of Rannard, he was asked to demonstrate on the various combinations A, B and D. Demonstration on combination A: Rannard was asked to turn the camshaft. He found that the spring moved freely and the spring did not compress to a solid or near solid. However, he was not satisfied that the spring was pre-set to the correct tension as shown in the drawing of the new unit exh P3.
Demonstration on combination B: This represented the combination of the original top part of the second pump. When Rannard turned the camshaft he said it was slightly lighter (in turning) than in combination A. He agreed that in combinations A and B both functioned smoothly. Demonstration on combination D: When Rannard turned the camshaft he found that he could not move it. Rannard said he could see that the long spring was compressed solid.
When asked if with this combination the pump could operate for five minutes without causing extensive damage, Rannard replied that it was possible to operate but improbable; that it would depend on the amount of hp being supplied to the unit by the engine; that the resultant effect would be extensive damage only to the pump.
Rannard`s evidence was that when he went to the engine room at Lae he found that the two sections of the second pump had been removed from the engine and that he used the first pump to test first the compression of the old short spring and later the compression of the long spring from the NTP and that was when he found that the long spring became a solid cylinder. At that time the fact that the old top part had a long retainer nut of 32mm was not in his mind. He agreed that the result of his test at Lae corresponded exactly with the position he demonstrated in combination D of exh P4, but provided that the pump exh P4 was identical to the one on board the United Glory.
Rannard said that the pump exh P4 appeared to be similar to the pump on board the United Glory but he had reservations as to whether they were identical. He said if it was not identical it could have an effect on the tests carried out in court on exh P4 depending on the sizes of the parts. When he checked exh P4, he had the plaintiffs` mechanics measure for him one fuel pump plunger. He noted that this plunger measured just over 20mm in diameter which was the size of the plunger shown on the drawing exh P2 which was the original pump fitted to the United Glory; however, the diameter of the plunger shown on drawing exh P3, which the plaintiffs said was the new modified pump, was 17.5mm. Rannard said that the length of the plunger could make a difference. However, he was unable to scale the length of the two plungers from the drawings exhs P2 and P3 so that accurate comparison could not be made by him.
Rannard also said that he noted that the coupling collar piece in exh P4 was visibly different from that which was on board the vessel: the collar driving faces of exh P4 were of more substantial design and strength than that observed by him on the United Glory.
Rannard referred to his report exh D12, p 4 para 3, and said that with the shorter spring fitted, the spring did not become a solid cylinder until it had been reduced in length to 47mm, while the longer spring became a solid cylinder at 48mm. He added: `Those two dimensions were later checked by the method I have already given which, compared, indicated that the correct ... spring to use was the short spring which would still have free compression available whilst the long spring would have been solid.`
Referring to the demonstration on exh P4, Rannard said that with the combinations B and D the longer spring would become a solid on compression, whereas with combination A there would be greater room for compression without becoming a solid.
Rannard said that the combination of long spring and short retainer nut was not compatible with the pump that was supplied or suitable for the engine that was on the United Glory and such a combination would have led to the damage which the vessel had sustained. He also said that the longer spring with a greater tension was more suitable for a higher capacity engine or a different type of pump than that which was on the vessel.
The chief engineer said that the NTP was made for a more powerful engine than that which was on the United Glory.
Rannard explained the basic operation of the engine on the United Glory. The camshaft was powered by the engine through the coupling. The cam of the camshaft lifted the plunger. If the springs in the fuel injector pump were oversized, the cam would exert extra pressure to push up the plunger for the camshaft to rotate. The effect of this would be to push the camshaft downwards. The coupling was the weakest part of the whole system. Normally when the engine was working smoothly the coupling would not break. When the camshaft which drove the plunger moved out of alignment, there would be extra pressure which would lead to failure of the driving key and the tendency would be eventually to spin on the shaft and not drive it. This would result in the coupling being subjected to stress. When this happened the consequences would be: 
 
 
(a) that the fuel would be injected prematurely or late which would reduce the power in the cylinder leading to the engine slowing down; 
 
(b) that it would cause wear in the bore of the coupling which would eventually cause slackness and lack of turning of the camshaft and could possibly break the shaft.
  
 
 
In the case of the `United Glory`, the coupling key gave way in the second pump, causing the shaft to shear or break adjacent to the end of the coupling. In Rannard`s opinion, the fitting of the heavier springs placed an excessive load on the camshaft and its driving key. This overloading in the pump caused the key to break and the camshaft to shear and this in turn led to the other damages.
Referring to the demonstration on combination D in exh P4 when he and others were unable to turn the camshaft manually, Rannard said that he thought that the vessel`s engine could have turned it. This was confirmed by the chief engineer who said that when he installed the NTP at Newcastle there was no difficulty in turning using the vessel`s engine.
Rannard said that with combination D the United Glory could have sailed. In fact the engine ran for about 104 hours before the engine broke down. Rannard explained that the driving key, which was the part that transmitted power, gradually became fatigued over a period of time. The key was gradually worn in the key way until the engine failed when the key and the key way gave way due to the excessive pressure or load on the camshaft.
After the breakdown of the vessel`s engine, the defendants ordered spares for the repairs of the engine at Gladstone from the plaintiffs. Among the spares ordered were four pieces of helical springs bearing Fig Item No 0117-762. Schorn confirmed that the plaintiffs supplied 72mm springs. Schorn explained: 
 
The Fig No 0117-606 represents the complete top part fuel pump. This number will cross-reference with our factory into a part number. The technician who will receive the order for this will cross-reference and he will find the engine was built with this part number but there will be a notification that this part has been replaced with a new part. If you order individual parts the supply would be for the old original unit.
 
 
 
Schorn was asked why the NTP Fig Item No 0117-606, which was supplied in July 1980, was fitted with 105mm helical springs and in August 1980 when the defendants ordered helical springs Fig Item No 0117-762 they were unit. Schorn replied: 
 
I don`t know if the order suggested that these springs should be for the new top part. But suppose I was the technician in the parts department and you wanted springs one month after you have been supplied with a new modified unit, I would guess that these springs would be for the existing original unit and I would then supply you the short springs.
 
 
 
Schorn said that the plaintiffs` spare parts book DB129 which was on board the United Glory did not contain any information or notification that the springs had been modified. He explained that the spare parts book DB129 only specified the Fig number and not the part number. He said that there was a separate spare parts book cross-referencing the Fig number with the actual part number. This second book was not with the owners of the vessel. He said that when the defendants ordered the four helical springs they would follow the No 0117-762 and this would `allow the technical people to deliver the exact part number and size of springs`.
Schorn said that when ordering a set of helical springs it was not sufficient just to give the engine model number. The serial number of the engine was required and then the plaintiffs would `determine the size of springs fitted in the particular type of pumps` and the correct size helical springs would be supplied. Schorn was asked and he replied that in determining which size of springs to supply, the plaintiffs would inquire whether the pump was a modified one. When asked if in this case when the helical springs were ordered whether such information was sought he replied: 
 
I don`t know, I was not present when these springs were ordered.
 
 
 
When asked: `If there was no such inquiry will you agree that the wrong size springs might be supplied?`, he answered: `There is no wrong size spring, short or long both are correct.`
Schorn agreed that both the 72mm and 105mm springs bore the same Fig No of 0117-762. According to Rannard, the 72mm and 102mm helical springs should not have had the same serial number. Schorn, when asked whether he was in a position to say whether the NTP supplied was assembled according to Fig No 0117-606, answered: 
 
I have not seen the pump then, so I cannot confirm.
 
 
 
Schorn was asked: `When you say that the new unit should have had the 105mm springs and 22mm retainer nuts you are of course assuming it.` He replied: `No. With the longer retainer nut the full movement of your pump stroke is not possible.` He was asked: `That would still be an assumption based on your engineering experience.` He replied: `Correct. I did not see what went into the unit.`
Schorn when asked what, in his opinion, the cause of the breakdown of the vessel`s engine was on the voyage, he said the coupling was not correctly tightened and that that conclusion was based on `reading the log book, examining the possibilities of the various spring combinations`. He said that that was the only possibility he had arrived at.
Schorn agreed that the longer thicker springs would require more power to compress; he said: `That was the purpose of this modification.` He agreed that this would mean that the longer thicker springs would exert greater pressure on the cam than the shorter ones would and that the greater pressure on the cam would be transferred in turn to the coupling. Schorn, however, said that the additional pressure would have no effect on the coupling at all.
Schorn said that it was necessary to remove the pump and separate the coupling to carry out the repairs that were carried out by the chief engineer before the vessel sailed for Lae and that the job of refitting the coupling required care and attention to ensure that the components of the coupling were assembled correctly. The evidence is that there were no problems with the coupling until the NTP had been installed on the second pump and the vessel had sailed for about five days. Schorn agreed that if the coupling had been incorrectly fitted after the repairs, engine trouble would have manifested itself sooner and ought to have been noticed by the chief engineer. However, the evidence is that no engine trouble or overheating was noted until after five days sailing.
Both the 72mm and 102mm helical springs bore the same Fig Item No 0117-762 and both the long and the short retainer nuts bore the same Fig Item number in the spare parts book of the plaintiffs on board the United Glory. Schorn agreed that the short springs were still being supplied as late as 1984. Schorn said: 
 
When the defendants placed the order, they checked the spare parts book and identified a Fig number for the complete top part injection pump. Upon receipt of an order like this, either we in Singapore will cross-reference this Fig number with technical information available to us to ensure that the top part which will be supplied is the correct type. In cases where these informations are not available to us, identical work of cross-referencing will be done in the factory. The supply therefore of this component fuel injection top part is identical and will include technical improvements to the components. In other words, the improvements will in no way jeopardize functioning of the component; improvements are to improve performance of this component.
 
 
 
We would have to check with engine records. We are Deutz and we will only keep records for Deutz engines. The engine in use the United Glory was built by Deutz and we have records of this engine.
The top part was supplied according to the order contained in the telex. The top part that was supplied was suitable for use on the United Glory. This top part will function properly if fitted properly by the ship`s engineers. The top part that was supplied was not defective in any way.
Schorn said that when a set of helical springs was ordered in order to ascertain which size of springs to supply, it was necessary not only to know the engine model number but also the serial number of the engine.
The evidence reveals that when the new top part was ordered by the defendants, the plaintiffs did not ascertain the model engine number nor the serial number of the engine which was on board the United Glory. The Deutz diesel engine was installed on the United Glory in 1955, many years before the new modified top part of the pump came into existence. Both Rannard and the chief engineer said that the combination of long thick springs and short retainer nuts in the NTP was not suitable for the engine that was on the United Glory. The chief engineer said that the NTP was made for a more powerful engine than that on the United Glory.
In Rannard`s considered independent opinion, the long thick springs ought not to have been there, and the key of the first pump kept failing, caused by excessive cam pressure from the second pump, which was caused by the necessity to compress the longer and thicker springs a longer distance. He also noted that the cause of the coupling giving way was due to too much pressure being applied on the camshaft of the second pump; as was normal, in such cases, the pressure was transferred from the camshaft to the driving coupling of the first pump. He concluded that the failure of the coupling, which was the weakest part, was caused by fatigue brought on by excessive pressure. The overloading in the pump also caused the coupling`s key in the second pump to break and the cam to shear, in turn leading to the other damages.
Rannard was also of the opinion that the combination of long springs and short retainer nuts was not compatible with the pump that was supplied, or suitable for the engine that was on board the vessel and that such a combination would lead to the damages which the vessel sustained. He was of the view that the longer springs with greater tension were more suitable for a higher capacity engine or a different pump than that which was on board the vessel.
The chief engineer said that according to the test results conducted by Det Norske Veritas (SE Asia) Pte Ltd contained in their report DB132, the longer springs required about three times more power to lift the plunger to top centre. This overloaded the coupling, causing the coupling key groove to become widened, resulting in the mistiming of fuel injection and loss of power in the main engine.
Schorn admitted that it was possible for the person who assembled the new top part ordered by the defendants to put into the unit the wrong combination of helical springs and retainer nuts.
The evidence is that the vessel did not experience any engine failure before the NTP was installed at Newcastle or after the chief engineer had substituted the 102mm helical springs in the NTP for the old 72mm springs. The vessel completed its last journey from Gladstone to Port Moresby and Banjermasin and Singapore, a total of 18 days sailing, without any further problems with the 72mm new springs in the second pump supplied by the plaintiffs.
Rannard and the chief engineer both saw and physically examined the damage and sought its cause and they independently ascertained its cause and came up with the same answer and remedy. Schorn`s evidence was based entirely on assumptions and he arrived at his conclusions without making any enquiry.
After considering all the evidence, I find that the long thicker helical springs and the shorter retaining nuts installed in the NTP were the cause of the engine breaking down. The NTP supplied by the plaintiffs was meant to be installed as delivered without the defendants having to open it up and examine the springs. Even if the defendants had opened up the NTP on delivery, the chief engineer would not have known that it was a wrong combination. The defendants relied entirely on the plaintiffs to supply an NTP which could be used with the engine which was on the United Glory. The wrong combination of 102mm helical springs and 32mm retainer nuts were a hidden and latent defect.
Section 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 [UK] provides that where the seller sells goods in the course of a business and the buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known to the seller any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, there is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for that purpose, except where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is unreasonble for him to rely, on the skill and judgment of the seller.
Further, by s 14(2), in the case of a seller who sells good in the course of business, there is an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of merchantable quality, except that there is no such condition as regards defects specifically drawn to the buyer`s attention before the contract is made; or if the buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, as regards defects which that examination ought to reveal.
If there has been a breach of contract, it is immaterial whether or not the seller has been negligent; he is equally liable for latent defects in the articles which he sells, as for defects discoverable on reasonable examination.
As the plaintiffs in this case are both the sellers and manufacturers of the NTP supplied to the defendants, they are liable to the defendants both in contract for breach of contract, and in tort for negligence in the manufacture of the NTP.
Independent of any warranty, a person who manufactures and sells an article owes a duty to take reasonable care in its design and manufacture. The duty is not to cause injury to the consumer`s person or property (34 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) p 32 para 37).
The duty of care arises where the manufacturer sells the article in such a form as to show that he intends it to reach the user in the form in which it left him, without any reasonable likelihood of such intermediate examination as would have revealed the danger, and the article is put to the use for which it is intended (34 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) p 33 para 38).
In the result there will be judgment for the defendants on their counterclaim and costs for damages to be assessed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
In August 1978, the plaintiffs agreed to buy 1,000 metric tons of jute from a Thai company, and at about the same time agreed to sell the same goods to a German company controlled by Iranians for delivery to Khorramshahr in Iran. Cargo space was booked on the defendants` vessel, the Kota Sejarah, and the goods were loaded on board on 3 January 1979. Two clean bills of lading (KR-3 and KR-4) were issued for the goods. The ship was also carrying other jute for another consignee in Khorramshahr. The Kota Sejarah sailed from Bangkok on 6 January 1979 and arrived on or about 26 January 1979 at Basrah, a port situated across the Shatt al-Arab waterway from Khorramshahr. Due to congestion arising from a stevedores` and port workers` strike on account of the then political unrest in Iran, the ship could not get into Khorramshahr to await berthing for discharge of the goods. After waiting for about two weeks in Basrah, the defendants decided to invoke cl 5 of the bills of lading. They telexed their agents in Bangkok to inform the shippers of their decision as follows: 
 
In view of the condition now prevailing in Iran and stevedore strike at Khorrmshhr which prevent discharge of cargoes ..., owners hereby give notice that they are obliged to invoke cl 5 of the said bills of lading n accrdgly are proceeding to disch the said cgo at Mina Qaboos or any other convenient ports. You and all intrstd parties are hereby invited to make arrangements concerning storage n on carriage of the said cargo so discharged. The cgo owners are advsd to insure the cgo pending on carriage, if necessary.
 
 
 
On 2 February 1979, the plaintiffs telexed the defendants for information on the itinerary of the Kota Sejarah and on 3 February 1979 (BD45) the defendants telexed their reply in which they quoted the above quoted telex and further said: 
 
FYI most likely the cgo to be dischd at Porbander ... Pls note as we are responsible to the port authorities for storecharges, we place lien on cgo.
 
 
 
The defendants in fact selected Porbander on the west coast of India as the port of discharge and so informed the plaintiffs who then requested a refund of the freight. The defendants rejected the request on the ground of extra expenses incurred by the diversion and told the plaintiffs` agents to contact the defendants` agents in India, James Mackintosh & Co Ltd (JM), in order to arrange delivery of the goods.
On 13 February 1979, the plaintiffs telexed (BD57) the defendants that the Iranian buyers had rejected the invocation of cl 5 and for that reason would hold the defendants responsible for all consequences. On 19 February 1979, the plaintiffs telexed (BD62) JM informing JM that they were the holders of B/Ls KR-3 and KR-4 and inquiring about, inter alia, the insurance of the goods. The plaintiffs repeated this in their telex of 26 February 1979 (BD64) and also informed them that their managing director would be going to India. On 1 March 1979, the defendants telexed a reply (BD77) that because of the difficulty in obtaining insurance cover except for fire, lightning, explosion and flood, the `receivers` should arrange their own insurance. The defendants also inquired of the plaintiffs whether they or the receivers wished to make their own arrangements for forwarding the goods to Khorramshahr or to arrange with JM on their behalf and further requested that they be advised as to what the receivers intended in regard to the forwarding of the goods and on the insurance.
On 6 March 1979, SM Gourisaria (PW1), a director of the plaintiffs, was in Bombay. He met PJ Dalal (DW1), a manager with JM. They had a discussion on various matters relating to the goods. PW1 was told that the goods were stored in a bonded warehouse, the cost of storage, transport, wharfage, the rates of transhipment, and potential buyers of jute in the region. There are material disputes on what was said by each party or agreed between them. I shall deal with the evidence later on. From Porbander, PW1 went to Calcutta to see the Indian Jute Commissioner. From there he went to Dacca and then back to Bombay by the end of March where he met DW1 again. He returned to London at the beginning of April.
After that there was no further contact between the plaintiffs and the defendants or JM. On 9 May 1979, the plaintiffs tried to telex (BD86) the defendants of the current position relating to the ownership of the goods but were unable to do so. On 10 May 1979, they telexed JM the message they had wanted to send which JM agree to do. The message was as follows: 
 
Pls note that we as holders of the bills of lading referred to above hold entitlement to and are owners of the goods resulting from a situation in which our buyers have defaulted stop we are in process of selling these goods elsewhere and as such ask you to instruct your agents in India, James Mackintosh Co Pte Ltd, Bombay not to remove cargo without our written approval and if and when we are able to sell these goods we will then give them the necessary instructions for the appropriate release in yr favour or at our direction stop needless to say we will be responsible for storage charges in Porbander. Kindly confirm.
 
 
 
JM was able to relay the message to the defendants on the same day. On 11 May 1979, the defendants telexed (BD91) the plaintiffs that their telex had been out of order for two days, that it was too late to comply with the request as the goods had already been loaded on the Kota Agung sailing for and estimated to arrive at Mina Qaboos on 14 May 1979 and departing for Khorramshahr on 17 May 1979, and that they were prepared to unload the cargo at Mina Qaboos if permitted and subject to payment of all storage charges incurred at Porbander and at Mina Qaboos. On the same day, the defendants sent a telex to their agents at Khorramshahr to check from the consignees whether they had no further interest in the goods.
On receipt of the defendants` telex, the plaintiffs telexed JM on the same day that they did not want the cargo to be loaded. JM replied in the same telex that the cargo had been loaded, that the ship was sailing on the next day (12 May 1979) and that the cargo could not be discharged, even at the expense of the plaintiffs. At that point in the telex, the plaintiffs said: 
 
... We must point out that Pilship declared Porbander as their final port of discharge under cl 5 of their B/L we are holding all parties concerned responsible for loading this cargo without our approval we are now informing Pilship of the same that is if their telex still working in meantime through you we register our protest that what has been done is completely contrary to all known marine laws this is a serious matter and we reserve our right to take all legal action against all the parties concerned in this matter Mr Gourisaria our director had two meetings with Mr Dalal where all above was explained and even insurance etc for warehousing was done by us no one has any right to move our cargo without our prior permission.
 
 
 
On the same day, the plaintiffs sent the following telex (BD98A) to the defendants: 
 
We are completely shocked and surprised by the content of your telex. We put on record:
 
 
 
(1) You declared Porbander as your final port of discharge.
 
 
 
 
(2) You told us to do the needful. 
 
(3) We informed Mackintosh that we are the owners of the cargo and no one should do anything with the cargo without our prior written approval. 
 
(4) Our director Mr Gourisaria met Mackintosh executive Mr Dalal in Bombay on two occasions and he agreed that nothing will be moved without our written approval.
  
 
 
We must insist that you telex Bombay and off-load the cargo and leave it as it was where it was because in the first instance you said that Porbander is the final port of discharge. We find it most unethical, most unbusiness-like and contrary to all known trade practice that you took this decision unilaterally if we do not receive a satisfactory answer from you we are hereby holding you responsible for all consequences, losses etc and instructing our lawyers to take necessary action against your company.
 
 
 
In the meantime you are responsible for all the insurances etc on our above cargo.
 
 
 
Please acknowledge clear receipt of this telex.
 
 
 
On receipt of this telex, the defendants informed JM of its contents and asked JM for an explanation as to the allegation that JM had committed to the cargo owners as alleged by the plaintiffs. On 12 May 1979, the following telex was sent to the plaintiffs: 
 
We refer to exchange of tlxes ending with ours of 1/3 to u for instructions whether u or yr receivers wish to make any arrangement for onfrwarding to K`shahr or wish our agts to arrange on their behalf. No reply was recvd by u.
 
 
 
We thfore made arrangements to onfrwrd by our vsl K Agung. Almost all consignees hv given grntee to our K`shahr agts to cover all t/shipmnt expenses including freight n storage charges at Porbander at USD60 per ton.
 
 
 
We were never aware before of yr claim as ownrs of the consignmnts nor were we aware tht our Bombay agts had agreed which is denied, not to remove the cgo fm Porbander without yr written approval.
 
 
 
To assert yr title to the goods u must realize tht u hv to present relevant Bs/L in order tht we can comply with yr reqst.
 
 
 
If u wish to hv delivery of the goods u must present the Bs/L to us or give us an indemnity, grnteed by a Spore bank to cover the full value of the goods n all charges n expenses of reshipmnt.
 
 
 
Kindly advise what yr intentions are.
 
 
 
We must say yr remarks that our `conduct were unethical, most unbusiness-like` is unwarranted.
 
 
 
On the same day, Penningtons, the London solicitors for the plaintiffs telexed the defendants setting out what they claimed to be the legal position of their clients, and informing the defendants that the plaintiffs had approached buyers to renegotiate the purchase. On 16 May 1979, Penningtons telexed the defendants that the plaintiffs had failed to find a buyer in Khorramshahr and that the cargo must not be discharged at that port but to be returned to Porbander, but that they would not mind the cargo being shipped to Singapore or Bangkok.
On 17 May 1979, the defendants telexed Penningtons to say that they did not admit that the plaintiffs were entitled to the goods unless the bills of lading were presented to them and that the goods would be delivered to the party who presented valid bills of lading. On 24 May 1979, the plaintiffs through their solicitors, replied to Penningtons. Thereafter allegations and counter-allegations were exchanged, the net result of which was that the parties reached an agreement, without prejudice, to have the goods reshipped to Bangkok at an agreed freight rate. Unfortunately, there was no happy ending to the dispute as the Kota Agung, after arrival in Khorramshahr on 17 June 1979, caught fire on 9 July 1979 in the course of unloading its cargo, resulting in the total constructive loss of the goods. Hence this action.
 Issues 
A number of matters in dispute in the pleadings were agreed at the start of the trial. They were (a) that the plaintiffs were the owners of the goods at the time of the reloading at Porbander; (b) that the defendants had properly invoked cl 5 of the relevant bills of lading; and (c) that the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act (Cap 33) had no application to the transhipment of the goods. The issues which arise from the pleadings in the amended statement of claim and which I have to consider are as follows:
 
 
(1) paragraph 4(c): whether the defendants wrongfully and/or contrary to and in breach of the specific instructions of the plaintiffs removed the goods from the godown at Porbander and transhipped the same on board the Kota Agung; 
 
(2) paragraph 4(d): whether the removal and transhipment constituted conversion of the plaintiffs` goods; 
 
(3) paragraph 4(e): alternatively, whether the defendants were in breach of duty and/or negligent in the performance of the transhipment when the cargo was lost by fire on board.
  
 
 
 
 
 Issue 1 
 
 
 
The first issue requires a consideration of the following questions:
 
 
(i) as a matter of law, whether the defendants had the power to tranship the goods; 
 
(ii) if they had, whether their power to do so was expressly terminated by the plaintiffs when PW1 met DW1 in Bombay, and if not; 
 
(iii) whether such power was terminated on 11 May 1979. I shall consider the first question after I have dealt with the other two questions.
  
 
 
(i) Did the defendants have the power to tranship?
The defendants` case is that they had a right to tranship the goods even after they had abandoned the voyage. They have put their case on different and not necessarily consistent footings. First, they say that cll 5 and 10 of the bills of lading permitted them to do so even after the abandonment of the voyage. Secondly, they say that when they made the decision to abandon the voyage, they also, at the same time, decided to reserve the right to tranship the goods. It is not clear whether the second argument is founded on the general law or on the terms of the bills of lading. If on the bills of lading, as I think it is, it would suggest that cll 5 and 10 are open to two different constructions, one where the right or power to tranship is permitted without reservation and the other with reservation. Before I turn to these clauses, I think it will be useful to set out by way of background the general law governing an open contract of carriage.
The right or power of the shipowner to tranship cargo to its contractual destination arises in different circumstances as set out in 43 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 626 is as follows: 
 
Different kinds of transhipment. As the contract of carriage usually implies a term that the cargo is to be carried to its destination in the same bottom, it is necessary to consider how far the rights and liabilities of the parties are affected by the transhipment of the cargo during the voyage, in order that it may be carried to its destination in another ship. For this purpose three kinds of transhipment must be distinguished, namely, (1) transhipment under a liberty reserved in the contract; (2) transhipment in the interest of the shipowner after the ship has been disabled from continuing her voyage; and (3) transhipment in the interests of the cargo owner after the voyage has been abandoned.
 
 
 
The present case does not concern a transhipment of the second kind referred to in the said passage. It is not clear that it is a case of the third kind although counsel has advanced arguments on the facts which suggest that the defendants may also be relying on this kind of transhipment. So I shall deal with it. Briefly, the submission is that the abandonment of the voyage is not the abandonment of the goods and that the defendants did ask the plaintiffs for instructions as to what they wished to do when the goods landed at Porbander.
Under the general law, the abandonment of a voyage in consequence of a supervening event making it impossible for the shipowner to deliver the cargo to the consignees at its contractual destination leaves the goods in the de facto custody of the master. He becomes an agent of necessity and has a duty to protect the cargo until it can be discharged and, if necessary, warehoused until it can be delivered to the owners or to be dealt with on their instructions. The master may also tranship the cargo at once, without communicating with the owners, if the circumstances justify such a decision and if immediate transhipment is reasonably justifiable as being the most beneficial course to take: see 43 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
(4th Ed) para 634 (where two examples are given, where the goods are perishable and where the ship is in danger of floundering and is met by another ship to which they can be transhipped). In such a case the master enters into the contract of transhipment as agent for the owners and not for the shipowner. Except in these circumstances, the master may not tranship the goods without obtaining the consent of the owners where it is reasonably possible to communicate with the owners to obtain such consent.
The decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 
 Barker v Burns Philp & Co Ltd 
 (1944) 45 SR (NSW) 1 is a useful illustration of the duties of a master where the contract of carriage is frustrated by a supervening event. B & Co (the plaintiffs) shipped, freight prepaid, bags of flour on board a ship owned by BP (the defendants) to consignees at Singapore, Malacca and Penang. Enroute the ship called at Batavia (now Jakarta) three miles from the berthing area where it awaited permission to discharge its cargo. Shortly afterwards, Batavia was bombed and the master received news that Singapore had fallen to the Japanese. The master tried unsuccessfully to communicate with BP through military channels but did not attempt to communicate with BP through the local wireless or cable offices, although in fact such communication was possible. On the eleventh day after arrival, he was told to go to berth but owing to the chaotic shore conditions and the deterioration of the war position, resulting in lack of shore assistance for discharging and the length of time it would take to do so, he decided to take the cargo back to Sydney. He also formed the view that the cargo would be lost if it was discharged at Batavia. The ship arrived in Sydney on 2 April 1942 with the flour still on board. B & Co were advised that he had to pay half the original outward freight to obtain the flour. B & Co paid the back freight under protest and without prejudice to their rights and commenced an action to recover the back freight on the ground that the master had no authority to carry the cargo back to Sydney without the authority of the owners and if they did have authority under the bill of lading back freight was not chargeable.
The Full Court held, by a majority, that BP were not entitled to back freight. The court was unanimous that the master had abandoned the voyage but each member of the court took a different view of what the rights of the shipowner thereafter. Jordan CJ (and it would appear that Davidson J agreed with him on this point) held that there was nothing in the bill of lading which expressly authorized the master to carry the cargo back to Sydney after abandonment. Jordan CJ then considered the general law and held that the master, in failing to communicate with the owners of the goods when it was reasonably possible to do so in order to obtain their sanction, acted without authority. Davidson J, however, held that in the conditions then prevailing the master could not reasonably have communicated with the owners when he decided to ship the cargo back in the interest of the owners. Street J held that the bill of lading did authorize the back carriage but that its terms disentitled the defendants to back freight.
Jordan CJ, after considering the terms of the bill of lading and the general law, said: 
 
The rights and duties of the carrier in this respect are always subject to the provisions of the contract of carriage; and hence it is necessary in the present case to refer to the bill of lading. There can be no doubt that the course taken by the ship from its leaving Sydney on 13 December 1941, to its putting into the roadstead at Batavia on 8 February 1942, was all in the fulfilment of the contract voyage. This is provided for by the last of the clauses added on the front of the bill of lading. Upon his arrival at Batavia, the master obviously regarded the entering of or discharging in the ports of discharge, Singapore, Penang and Malacca, as being unsafe and likely to prejudice the interests of the vessel and her cargo. He was therefore authorized by cl 3(e) printed on the back of the bill of lading to land the goods at the vessel`s most convenient port selected by him; and if he had done so at Batavia (as he at first intended) this would have constituted due delivery under the bill of lading, because the clause expressly so provides. However, he did not do so. Before he had an opportunity, the war position had so deteriorated that he formed the opinion that if he discharged the goods there they would probably be lost, and he therefore decided to take them back to Sydney, the port from which they had been consigned. I do not think that this course is provided for by the endorsed cl 3(e) or 3(h). These, I think, contemplate the landing of the cargo at some port or ports reached in the course of the voyage to the port of destination, a landing which is agreed to constitute due delivery under the bill. They do not contemplate a new voyage undertaken after the abandonment of the contract voyage, and a landing after the new voyage. Nor does added condition No 1 on the front of the bill of lading touch the point. This is directed to temporary storage of goods in contemplation of the commencement or continuance of the voyage contracted for. I think that the proper inference from the evidence is that at Batavia the master ultimately decided to abandon the voyage. This he was entitled to do under the added condition No 2 on the front of the bill, a condition which authorizes him, when a state of war exists, either to abandon the voyage or to alter the route and proceed to the port of discharge by a different route. If he adopts the latter course he is performing the intended voyage in a varied but permitted manner. If the former, the voyage is abandoned, and the question arises as to what is to be done with the goods. No provision is made for this in the special added war provision. Incl 9 of the ordinary provisions, it is provided that if on arriving at the port of destination the master is prevented from discharging the goods for certain reasons, he may take them back to the port of shipment or land them at any other port at the risk and expense of the owner of the goods. But no such provision is made in relation to an abandonment of the voyage under the special war clause No 2. In my opinion, therefore, the position at Batavia was that the master was entitled, without reference to the owner of the goods, to land them there and also to abandon the voyage, if he thought this best in the interests of all parties, but that, he having abandoned the voyage, there was nothing in the bill of lading which entitled him to carry them to some other port without communicating to the owners of the goods (if it were reasonably possible to do so with a reasonable expectation of receiving a timely answer) such reasonably adequate information of the nature of the emergency and of the nature of, and reasons for, his proposed action, as it was reasonably possible for him to give, and obtaining their sanction. He was therefore not justified in taking the course which he did without instructions from them, unless (i) it was both necessary and reasonable so to carry the goods in what he might reasonably regard as the best interests of the shippers and (2) it was not reasonably possible for him to communicate with them, in circumstan ces giving a reasonable expectation that an answer would be received in time, or, if such communication was possible, and was had, no sufficient instructions were received in time to give him a reasonable opportunity of complying with them before it became necessary to act. In other words, I am of opinion that there is nothing in the bill of lading which takes the case out of the general law. It now remains to apply it.
 
 
 
 
 
 Barker 
 
 `s case is an application of the general principle that the abandonment of a voyage resulting from the occurrence of a supervening event as prescribed by the contract of carriage results in the termination of the contract and that in such event the right or power of the shipowner to ship the goods back to Sydney ceases unless such a right is expressly reserved in the contract or the master acts as an agent of necessity. The defendants have not put their defence on the basis that they were acting as agents of necessity. If they had done so, the defence would also failed as it is not disputed that the defendants failed to communicate with the plaintiffs when they could have done so long before they decided to load the goods on board the Kota Agung.
The relevant provisions of the bills of lading, ie cll 5, 10 and 14, read: 
 
5 If the ... discharge or delivery is impeded ... by ... labour regulations lockouts strikes or disturbances ... or by absence from any cause of facilities for ... discharge or delivery or congestion or difficulties in ... discharge the carrier ... and/or the Master may (if in his or their uncontrolled discretion he or they think it advisable) at any time ... after the commencement of the voyage abandon 
 or
suspend the voyage 
 or
 alter or vary or depart from the proposed or advertised or agreed or customary route 
 and/or
delay or detain the vessel at or off any port or place 
 and or
tranship and forward subject the provisions of cl 11 hereof 
 or
put into hulk lighter or craft or land or store or otherwise dispose of the cargo at any port without being liable for any loss or damage whatsoever directly or indirectly sustained by the owners of the goods and all at the risk and expense of the owners of the goods. Anything done or not done by reason of or in compliance with the provisions hereinbefore contained or any of them shall be deemed to be within the contract voyage ... .
 
 
 
10 Transhipment and Forwarding. ... The shipper or consignee constitutes the carrier his agent to enter into contracts with others for the ... subsequent transport of the goods and/or storing transhipping or otherwise dealing with them ... without responsibility for any act neglect or omission on the part of the carrier ... If the goods cannot be forwarded immediately to destination any charges incurred for storage shall be borne by the owners of the goods.
 
 
 
14 Where customs at port of transhipment or delivery require any bond or undertaking before permitting the landing or forwarding of dutiable goods the carrier, master or agents are hereby authorized to give such undertaking on behalf of owners of the goods who shall indemnify the carrier from all risks and expenses incurred. The carrier and/or master porter are authorized by the owners of dutiable cargo at any port, during and after discharge, at their sole discretion, to incur and pay customs charges for watching such cargo which charges the owners thereof undertake to pay, any custom of the port to the contrary notwithstanding.
 
 
 
Although cl 5 refers to cl 11, counsel for the defendant says that it is an obvious typesetting error and that the correct reference is cl 10. I do not consider this a material point and will therefore assume that there is such an error. Beyond contending that the said clauses allowed the defendants, after an abandonment of the voyage, to tranship the goods without having to communicate with the plaintiffs, counsel for the defendants has made no attempt to analyse the structure of cl 5. It is clear that cl 5 reserves to the defendants a number of options to take if the discharge of cargo is hindered by the occurrence of any of the prescribed events. The defendants may abandon the voyage, or suspend it or delay it. They may also discharge the cargo, presumably after an abandonment or a suspension of the voyage. They may also tranship the goods. However, the crucial question is whether the power to tranship the goods is cumulative with or alternative with the power to abandon the voyage. Counsel has not made any submission on why cl 5 should be construed so as to reserve to the defendants the power to tranship the goods after they, in abandoning the voyage and discharging the goods at Porbander, had fulfilled their part of the contract. In my view, and having regard to the general law, cl 5 cannot be so construed. Such a construction will enable the defendants to decide on a conditional abandonment, a concept which will lead to great inconvenience to cargo owners. I am not aware of any authority giving effect to such a concept. If there is any doubt about the meaning of cl 5, it should be construed against the defendants. There is, I think, no inconsistency between the power to suspend or delay or alter the voyage and the power to tranship the cargo. This was not what the defendants purported to do. The voyage having come to an end at Porbander, there was nothing in cl 5 which gave the defendants the power to on-carry the goods to any other place. The situation is analogous to that in 
 Barker 
`s case. There, Jordan CJ found (and with whom Davidson J agreed) that the bill of lading did not authorize BP to back-carry the cargo to Sydney. Here, I find as a matter of construction that cl 5 did not permit the defendants to tranship the goods to Khorramshahr after the defendants had elected to abandon the voyage and discharged the goods at Porbander.
This finding also answers the submission of counsel for the defendants that because the plaintiffs had failed to communicate with the defendants prior to loading the goods on board the Kota Agung, the defendants were entitled to do so for the purpose of transhipment. The defendants had no such authority unless the plaintiffs had requested the transhipment. Silence was not express consent. In any case, the request was made long before the transhipment and could not be read as an implied agreement to tranship.
Counsel for the defendants has also submitted that the abandonment of the voyage did not amount to the abandonment of the goods. That is correct, but I do not see how that helps the defendants. The circumstance that the defendants were in de facto possession of the goods gave them no authority to tranship the goods except as an agent of necessity, and even then, they would have to notify the plaintiffs as it was possible to do so.
On the construction I have given to cl 5, the question of the defendants reserving their right to tranship also does not arise. I also find as a fact that, assuming that clause gave such a right, the defendants made no such reservation which was communicated to the plaintiffs. Counsel has referred to the telexes, viz BD45, BD53, BD54 and BD63 which, in his view, showed that the defendants merely invited the plaintiffs to make arrangements to on-carry the goods to Khorramshahr without relinquishing their right to do so. It is also suggested that BD53 was evidence of the fact that the defendants were requested to take delivery of the goods at Khorramshahr at some later stage after the abandonment. I do not accept this submission for two reasons. First, I do not agree with the meaning put on these telexes by counsel. In my view, they meant and were intended (and were reasonably understood by the plaintiffs) to mean that the voyage had been abandoned and that Porbander was the final port of discharge. BD53 was a confirmation that the plaintiffs had been told to take delivery of the goods where they would be discharged after abandonment (which was Porbander) and BD63 contained a clear direction to the defendants` agents in Khorramshahr to inform consignees/cargo owners that if they wanted to have the cargo shipped to Khorramshahr, they should ask the defendants` agents (at Porbander) to act on their behalf to effect the transhipment. BD70 is a telex dated 26 February 1979 from the plaintiffs` agents in Khorramshahr to JM asking for freight rates to Khorramshahr with a view to informing the consignees and obtaining their consent to arrange the transhipment. In my view, the evidence shows that the plaintiffs` intention in invoking cl 5 was to abandon the voyage (which they effected by discharging all the cargo at Porbander).
(ii) Did PW1 instruct DW1 not to load goods or to tranship?
Although I have found that the defendants had no power to tranship the goods after the voyage was abandoned, it is still desirable, in case my construction is successfully challenged on appeal, that I decide the issue as to whether or not PW1 did instruct DW1 not to remove the goods from the godown at Porbander or tranship the goods to Khorramshahr. There is no contemporaneous documentary evidence to prove PW1`s assertion and DW1`s denial of the matter. My finding on this is that on a balance of probabilities, PW1 did not expressly instruct DW1 concerning the removal of the goods from the warehouse at Porbander. Here are my reasons:
 
 
(a) the plaintiffs were informed on 3 February 1979 that the goods would not be discharged at Khorramshahr: on 8 February 1979, they sent the B/Ls and the relative bills of exchange to State Bank of India, London (SBI) for presentment to the consignees in Hamburg: SBI mailed the documents on 13 February 1979 to Deutsche Bank, Hamburg (DB): the notary`s protest was made on 8 March 1979 and so the B/Ls must have been rejected by the buyers on or about 7 March 1979; 
 
(b) when PW1 went to Bombay on or about 5 March 1979 he believed that the voyage had been abandoned by the defendants pursuant to cl 5 of the B/L and that he had to take delivery of the goods at Porbander: PW1 went to Porbander to arrange for shipment to the consignees as the latter had not yet defaulted; 
 
(c) for the said reasons, when PW1 inquired of DW1 of freight, bunker and congestion rates, it was in relation to Khorramshahr: this is consistent with the evidence of DW1 that the information given by him were applicable only to Gulf ports and not Karachi; 
 
(d) at the end of March 1979, PW1 went back to Bombay and spoke to DW1 again: by this time, PW1 would have known of the rejection of the B/Ls by the Iranian buyers: it was probably on this occasion that PW1 mentioned to DW1 that he wanted to dispose of the cargo in India, but PW1 did not in his testimony say it was on this occasion that he instructed DW1 not to remove the plaintiffs` cargo without prior notice or consent to the plaintiffs: PW1 then returned to London and for more than a month did not contact the defendants or JM: the probable reason is that pending their negotiations with the Iranian consignees to accept the goods, it was more convenient to leave them at Porbander: it was only on 10 May 1979 that the plaintiffs (having failed to contact the defendants) contacted JM to relay instructions to the defendants to instruct JM not to remove the cargo without their written consent: this telex would be entirely unnecessary if it were true that PW1 had already instructed DW1 not to do so or if DW1 had agreed not to do so; 
 
(e) about 22 May 1979 (BD123), Penningtons telexed the defendants and claimed that PW1 had records of points of discussion (which included PW1`s confirmation that the cargo was not to be removed); this claim was repeated in Pennington`s telex of 29 May 1979 to the plaintiffs which also claimed that the plaintiffs had a witness and that the matters discussed had been annotated; these claims were not made good when PW1 gave evidence as all he could produce was BD78 which contained his jottings of warehousing and freight rates etc.
  
 
 
 
 
 Issue 2: Conversion/Detinue 
 
 
 
I turn now to the claim in conversion. The plaintiffs rely on the first two of the three forms of conversion described in 45 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
(4th Ed) para 1422 as follows: 
 
Conversion exists in three forms. To constitute the first form of conversion there must be a positive wrongful act of dealing with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner`s rights, and an intention in doing so to deny the owner`s rights or to assert a right inconsistent with them. This inconsistency is the gist of the action. There need not be any knowledge on the part of the person sued that the goods belong to someone else, nor need there be any positive intention to challenge the true owner`s rights. The second form of conversion is committed where goods are wrongfully detained by the defendant. A wrongful detention gave rise to an action for detinue before detinue was abolished [by the Torts (Interference with Goods) Act 1977] and now gives rise to an action in conversion. The normal method of establishing a wrongful detention is to show that the plaintiff made a demand for the return of the goods and the defendant refused after a reasonable time to comply with that demand. In many cases, this form of conversion will coincide with the first ... The third form of conversion lies for loss or destruction of goods which a bailee has allowed to happen in breach of his duty to the bailor.
 
 
 
Counsel for the defendants accepts that the law in Singapore is the same as the law as stated in the above passage. I think the concession is wrong as detinue is still a common law tort in Singapore and has not been, unlike in England, abrogated by statute and converted into a form of statutory conversion. Therefore, in so far as the plaintiffs have claimed in conversion of the second type, they should properly have claimed in detinue. However, this error is not fatal as the statement of claim contains a sufficient averment under the claim in conversion which, if proved, founds a separate cause of action in detinue at common law. The defendant is also not prejudiced by the plaintiffs` omission to express his claim in detinue as counsel for the defendants is fully aware detinue has been pleaded not as detinue but as a form of statutory conversion. For these reasons, I do not see why I should be prevented from finding for the plaintiffs in detinue if the evidence before me is sufficient to prove detinue.
The plaintiffs` case is as follows: (1) that the defendants converted the goods when, despite the plaintiffs` strict orders to the contrary, they removed the goods from the warehouse and loaded it on board the Kota Agung and/or tranship the goods against the express wishes of the plaintiffs and (2) that the defendants converted (ie wrongfully detained) the goods when they refused, when demanded by the plaintiffs, to unload the goods from the Kota Agung. I have earlier found as a fact that PW1 had not at any time prior to 11 May 1979 expressly instructed DW1 not to remove the goods from the warehouse. Accordingly, I am unable to find that the defendants had done anything wrong in relation to the goods at the time of removal and up to the time when it was loaded on board the Kota Agung. The next point is whether the defendants had done anything wrong in refusing to unload the goods when demanded by the plaintiffs. Were the defendants under an obligation to unload the goods and if so, was the refusal of the defendants a breach of bailment, a conversion or a detinue?
The defendants deny any wrong in refusing to unload on three main grounds: (i) that by virtue of cl 5 of the bills of lading, the defendants were entitled to tranship the goods and having loaded the goods, they would proceed with the transhipment to Khorramshahr; (ii) they were prevented by Indian law and regulations to unload the goods into Porbander.
(i) Were defendants entitled to tranship against plaintiffs` wishes under cl 5?
I have already held that, as a matter of construction, cl 5 did not give the defendants a contractual right or power to tranship once they elected to abandon the voyage, which they had done on the evidence. This defence therefore fails. But assuming that cl 5 did give the defendants a contractual right or power to tranship after abandonment of a voyage, it is still necessary to consider whether this power was capable of being revoked by the defendants at any time before it was exercised. Although neither counsel addressed me on this point, I have no doubt in my own mind that in principle the right or power is revocable. After the abandonment of the voyage, the owners of the cargo are entitled to take delivery of the goods at the place where the goods are landed. An irrevocable power to tranship to the abandoned port of discharge is inconsistent with the rights of the owners. On the evidence, the defendants` right or power to tranship was terminated on 11 May 1979 when the Kota Agung was still loading the remainder of the goods. If the Kota Agung had arrived at Khorramshahr with the goods before the plaintiffs knew of it, a different situation would have arisen. On the facts, the issue must be decided against the defendants.
(ii) Were the defendants prevented from unloading by Indian laws, etc?
DW1 gave testimony on the state Indian law and regulations at Porbander. He was not an expert witness and he worked in Bombay and not at Porbander. He instructed agents to act for JM or the defendants. He said that the bond (D1) was valid for only two months from 16 February 1979 and so it was imperative that the cargo be shipped out lest the bond be forfeited. In my view, that is not correct as the bond period was co-extensive with the warehousing period, as otherwise the bond would already have been forfeited at the time of the reloading. Moreover, both periods were capable of being extended and DW1 agreed. On the evidence, I find that none of the acts leading to and including the transhipment of the goods was forced upon the defendants by any circumstance. They were `forced` to remove the goods from the bonded warehouse only in the sense if they failed to do so in accordance with the terms of the bond (D1), the bond would be forfeited. There is no evidence that this was an impending event. At the material time, there was no demand by the Indian authorities for the removal of the goods from Porbander. The transhipment was entirely voluntary. There was also no physical or other impediment in unloading the goods as they were not over-stowed. Loading was not completed until 17 May 1979, and indeed, the master`s testimony was that if had been instructed, he would have unloaded the goods. In my view, all the assertions of DW1 concerning the requirements of Indian law and regulations were never put to the test. When DW1 first received the request to unload, his reaction was not that the unloading was not permitted by laws and regulations but that the goods were already loaded and the ship was sailing the next day.
Even if the defendants were under immediate threat as regards their bond, any payment made thereunder was secured by their line on the goods. It was the plaintiffs who were at risk if they failed to take delivery of their goods at the appropriate time and when requested to do so. This defence also fails.
Was the unauthorized transhipment a form of conversion? Counsel for the plaintiffs has submitted that there was conversion on it because by transhipping the goods against the categorical instructions of the plaintiffs the defendants did a positive wrongful act in respect of the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owners` rights and an intention to assert a right inconsistent with them. The defence is that the gist of the action is an intention to deny the owners` rights and that the defendants did not at any time deny the plaintiffs` rights. In the present case, I do not think that there is any material difference between the ingredient of an intention to deny the owners` rights or to assert a right inconsistent with them. The plaintiffs, as owners, had the right to prohibit the transhipment of the goods which right they exercised. The defendants had no right to tranship the goods but they did. In doing so, the defendants intended to deny the plaintiffs` right (to prohibit transhipment) and also at the same time asserted a right (to tranship) inconsistent with the plaintiffs` right to prohibit it. Not only that, the evidence shows that the defendants in transhipping the goods intended to charge freight and to claim a lien on the goods for freight. This was clearly an intention to assert dominion over the goods until it is delivered to the plaintiffs: 
 Clerk & Lindsell on Torts 
 (16th Ed) para 22-13 citing a venerable judgment: `If a man takes my horse and rides it and the redelivers it to me nevertheless I may have an action against him, for this is conversion, and the redelivery is not bar to the action but shall be merely a mitigation of damages.` In my view, the transhipment was sufficient to constitute conversion of the first type.
What of detinue? Counsel for the plaintiffs says that there was detinue because the defendants refused to unload the goods. Counsel referred to 
 Howard E Perry & Co Ltd v British Railways Board 
 [1980] 2 All ER 579, where Megarry J held there was conversion of the second type when the defendants in that action refused to deliver to the owners a cargo of steel which was lying in their depot because they feared industrial action by a third party. Megarry J held that an uncertain period of detention, whether long or short, amounted to conversion. I do not think that this decision helps the plaintiffs as the defendants did not actually refuse to deliver the goods to the plaintiffs. On the evidence, the plaintiffs had made no demand for delivery of the goods to them, but merely for discharge back into the warehouse into the custody of the defendants. The position here was that the defendants insisted on retaining possession of the goods on board the Kota Agung without the consent of the plaintiffs rather than in the warehouse with the plaintiffs` consent. I do not think that there was any detinue in these circumstances. Indeed, but for the fire at Khorramshahr, the goods might have been carried back to Bangkok, as arranged, and the question of detinue would never have arisen. There is, to my mind, no distinction in principle between the two situations.
On the evidence, it is clear that the defendants had no right to retain possession of the goods on board the Kota Agung. Their wrongful possession constituted trespass to the goods. The goods were lost whilst they were still in unlawful possession. I think the defendant`s position was, by analogy to a bailee`s position in 
 Mitchell v Ealing London Borough Council 
 
[1979] QB 1
 , 
 that of insurers and in the events that happened, the defendants were liable for the loss of the goods, whether or not they were negligent.
 Issue 3: Breach of duty and/or negligence in transhipment 
The plaintiffs have also claimed against the defendants as bailees who were negligent or in breach of duty in the performance of the transhipment of the goods, whereby the same was totally lost by fire on board the Kota Agung. The law is well established. The onus is on the defendants to establish that the goods were lost without their negligence: see 
 Port Swettenham Authority 
 
 v 
 
 Wu (TW) & Co Sdn Bhd 
[1979] AC 580
. In 
 Philips & Co (Smithfield) Ltd 
 
 v 
 
 Clan Line Steamers Ltd 
(1943) 76 Lloyd`s LR 58, where a cargo was shipped in good order and condition but was delivered damaged, Atkinson J said: 
 
It is not necessary for the defendants to establish exactly why and how the damage occurred, provided that they can disprove negligence; but of course, it is not easy to do that unless they can establish some reasonably possible alternative explanation. If the damage is entirely unexplained, it is difficult to see how the onus can be discharged.
 
 
 
In the present case, there is no mystery as to the cause of the damage. It was the fire. The issue is therefore whether the fire occurred as a result of the negligence or breach of duty of the defendants or their servants. I think that as the fire started on board the Kota Agung which was in the possession and control of the defendants, the onus is on them to prove that the fire occurred without their negligence. The evidence showed that the ship began discharging its cargo at Khorramshahr at 1615 hours on 17 June 1979. Discharge took place in two shifts for 0700 hrs to 1200 hrs and from 1500 hrs to 1900 hrs. On 9 July 1979, the workers ceased work at 1200 hrs and went ashore for lunch. According to the master`s protest, at 1330 hrs, a member of the crew, Bandary, saw a fire had broken out in hatch no 3, lower hold. Help was summoned. They tried to close the hatch but there was no power. Fire trucks and fire fighting floats came soon after but they could not put out the fire which also started in no 2 hatch. The master could not give any explanation for the fire. He said that `No Smoking` signs were displayed at the hatches and the chief officer had inspected the hatch shortly after 1200 and noted nothing amiss.
A survey was done by one NA Leonard (PW2) of Johnson`s Sons & Mowat, marine surveyors, for and on behalf of The Salvage Association on or about 18 July 1979. His evidence was as follows: 
 
According to stowage plan, BD 118, Kenaf stand up to steel coamings: which were exposed. It was very hot. I could feel heat on soles of feet. I placed thermo on block of wood: 60[deg ]C: atmosphere temperature 45[deg ]C. I discussed cause of fire with master: BD 176. He agreed. Exposed to severe sunlight from 10am to about 3-4pm. Steel coamings would be very hot if exposed to sun. Kenaf in dry condition: inflammable: my view, the steel coamings set fire to a few bales and spread. Hottest time in Khorramshahr was about 11-12 noon. Mid-day break in Khorramshahr between 1200-1500 hours. Fire took place at 1330 hours. It would have been prudent to close hatch. There was also general cargo. Should be a regular practice especially for longer period like three hours. ... Kenaf is their name for jute.
 
 
 
Matting: use of paper usually: dunnage is using planks: reason for matting and dunnage is to protect from shipside sweat: dunnage would protect kenaf from side of ship.
 
 
 
BD 118 - Empty space next to hold 3 is engine room. That part of bulkhead would heat up but not to dangerous level.
 
 
 
For kenaf to have caught fire, must have been touching steel coamings.
 
 
 
Can`t say when cargo was separated from bulkhead next to engine room.
 
 
 
Likely cause of fire: extreme heat heating metal which was touching cargo.
 
 
 
There were suggestions of sabotage: Investigated this. Discounted: other causes: cigarettes discarded in open hatch: seats of fire. No possibility of spontaneous combustion.
 
 
 
The evidence of the master was that he had taken every precaution against the occurrence of fire. His evidence was as follows (pp 57-57 N/E): 
 
I took into account possibility of fire: so I took extra precautions: exhibited no smoking signs: instructed ship`s officers and stevedores; fire hoses were connected to fire mains along the hatches where kenaf stowed: fire extinguishers put out on the ready near the gangway. I arranged for a fire watch to be kept while loading: one watchman in each hold. Officers went round deck to ensure no smoking: also officer on duty at all times.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
On the way to Muscat, I held a comprehensive fire drill and gave crew talking too. Arrived in Muscat on 20 May 1979 and began to load cargo. On opening hatches, chief officer drew my attention to heat emanating from kenaf in all the holds. After hatches opened, heat disappeared after a short while. Heat problem but not excessive. Weather was hot. At Muscat until 10 June 1979 when we sailed for Khorramshahr. We had a fire drill on way to Khorramshahr.
 
 
 
We were aware of state of civil unrest in Khorramshahr. Trying time: we could hear firearms being discharged and buildings on fire in Khorramshahr as we approached: we also heard fighting on otherside of riverway.
 
 
 
... I took particular care: summoned officers and agent to my cabin and discussed situation with agent with regard to civil disturbance and possible damages to vessel: concerned with unspecified type of attack on vessel: instructed officers to be alert: everything on the ready, including fire fighting equipment: told agent to instruct his overseer as to danger from fire and large notice was exhibited in gangway in Farsi to this effect.
 
 
 
Fire equipment connected: there was water on deck: fire extinguishers ready: agent provided one watchman for each hold: also gangway watchman: chief officer organized crew into watches: at all times, crew patrolling deck: also traditional duty officer: general watch but specifically instructed to look for fire.
 
 
 
Loading between 7am to 12 noon: lunch: resume 3pm until 7pm: there was disturbance in the port area at all times. It was very hot and dry at noontime: there was also wind from desert.
 
 
 
At lunchtime, hatches were left open: reasons: (1) at all times, we were concerned about heat from cargo: need for ventilation: there was complaint of pilferage but we considered heat problem more serious: (2) if hatches closed, it would have been unworkable inside.
 
 
 
I did not consider the sun`s ray as a potential danger to the cargo. During lunch break, a fire watch was kept, one at each hatch: my own officers watching around and watchman at gangway.
 
 
 
The master also denied that the goods had been stowed in such a way as to touch the underside of the steel coaming or the centre steel post in hatch no 3. He said that the centre bulkhead and post was wrapped with matting and that the topside of the goods did not touch the deck or other steel structure, and therefore the fire could not have been caused by the heating up of the steel structures as postulated by PW2. He also said that the goods were not self-combustible nor were they contaminated with inflammable contaminants. If the master`s evidence is accepted, then the fire should not have started at all and yet it occurred. PW3, an expert mariner, said that the goods was classified as highly combustible. The evidence shows that the goods were in a very dry condition (part of it having caught fire twice at Porbander, the first after unloading and the second time just before reloading, and the same having stored for more than three months) and would easily ignite. However, on the evidence, I am unable to determine the cause of the fire. But, I am able to find that the opening of the hatches during the lunch break for three hours substantially increased the risks of fire occurring to the goods. The master was fully aware of the prevailing political and labour conditions and that the ship could be attacked or subjected to accidental damage. When asked if the civil commotion did not bother him, his reply was that if attacked, he would have time to close the hatches. In fact, when the fire started, he did not have time to close the hatches. He gave a number of reasons for leaving the hatches open. The first is that ventilation was necessary. I find this reason difficult to accept as the hatches were opened each day from 0700hrs for unloading, and therefore the holds would have ventilation for at least five hours before the lunch break at 1200 hrs. The second reason is that if the hatches were closed it would have been unworkable inside. Again I have difficulty in accepting this reason as, on the ma ster`s evidence, it would have taken about half an hour for the heat to dissipate if the hatches had been closed. A third reason was that the wharf labourers were sensitive to the working conditions. I also find this reason difficult to accept, as there is no reason to believe that the workers were not used to working in such conditions. In my view, the master was wrong in being more concerned with the ventilation than with the civil commotion occurring daily at the port area. I agree with PW3`s evidence that as a general operation rule of prudence, when cargo is not needed, the hatches should be closed. All the more so in the circumstances of this case. The master, in my view, increased the risk of damage to the cargo by not closing the hatches during the long lunch break when it was most unlikely that there would have been any crew around to keep watch on the ship at all the open hatches, and that the master was negligent in not closing the hatches when doing so would have prevented any accidental ignition of the goods. In my view, since the fire was not caused by self-combustion of the goods or the heat of the sun either on the goods or on the ship, it could only have been caused by an external source deliberately or accidentally. This source of fire was within the contemplation of the master and he contemplated it. Accordingly, I find that he was negligent or in breach of duty in not closing the hatches during the lunch break or in leaving it open for such a long period of time. In any case, the defendants have failed to discharge the onus of proving the probable cause of the fire. I view with scepticism his evidence that there was a watchman for every hold. In fact, there was no one at hatch no 3 when the fire was first seen by Bandary, the gangway watchman and by the time he summoned the crew at hatch no 4, it was too late to stop the fire by any means. Even if I am wrong in finding the master negligent, I am of the view that the defendants in failing to prove the probable cause of the fire has not discharged the onus of proving that their servants were not negligent in allowing the fire to occur in the circumstances it did.
I consider next the defendants` position as bailees of the goods on board the Kota Agung without the consent of the plaintiffs. The defendants` duty was to keep the goods in the warehouse at Porbander until the plaintiffs took possession of it. In insisting on keeping the goods on board the ship and delivering the goods to the plaintiffs at Khorramshahr, the defendants did so at their own risk. The defendants became insurers of the goods: see 2 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 1519.
 Merchant Shipping Act 1988 s 271 
The defence also relies on s 271 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1988 (the Act) which provides as follows: 
 
The owner of a British ship shall not be liable to make good to any extent whatever any loss or damage happening without his actual fault or privity in the following case:
 
 
 
(a) where any goods, merchandise or other thing whatsoever taken in or put on board his ship are lost or damaged by reason of fire on board the ship.
 
 
 
(Under s 3 of the Merchant Shipping Act British ship is construed as Singapore ship.)
 
 
 
The defence is that even if the master were negligent the defendants would not be liable if the loss occurred without their actual fault or privity, the onus of proving which is on the defendants. Counsel refers to the following authorities: 
 The `Lady Gwendolen`

[1915] AC 705
 and 
 Tempus Shipping Co Ltd 
 
 v 
 
 Louis Dreyfus & Co Ltd 
[1930] 1 KB 699
. Counsel contends that on the evidence the Kota Agung was a seaworthy vessel and that it was under the control and management of a qualified and experienced master and that it was not their responsibility to give specific instructions to him in the handling of the ship and the cargo. He refers also to 
 Virginia Carolina Chemical Co

 The Rostellan 
(1929) 35 Lloyd`s LR 117 at p 126 and 
 Beauchamp 
 
 v 
 
 Turrell 
 
[1952] 2 QB 207
 at p 215.
The plaintiffs` case is that: (i) there was no evidence that the vessel was not seaworthy as DW3 who testified to such effect was only the traffic manager at the material time and that he was not familiar with the operational aspects of the vessel; (ii) the defendants have not been able to give a satisfactory explanation for the cause of the fire.
As to (i), I find that the plaintiffs have not proved that the ship was unseaworthy. As to (ii), the fact that a fire occurred does not prove that the ship was unseaworthy. It cannot be disputed that the Kota Agung was fully classified in all respects at the material time. I do not think that the decision of 
 Pendle & Rivett Ltd v Ellerman Lines Ltd 
 (1929) 27 Lloyd`s LR 133 relied upon by counsel for the plaintiffs is relevant to the point. In that case, MacKinnon J held that by reason of the wholly inexplicable conflict of evidence on both sides, the shipowners had not discharged the onus of proving that the short delivery was not due to their actual fault or privity under art 4 r 2 of the Carriage of Goods by Sea Act 1924. I agree with counsel for the defendants that 
 Pendle 
`s case has no relevance to the present case on the ground that the exemption clause in the Hague Rules operate in a different way from s 271 of the Act. The latter exemption is based on public policy (see the Preamble to 26 George III C 806 (1786) on which the Singapore Act is based). The policy was to exempt shipowners from liability for any loss or damage to goods as a result of any fire happening to or on board the vessel. The exception to this exemption was the actual fault or privity of the shipowner. Under the Hague Rules, the shipowner was vicariously liable for the negligence or wrongful acts of its servants, but not under s 271. It must follow that the defendants` inability to explain the cause of the fire does not mean they have not discharged the onus of proof that the loss occurred without their actual fault or privity. On the evidence I am satisfied that they have discharged it for the purpose of s 271 of the Act.
This finding merely means that if s 271 of the Act were applicable, it would have provided a defence to the defendants in respect of the negligence of the master. But I am of the view that s 271 has no application in the present case where the cargo is carried on board a ship without the consent of the owners of the goods. Although, in the present case, the goods was, initially, taken or put on board lawfully in the sense that it was not a trespass to the goods, it became a trespass once the plaintiffs objected and required that it be unloaded. I have found that there was conversion of the goods when the transhipment was effected and also breach of bailment when the defendants insisted to keep the goods on board the ship. Although the transhipment to Khorramshahr was not the causa causans of the loss, it was a sine qua non of the loss. Bearing that in mind, I do not think the legislature could have intended (it being contrary to good sense and justice) s 271 to protect a shipowner in a case where he wrongfully takes in or puts on board his vessel goods which is subsequently destroyed by fire on board the ship. I hold that s 271 has no application except where the goods are lawfully taken in or put on board a Singapore ship.
For the above reasons, the plaintiffs succeed in their claim and there will be judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of US$339,822 with interest thereon at 8%pa and costs.

On 30 July 1990, on his pleas of guilty, I sentenced the accused, Chot Saik Kam, to ten years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane on an amended first charge and three years` imprisonment on an amended second charge. I ordered the terms of imprisonment to run consecutively from the date of arrest, ie 24 January 1988. The accused now appeals against the sentences. The accused was represented by counsel.
The amended first charge reads: 
 
You, Chot Saik Kam, are charged that on or about 24 January 1988 at about 9.20pm at Blk 341 Jurong East Ave 1 #04-1508, Singapore, committed culpable homicide not amounting to murder by causing the death of one Poon Yit Fong, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The amended second charge reads: 
 
You, Chot Saik Kam, are charged that on or about 24 January 1988, at about 9.20pm at Blk 341 Jurong East Ave 1 #04-1508, Singapore, did an act, namely, by using a knife to repeatedly stab one Cheong Siew Foong, with such intention and under such circumstances that if by that act you had caused the death of the said Cheong Siew Foong, you would have been guilty of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 308 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
 
 
 Facts 
 
 
 
The deceased (Poon) was 30 years old, a female Malaysian. She was a waitress. The victim (Cheong), aged 23, was also a waitress and a female Malaysian. They were room-mates and worked at the same restaurant.
The accused is a male Malaysian, aged 27. He worked as a machine operator. He rented one of the rooms in the flat where Poon and Cheong were staying.
Poon and Cheong were watching a Chinese video film in their room. Cheong overheard the sound of the main door of the flat being opened. The television set in the hall was switched on and the volume was very loud. Poon was irritated by the loudness and went to the hall. If it was the accused who had come home, she had a message to pass him to call a Francis Tan, the employer at the restaurant she worked.
Cheong could not hear what was spoken in the hall between Poon and the accused even though the door of the room was not closed. Poon came back to the room and asked Cheong to write down the telephone number of their restaurant. With that, Poon left the room.
Poon came back to continue watching the video film. She complained to Cheong that the accused did not heed her advice to reduce the volume of the television set.
Later, the accused shouted for Poon. She answered. The door was flung open and the accused, clad in his underwear, holding a knife in his right hand was there. Poon and Cheong became hysterical and screamed. The accused attacked Poon and Cheong in turn with the knife.
Poon ran out of the room when Cheong was attacked. The accused then stopped and also ran out of the room. When Cheong followed, the accused was in the hall. When he went for her again, Cheong returned to the room and locked herself up. She nursed her wounds while in the room.
Cheong shouted for help. She then heard the main door being slammed. After some time, she decided to open the door of the room to seek help. When she came out, she saw Poon lying in a pool of blood. She slipped and fell. Lying near Poon`s head, she saw a long knife which was one of the two knives kept in the kitchen of the flat. She managed to leave the flat and approached a neighbour who called the police.
Cheong sustained three stabs wounds on her shoulder, chest and back. Her skull was fractured. She also had superficial incisions on her index finger, forearm and thumb. There was a 6cm incision on her right armpit. This wound required surgery lasting nearly five hours. She still had `persistent right wrist drop, positive pointing finger sign and hand anaesthesia; requiring long-term management`.
Poon suffered multiple injuries on her body. She died from massive haemorrhage due to an incised wound of the neck.
According to a government psychiatrist, the accused was suffering from depression at the time of the offences. This condition did not amount to unsoundness of mind. It was an abnormality of mind which had substantially impaired his mental responsibilities for his acts and omissions in causing the death of Poon.
The accused was found fit to stand trial and to plead to the charges. He pleaded guilty to both amended charges. He admitted the facts as stated by the learned deputy public prosecutor. He understood the nature and consequences of his pleas of guilty. I accordingly convicted him of the charges he faced. The accused had no previous conviction.
 Mitigation 
A Malaysian, the accused came to Singapore on a work permit. On the day of his offences, the accused visited an amusement park where he consumed some beer. He went back to the flat where Poon and Cheong also stayed.
Counsel for the accused related the circumstances leading to the commission of the offences, in particular Poon`s remark `if you had no money, why rent the room` provoked him. He was arrested while seated on the parapet wall with his feet dangling outside. This was on the 12th floor of the block of flats where he stayed.
He experienced a traumatic childhood. His father was harsh, irresponsible, often drunk and used to assault members of the family.
The accused was of good character. He married shortly before coming to Singapore and had hopes of working in Australia.
His feelings were sorrow and deep regret for the victims and their families. Counsel urged me to order concurrent sentences of imprisonment for the two convictions.
 Sentences 
In deciding on sentences, I took all the relevant factors into consideration. Among these was the medical report of the psychiatrist on the accused, including the depression he was suffering at the time of the offences. As against this, the two persons on whom he inflicted injuries were two unarmed and helpless women alone in a flat, undoubtedly surprised by his approach with a kitchen knife and with no capacity for retaliation, let alone self-defence.
His counsel described Poon`s remark as having provoked the accused. He certainly could not have used the word `provoke` in the sense the cognate word is used in `grave and sudden provocation`. In any event, no matter what the extent of the irritation caused by the remark was, no one can say that the remark was sufficient to make the accused inflict the injuries he did. Their full nature will appear hereafter.
As far as the amended first charge is concerned, by his plea of guilt in relation to Poon, the accused admitted what he did was done `with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death` (s 304(a)). Apart from his plea, this is clear when one examines the injuries suffered by Poon. They were:
 
 
(a) Small bruise measuring 2.5 x 0.4cm at the left side of the jaw. 
 
(b) Deep incised wound measuring 7.5cm at the left side of the upper neck region. It cut the left internal jugular vein. 
 
(c) Deep incised wound measuring 9cm extending obliquely downwards from the left side of the upper neck anteriorly across the middle of the neck to the right side of the lower region. The incised wound was deeper laterally on the left side of the neck where it had incised into the left common carotid artery, bisected the left vagus nerve and penetrated posterior to the left trapezius muscle, which had been incised into at its medial border. 
 
(d) Small bruise 2.5cm in diameter at the right upper anterior chest wall region just above the right breast. 
 
(e) Deep incised wound measuring 13.5cm at the right lower anterior chest wall region and right upper abdominal wall region. This wound had incised into the right 6th intercostal muscle and part of the right seventh rib and had also incised into the surface of the right seventh and eighth costal cartilages. 
 
(f) One stab wound just below the left breast at the region of the abdomen. This stab wound penetrated through the body and created an exit stab wound at the right side of the body. This wound penetrated the liver. The depth of the track from the entry to the exit stab wounds was about 19 to 21cm. 
 
(g) Second stab wound at the left lateral chest wall region. It went through the stomach and terminated in the right anterior abdominal wall. The depth of the wound was about 18 to 20cm. 
 
(h) Third stab wound at the posterior aspect of the left forearm. 
 
(i) One defensive incised wound at the left index finger. 
 
(j) A small bruise on the left breast.
  
 
 
The brutality of the killing is further shown in an examination of the photographs tendered at the preliminary inquiry.
There is also evidence that the accused had time to think before he opened the door of the room in which Poon and Cheong were and it was this thinking that led him to get a knife from the kitchen of the flat.
Having regard to all these factors, my initial inclination was to sentence him to life imprisonment but in view of the state of depression that he was described as suffering from, I decided that ten years was an appropriate sentence. Having regard to the violence involved, I was also of the view that an additional six strokes of the cane was warranted on the amended first charge.
As far as Cheong was concerned, the injuries were:
 
 
(a) Fractured skull with an overlying V-shaped 11cm scalp laceration. 
 
(b) Three stab wounds deepening down to the muscles: (i) 9cm on the right shoulder region; (ii) 10cm right front of the chest; and (iii) 4cm left upper back region. 
 
(c) Superficial incision on the following areas: (i) 1cm at the tip of the right index finger; (ii) 3cm left forearm; and (iii) 1cm left thumb. 
 
(d) 6cm right armpit incision involving the triceps, radial nerve and bleeding profusely from the surrounding small vessels. The surgery to repair the various injuries lasted four hours and 55 minutes. Due to the right auxiliary incision, she still had persistent wrist drop, positive pointing finger sign and hand anaesthesia; requiring long-term management.
  
 
 
Section 308 of the Penal Code creates an offence which, where the victim had died, the offence would have been one under s 304. Each of paras (a) and (b) of s 304, refers to different and distinct states of an accused`s mind. Notwithstanding the nature of the injuries, I gave the accused the benefit of treating him as having no intention to cause death or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death as in para (a) of s 304. This is what led me to sentence him to three years` imprisonment on the amended second charge although the maximum provided under s 308 is seven years or a fine or with both. It should be noted that under s 308 if no injury is caused, the maximum imprisonment is three years.
Having regard to the nature of the injuries suffered by Cheong, I was of the view that three years was the appropriate sentence.
The next question I had to consider was whether the sentences should be concurrent or consecutive. The principles applicable in this context were the subject of consideration by Rajah J and me in the case of 
 PP v Teo Heng Chye 
 
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 205
  from p 209 (left D) to the end of the judgment. We were of the view that in the light of the two illustrations to s 71 of the Penal Code, where there was more than one victim of offences that constituted part of the same transaction, the accused was liable to one punishment in respect of one victim and 
 another 
 punishment in respect of the other victim. `Another` in this context can only mean `separate and distinct`. In our view, the use of the word `another` in the second illustration to s 71 clearly implied a consecutive sentence. The use of illustrations in legislation was fully considered by us in 
 Teo Heng Chye 
`s case.
The ultimate guiding principle for sentences in two or more offences is the totality of the sentences. (This principle and the relevant authorities are covered in 
 Teo Heng Chye 
 `s case.) I therefore asked myself whether in the light of all the facts of the case before me, the totality of 13 years` imprisonment was `too much or not`.
Having regard to what I have already said, particularly on the nature of the injuries inflicted by the accused on the two helpless women alone in the flat and with no capacity for self-defence against a male flatmate armed with a knife, I came to the firm view that 13 years in total was appropriate to the facts before me and not too much. In coming to this conclusion, I took all factors into consideration, including the medical report of the psychiatrist and Poon`s remark which may have angered him but was certainly not in the sense of provocation as a defence.
I cannot ignore the fact that it was a very brutal killing as can be seen from the photographs tendered at the preliminary inquiry and from the medical reports on the numerous injuries received by each, Poon and Cheong. I ordered the sentences to run consecutively.
 Order accordingly

This is a petition for revision of a plea of guilty by the petitioner to two charges of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) involving the procurement of false work permits for certain Bangladeshi workers. The petitioner was represented by counsel when he decided to plead guilty to the said charges.
The undisputed facts are as follows: the petitioner was charged on five counts of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The trial commenced on 11 April 1989 and was adjourned in the afternoon of 12 April 1989. On adjournment, five prosecution witnesses had given evidence and been cross-examined by defence counsel. The trial resumed on 23 August 1989 and by 24 August 1989 afternoon, three more prosecution witnesses had given evidence and been cross-examined by defence counsel. The petitioner was ill on 25 August 1989 and the case was subsequently adjourned to 13-15 December 1989 for further hearing. On 13 December 1989, the prosecutor informed the court that the petitioner had agreed to take a certain course of action if only two charges were proceeded with, two other charges to be taken into consideration and the fifth charge withdrawn. The two charges were then read and explained to the petitioner. The notes of evidence of the district judge has the following entries: `P1A and P2A. Charge read explained and understood. Pleads guilty to both charges. Understands the nature and consequences of such a plea. Facts to be tendered tomorrow.`
On 14 December 1989, the statement of facts was read out to the petitioner who admitted the facts stated therein. He also consented to the third and fourth charges being taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing and also admitted the said charges. Counsel for the petitioner then made a speech in mitigation. The district judge imposed concurrent sentences of five months` imprisonment on each charge. He was acquitted and discharged on the fifth charge. The petitioner was taken aback by the sentence, and as the judge was leaving the courtroom said that he would appeal. Defence counsel filed the notice of appeal against sentence only on the same day and the petitioner was released on bail pending appeal. The petition of appeal was filed on 12 January 1990. It set out two grounds of appeal: (a) that the trial judge had not sufficiently taken into consideration the mitigating factors, and (b) that the sentence was manifestly excessive and inappropriate in the circumstances of the case. On 7 July 1990, the petitioner, through his new solicitors, filed his petition for revision of the plea of guilty.
The grounds in support of this petition are set out in the following paragraphs of the petition:
 
 
(5) Before the learned district judge passed sentence on your petitioner, he was put under pressure by his abovementioned counsel to plead guilty to the charges. Your petitioner was told by his counsel words to the effect that `No other way. The facts and evidence are against you - you cannot win against this case.` His counsel advised your petitioner that if your petitioner did plead guilty and make restitution of $4,000 to the workers, the five charges would be reduced to two charges and the court would impose a fine, this being the only way out for your petitioner. 
 
(6) Your petitioner thought that this arrangement has been agreed upon by counsel with the police and the court and, on this understanding, your petitioner thought that there was no other alternative and decided to plead guilty to the first and second charges. 
 
(7) As advised by his counsel, your petitioner handed over $4,000 in cash to his counsel who in turn handed the same to a Detective Liau Hong Chang who was present in court on the morning of 14 December 1989. 
 
(8) When the court resumed, your petitioner`s counsel informed the learned district judge that your petitioner had decided to take a certain course and a plea of guilty was taken on the first and second charges under s 420 Penal Code. 
 
(9) When the statement of facts was read to your petitioner through an interpreter, your petitioner admitted the facts stated therein, because he thought that the issue in respect of his sentence had been arranged between his counsel and the prosecutor and the court, as advised by his counsel. 
 
(10) Your petitioner realised the error only when the learned district judge imposed concurrent sentences of five months` imprisonment on each of the charges he pleaded guilty to ... Your petitioner exclaimed that he wanted to `Appeal` in court. Your petitioner then saw his counsel leaving the courtroom. Your petitioner`s counsel later returned and arranged bail for your petitioner. 
 
(11) When your petitioner managed to see his counsel a few days later, your petitioner asked his counsel why he was wrongly convicted for something which he did not do. His counsel then replied `You did not give me bullet - how can I fight the battle?`. 
 
(12) During the course of investigations, the Criminal Investigation Department interviewed one Badal who is a Singapore agent named by your petitioner and the witnesses PW2, Moqbul Moral, and PW3, Mohd Abdul Gafur, in their respective testimonies. The said Badal is a material witness as he attended to the recruitment and the meeting with the five Bangladeshi workers. 
 
Your petitioner could not trace the whereabouts of the said Badal. However, your petitioner ascertained from Detective Liau Hong Chang that the Criminal Investigation Department had interviewed the said Badal but refused to call Badal as a witness, thereby depriving your petitioner or his counsel the opportunity to cross-examine him and to provide the court with the material evidence and facts in respect of the charges. 
 
(13) Your petitioner`s then counsel also failed to appreciate the importance of demanding a statement from and the attendance of the said Badal at court, thus placing your petitioner in a difficult position. 
 
(14) Your petitioner is of the humble view that had the said Badal been called as a witness there would have been no offences of cheating disclosed. 
 
(15) Your petitioner`s then counsel, on instructions to appeal, filed the notice of appeal against sentence on 14 December 1989, the hearing of which was listed for 9 April 1990 and which has been further adjourned to the 12 July 1990. 
 
(16) However, your petitioner is of the humble view and prays that this honourable court, under the above circumstances, exercise its revisionary powers and order that the conviction be quashed and the sentence imposed on your petitioner be set aside or such order as may seem just. Your petitioner has involuntarily pleaded guilty as ill-advised by his then counsel and verily believes that he did not have a fair trial.
  
 
 
The applicant gave evidence on how he had been misled into pleading guilty. In his evidence-in-chief, he said: 
 
On that day I was in courtroom with my lawyer. Before the court sat, he walked out of court and then came back. He then told me he had a discussion with people outside, government officials, and told me to plead guilty and compensate $4,000 to Bangladeshi workers, $1,000 per worker. He told me I was facing four charges but government officials were prepared to reduce charges to two. I asked him how I could plead guilty. I told him that if I had wanted to I would have done so much earlier. He said there was no alternative as there was sufficient evidence against me.
 
 
 
I then asked him what the consequences would be. He said there would be a fine and mandatory sentence of one day. I was thinking that to avoid the trouble of having to come to court so many times that if I pleaded guilty I could go back to my job.
I thought it had all been arranged by government officials. I thought by paying a fine, the matter would rest there and so I agreed to plead guilty. After that I saw government officials and Edwin Chan very busy at work. My case was only case fixed for hearing. I saw them walking out of court. I saw them going into a room from which the judge would come. Court had not sat yet. I thought that they were attending to my matter. I was under the impression that they were going to see the judge and that they had spoken to the judge and all had agreed to it. When they came out, the case was adjourned to 14 December 1989. I cannot recollect whether judge came out.
On 14 December 1989, I was in courtroom. Before hearing, Edwin Chan asked me whether I had $4,000 ready. I gave money to him. I saw him giving money to I/O. They were talking. Then they walked out of courtroom. I waited. Edwin Chan returned. A short while later the court sat. The interpreter read out charges to me and asked me for plea. I told him I was pleading guilty. Two charges read out to me. I sensed something was wrong. I thought all was agreed. I thought it was a mistake. I was stunned. The police wanted to handcuff me. I then said I wanted to appeal to the people present ...
When I pleaded guilty, I was under impression I would be fined. I did not commit offences. He did not advise me not to plead guilty if I was not guilty.
The petitioner was cross-examined by the DPP. I reproduce below part of the cross-examination:
 
 
Q When [Edwin Chan] told you that [two charges to be proceeded with], did he say anything else? 
 
A He said judge would impose a fine and could also jail me for a day. 
 
Q Edwin Chan suggested either one? 
 
A Fine or fine plus one day. 
 
Q What Edwin Chan said cannot be true: s 420 provides for mandatory custodial sentence. 
 
A I didn`t know the law or that imprisonment mandatory. I thought everything agreed. 
 
Q Impression: how did you get that impression? 
 
A I was charged with five charges: later four charges and then reduced to two charges. So I thought they must have agreed. 
 
Q How were these [events] linked to fine? 
 
A Counsel told me I would be fined. 
 
... 
 
Q (By court) Did Edwin Chan tell you specifically all had agreed? 
 
A He did not. 
 
Q But he did not tell you it was a fine and one day. 
 
A He did. 
 
Q But you got impression that judge had agreed because they went into the room! 
 
Q (By court) Did you see them going into judge`s chambers? 
 
A No, only the room leading to judge`s chambers. 
 
Q Did you see judge coming out and talking to them? 
 
A No.
  
 
 
The petitioner also alleged that the nature and consequences of the plea of guilty had not been explained to him, as otherwise he would not have pleaded guilty to the charges.
Edwin Chan testified as follows: 
 
Accused is my friend`s brother. When introduced to me, I took case seriously. I did case gratis. Recorded his statement and then applied for papers. After getting papers, I met him to discuss matter. I made note that all along he maintained his innocence. I never told him we would win case.
 
 
 
After trial had gone on half-way, I was of opinion that evidence against him was very strong and after each day`s hearing, he would go back to my office and we would discuss the evidence. At all times, he was afraid of going to jail. Asked me to do my best for him: family and business commitments, business dealing with marine fish, got contract to supply NUS fish for experiments.
I realized conviction likely. I told him we might not win case. That was on 13th morning. That`s why we went to judge`s chambers to have case stood down to approach prosecutor for plea bargain. I was aware courts generally sympathetic to accused who pleaded guilty and who made restitution.
I advised him the only possibility of fine and one day is to plead guilty and restitute. He told me to do my best. Then I went to see DPP and it was reduced to two charges. We then went to judge`s chambers for adjournment for him to get ready. I told him possibility of fine. I never told him it would be a fine.
Edwin Chan was cross-examined by counsel for the petitioner. He maintained that he did not advise the petitioner that the judge would only impose a fine and a day`s imprisonment but only that there was a possibility that the judge might impose a fine and a day`s imprisonment and that the sentence was for the judge to decide. To a question from the court as to whether he had said anything that might have given the impression that the sentence would be a fine or a fine and a day`s imprisonment, Edwin Chan`s reply was that he had not. He also said that he was unaware that the petitioner had the impression he had alleged in this petition.
The testimony of the petitioner directly contradicts that of Edwin Chan on what was actually said by Edwin Chan in relation to the sentence. It is a contradiction which a court is normally obliged to resolve in any trial unless it makes no difference to the legal result. It is therefore convenient for me to determine the principle of law on which a plea of guilty may be set aside.
Counsel for the petitioner has relied strongly on the decision of 
 R v Turner 
[1970] 2 QB 321
 . 
In that case, the appellant had pleaded not guilty at his trial on a charge of theft of his own motor car which he had left in a garage for repairs. The garage owners gave evidence that they considered the unilateral repossession a civil case. During an adjournment, he was advised by his counsel that if he pleaded guilty he would receive a non-custodial sentence. This was followed by a long discussion in court between the appellant, his sister and his girlfriend, the solicitor and counsel. Then counsel said he wanted to discuss the matter with the judge who was hearing the case. Counsel came back and gave his opinion of the case in the following words: 
 
There is a very real possibility that if you are convicted by the jury and an attack has been made on the police officers, with your 16 previous convictions, you may receive a sentence of imprisonment. If at this stage you plead guilty, you must take my word for it, you will receive a fine or some other sentence which will not involve imprisonment.
 
 
 
Eventually, after repeated statements were made to him that the choice was his, the appellant pleaded guilty. He was fined Â£50 and in default four months` imprisonment, and his licence was endorsed. He appealed against the conviction on the following amended ground: 
 
The appellant`s mind did not go with his plea of guilty in that he at no time intended or wished to admit the offence charged, yet was induced to plead guilty on being advised by his counsel that having consulted with the learned trial judge in the matter of sentence, the appellant would definitely be sent to prison were he to proceed with his trial and be convicted, whereas by pleading guilty he would receive a small fine. In all the circumstances the appellant was deprived of a free choice of pleading guilty or not guilty and was deprived of his opportunity to put his defence before the jury.
 
 
 
The Court of Appeal found that the appeal in so far as the appeal rested on undue influence must fail, as he had been told repeatedly that the choice was his. However, the court went on to say at pp 325-326: 
 
The matter, however, does not end there, because albeit it may be sufficient in the majority of cases if it is made clear to a prisoner that the final decision is his, however forcibly counsel may put it, the position is different if the advice is conveyed as the advice of someone who has seen the judge, and has given the impression that he is repeating the judge`s views in the matter. As I have said, the court is quite satisfied Mr Grey [counsel] was giving his own views and not the judge`s at all. But it had been conveyed to the appellant that Mr Grey had just returned from seeing the deputy chairman. What was said gave Mr Laity [solicitor] the impression that those were the judge`s views, and Mr Grey very frankly said that in the circumstances the appellant might well have got the impression that they were the judge`s views. Accordingly one asks: was he ever disabused of that, did anything happen to show that these were not the judge`s views on the case?
 
 
 
...
True, as I have said, he was warned that the choice was his, 
 but once he felt that this was an intimation emanating from the judge, it is really idle in the opinion of this court to think that he really had a free choice in the matter 
.
Accordingly ... and in all the circumstances of the case the court feels that the proper course will be to treat the plea that was given as a nullity, with the result that the trial that had taken place is a mistrial, and that there should be an order of a venire de novo. (Emphasis added.)
The principle applied in 
 R v Turner 
 is freedom of choice. A long list of similar cases is set out at p 518 of 
 Crown Court Law And Practice 
by Richard Bighams QC. In each of these cases, the judge played some role in each of the appellant`s decision in pleading guilty which the court found had deprived the appellant of his power not to plead guilty. In 
 R v Inns 
[1975] Crim LR 182, the Court of Appeal also declared a plea of guilty a nullity on the ground that the appellant had misunderstood the judge`s intimation to his counsel, who had seen the judge in chambers on the probable sentence, as a threat. The appellant was discharged conditionally. The decision of the court is reported as follows:
 Held 
, the court did not intend to decide whose recollection of the unfortunate incident was the most reliable. It was surprised that it had happened, and hoped this sort of conversation would not take place again. The whole basis of a plea on arraignment was that the accused had a free choice. The law attached so much importance to a plea of guilty in open court that no further proof of guilt was required. A plea made under pressure and threats was not a proper plea and the proceedings thereafter were a nullity.
That the principle is freedom of choice is further confirmed by another decision where the Court of Appeal refused an application to set aside a plea of guilty. In 
 R v Peace 
 [1976] Crim LR 119, the appellant had pleaded guilty and was later pardoned after his employer`s conviction for the same offences as a concerted party was quashed. He then applied for leave to set aside his plea of guilty on the ground that, after speaking to his counsel, he had formed the impression that counsel was not familiar with his case, thought he was guilty and would not represent him satisfactorily on a plea of not guilty. Counsel had said that if he pleaded guilty he would be sentenced to Borstal but if he pleaded not guilty he might receive three to four years` imprisonment, and that if he called his fiancee to support his alibi, she might be prosecuted for perjury. The appellant had little time to make up his mind and decided to plead guilty as the lesser of the two evils. He had an opportunity to tell his fiancee of his decision. She was unhappy about it but decided to stick to it. The Court of Appeal held that an ill-advised plea of guilty was not such an irregularity as came within s 2(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. The court went on to say that the only possible alternative available to the appellant was an order of 
 venire de novo 
 on the ground that his plea was a nullity (and in 
 R v Inns 
 ), that what had to be shown was that the apparent plea of guilty was no plea at all because it was made under pressure or threats or the like circumstances in which the accused had no free choice but was driven to a certain course whether he liked it or not. The court held that the facts did not make the plea a nullity as the said applicant could not be said to have lost his power to make a voluntary and deliberate choice, and that it would be a serious matter if it were accepted that when counsel gave strong advice indicating the prospect of being found guilty and the alternative of pleading guilty it could be said that the plea was forced on the defendant. It was a question of fact in every case.
In 
 R v Peace 
 , the judge played no role in the plea of guilty by the appellant who had obviously been greatly influenced by his counsel`s strong advice of the outcome of the trial as well as the probable sentence.
In the case before me, I have to decide whether on the evidence the petitioner had no free choice when he pleaded guilty. What is his story? In para 5 of the petition which was drafted by counsel, the petitioner asserted that he was put under pressure to plead guilty as his counsel had told him that on the evidence adduced by the prosecution, his defence would fail and that if he pleaded guilty `the court would impose a fine`. In his evidence in court, he changed the allegation to a fine and a day`s imprisonment. Obviously, between the day he instructed the present counsel and the day he gave evidence in court, he was still not sure what Edwin Chan had told him. In para 6, he asserted that he `thought that this arrangement had been agreed upon by his counsel with the police and the court and on this understanding [he] thought there was no other alternative and decided to plead guilty ... `.
However, assuming that paras 5 and 6 were true, what do they suggest? They suggest that it was possible that there could have been such an arrangement between the petitioner (through his counsel), prosecutor and judge which the judge had failed to keep. In para 9 of the petition, the petitioner went even further to allege that `he thought the issue in respect of his sentence had been arranged by his counsel and the prosecutor and the court, 
 as advised by his counsel 
 `. The petitioner, in his reply to a question from the court, has admitted that he did not receive such advice. Here again, the petitioner appeared to have forgotten what he had said in para 9 of his petition.
In the light of these two contradictions, the petitioner is left with his `understanding` that there was this arrangement. When asked how he arrived at this understanding, he gave two reasons: (i) in the course of negotiating the plea of guilty, the prosecutor and his counsel went into a room from which the judge came into the courtroom and (ii) the prosecution agreed to proceed with only two charges against him after he had been charged with four charges. In my view, no reasonable person in the circumstances in which the petitioner was placed would have formed the alleged understanding on the basis of these two events. Even assuming that the petitioner did not know that `plea-bargaining`, in the sense of the court bargaining with the accused as to the sentence, is not part of the administration of criminal justice in Singapore (see Lord Scarman in 
 R v Atkinson 
 [1978] 2 All ER 460 at p 462), his understanding was wholly irrational, if not perverse, for the following reasons: firstly, Edwin Chan did not do anything or say anything before going into or after coming out of the room which suggested that the judge had agreed to any arrangement. Secondly, the petitioner`s second reason implies that it was the prosecutor who was anxious to do a deal with him to secure his conviction and on that account had agreed to reduce the number of charges. As he well knew, he accepted his counsel`s advice that there was no viable defence and that it was in his interest that a plea of guilty be negoon the best terms in the circumstances.
In my view, having regard to his statements in the petition which, it should also be noted, was only filed seven months after his conviction after receiving independent legal advice, and his evidence in this court, the petitioner`s version of what his counsel had said to him is unreliable and that it was more probable that Edwin Chan had advised him that there was a likelihood of a sentence of a fine and a day`s imprisonment, and that his advice could not have been stronger than that. The reason, in my view, is obvious. Edwin Chan was an experienced advocate and solicitor in criminal cases and he was aware that there was no such thing as `plea bargaining` with the judge. It was therefore inconceivable that Edwin Chan could have told the petitioner that the judge would (in the sense of conveying the judge`s intention, and not merely giving advice) impose a fine and a day`s imprisonment.
But, assuming that the petitioner did have the understanding alleged in para 6 of the petition, how could he have `thought` that there was no other alternative but to plead guilty? The thought process in this paragraph is difficult to understand. Even if the petitioner had been expressly told by his counsel that there had been such an arrangement, why was there no alternative to pleading guilty? There was no threat or pressure on him to plead guilty since he was not told and did not think that the alternative was a heavier sentence if he were found guilty. Since he had maintained his innocence all along, and this is confirmed by his own counsel, he could have rejected his counsel`s advice and fought on in the hope of obtaining an acquittal. He could have discharged his counsel for lacking confidence in putting up a successful defence.
In my view, the petitioner has confused an inducement with a threat or pressure. Paragraph 9 must mean that the petitioner was induced into pleading guilty because of the arrangement. That should have been the ground for an application to set aside the plea of guilty and not the ground of denial of his free choice. Since, in fact, there was no such arrangement and the petitioner says that he pleaded guilty because he thought that there was such an arrangement, it must follow that the plea of guilty was self-induced. This is confirmed by his own testimony as follows: `I was thinking that to avoid the trouble of coming to court so many times that if I pleaded guilty I could go back to my job ... I thought by paying a fine, the matter would rest there and so I agreed to plead guilty`. In my view, the petition was misconceived.
The other ground of this petition, that the applicant did not receive a fair trial because his counsel had failed to obtain a statement from or secure the attendance at the trial of one Badal, is also without merit. It has nothing to do with the petitioner being denied his free choice or the absence of a fair trial since the petitioner elected to plead guilty voluntarily with full knowledge of the absence of the said witness in court. It relates to the professional competence of counsel in conducting the defence, a matter which is not relevant in these proceedings.
For the above reasons, this petition is dismissed.

Yong Pung How CJ:

1          These were two related appeals by the first appellant, Ng Keng Yong, and the second appellant, Chua Chue Teng, against their respective convictions for causing death by a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, an offence under s 304A of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the PC”). I dismissed both appeals and now give my reasons.

Facts

2          Both the appellants are lieutenants in the Republic of Singapore Navy (“RSN”). The charges against them arose out of the tragic collision between the RSN ship RSS Courageous (“the Courageous”) and the merchant vessel ANL Indonesia (“the ANL”) on 3 January 2003, which resulted in the deaths of four RSN servicewomen.

The vessels

3          The ANL was a Netherlands-registered container ship with a gross tonnage of 51,938. She was 293.5m in length and had a top speed of 24.8 knots (46km/h). The Courageous was a “Fearless Class” anti-submarine patrol vessel which displaced approximately 452 tonnes. At 57.94m, she was less than one-fifth the length of the ANL. She was powered by an advanced twin jet propulsion system, and had a top speed exceeding 20 knots (37km/h).

4          Both ships were equipped with a Gyro compass, radar, Automatic Radar Plotting Aid and other navigational equipment and charts. All the equipment was functioning at the material time.

The sequence of events

5          At about 11.20pm on 3 January 2003, the Courageous and the ANL were both travelling on the eastbound lane of the Traffic Separation Scheme (“TSS”) just off the Horsburgh Lighthouse at Pedra Branca. Both vessels were moving in a north-easterly direction in accordance with the general traffic flow. The ANL was en route from Port Klang, Malaysia, to Busan, South Korea, while the Courageous was some 6 nautical miles (“nm”) ahead of the ANL conducting her regular patrol of the waters.

6          At the material time, the first appellant was the Officer-of-the-Watch (“OOW”) on the Courageous. He was responsible for the safe navigation of the ship. The second appellant was only a trainee OOW, but she had the con, or control of the steering, of the vessel. She made navigational decisions and issued the relevant orders to the rest of the bridge team. As the supervising OOW, the first appellant would only intervene if he was of the view that any of her actions or instructions were wrong.

7          At 11.25pm, the Courageous reached the end of her patrol area. After checking that both sides were clear, the second appellant ordered the Courageous to execute a “U-turn”. This changed her course to a south-westerly direction of 235°, leading her to proceed down the eastbound lane of the TSS against the general flow of traffic. 

8          Shortly after, the officer on the bridge of the ANL, Gerrit Easge Botma (“Botma”), observed the red port sidelight of the Courageous on the port side of the ANL. This suggested that the vessels would pass port to port. Meanwhile, on board the Courageous, the Closest Point of Approach (“CPA”) alarm on the radar came on. The CPA alarm was set at three cables (0.3nm), indicating that the closest distance at which the Courageous would pass the target vessel (the ANL) was about three cables.  

9          Second Sergeant Goh Chun Yong, the radar plotter on the Courageous, reported the activation of the CPA alarm to the second appellant and informed her that the ANL was at “green 10” (10° on the starboard side). The lookout, First Sergeant Tan Soon Teck, and the petty OOW, Marcus Kuah Yeow Hwee, both confirmed his report. At this time, the vessels were closing in on each other at 31 knots or five cables per minute. Based on the report from the bridge team that the ANL was on the starboard side of the Courageous, the second appellant ordered an alteration to port from 235° to 215° at 11.30pm to increase the CPA. She also ordered a reduction in speed from Step 4 (1,000rpm or 13 knots) to Step 3 (860rpm or 12 knots).

10        Unfortunately, neither the appellants nor the rest of the bridge team realised that the ANL was in fact on the port side of the Courageous. The latter’s alteration to port therefore inadvertently brought the courses of the vessels even closer together. When the CPA did not open up as the second appellant had hoped, she ordered a further alteration to port from 215° to 210° at 11.31pm.

11        A minute later, Botma saw the green starboard light of the Courageous and realised that she had altered to port. As her relative bearing was not changing and the CPA was now zero, Botma alerted the Captain of the ANL, Petrus Paulaus Maria Koop (“Koop”), to the danger of collision. After a quick discussion, they decided to alter the ANL’s course to starboard in accordance with the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea 1972 (“the Collision Regulations”). The ANL made two alterations to starboard by autopilot between 11.32pm and 11.34pm, bringing her course from 51° to 73°. She also sounded a whistle blast to alert the Courageous.

12        At 11.33pm, the second appellant ordered the Courageous to make yet another alteration to port to 200°. She also ordered the speed to be increased back to Step 4. At 11.34pm, she ordered a final alteration to port to 190°, followed shortly by an order to put the helm hard to port. The first appellant also ordered both engines to “full throttle”.

13        The combination of the ANL’s alterations to starboard and the Courageous’ alterations to port resulted in the vessels colliding at 11.35pm about 1nm northeast of the Horsburgh Lighthouse. The ANL sustained superficial damage to her bow area, and none of her crew of 23 were injured. However, the Courageous sustained heavy losses. Part of her aft section was sheared off and sank. Of her 44 crewmembers, eight were injured and four died.

The inquiry and the charges

14        An inquiry was conducted under s 118 of the Merchant Shipping Act (Cap 179, 1996 Rev Ed) by investigators from the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (“MPA”). In their findings, the inquiry team noted that both the ANL and the Courageous “could have exercised better seamanship”. Nonetheless, they found that the collision was caused by “errors in judgment in assessing the situation and the wrongful application of the Collision Regulations” by the Courageous.

15        As the appellants were jointly responsible for negligently navigating the Courageous in an unsafe manner across the path of the ANL, they were subsequently charged under s 304A of the PC for causing the deaths of the four RSN servicewomen. The charges against them were heard together.

The Prosecution’s case

16        The Prosecution alleged that the appellants were negligent in:

(a)        navigating the Courageous against the flow of traffic in the TSS;

(b)        altering her course in the wrong direction; and

(c)        turning to port in a series of small alterations with a decrease in speed.

Navigating against the flow of traffic

17        The 1997 RSN Operations Directive entitled “Guidelines for RSN Craft/Ships Operating in Singapore Territorial Waters” states that RSN vessels such as the Courageous should, as far as possible, comply with the Collision Regulations. At the material time, the Courageous was travelling against the general flow of traffic on the eastbound lane of the TSS. This was a technical breach of r 10(b)(i) of the Collision Regulations, which provides that:

(b)      A vessel using a traffic separation scheme shall —

(i)         proceed in the appropriate traffic lane in the general direction of traffic flow for that lane …

Altering course in the wrong direction

18        The Prosecution also contended that when the Courageous found herself on a reciprocal or near reciprocal course with the ANL, she ought to have altered her course to starboard in accordance with r 14(a) of the Collision Regulations, which reads:

When two power-driven vessels are meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses so as to involve risk of collision each shall alter her course to starboard so that each shall pass on the port side of the other.

19        As the ANL was on the port side of the Courageous, an alteration to starboard in compliance with R 14(a) would have ensured that the vessels passed each other safely. By doing exactly what she should not have done, the Courageous placed herself on a particularly hazardous course.

Turning to port in a series of small alterations with a reduction in speed

20        The Courageous made a total of four alterations to port:

(a)        11.30pm: from 235° to 215° (a 20° alteration);

(b)         11.31pm: from 215° to 210° (a 5° alteration);

(c)         11.33pm: from 210° to 200° (a 10° alteration); and

(d)        11.34pm: from 200° to 190° (a 10° alteration).

21        The first alteration was accompanied by a reduction in speed from Step 4 to Step 3. The Prosecution argued that these actions violated r 8(b) of the Collision Regulations, which states that:

Any alteration of course and/or speed to avoid collision shall, if the circumstances of the case admit, be large enough to be readily apparent to another vessel observing visually or by radar; a succession of small alterations of course and/or speed should be avoided.

The Defence’s case

22        The appellants denied any negligence on their part. Instead, they claimed that the collision was caused by Botma and Koop’s negligent breach of r 8(b) of the Collision Regulations, set out above. Specifically, they argued that the ANL should have made a decisive alteration to starboard by manual steering, instead of two small alterations using her auto-pilot.

Navigating against the flow of traffic

23        The appellants acknowledged that they were technically in breach of r 10(b)(i). However, a minute of 27 January 2003 from the Office of the Chief of Navy to the MPA entitled “Compliance with COLREGS” states clearly that there can be situations where RSN vessels may be compelled to deviate from the Collision Regulations due to the nature and requirements of military missions and operational profiles. In this case, the Courageous was entitled to patrol against the flow of traffic as it placed her in a good position to reinforce the waters off Pedra Branca.

Altering course in the wrong direction

24        The appellants also asserted that r 14(a) was not applicable when they made the alterations to port as there was no risk of collision at the time. The CPA of three cables was safe, and the night order book of the Commanding Officer, Major Tang Yong Yang (“CO”), showed that previous CPAs practiced on board the Courageous were as low as two to three cables.

Turning to port in a series of small alterations with a reduction in speed

25        A Seaman’s Guide to the Rule of the Road (6th Ed, 1995) stipulates that a bold alteration is generally 30° or more. Although the appellants’ alterations fell below this standard, they argued that their initial alteration of 20° made their intention to cross ahead of the ANL readily apparent. The defence expert, Captain John Third (“DE”), also suggested that the two initial alterations should be considered as one, as they occurred within a minute of each other. This meant that the Courageous’ first alteration was 25°, a mere 5° below the standard.

The decision below

26        It is settled law that the standard of care for criminal negligence is the same as that for civil negligence: Lim Poh Eng v PP [1999] 2 SLR 116. The question before the district judge was whether the appellants had acted in a manner which a reasonable person in their positions would have done. After holding that the applicable standard in this case was that of a reasonable naval OOW operating a naval vessel, the district judge turned to evaluate each of the Prosecution’s allegations: see PP v Ng Keng Yong [2004] SGDC 74.

Navigating against the flow of traffic

27        The district judge recognised that the Courageous had technically contravened r 10(b)(i) of the Collision Regulations by proceeding against the flow of traffic in the TSS. However, he accepted that this manoeuvre was safe and operationally necessary. The appellants were therefore not negligent in this respect.

Altering course in the wrong direction

28        Although the appellants were not negligent in navigating against the flow of traffic, the onus was on them to take extra precautions to avoid a close-quarters situation with other vessels proceeding in the right direction. The district judge accepted the evidence of the prosecution expert, Captain Hilbert Fernandez (“PE”), that the CPA of three cables was, in the circumstances, unsafe. Given that this was a head-on situation at night with a large vessel, the appellants should have kept a greater buffer to take into account contingencies such as radar time lag, margins of error and the ANL’s size and lack of manoeuvrability. Bearing in mind the conservative approach advocated by the Collision Regulations, the district judge found that there was a risk of collision and r 14(a) therefore applied.

29        The district judge noted that r 14(a) applied to all head-on situations where there was a risk of collision, whether the vessels were passing port to port or starboard to starboard. He found support for this proposition in Nicholas J Healey and Joseph C Sweeney, The Law of Marine Collision (1998) at 184:

[I]n the head-on situation, if any change of course is required to effect a safe passing it must be to starboard so that the vessels will pass port to port. Even if the courses are somewhat starboard of each other, but a safe starboard to starboard passing cannot be made without an alteration of course by either vessel, each must turn to starboard. This is so, even though it may mean that one vessel must cross the other’s bow in order to pass port to port.

30        Therefore, although he accepted that the appellants had perceived the ANL to be on their starboard side, he found that they were nonetheless obliged to alter to starboard. By altering to port instead, they had negligently breached r 14(a) of the Collision Regulations.  

31        Turning to the question of causation, the district judge observed that both causation in fact and in law had to be established. “But for” the Courageous turning to port in breach of r 14(a), the collision would have been avoided – causation in fact was proven. The reasonable foreseeability test for causation in law was also satisfied. The district judge therefore held that the collision was caused by the appellants’ negligent breach of r 14(a).

Turning to port in a series of small alterations with a reduction in speed

32        The district judge accepted DE’s opinion that the first two alterations of the Courageous should be considered as one, as they occurred within a minute. However, the two further 10° alterations were a clear violation of r 8(b) of the Collision Regulations. Although this breach did increase the risk of collision, he found insufficient evidence to establish causation on this aspect of the appellants’ negligence.

Further negligence by the appellants

33        The district judge also held that the appellants’ failure to make light and sound signals when making the last two 10° alterations was a negligent breach of rr 34(a) and (b) of the Collision Regulations, which state as follows:

(a)        When vessels are in sight of one another, a power-driven vessel underway, when manoeuvring as authorised or required by these Rules, shall indicate that manoeuvre by the following signals on her whistle:

one short blast to mean “I am altering my course to starboard”;

two short blasts to mean “I am altering my course to port” …

(b)        Any vessel may supplement the whistle signals prescribed in paragraph (a) by light signals, repeated as appropriate, whilst the manoeuvre is being carried out —

(i)         these light signals shall have the following significance:

one flash to mean “I am altering my course to starboard”;

two flashes to mean “I am altering my course to port” …

34        However, the Prosecution did not allege that any of this was causative of the collision. The district judge was also not prepared to hold that the appellants were negligent in:

(a)        failing to take compass bearings to assess the risk of collision;

(b)        failing to infer from the decreasing CPA that the ANL must be altering course to starboard; and

(c)        failing to switch the radar to a six-minute vector, 3nm range scale or a relative motion setting to assess the risk of collision more accurately.

The ANL’s contributory negligence

35        In response to the Courageous’ actions, the ANL had altered her course to starboard which was the correct direction as prescribed under the Collision Regulations. However, instead of making a bold alteration by manual steering, the ANL made two smaller alterations by autopilot. As a result, the district judge found that her eventual 22° alteration in course was not large enough to be readily apparent under r 8(b) of the Collision Regulations.

36        If the ANL had made a decisive alteration to starboard, the collision could have been avoided. Both elements of causation in fact and in law were satisfied. Nonetheless, drawing from the doctrine of novus actus interveniens, the district judge took the view that the ANL’s actions were not so unreasonable as to eclipse the appellant’s initial negligence in breaching r 14(a), which indisputably caused the collision and resulted in the deaths of the four RSN servicewomen. The appellants were accordingly convicted under s 304A of the PC.

The appeals

37        The appellants raised three principal issues in their appeals:

(a)        whether the alteration to port by the Courageous was a negligent act in breach of r 14(a) of the Collision Regulations;

(b)        whether the alteration to port was the proximate and efficient cause of the collision under s 304A of the PC; and

(c)        whether the second appellant, as a trainee OOW, should be held to the same standard of care as a qualified OOW.

Whether the alteration to port was a breach of r 14(a)

38        Rule 14(a) of the Collision Regulations would have applied only if the two vessels were meeting on reciprocal or nearly reciprocal courses (ie, approaching within 6° of each other), and they were approaching “so as to involve a risk of collision” at the material time. The appellants did not dispute that before the Courageous made her first alteration to port, she was meeting the ANL on a reciprocal course. Instead, they contended that there was no risk of collision, and the district judge’s finding to the contrary was against the weight of the evidence.

39        It is trite law that an appellate court will only disturb the trial judge’s findings of fact when they are plainly wrong or against the weight of the evidence: Lim Ah Poh v PP [1992] 1 SLR 713; PP v Azman bin Abdullah [1998] 2 SLR 704. However, when a finding is based not so much upon the demeanour of witnesses but upon inferences made from objective evidence, an appellate court is then in as good a position as the trial court to assess the material: PP v Choo Thiam Hock [1994] 3 SLR 248.

“So as to involve risk of collision”

40        A preliminary point must first be made. Both in the trial court and before me, the parties appeared to take the position that the phrase “so as to involve a risk of collision” in r 14(a) was equivalent to the existence of a risk of collision. Their arguments therefore centred on whether a risk of collision existed at the material time. This approach was, strictly speaking, inaccurate as a matter of law. The Collision Regulations draw a clear distinction between situations where a risk of collision exists (for example, rr 18 and 19), and where the vessels are approaching each other “so as to involve risk of collision” (for example, rr 14 and 15): see Healey and Sweeney, The Law of Marine Collision ([29] supra) at 126–127. Support for this proposition can also be found in John Wheeler Griffin, The American Law of Collision (1949) which states at 23:

It will be noted that the phrase is not “so that there is risk of collision,” but “so as to involve risk of collision.” The words evidently refer to a time when there is not yet actual danger, but when the relation between the vessels is such that danger may shortly arise, if the rules are not obeyed. Thus Brett, MR, in the Beryl, 9 Prob Div 137, 5 Asp 321 [1884], said that the rules are intended “not merely for the purpose of preventing a collision, but for the purpose of preventing even a risk of collision.” And Atkin, LJ, in the Gulf of Suez, [1921] Prob Div 318, 332, said that the phrase “to involve risk of collision … indicates a period before the risk has, so to speak, actually matured; it means a period at which there is a probability that there will be a risk of collision if precautions are not taken.” [emphasis added]

41        The real question before me was not whether a risk of collision existed at the material time, but whether the situation simply involved a risk of collision. However, this subtle recharacterisation of the issue did not undermine the district judge’s decision, since his finding that a risk of collision existed at the time necessarily implied that a risk of collision was involved to begin with. The distinction was nonetheless crucial to these appeals, since the Prosecution did not have to prove that a risk of collision existed for r 14(a) to apply. All they had to show was that the situation was such that a risk of collision could possibly arise if the vessels did not act in accordance with the regulations. I evaluated the appellants’ contentions with this in mind.  

Objective test for risk of collision

42        The appellants’ main argument was the fact that none of the navigators on the ANL or the Courageous perceived that a risk of collision existed at 11.30pm, just before the Courageous’ initial alteration to port. In this regard, I agreed with the Prosecution that when considering if a risk of collision was involved, the subjective opinions of the navigators could not be decisive. The test of whether a risk of collision is involved must be an objective one. Any other approach would completely subvert the Collision Regulations’ objective of promoting certainty and safety.

43        The Collision Regulations have force of law in Singapore by virtue of the fact that they are encapsulated in the Merchant Shipping (Prevention of Collisions at Sea) Regulations (Cap 179, Rg 10) of the Merchant Shipping Act. They are universally accepted principles of safe navigation that are designed to ensure that, whenever possible, ships will not reach a close-quarters situation in which a risk of collision will arise: The “Maloja II” [1993] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 48 at 50–51. As G P Selvam J stated emphatically in The Teng He [2000] 3 SLR 114 at [39]:

Certainty of the situation must be the primary objective. Optimistic assumptions must be avoided: pessimistic assumptions should be preferred. These are the requirements of the Collision Regulations. These are also common sense rules of caution for the avoidance of collisions at sea. Strict adherence to these rules cannot be overemphasized because of the huge losses non-adherence to them can cause to property and human lives.

44        The conservative approach of the Collision Regulations is also borne out by the contents of the rules themselves. For example, r 7(a) provides that if there is any doubt as to whether a risk of collision exists, such risk shall be deemed to exist. Given that the Collision Regulations are meant to regulate and “de-conflict” the actions of vessels approaching one another, an objective approach must be taken when deciding if a risk of collision is involved at the material time. I could not see how the regulations could effectively serve their function if, in the same situation, they would apply to one vessel but not the other, merely because their respective navigators held different opinions as to the risk of collision. I did take into consideration the opinions of the trained navigators on board the ANL and the Courageous. However, the determination of whether a risk of collision was involved is essentially an objective exercise, and their subjective opinions had to be weighed against the rest of the evidence.

45        Dealing first with the opinions of Botma and Koop on the ANL, I noted that they had made their assessment based solely on the fact that the Courageous was showing her port sidelights, indicating that the vessels would pass port to port. There was no evidence to suggest that Botma and Koop took any further measures, such as radar plotting, to ascertain if a risk of collision was imminent. This appeared to be an overly simplistic approach, bearing in mind r 7 of the Collision Regulations:

(a)        Every vessel shall use all available means appropriate to the prevailing circumstances and conditions to determine if risk of collision exists. If there is any doubt such risk shall be deemed to exist.

(b)        Proper use shall be made of radar equipment if fitted and operational, including long-range scanning to obtain early warning of risk of collision and radar plotting or equivalent systematic observation of detected objects.

(c)        Assumptions shall not be made on the basis of scanty information …

46        Although r 7 only applies to the determination of whether a risk of collision exists, it underscores the conservative approach that should be taken by navigators whenever a close-quarters situation appears to be developing. Botma and Koop’s opinion that there was no risk of collision was therefore undermined to a certain extent by their rather crude method of assessing the risk involved.

47        Further, Botma and Koop had estimated that the CPA at the time was four to five cables. As the ANL’s CPA alarm was not switched on, this approximation could not be verified with certainty. In contrast, the CPA alarm on the Courageous was activated and clearly indicated that the CPA was three cables. As Botma’s and Koop’s evaluation of the situation was made in the context of an overestimation of the CPA, I found that the district judge was correct to have placed little weight on their opinions.

48        As for the appellants’ claim that there was no risk of collision, this had to be placed in the context of my earlier finding that a risk of collision did not have to exist at the material time for r 14(a) to apply. The threshold for the operation of r 14(a) was lower – all that was necessary was for the situation to involve a risk of collision.

PE’s evidence

49        Also, the appellants’ views that there was no risk of collision had to be balanced against PE’s considered opinion that there was such a risk. The appellants alleged that PE was tailoring his evidence to suit the Prosecution’s case, as he only suggested that there was a risk of collision in his Supplementary Expert Report after the appellants had adduced evidence to show that there was no such risk.

50        I found this attack on PE’s credibility to be disingenuous and completely unwarranted. The only evidence that the appellants produced to suggest that PE did not initially believe that there was a risk of collision was the following quote from his first Report:

From 2325 to 2329 hours, RC [the Courageous] was fine on the port bow of AI. At this stage, they were not on a collision course and would have passed each other port to port…

51        Saying that the vessels were not on a collision course is very different from taking the view that there was no risk of collision. The Courageous and the ANL were obviously not on a collision course at the material time because the CPA was not zero cables. The real question was whether the CPA of three cables was safe, or whether the situation was such that a risk of collision would arise if proper precautions were not taken. Although PE did not use the exact phrase “risk of collision” in his first Report, a brief perusal of the contents demonstrated that he had consistently maintained that a CPA of less than five cables was risky in the circumstances. At para 29 of the Report, he opined that the CPA of three cables was “unsafe and unjustifiable … as it would not allow the OOWs on both vessels to take corrective action(s) in time …” He reiterated this at para 34:

[A] small CPA of less than 5 cables at night (especially when going against the flow of traffic in the TSS) is risky and is certainly poor seamanship… [S]uch small passing distances is [sic] unacceptable.    

52        The appellants sought to dispute PE’s findings by referring to the American case of Acacia Vera Navigation Co Ltd v Kezia Ltd 1996 AMC [American Maritime Cases] 2592. In this case, the vessels Omina and Blue Cloud were passing starboard to starboard at a distance equivalent to three cables when the Blue Cloud took a sharp starboard turn, causing her to collide twice with the Omina. In giving judgment for the owners of the Omina, the district court found that there would have been a distance of at least three cables between the two vessels, “a clear and sufficient distance in all respects”: see Acacia Vera at 2601. The decision was upheld on appeal, and the appellants argued that the case supported their contention that the CPA of three cables was safe.

53        I could not agree. The court in Acacia Vera had merely held that a CPA of three cables was sufficient in the circumstances of the case. As PE highlighted in his Report, the calculation of a safe CPA is necessarily dependent on the particular circumstances of the encounter. Factors such as traffic density, state of visibility, sea condition, manoeuvring characteristics of the vessel, speed and draft have to be taken into consideration. It follows from this that the court’s finding in Acacia Vera could not be transplanted in toto to the facts of the present case.

54        In any event, the Prosecution also cited a number of cases which found a risk of collision even though the CPA was more than three cables. This further substantiated my opinion that the appellants’ reliance on Acacia Vera was misplaced, as a safe CPA has to be determined according to the circumstances of every encounter.

Whether a CPA of three cables was safe in the circumstances

55        Therefore, the facts of the present case had to be scrutinised to determine if the ANL and the Courageous were approaching each other so as to involve a risk of collision. After evaluating the evidence, I found myself in firm agreement with the district judge that the CPA of three cables was unsafe in the circumstances. In coming to this conclusion, I took the following factors into account:

(a)        the Courageous was travelling against the flow of traffic;

(b)        a sufficient buffer had to be given to accommodate contingencies such as engine and steering failure and unexpected last minute manoeuvres;

(c)        the vessels were closing in on each other rapidly;

(d)        there were margins of error on the radars of both vessels that could assume significant portions at close range;

(e)        visibility was obviously poorer at night; and

(f)         the Courageous had failed to use any light or sound signals at any time.

56        Although the appellants were not negligent in navigating the Courageous against the flow of traffic, it was incumbent on them to take all the necessary safety measures including the maintenance of a sufficient CPA. Considering the circumstances highlighted above, and the relative approaches of the ANL and the Courageous, I had no doubt that the situation clearly involved a risk of collision. Therefore, I agreed with the trial judge that r 14(a) applied.

57        It has been established since my decision in Lim Poh Eng ([26] supra) that the civil standard of care applies to criminal cases as well. Since the appellants did not dispute that an unjustified breach of the Collision Regulations would constitute negligence, and they had plainly failed to alter to starboard as required by r 14(a), I found that the Prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

58        In coming to this conclusion, I did take into account the fact that entries from the CO’s night order book indicated that the Courageous had kept a CPA of as low as two to three cables on a number of nights. Given that the applicable standard of care in this case was that of a reasonable naval OOW, the appellants argued that the entries in the night order book demonstrated that they did not fall below the standard required of them, even though the CPA on the night of the accident was only three cables.

59        This contention completely misses the point I had made earlier, which is that the minimum safe CPA to be kept at any given time must be determined on a case by case basis. Without any further evidence to suggest that the circumstances involved on the dates of these entries were similar or analogous to those on the night of 3 January 2003, I failed to see how this evidence advanced the appellants’ case. Even if I accepted that the practice on these specific occasions could be applied to the night of the accident, the success of the appellant’s argument rested on the assumption that the CO’s orders on the entries were not negligent to begin with. Not having adduced any evidence to support the soundness of such an assumption, the appellants could not hope to succeed on this point. 

Whether the alteration to port was the proximate and efficient cause of the collision

60        The appellants’ second ground of appeal related to the issue of causation.

Test for causation

61        The established test for causation under s 304A of the PC is set out in Lee Kim Leng v R [1964] MLJ 285 at 286, where F A Chua J adopted the Indian decision of Emperor v Omkar Ram Pratap (1902) 4 Bom LR 679:

In the Indian case of Emperor v Omkar Ram Pratap it was held that to impose criminal liability under section 304A of the Indian Penal Code (which is similar to our section 304A of the Penal Code) it is necessary that the death should have been the direct result of a rash and negligent act of the accused and that act must have been the proximate and efficient cause without the intervention of another’s negligence. It must have been the causa causans; it is not enough that it may have been the causa sine qua non. [emphasis added]

62        Although Chua J’s words are recognised to be inaccurate in so far as they suggest that death should be the direct result of a rash and negligent act (it being clear that the provision only requires the offending act to be rash or negligent), the rest of the decision is widely acknowledged as the correct approach to causation under s 304A. The Malaysian court in PP v Joseph Chin Saiko [1972] 2 MLJ 129 expressed similar views at 133, noting that the rash or negligent act had to be the immediate cause of death and not just a remote cause.

63        Therefore, I agreed with the appellants that the district judge erred in importing principles of causation from civil negligence, such as the “but for” test and the doctrine of novus actus interveniens, into the operation of s 304A. Although I held in Lim Poh Eng ([26] supra) that the standard of negligence in criminal cases should be the civil standard of negligence, this was by no means a licence for the entire law of civil negligence to be transplanted into the criminal sphere. There is no doubt that the distinction between criminal and civil liability must be maintained. In the present context, the distinction between civil and criminal negligence is reflected in both the higher standard of proof for the Prosecution and the stricter test of causation that needs to be established for criminal liability to attach.

Whether ANL’s contributory negligence broke the chain of causation

64        Adopting Chua J’s test of causation in Lee Kim Leng, the question before me was whether the appellants’ negligent alteration to port in breach of r 14(a) of the Collision Regulations constituted the proximate and efficient cause of the collision, or whether the ANL’s undisputed contributory negligence intervened to break the chain of causation.  

65        According to the appellants’ interpretation of Lee Kim Leng, the chain of causation is necessarily broken whenever another party’s negligence in fact intervenes, irrespective of the parties’ relative blameworthiness. Read literally, Chua J’s statement that the accused’s act “must have been the proximate and efficient cause without the intervention of another’s negligence” might support the appellants’ argument. However, I found such an approach to be so repugnant to common sense that it had to be rejected. Taking the appellants’ argument to its logical conclusion, criminal liability under s 304A would at all times be imposed on the person who committed the most recent act of negligence, even when the negligence of another was more substantially to blame. I could not accept that the authorities led inexorably to such an arbitrary conclusion.

66        To my mind, the words of Chua J in Lee Kim Leng can be interpreted in a much more reasonable and equitable fashion. In the same case, Chua J noted further in his judgment that to impose criminal liability, “it must be found as a fact that the collision was entirely or at least mainly due to the act of the appellant”: Lee Kim Leng, [61] supra, at 286. Proceeding on both principle and logic, it is evident that criminal liability under s 304A should attach to the person(s) whose negligence contributed substantially, and not merely peripherally, to the result. When Chua J observed that the accused’s act should be the proximate and efficient cause of the result without the intervention of another’s negligence, he was merely emphasising the point that the accused’s negligence, and not the negligence of any other person, should have contributed significantly to the result. If he meant to suggest that the chain of causation was necessarily broken by the very fact of a third party’s intervening negligence, then, with the greatest respect, I cannot agree. The particulars of the factual matrix, and the extent to which the third party’s negligence contributed to the deaths, have to be assessed as well. The court must ultimately direct its mind to whether the negligence of the accused contributed significantly or substantially to the result.

67        On the facts, the appellants were negligent in turning to port in the face of a potential risk of collision when r 14(a) of the Collision Regulations directed them to alter to starboard instead. On her part, the ANL had turned starboard in accordance with the Collision Regulations, but was also negligent in failing to alter her course boldly and quickly. Applying the above principles of causation to the present case, the question was whether the ANL’s contributory negligence had such causative potency that the appellant’s initial negligence could not be said to have contributed significantly to the collision.          

68        The appellants cited a number of authorities to support their case. In Kurban Hussein Mohamedalli Rangawalla v State of Maharashtra AIR 1965 SC 1616, seven workers were killed in a fire at a paint factory. The fire was caused by the negligence of one worker, Hatim. While manufacturing paints through a heating process, he had poured turpentine too quickly into a hot rosin mixture, causing it to overflow. The heat that was generated subsequently caused some varnish and turpentine stored nearby to catch fire. The appellant, the managing partner of the factory, was initially convicted under the Indian equivalent of s 304A for causing the workers’ deaths, as he had allowed the heating process to take place in the same room where the varnish and turpentine were stored. The Supreme Court of India allowed his appeal, holding that the deaths were not the direct or proximate result of his negligence. Instead, they held that the direct or proximate cause of the fire was Hatim’s own negligence. 

69        In Lee Lai Siew v PP [1978] 1 MLJ 259, the master of the ship Nanukan Express was charged and convicted of causing the deaths of 38 passengers following the sinking of the vessel. He had overloaded her with 170 passengers when she was only licensed to carry 84. The High Court of Sabah set aside his conviction, finding that the main cause of the sinking and the passengers’ deaths was the bad weather and rough seas. The negligent overloading was, in the court’s view at 262, “a very remote fact in causing this tragedy”.

70        In my opinion, the facts in both cases were clearly distinguishable from those in the present appeals. In Lee Lai Siew, there was evidence to suggest that the overloading had absolutely no impact on the safety of the ship. The court took the view that the weather and the sea were the only causes of the passengers’ deaths. In Kurban Hussein, while the appellant’s negligence in storing the varnish and turpentine in the heating room did facilitate the fire, it was Hatim’s own independent act of negligence that ignited the materials in the first place. Hatim’s negligence was in no way related to or caused by the appellant’s initial negligence.

71        In the present case, I accepted the appellants’ point that the vessels would not have collided if the ANL had not been negligent. Nevertheless, it must be emphasised that the appellants were the ones who created the situation of danger to begin with. Although I agreed with the district judge that they were not negligent in navigating against the flow of traffic due to operational exigencies, the onus was on them to take the necessary extra precautions to avoid any potential risk of collision with other vessels proceeding in the correct direction on the TSS. Far from keeping a watchful eye on the situation, the appellants made a series of alterations to port in breach of the Collision Regulations. The ANL was obliged by the appellants’ actions to respond with her own, albeit negligent, manoeuvres. To my mind, the appellants’ negligence was clearly a substantial cause of the collision.

72        As Lord Pearce opined in The “Miraflores” and the “Abadesa” [1967] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 191 at 200 (sub nom Miraflores (Owners) v George Livanos (Owners) [1967] 1 AC 826 at 847–848):

It is axiomatic that a person who embarks on a deliberate act of negligence should, in general, bear a greater degree of fault than one who fails to cope adequately with the resulting crisis which is thus thrust upon him … For all humans can refrain from deliberately breaking well-known safety rules; but ’tis not in mortals to command the perfect reaction to a crisis; and many fall short at times of that degree which reasonable care demands. [emphasis added]

73          This analysis of the situation is also supported by Chua J’s decision in Lee Kim Leng itself. In this case, a pedestrian was killed by the impact of the appellant’s car colliding into the rear of a taxi, which had stopped suddenly at the pedestrian crossing. The appellant was convicted under s 304A of causing the death of the pedestrian, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. Chua J found that the appellant’s negligence was not wholly or mainly responsible for the collision, as the taxi driver was initially negligent in failing to see the pedestrian at the crossing until he was almost upon her. As the taxi had stopped suddenly without giving any signals, the appellant simply had no time to react and he could not therefore be held responsible for the subsequent collision. 

74        Similarly, in this case, the ANL was forced to react in response to a risk of collision created by the appellants’ own negligent actions. I could not see how the appellants could seriously argue that their negligence had not contributed significantly to the collision and the consequent deaths of the four servicewomen.  

Whether second appellant should be held to same standard as a qualified OOW

75        The final ground of appeal centred on the issue of the standard of care, and related only to the second appellant’s conviction. The second appellant argued that as a trainee OOW she should not be held to the same standard as a qualified OOW, and the district judge had erred in applying the case of Nettleship v Weston [1971] 2 QB 691.  

Whether Nettleship v Weston should apply

76        In Nettleship v Weston, the plaintiff was injured as a result of the defendant’s negligent driving. Although the defendant was a learner driver, the English Court of Appeal found that she had to be held to the same standard of care as that of a reasonably competent driver. A doctrine of varying standards depending on the defendant’s experience was too uncertain to be viable. Megaw LJ (who dissented only on the issue of quantum of damages) explained the rationale for the court’s decision at 707:

The disadvantages of the resulting unpredictability, uncertainty and, indeed, impossibility of arriving at fair and consistent decisions outweigh the advantages. The certainty of a general standard is preferable to the vagaries of a fluctuating standard.

77        I acknowledged the second appellant’s point that Nettleship v Weston was influenced to some extent by extraneous considerations of insurance and risk allocation, none of which were relevant in the present case. Nonetheless, I found that the approach taken by the court was correct and ought to be adopted here – any other alternative was simply too ambiguous and uncertain.

78        Even if I were minded to accept the second appellant’s argument that she should be held to a lower standard because she was still a trainee, that still begged the question of what standard the second appellant should have been held to. The second appellant argued that all she had to do was take her training seriously. Assuming that I was prepared to agree with this, I could not see any logical reason to limit such an indulgence to the facts of this case. The court in Nettleship v Weston itself recognised that its decision would inexorably extend to a much wider sphere of negligence responsibility. Megaw LJ’s comments at 593 merit reproduction here:

… [I]f the principle of varying standards is to be accepted, why should it operate, in the field of driving motor vehicles, only up to the stage of the driver qualifying for a full licence? And why should it be limited to the quality of inexperience? If the passenger knows that his driver suffers from some relevant defect, physical or temperamental, which could reasonably be expected to affect the quality of his driving, why should not the same doctrine of varying standards apply? … Logically there can be no distinction. 

79        At the end of the day, the duty of care should be tailored not to the actor, but rather to the act which he or she elects to perform: per Mustill LJ in Wilsher v Essex Area Health Authority [1987] QB 730 at 750–751. Holding a trainee to the same standard as a qualified professional is also sound as a matter of policy. Here, the second appellant had plainly taken control of a vessel that was plying in open waters with heavy merchant traffic. She herself conceded that once she took the con of the Courageous, she was responsible for the lives and safety of the crew on board. I would only pause to add that once she was placed in the position of making navigational decisions for the vessel, she was also responsible for the lives and safety of the crew of other vessels in the vicinity as well. In the circumstances, she had to be held to the same standard as a reasonably competent and qualified OOW. This may seem harsh, but to subject her to a lower standard of care would unfairly place the safety of everyone else around her at risk.

The criminal context

80        I recognised that Nettleship v Weston dealt with civil negligence, and, as I had emphasised earlier when discussing the appropriate test for causation under s 304A, the distinction between civil and criminal liability ought to be maintained. Nonetheless, I took the view that the court’s decision in Nettleship v Weston ought to be adopted in the present appeal.

81        I laid down the definitive standard of care for criminal negligence in the case of Lim Poh Eng ([26] supra). In this case, the appellant was a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine who was charged under s 338 of the PC for causing grievous hurt to a patient who had visited his clinic for colonic washouts. The Prosecution alleged that the appellant had been criminally negligent in prescribing the colonic washouts without proper training in the procedure and use of equipment, and without any understanding of the risks and complications involved. One of the appellant’s arguments on appeal was that the standard of negligence in criminal cases should be higher than the civil standard.

82        After considering the case law and various policy concerns, I rejected the appellant’s contention and held that the standard of negligence required in criminal cases was the same as that in civil cases. This followed from the local High Court’s decisions in Woo Sing v R [1954] MLJ 200 and Mah Kah Yew v PP [1969–1971] SLR 441. I acknowledged the need to maintain a distinction between civil and criminal liability, but found that it was not strictly necessary to have a higher standard in criminal cases to maintain that distinction. Even without a different standard of negligence, there are still essential differences between a civil tort in negligence and a criminal offence involving negligence. The standards of proof are obviously different in the two scenarios. Also, as I had set out earlier, the causation test is stricter in the case of criminal negligence under s 304A.  

83        In Lim Poh Eng, the appellant had proposed an intermediate standard of negligence, lower than the standard of gross negligence for the common law offence of manslaughter but higher than the civil standard of negligence. I found such an intermediate standard to be too elusive a concept to be workable, and held that the standard of negligence in criminal cases should be the civil standard of negligence.  

84        It is therefore established that the criminal standard of negligence is the same as that in civil negligence. Nettleship v Weston was a case that dealt directly with the issue of standard of care. Since I took the view that Nettleship v Weston represented the correct approach to a trainee’s standard of care in civil negligence, it necessarily applied in the present criminal context. This flows strictly from my earlier decision in Lim Poh Eng.

85        I also noted that Lord Denning MR and Megaw LJ in Nettleship v Weston drew much support for their decision from the responsibility of a learner driver in criminal law. Lord Denning MR observed at 698:

In the criminal law it is no defence for a driver to say: “I was a learner driver under instruction. I was doing my best and could not help it.” Such a plea may go to mitigation of sentence, but it does not go in exculpation of guilt. The criminal law insists that every person driving a car must attain an objective standard measured by the standard of a skilled, experienced and careful driver.

86        The second appellant contended that the strict approach in Nettleship v Weston was inappropriate for a criminal charge because “the status of a trainee is itself diametrically opposed to the concept of mens rea … [as] a trainee is still be trained to know what is right and what is wrong.” With respect, I found counsel’s argument on this point difficult to follow. Presumably, he was suggesting that for criminal liability to attach in this case, the second appellant had to subjectively know that her actions were likely to cause death or injury.

87        In my opinion, this line of reasoning completely misses the point. Section 304A does not require proof of intention or knowledge. The relevant mens rea is rashness or negligence, which was defined by Holloway J in Re Nidamarti Nagabhushanam (1872) 7 MHC [Madras High Court] 119 at 120, and cited with approval by MPH Rubin JC (as he then was) in PP v Teo Poh Leng [1992] 1 SLR 15 at 16, [4]:

Culpable rashness is acting with the consciousness that the mischievous and illegal consequences may follow, but with the hope that they will not, and often with the belief that the actor has taken sufficient precaution to prevent their happening. The imputability arises from acting despite the consciousness (luxuria). Culpable negligence is acting without the consciousness that the illegal and mischievous effect will follow, but in circumstances which show that the actor has not exercised the caution incumbent upon him, and that if he had he would have had the consciousness. The imputability arises from the neglect of the civic duty of circumspection. [emphasis added]

88        It was therefore legally inaccurate for the second appellant to argue that s 304A requires an accused person to possess knowledge that his act was likely to cause death or injury. The correct approach is to consider whether a reasonable man in the same circumstances would have been aware of the likelihood of damage or injury to others resulting from such conduct: Adnan bin Khamis v PP [1972] 1 MLJ 274. The subjective knowledge of the second appellant was irrelevant, so long as a reasonably competent OOW would have known that the act was likely to cause death or injury. I had no doubt that a reasonable OOW in the same circumstances as the second appellant would have had such knowledge. The mens rea requirement of s 304A was therefore satisfied, and the second appellant could not succeed on this final ground of appeal.

Further implications

89        Counsel for the appellant sought to impress upon me that this decision would have wider implications on the training regime of the RSN. In particular, future trainee OOWs taking the con of vessels as part of their training programme would be held to the same standard as a qualified OOW. I recognised the potential ramifications of my finding. Yet, to my mind, there was no reason for these trainees to be held to a lower standard of care simply because allowing them to take control of naval vessels was part and parcel of the RSN’s training regime. I had to consider not just the welfare of such RSN trainees, but also the wider interests of other RSN personnel as well as the other vessels and their crews at sea. To demand any less from these trainees would unduly place the lives and property of other innocent parties at risk.        

Conclusion

90        For the reasons above, I dismissed both appeals against conviction. As neither party appealed against sentence, and I found the respective sentences imposed on the appellants to be entirely appropriate, I chose not to disturb the district judge’s orders on this matter.

Judgment reserved.





MPH Rubin J:

Background

1          The accused, Sundarti Supriyanto, is a 23-year-old female Indonesian working as a domestic maid in Singapore. She was tried before me on a charge of murder by causing the death of her female employer (“the deceased”), on 28 May 2002 between 8.00pm and 10.41pm at Block 165 Bukit Merah Central #06-3661/3663. At the end of the trial, I reserved my judgment. I have now come to the decision to convict the accused on a reduced charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. I give my reasons.

Facts

2          On 28 May 2002, at about 10.41pm, a fire was reported at Block 165 Bukit Merah Central. Officers from the Singapore Civil Defence Force (“SCDF”) and the police were immediately despatched to the scene.

Discovery of the bodies

3          SCDF Second Warrant Officer Jumahat bin Bakri (“WO2 Jumahat”), the officer-in-charge of Pump Ladder 012, arrived at the scene with his section at 10.49pm. He rushed up to the location of the fire with SCDF Lance Corporal Arif bin Amat (“LCP Arif”). WO2 Jumahat entered the unit to search for casualties. There, he observed that #06-3663 was connected internally to unit #06-3661. At the rear of unit #06-3661, WO2 Jumahat discovered the body of the deceased, lying motionless in a supine position on the floor in a corridor. With the assistance of LCP Arif, WO2 Jumahat carried the body of the deceased out to the common corridor. Two SCDF ambulance officers attended to the deceased, but failed to revive her; she was pronounced dead at 11.30pm.

4          At 11.33pm, SCDF first warrant officer Abdul Razak Senin (“WO1 Razak”), the officer-in-charge of Pump Ladder 011, arrived at the scene with his section. WO2 Jumahat briefed WO1 Razak on the situation, following which WO1 Razak entered the fire-affected units to assist in the search for other casualties. While searching the corridor towards the rear of unit #06-3661, he discovered a closed door leading to the toilet and kitchen. When he opened the door, he found the body of a girl, the deceased’s three-year-old daughter (“Crystal”), also lying motionless on the floor in a supine position. He immediately carried Crystal out of the unit, where a SCDF ambulance officer attended to her. Crystal was then conveyed to the Accident & Emergency Department of Alexandra Hospital. The medical staff at the hospital could not revive her, and she was pronounced dead on 29 May 2002 at about 12.20am.

Behaviour of the accused at the scene

5          Before the arrival of the officers, several members of public spotted the accused sitting along the common corridor outside units #06-3661/3663, with an infant boy (“the baby”) on her lap. The baby was later identified as the deceased’s 18-month-old son. According to eyewitnesses, both the accused and the baby appeared calm. The accused had also reportedly pointed to the direction of the said units uttering “Mum and daughter inside” and/or “Mama, Anak [child]”. One member of public then accompanied the accused and the baby down the block via the staircase.

6          At about 10.53pm Police Sergeant Suhaimi bin Md Kasim (“Sgt Suhaimi”) arrived at Block 165 Bukit Merah Central. He met the accused at the ground floor and proceeded to interview her. The accused identified herself to Sgt Suhaimi as “Sundarti”. Sgt Suhaimi observed that the accused appeared calm, but seemed to be in pain. Subsequently, the accused was conveyed to the A&E Department of Singapore General Hospital (“SGH”), where she was admitted for treatment on 29 May 2002 at about 12.23am.

The fire

7          A SCDF Fire Investigation Team conducted investigations into the cause of the fire, and drew up a report[1] of its findings. According to this report, the fire was most probably caused intentionally, through the introduction of a naked light to combustible materials around an office area within the units, with petrol being introduced to accelerate the fire. Annex G of the report showed that petrol was detected from the fire debris collected from the three points at the scene (points A1, C and D).

Injuries on the deceased’s body and the cause of her death

8          Senior Forensic Pathologist, Dr Gilbert Lau (“Dr Lau”), performed the autopsy on the deceased. In his autopsy report,[2] Dr Lau recorded that he found two stab wounds on the deceased’s neck. The first stab wound measured between 1.2cm and 1.4cm in length and the track proceeded downwards, towards the right and slightly backwards, ending at a depth of about 2cm. The second stab wound measured between 2cm and 2.2cm in length and the track proceeded downwards, towards the right and backwards. Dr Lau found that the second stab wound was the fatal injury, as it incised the right carotid sheath, the middle third of the right common carotid artery and terminated at an estimated depth of 6cm. This wound resulted in extensive, severe and acute haemorrhage.

9          Apart from the neck wounds, there was also a series of deep and gaping incised wounds across the deceased’s left forearm, as well as the wrist and hand. The deceased’s muscles, tendons, nerves and blood vessels were cut. There was a fracture of the left wrist joint and near dismemberment of the left hand at the wrist. There were also several incised wounds on the deceased’s right arm and right hand. Dr Lau found that the multiple incised wounds on the deceased’s arms were consistent with defensive injuries. Dr Lau also found that most of the defensive injuries on the deceased’s upper limbs were inflicted using a cutting instrument with a relatively heavy and sharp blade such as Exhibit P298 (a chopper) or a similar knife. In particular, Dr Lau testified that the injuries to the deceased’s forearms were caused by deliberate, downward blows directed at her head or neck with tremendous force.

10        Dr Lau testified that the deceased was already dead when the fire started, and he certified the cause of her death as acute haemorrhage due to the incised right common carotid artery caused by the second stab wound to the neck. Dr Lau opined that the track of this stab wound indicated that it was very unlikely that the fatal injury was self-inflicted. He also stated that a smaller knife (such as Exhibit P292) or a similar knife was likely to have been used to inflict the fatal injury.

Injuries on the accused

11        Dr Ong Lin Yin (“Dr Ong”) was the first doctor to examine the accused when the latter was admitted to the A&E Department at SGH. According to Dr Ong’s report,[3] the accused suffered four per cent burns over her right leg and right forearm and there were bite marks on her left back, left shoulder and left breast. No other injuries were observed on her. Dr Ong confirmed that the accused’s vital signs were stable and she was not in a state of shock. Dr Ong also testified that the accused was not very communicative.

12        Dr Goh Bee Tin (“Dr Goh”), a Senior Registrar of the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, National Dental Centre, attended to the accused on 29 May 2002 at about 1.15pm at Ward 43, SGH. She noted three bite marks on the accused’s body. The marks were at the lateral aspect of the accused’s left breast (“S1”), on her left shoulder (“S2”) and on the mid-portion of her back (“S3”). Dr Goh examined the dentition of the deceased, Crystal and the baby. She took dental impressions from them and compared them with S2 and S3. S1 was too indistinct to be identified.

13        Dr Goh concluded that there was a good match between Crystal’s dentition and S2 and S3. The deceased’s and the baby’s dentitions did not match the said bite marks. From the orientation of the bite marks, S2 was inflicted with the biter facing the accused with his/her face over the shoulder of the latter. S3 was inflicted on the left of the accused, with the biter’s face over the back of the accused. Dr Goh also noted that since the bite marks were at the phase of acute inflammation at the time when they were first examined on 29 May 2002 at 1.15pm, it was likely that they were inflicted within the last 72 hours. Although she could not rule out that the deceased might have inflicted S1, she testified that the dimensions of S1 were 30mm by 30mm, and these were quite small for an adult, whose dimensions generally ranged from 34mm to 37mm. Further, the dimensions of S1, S2 and S3 were fairly close to each other.

14        Dr Jasmine Heng (“Dr Heng”) testified that the Deoxyribonucleic Acid (“DNA”) evidence showed that the accused’s clothes comprising one pair of shorts, one T-shirt, one pair of panties and one brassiere were stained with blood that matched the DNA profile of the deceased. Additionally her T-shirt and shorts were also stained with the accused’s own blood. However, Dr Heng also gave evidence that DNA testing on the knives and chopper found at the scene was inconclusive.

Testimony of some prosecution witnesses

15        Hong Ngah San Esther (“Esther Hong”), the deceased’s staff member, testified that before lunchtime on 28 May 2002, the deceased called her through the intercom and told her to make sure that the accused did not leave the office. The deceased also told her that on a previous night, the accused had brought Crystal out of the bedroom without any reason. Further, Esther Hong, together with Low Siew Kuan Margaret (“Margaret Low”) and Ee Kim Lian Nancy (“Nancy Ee”), two other employees of the deceased, testified that at lunchtime, when they were having food at the reception area in the office, the deceased came to them and complained that the accused had eaten her son’s food. They added that the deceased had also scolded the accused in front of them.

16        Esther Hong and Margaret Low also testified that they met the deceased, the accused, the baby and Crystal at a handphone shop at Block 166 Bukit Merah Central. While she was there, Margaret Low offered some fruits (longan) to the baby. The deceased stopped her and said that her son was having a cough. Margaret Low then offered the fruit to the accused. However, the deceased stopped Margaret Low from doing so.

17        Ang Kim Wah Rose (“Rose Ang”), the cleaning lady, testified that the accused told her that she was hungry and had not eaten for a few days. Rose Ang gave the accused three biscuits and the accused consumed them. Rose Ang also mentioned that the deceased had a total of eight maids coming and going from her employ over a period of one year or so. Joseph Anthony Nathan Lefort (“Joseph Lefort”) testified that on 28 May 2002 at about 8.46pm, while he was in the toilet of Block 165 Bukit Merah Central #07-3661, he heard a lady calling out the words “jangan, jangan”. He stated that the voice sounded like a desperate plea for help, and that it was very distressful. Immediately after that, he heard a young child scream.

The accused’s statements to various people

18        When the accused was admitted to the A&E Department of SGH, she was attended to by nurses Bebe Zaiton bte Abdullah (“Nurse Bebe”) and Wong Martin alias Van Ah Kiong (“Nurse Martin”). She was asked about what had happened, whereupon she informed Nurse Martin that there was a fire, the lights went out and there was smoke.

19        Nurse Aidah Mohd Kassim (“Nurse Aidah”) attended to the accused at Ward 43, SGH on 29 May 2002 at about 12.40pm. Nurse Aidah asked the accused in Malay about what had happened. The accused informed Nurse Aidah that she was with her female employer and two children in the office at Bukit Merah at about 9.00pm. She claimed that 11 people came into the office wearing masks that covered their faces. The room then became dark and suddenly, a fire broke out. She also told Nurse Aidah that a woman caused the bites that were found on her body. The accused’s narration of events was recorded by one Chua Wee Lian.[4]

20        Assistant Superintendent of Police Michael Sim (“ASP Sim”) interviewed the accused in Malay in Ward 43, SGH on 29 May 2002 at about 2.00am. The accused gave him her name as Sundarti and told him that three female persons came into the Bukit Merah units, following which the lights went out and a fire started. She also claimed that another nine male persons entered the units as well. According to ASP Sim, the accused kept on repeating the words “three female persons came, the lights went out and fire started”.

21        Nurse Noor Ashikin bte Abdul Kahar (“Nurse Ashikin”) interviewed the accused in Ward 43, SGH on 29 May 2002 at about 7.30am. Nurse Ashikin spoke to the accused in a mixture of Bahasa Indonesia and Malay. The accused informed Nurse Ashikin that she was at the shop (the Bukit Merah units) when three women came in and switched off all the lights. The three women were wearing stockings as masks and one of them shouted “quiet” in English. When Nurse Ashikin asked the accused how she sustained the bite marks on her body, the accused replied that a woman had bitten her. Nurse Ashikin then asked the accused whether she fought back, to which the accused replied that she did.

22        Anita Foo interviewed the accused twice in Ward 43, SGH on 30 May and 6 June 2002. Anita Foo spoke to the accused in English and obtained some background information on the accused’s family. The accused told her that the assailants had carried and bitten her. They then placed her in a dark and smoky room. The accused claimed that she had dark and vague memories of the event, but was unable to recall the whole incident. The accused also informed Anita Foo that she had no problems and enjoyed her work with her current employer. The accused also allegedly informed her that she was hoping to go back to work after her discharge.

23        Apart from the statements given by the accused soon after the fire and at the hospital, there were 11 other statements made by her on or after 10 June 2002 to two police officers, namely, Assistant Superintendent of Police Ang Bee Chin (“ASP Ang”) and Inspector of Police Bahar Bakar (“Insp Bahar”). Two of these were verbal statements and the rest were written. The accused was formally arrested at 3.00pm on 10 June 2002. The Prosecution sought to admit seven of the accused’s statements during the conduct of the Prosecution’s case, and the Defence sought to admit four when the defence was given. Being satisfied that all the statements sought to be admitted in evidence were given by the accused voluntarily without any threat, inducement, promise or any form of oppression or coercion, the said statements were admitted in evidence. The statements contained both incriminating and exculpatory parts.

24        In brief, the accused claimed that on the night of 28 May 2002, she and the deceased had been involved in a fight, during which both women brandished knives. The accused then claimed that she did not cause the fatal injury to the deceased, as the deceased had inflicted the fatal injury on herself. Additionally, the accused insisted that the injuries on the deceased’s limbs were self-inflicted. Several portions of the accused’s cautioned statement[5] were significant. These portions are reproduced below:

Mom [the deceased] ill-treated me. At home, I was made to eat the 2 children’s faeces on 3 occasions. Whatever mom held she would throw at me. When I was holding a knife, mom would take it and throw it at me. When I was preparing milk, mom would take the milk and throw it at me. There was a vegetable container in the fridge at home. Sometimes, mom forgot to close the container but she would throw the container at me and told me to close it properly. Sometimes, mom also punished me by telling me to kneel down for 2 hours as punishment and at the same time, I had to pull my ears. These were when mom scolded me for cooking too much porridge for the baby or for [sic] the porridge was no tasty enough. If I did not pull my ears, mom would cut $10/= from my pay. If I did not clean up the faeces of the children in the office and mom thinks that I did not clean it thoroughly, mom would throw the wet tissue used to clean up the faeces at my face. In the office, the children urinated on the carpets with the words ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and so on. Sir would scold mom because there was urine smell in the office, which was air-conditioned. Mom would scold me for not cleaning up the carpets. I had already cleaned them but there was smell because mom did not allow me to use soap. There was no soap in the office. When the porridge fell on the baby’s clothes, I would take tissue to take out the porridge from the clothes but mom would scold me for wasting the tissue, asking me if the tissue belonged to me or my mother, that as if it was my own place. When mom’s daughter cried, Sir would scold mom and mom would beat the daughter and she would scold [me] for not knowing how to take care of the children. I could not bear to see mom use cane on her daughter. This is enough. I am pleading guilty to the offence. I am remorseful. I hope the Judge would take into consideration what I have said about mom and give me a fair sentence. There is more I want to say. There are 7 staff in the office and whatever Sir was not happy with the performance of the staff, he would show it to mom. Both of them would argue in the car on the way home and the daughter would be frighten and she would be crying. Sir would also tell mom the maid, meaning me, was not capable of looking after the children. There is one staff by the name of Esther. She likes to give foodstuff to the children. I did not tell mom about this. However, mom knew about this, mom scolded me for allowing Esther to give foodstuff to the children, saying that the children would fall sick. When the son got wind in the stomach, mom also blamed me. The son always fell sick and mom would blame me. I also felt pressurized because of what mom did to the previous maids. I am responsible for causing the office to be burnt. I am responsible for causing mom to die. I am responsible for causing mom’s daughter to die. I am angry with mom for pouring hot water on my hands and my left leg, mom also bit me and pulled my hair. Mom also threw telephones at me. Mom tried to kill me with a knife but the knife accidentally struck her daughter twice on the chest. The daughter bled badly. Mom took the knife as if she was in a trance and she was very fierce. I ran towards the kitchen. I took a knife and told mom to stop, otherwise I would use the knife on the son. When I took the knife, I also carried mom’s son. I told mom I would count until three and if she did not stop, I would kill her son. Mom was trying to strike me with her knife and I was trying to strike her with mine. Mom’s knife is a chopper and mine is a vegetable knife. Mom’s knife did not strike me and my knife did not strike mom. Mom’s knife cut mom on her own hand. Mom and I struggled in the toilet until the door broke. I managed to escape but mom pursued me. I told mom I was going to count until three and she must kill herself and if she did not, I would kill myself and her son. Before I escaped, mom actually took a kettle in the kitchen and splashed hot water at me. The hot water touched me and also mom. In fact, when I threatened mom that I would kill her son, I was chasing after her son and mom was chasing after me. Mom had some magical power, which nobody could win her. There is a playroom in the office. Mom entered the playroom. Mom poked a knife against her throat and her chest and she was bleeding. I then pulled mom and her daughter to the kitchen. I washed all the knives that had blood. There were 3 knives. I put my shorts that had blood in a pail and put soap and water. I also put my T-shirt in the oven to dry. I then went to mom’s office and took money, 2 cards, 2 handphones and went to buy petrol. I took a taxi to the nearby petrol kiosk. After obtaining the petrol, I returned to the office. I poured the petrol in the office at several locations. I lighted a flame. Then, I went to the playroom. The fire became big. I took mom’s son but as I did not have the strength, the baby managed to escape. The baby ran towards the door of the playroom. There was fire there. I saved the baby by carrying him and used a chair to break the glass door to come out of the unit. I sat outside the office. I had no strength as I was injured badly. Many people came and saved us. When I was in the hospital, the police took away my clothings. Inside my shorts, there were the money, 2 cards and 2 handphones.

25        These were the primary facts before me. At the close of the Prosecution’s case, there was no submission by the counsel for the accused. Having considered the evidence adduced by the Prosecution thus far, and having regard to the principles articulated in Haw Tua Tau v PP [1980–1981] SLR 73, I was satisfied that the Prosecution had made out a case against the accused which if left unrebutted would warrant her conviction. Consequently, the standard allocution was given to the accused, and the courses available were explained to her. The accused, in the event, elected to testify from the witness box.

The defence

26        The accused’s testimony follows.

27        The accused was the eldest in a family of three children. Her father passed away in September 2001. Thereafter, she joined a company in Jakarta where she was trained as a domestic maid, and was taught English, cooking and housekeeping. After her training, she was offered work in Singapore as a domestic maid for a Chinese family with three children. She took up the offer and arrived in Singapore in April 1999.

28        After a two-year stint in Singapore, she returned to Jakarta for further training. She returned to Singapore sometime in April 2002, where she met the deceased at an interview. After the interview, the deceased decided to employ the accused on a trial basis. The accused was brought to the deceased’s office premises in Bukit Merah. There, she noticed that the deceased had two other maids, referred to as Jami and Aminah. She discovered that she was supposed to replace Jami.

29        In her first two to three days in the employ of the deceased, the accused claimed that she saw the deceased abuse Aminah by pulling her hair, pinching and kicking her. On one occasion, the deceased threw Aminah out of the house, citing unsatisfactory work standards. The police was eventually called in to settle the matter. The next day, Aminah was sent back to her maid agency. The accused also claimed that the deceased abused Jami by slapping her and pushing her head.

30        In this respect, Jami’s evidence at trial matched the accused’s claim. Jami testified that she was unhappy working for the deceased, who had a tendency to scold, slap, poke and kick her when she made mistakes while working. Sometimes, the deceased would make Jami hold her ears and kneel as a form of punishment. After witnessing the manner in which Aminah and Jami were treated, the accused became frightened and asked the deceased to send her back to the agency. However, the deceased refused her request, telling her that she was new and could learn from Jami.

31        The accused then continued to work for the deceased. Her daily work routine revolved mainly around preparing food, and caring for the children at the deceased’s home and office premises in Bukit Merah. The accused’s meals usually consisted of leftovers from meals she was told to prepare at home for the deceased’s husband (“the husband”), or bread, when there was some at home. For breakfast, she would have one or two slices of bread, and nothing else. She used to have food to eat for lunch when Jami and Aminah were around, as the latter two maids would prepare lunch in the office premises.

32        However, when Jami and Aminah left the deceased’s employ, the accused did not eat anything at the office, save for some bread and snacks, which were offered to her by the deceased’s staff members at the Bukit Merah office, namely Ong Lay Hong Fiona (“Fiona Ong”), Esther Hong, Margaret Low or Nancy Ee. At times, the accused would help herself to some bread left in the office premises.

33        The deceased was reportedly unhappy whenever her staff gave the accused food, and expressed her displeasure to the accused. However, the accused still accepted the food offered to her because she needed to have something to eat. For dinner, the accused relied on the leftovers from dinners she cooked at home for the husband. However, when the husband went overseas, the deceased would forbid her from cooking. As a result, the accused would have to go without food. Three weeks before the incident on 28 May 2002, the deceased stopped the accused from cooking at home, thereby preventing her from receiving her rations of leftovers. The deceased’s reason for doing this was because she felt that the accused’s job performance was not up to mark.

34        The accused then claimed that on two occasions before 28 May 2002, the deceased had gotten frustrated with her and told her to eat the children’s faeces. The first occasion was a Sunday afternoon, when the accused told the deceased that she was hungry. The deceased responded by saying that if she was hungry, she should eat Crystal’s faeces. The second occasion took place in the husband’s room when he was not in Singapore. The accused had asked the deceased whether she should feed the children porridge. The deceased found the accused’s question foolish. She told the accused that if the children did not eat the porridge, the porridge would be thrown away, and if the accused wanted any food, she could just eat Crystal’s faeces. On both occasions, the deceased did not force the accused to eat the faeces. However, on the second occasion, the accused voluntarily ate the faeces to show the deceased that she would rather eat the faeces of the baby she loved, than the food provided by the insincere deceased.

35        On 26 May 2002, the husband left for Myanmar on business. The accused ate a slice of bread for breakfast. At about 1.30pm she left for the husband’s parents’ flat with the deceased and the children. The accused stated that the husband’s mother had cooked “bee hoon”, and the deceased gave the accused a bowl of “bee hoon” to feed the baby. The accused alleged that she was not given any food to eat when she was at the flat, although she was allowed a drink of warm water. Although she could have asked for a warm beverage, she did not make such a request because she felt shy to ask for food there. When they returned home, the deceased told the accused not to cook, as the husband was not at home. The accused did not prepare anything for herself, fearing a scolding from the deceased if she were spotted doing so. As such, the accused went to sleep without any food.

36        The accused claimed that on 27 May 2002, she did not have anything to eat, as there was no bread at home and the deceased had stopped her from cooking at home. She only had a drink of warm water and went to sleep at night after doing the laundry.

37        On 28 May 2002, the accused woke up at 5.30am and proceeded to do the household chores. At about 8.30am, she fed the baby porridge for breakfast, while the deceased fed Crystal. The accused did not have any porridge, as it contained pork. By this time, the accused was feeling extremely hungry, as the last time she had eaten any food was on the morning of 26 May 2002, when she had had the slice of bread. She then told the deceased that she was hungry, and the latter grudgingly gave her two packets of instant noodles. The accused tried to cook the instant noodles in a cooking pot, but was stopped by the deceased, and told to eat the noodles raw.

38        Nevertheless, the accused took out a plastic container, filled it with hot water and placed one packet of instant noodles in it, together with the sauces. She then sat on a chair in the kitchen and was about to eat the noodles when the deceased came in and told her not to sit on the chair. The accused stood up, and the deceased ordered her to eat the noodles in the toilet. The accused complied. She ate about two to three spoonfuls of noodles when the deceased called for her to leave for the office. Upon hearing the deceased, the accused left the plastic container with the noodles and the unopened packet of instant noodles in the toilet. These items were later recovered by the police in the course of their investigations in the same place and position as described by the accused.[6]

39        At about 11.30am, the accused and the deceased left for the office with the two children. At the office, the accused looked after the two children in a playroom within the office premises, while the deceased attended to her work. At about 2.30pm, the deceased entered the playroom and gave the accused a thermos flask containing noodles to feed the baby. The deceased fed Crystal. While the accused fed the baby, some of the noodles fell on his shirt. The accused used tissue paper to clean the baby’s shirt. The deceased noticed this and scolded the accused for using too much tissue paper, “as though it belonged to the accused’s parents”.

40        Subsequently, the baby urinated on the carpet. The deceased scolded him and used a cane to hit him. Following this, the deceased turned to the accused and hit her on the buttocks with the cane, alleging that she had eaten the baby’s food. The accused responded by telling the deceased that she had not eaten the baby’s food, but had only blown at the food to make it cooler before feeding the child. The accused was saddened and angered by the deceased’s actions. Esther Hong, Margaret Low and Nancy Ee, who were in the office premises at the time, heard the commotion in the playroom.

41        After the children were fed, the accused went to the kitchen to wash the dishes. While she was there, she met Rose Ang, the cleaning lady. The accused told Rose Ang that she was hungry and that the deceased had not given her food for three days. Rose Ang gave the accused three biscuits and the accused consumed them. At trial, Rose Ang, who was called as a witness for the Prosecution, substantially corroborated this aspect of the accused’s version of events.

42        The accused then prepared rice, porridge and soup for dinner. At about 6.00pm, the deceased brought the accused and the two children out of the office to run some errands. They were at a handphone shop when they met Esther Hong and Margaret Low, where Margaret Low offered some fresh fruits to the baby. The deceased stopped her, saying that the baby was coughing. Margaret Low then offered the fruits to the accused, but the deceased stopped her saying, “Don’t give her”. The accused testified that she felt slighted and disappointed when the deceased stopped Margaret Low.

43        The deceased, the accused and the two children then went back to the office. In the office, the deceased spoke to Fiona Ong for some time and then went to the kitchen to get the food ready for the two children. At about 8.00pm, Fiona Ong left the office. Around that time, the deceased and the accused were feeding the two children in the playroom. The accused fed the baby while the deceased fed Crystal. Both women had difficulty in feeding the children, as the children kept moving about. The deceased got impatient and began to scold the accused, claiming that she had come to the office only to sit and eat and did not take proper care of the children.

44        The deceased then took a melamine feeding-spoon and poked it in the ear of the accused. The accused felt pain, although she did not bleed. The accused also testified that this was not the first time the deceased had used a spoon to poke her ear, claiming that the deceased had done the same thing on one other occasion at home. Around this time, the baby had to pass motion. The accused took a pink-coloured potty for the baby to use.

45        After the baby had finished, the accused used a wet tissue to clean him. While she was cleaning the baby, the deceased began to scold her for being too slow and not cleaning the baby properly. The deceased then snatched the soiled wet tissue from the accused and threw it at her face. The soiled tissue hit the left side of the accused’s face and left traces of faeces behind. The accused felt like vomiting and was angry.

46        The accused then took another wet tissue to clean the baby. The deceased snatched the second soiled tissue and threw it at the accused’s face again. The tissue hit the accused’s nose and bits of faeces were left behind. The accused continued to try to clean the baby with another wet tissue. However, for the third time, the deceased grabbed the wet tissue and threw it at the accused’s face. The accused then picked up the three tissues and placed them into the potty. She felt nauseous and told the deceased that she wanted to drink some water, as she was feeling hungry. The deceased told her to continue feeding the baby. The accused then told the deceased a few more times that she was very hungry and wished to go to the kitchen to have a drink. The deceased told the accused to eat the baby’s faeces if she was very hungry. The accused felt insulted and angry by the deceased’s words.

47        The accused then took a spoonful of faeces from the potty and put them in her mouth. The accused’s intention was to show the deceased that she preferred eating the faeces of the baby she loved, rather than to eat the food provided by the deceased. After she ate the faeces, the accused threw the spoon onto the floor and brought the potty to the toilet. She washed her face and went into the kitchen to get a drink of water. While in the kitchen, the accused thought about the way she had been treated by the deceased thus far, and her anger intensified.

48        While drinking the water, the accused did not realise that the deceased was standing behind her. The deceased pulled the accused by the back of her shirt-collar and dragged her into the playroom. The accused fell and sat on the floor. The deceased then told the accused to finish feeding the baby. While the accused was feeding the baby, the child grabbed a computer mouse and played with it. The deceased took the mouse away from him, and the baby started to cry. This annoyed the deceased and she scolded and caned the child.

49        The deceased then told the accused to pack up to leave for home. While packing up and changing the children, the accused asked the deceased whether she wanted Crystal to be dressed in her pyjamas. This question annoyed the deceased further. She pulled a red backpack which the accused was holding, causing her to fall backwards onto Crystal, who was behind her. Crystal started to cry and the deceased attempted to pacify the child.

50        Then the baby took the computer mouse again. The accused took the computer mouse away from him and he began to cry. The accused then tried to give the computer mouse back to the baby to stop him from crying, but the deceased snatched it from her hands, causing the accused to lose her balance and fall on the baby. The deceased then threw the computer mouse at the accused, but missed her.

51        The accused became disturbed by this, stood up and told the deceased, “Ma’am why you do to me everyday like that, I very pain”. The deceased reacted by scolding the accused and used her fingers to scratch the accused’s face. Although the deceased’s fingernails did not leave scratches on the accused’s face, the accused felt pain and became angry. She pulled at the deceased’s dress, and both women began to wrestle with each other.

52        The accused tried to punch the deceased several times, but the deceased managed to ward off the blows. The accused then grabbed a cable under a table to tie the deceased’s hands, but did not succeed. The accused ran to the kitchen to look for something to tie the deceased’s hands. While in the toilet, the accused found a rope and returned with it to the playroom. She tried to tie the deceased’s hands again, to stop the deceased from fighting. However, she failed and the two women ended up wrestling again. The accused then pressed the rope against the deceased’s neck, choking her. At that time, the accused was furious at the treatment she had received all along. She testified that the thought of the treatment made her “blood rise”.

53        The deceased had become limp by this time. The accused then threw the rope away and went towards the two crying children to pacify them. She hugged the two children, with Crystal on her left. While the accused was hugging them, Crystal pushed the accused away. According to the accused, Crystal could have bitten her on the left shoulder, but she did not feel any pain. She was, however, unsure of whether Crystal had indeed bitten her. At this point, the deceased got up suddenly and kicked the accused from behind. The two women started to wrestle with each other again. The deceased pulled the accused’s hair and banged her head against the wall. They continued to wrestle. The accused then pushed the deceased away and managed to break free. She ran towards the kitchen to look for something to fight the deceased with. The deceased followed the accused into the kitchen and pushed her, causing the accused to lose her balance.

54        The deceased grabbed a kettle and attempted to throw it at the accused. The accused kicked the deceased’s leg, causing the deceased to fall into the toilet together with the kettle. As a result, hot water from the kettle spilled onto the accused’s left hand and leg. They then wrestled in the toilet. In the process, the toilet door was dislodged and fell on the accused.

55        The accused managed to break free from the deceased again and ran towards the glass door of unit #06-3663. As she was running away, she noticed that the deceased was chasing her with a small knife. The accused reached the glass door but was unable to open it. The deceased stood about two feet away from the accused and tried to stab her. The accused shouted “jangan, jangan” (meaning “stop, stop” in Bahasa Indonesia), dodged the stabs and ran back to the playroom.

56        When the accused entered the playroom, she spotted the baby and Crystal. She carried Crystal on her left and the baby on her right, intending to use them as human shields to prevent the deceased’s stabs. The accused claimed that the deceased continued to attack her with the knife, despite the fact that her two children were being used as shields. The accused became exhausted and dropped the baby on the floor, while continuing to carry Crystal.

57        She then held Crystal in front of her and shifted from left to right to avoid the deceased’s stabs. In the process, the knife the deceased was holding came into contact with Crystal’s left chest once. Despite this, the deceased allegedly continued trying to stab the accused. The accused managed to back out of the playroom and while she was near the playroom door, she dropped Crystal onto the floor and ran to the kitchen to find something to fight the deceased with.

58        In the kitchen, the accused took a knife[7] and ran back to the playroom with it. In the common office area outside the playroom, the accused saw the deceased running towards her. She side-stepped the deceased, whereupon the deceased ran into the kitchen and emerged carrying two knives in both her hands, a small one[8] in her left hand and a big knife[9] in her right. Both women then fought at different spots in the office. The deceased failed to stab the accused, hitting a computer and table in the office area instead.

59        The accused claimed that the deceased hit her own left hand with the big knife about three to four times. The accused was unsure whether the knife she was holding hit the deceased, although she conceded that the knife she was holding could have touched the deceased when they were fighting in the kitchen. The accused was not injured. The accused then ran to the office common area and picked up the baby. The deceased followed her. The accused held the baby and placed a knife at his neck. She then told the deceased that she would kill the child unless the deceased cut her hand. Subsequently, the deceased allegedly entered the playroom while the accused remained in the office common area. The accused repeated her threats to the deceased. The deceased then sat down and started to “slice” her left hand with the big knife, in a cutting and chopping motion.

60        The accused claimed that the deceased got up and with both knives in both hands, went after the accused again. When the deceased reached Margaret Low’s desk, she dropped the big knife and threw books, stationery and telephones at the accused using her right hand. The accused then told the deceased to kill herself, failing which she would kill the baby and subsequently commit suicide. There was a stand-off for about one to two minutes before the deceased went back to the playroom, holding the small knife in her right hand. The accused remained in the office common area holding the baby and pointing the knife at his neck.

61        After the deceased entered the playroom, the accused heard her saying, “I die”. There were no more sounds thereafter. The accused then waited a while and entered the playroom. She discovered the deceased lying on the floor of the playroom, with her right hand holding the small knife, which was in turn embedded in the right side of her neck. There was blood flowing from her neck, arms and other parts of her body.

62        She approached the deceased’s body and used her right leg to check if the deceased was still alive. There was no response from the deceased. She then withdrew the knife from the deceased’s neck, collected all three knives and the deceased’s watch, and brought all the items to the toilet, where she washed them. She claimed that the knives were not washed properly. She applied some toothpaste on her arms and legs, as they had been scalded earlier by the hot water from the kettle.

63        The accused then pulled the deceased into the kitchen and left the body there. She took Crystal and placed her on the deceased’s body. She did not know whether Crystal was still alive at that time. She also did not call for an ambulance for Crystal, as she claimed she did not know the number of the hospital. She testified that she was in a confused state at that time and did not know what to do. After moving the bodies, she went into the playroom and decided to get rid of the blood with fire. She claimed that she recalled that one could remove blood with fire, as she had seen this being done on television.

64        She then opened the deceased’s room using a set of keys found in the playroom. She took the contents of the deceased’s wallet (which included US$355 and about S$100) and other valuables from the room. The accused stated that she intended to buy petrol to burn the office. However, she noticed that there was blood on her shirt. She washed her shirt and dried it in the microwave oven before going out of the office. She also found and cleaned a container to keep the petrol in.

65        The accused then left the baby in the office and carried the container with her to buy petrol. She took a taxi to the petrol station and gave the taxi driver, one Haron bin Hashim (“Haron”), a $50 note taken from the deceased’s wallet, requesting him to buy some petrol for her. He obliged. She then asked Haron to send her back to Block 165 Bukit Merah Central. After disembarking from the taxi, the accused claimed she spotted a Chinese woman sitting at the taxi stand smoking a cigarette. She approached the woman and bought two disposable lighters from her, one of which was orange in colour[10] and the other, blue.[11]

66        She then returned to the office through the door of unit #06-3663 and spotted the baby near the glass door. She poured the petrol on the tables used by Fiona Ong, Nancy Ee and Margaret Low and on the metal cabinet. She went into the deceased’s room and the playroom and poured some petrol in these areas. She then went into the playroom and sat on the floor. She ignited the orange coloured disposable lighter and started the fire. The fire began to spread. She placed the baby beside her and lay on the floor with him. According to the accused, she wanted to die because she could not go back to Indonesia or approach anyone for help. She also claimed that she thought of killing herself, as she assumed she would be arrested and sentenced to death.

67        Then, the baby got up and walked towards the fire. The child’s hand and hair caught fire. When the accused noticed this, she quickly got up, grabbed the child and used her hands to put out the fire on him. She tucked him under her shirt and rolled on the floor until she reached the glass door entrance adjoining the two units. While rolling, her lower right hand and part of her right thigh and calf caught fire. She got up and carried the baby to Esther Hong’s table. There, she took a chair and broke a glass panel on the door to give the baby some fresh air. By then, the fire had gotten fiercer. The accused walked back to the fire, as she wanted to die. However, she returned to the baby after hearing him cry out for her, and carried him out of the office. The accused then sat along the corridor with the baby on her lap.

68        By this time, a crowd had gathered along the corridor. The accused recalled people talking to her, whereupon she informed them that the deceased and Crystal were still inside. She then told a Chinese man in the crowd that she wanted to go to the hospital because she and the baby were burnt. The man then followed the accused and the baby to the void deck. The accused claimed that she could not recall if she met a police officer (Sgt Suhaimi) at the void deck.

69        She was then conveyed to SGH, where Nurse Bebe and Nurse Martin attended to her. She recalled Nurse Martin asking her some questions, to which she responded that there was a fire, the lights went off and there was smoke. She was then given an injection that made her dizzy and heavy headed. She was having a headache, felt sleepy and was not aware of the things that were taking place around her.

70        She claimed that when she was at the hospital, she did not think of anything because she was putting up with the pain that she was under. She was also scared that the deceased’s and Crystal’s faces would haunt her, although she did not feel responsible for their deaths. The accused then recalled meeting various hospital staff and police personnel, to whom she narrated her initial version of events, as set out earlier. She was extensively questioned on her statements given to the police. She changed and chopped her stories and there were substantial retractions on her part.

Closing arguments for the Defence

71        The Defence relied on the accused’s testimony and argued that she was not guilty of the offence of murder, as she had not stabbed the deceased, the deceased having killed herself. The Defence also contended that three exceptions to the offence of murder were available to the accused. These were the exceptions of provocation (Exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 1985 Rev Ed) (“PC”)), private defence (Exception 2 to s 300 PC) and sudden fight (Exception 4 to s 300 PC). The latter argument was made as an alternative, in the event that I was to find that the fatal wound was indeed caused by the accused.

Exception 1 – Provocation

72        The Defence argued that culpable homicide was not murder if the offender, while deprived of his or her self-control by grave and sudden provocation, caused the death of the person who offered the provocation. In this case, the Defence claimed that the provocation emanated from the deceased. Counsel argued that on 28 May 2002, the deceased had acted unreasonably, and in a humiliating and insulting manner towards the accused. The accused was angered by this treatment and was therefore provoked into causing the death of the deceased.

73        The Defence then detailed the deceased’s alleged acts which constituted the grave and sudden provocation. I reproduce this aspect of the Defence’s submissions:[12]

1. depriving her of her food by not providing food since her last breakfast on 26th May 2002;

2. not allowing her to cook food for her[self] to eat on 26th & 27th May 2002;

3. not allowing her to sit on the chair to eat in the morning;

4. asking her to eat the Maggi mee raw;

5. asking her to eat in the toilet;

6. not allowing her to finish eating the 2 packets of Maggi mee;

7. using the cane and hit [sic] on her buttocks;

8. scolding and accusing her of eating Baby’s food in the office;

9. preventing Margaret (PW37) from even giving some fruits to the Accused;

10. poking the spoon into her ears;

11. slapping and throwing the soiled tissues on [her] face;

12. refusing the Accused [sic] to drink water to relieve her hunger;

13. asking the Accused to eat Baby’s faeces in the potty;

14. dragging her by the neck of her T-shirt from the kitchen to the playroom;

15. pulling the red backpack from the Accused causing her to fall backwards on Mei Mei [Crystal];

16. pulling the computer mouse from the Accused causing her to fall on Baby;

17. throwing the computer mouse at the Accused;

18. scratching the Accused[’s] face with her fingers.

74        Additionally, defence counsel argued that the accused had been feeling angry at the manner in which the deceased was treating her since she commenced work. In this respect, the accused claimed that she was subject to much abuse over a period of time prior to 28 May 2002. As such, on the fateful day, after having been subject to all of the above ill-treatment, abuse and humiliation, the accused claimed that she was in a state of anger.

75        The accused also alleged that the deceased had pulled her by the back of her collar and dragged her, thereby causing her to feel incensed. The accused added that the acts of provocation did not end there, but continued when the deceased pulled a red backpack and a computer mouse that the accused was holding, causing her to fall. The accused then confronted the deceased, whereupon the deceased scratched the accused’s face.

76        It was further submitted by defence counsel that it was this last act of the deceased that was the proverbial straw that broke the camel’s back. The accused then lost her self-control and pulled at the deceased’s dress, leading to the fight and subsequently, the deceased’s death. The Defence tried to distinguish the facts in the cases of Ithinin bin Kamari v PP [1993] 2 SLR 245 and Lau Lee Peng v PP [2000] 2 SLR 628 from the present case. Counsel submitted that in these two cases, the acts of provocation were minor or did not stretch for a period of time, whereas in the present case, there was a series of grave acts of ill-treatment, abuse and humiliation, all of which constituted the grave and sudden provocation emanating from the deceased towards the accused, and caused the accused to lose her self-control.

Exception 2 – Right of private defence

77        Defence counsel next argued that when a person exercises his right of private defence of person or property against someone, and thereby causes the death of that person without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for such private defence, his act of causing the other person’s death is not murder, but culpable homicide.

78        Defence counsel relied on the Court of Appeal decision of Soosay v PP [1993] 3 SLR 272 to argue that for this exception to apply, the accused only had to prove on a balance of probabilities that:

(a)        the right of private defence has arisen;

(b)        the right was exercised in good faith;

(c)        the death was caused without premeditation; and

(d)        the death was caused without any intention of doing more harm than was necessary for the purpose of such defence.

79        Counsel then submitted that the deceased had confronted the accused with a small knife in her hand, and had chased her to the glass door of unit #06-3663. Counsel submitted that, as in Soosay v PP, the accused’s right of private defence arose when this incident occurred. Additionally, counsel argued that the threat from the deceased continued when the deceased attacked the accused with a chopper and a knife as well. The accused then responded by fighting back. Counsel argued that in both instances, the accused was in imminent danger of harm, if not death.

80        Counsel thus submitted that at all times, the accused’s act of arming herself with a knife to act against the deceased was for the protection of her own life, and was not for the sake of gaining an undue advantage over the deceased. If not for the accused’s exercise of her right to private defence, she would have been hurt or even killed by the deceased. As such, counsel argued that, given the circumstances, the accused was entitled to exercise her right of private defence.

Exception 4 – Sudden fight

81        Finally, the Defence relied on Exception 4 to s 300 PC, which states that culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. Counsel relied on the Court of Appeal decision in Tan Chun Seng v PP [2003] 2 SLR 506, where it was held that there are three main ingredients in the defence of sudden fight, namely:

(a)        a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel;

(b)        the absence of premeditation; and

(c)        no undue advantage or cruel or unusual acts involved.

82        Counsel evidently relied on the accused’s testimony pertaining to the events of 28 May 2002 to submit that the fight between the accused and the deceased, which led to the death of the deceased, was not planned by the accused at an earlier date, but was one which erupted unexpectedly when the deceased scratched the accused’s face. Additionally, counsel submitted that the accused was unarmed at the time the fight started and that it was the deceased who first armed herself with a knife and chased the accused. Counsel also argued that the accused did not gain any undue advantage over the deceased, as it was the deceased who was the aggressor at all times.

83        Further, although the accused may have been a little bigger than the deceased, defence counsel submitted that she never used her slight advantage in size or height to start the fight and overwhelm the deceased. Counsel therefore argued that the three main ingredients in the defence of sudden fight had been satisfied and, as such, Exception 4 to s 300 PC should apply in this case. Defence counsel further submitted that since the Defence had raised the foregoing issues, it remained for the Prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Prosecution’s response to the Defence’s contentions

84        The Prosecution tackled the Defence’s contentions on three levels. First, the Prosecution submitted that the objective facts of the case proved that the accused was guilty of murdering the deceased. Second, it was submitted that the accused was not a credible witness and that her testimony in court was entirely unbelievable. Third, the Prosecution attempted to show why each of the three exceptions to s 300 PC, as raised by the Defence, did not apply in this case.

The Prosecution’s arguments on the accused’s guilt

85        The Prosecution charged the accused under s 300(c) PC. I reproduce the relevant section below:

Except in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

86        The Prosecution relied on the case of Tan Cheow Bock v PP [1991] SLR 293, where the then Court of Criminal Appeal cited the judgment of Bose J in Virsa Singh v State of Punjab AIR (45) 1958 SC 465. The Prosecution submitted that in order for s 300(c) PC to be made out, it had to prove the following beyond a reasonable doubt:

(a)        that a bodily injury was present;

(b)        the nature of the bodily injury;

(c)        that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of bodily injury was intended; and

(d)        that bodily injury inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

For convenience, I shall term the above “the test in Virsa Singh”.

87        The Prosecution reiterated that Dr Lau’s evidence clearly showed that the injuries suffered by the deceased were not suicidal, as suggested by the accused, but homicidal. Therefore, the Prosecution submitted that limbs (a), (b) and (d) of the test in Virsa Singh had been established. The Prosecution was then left to prove limb (c) of the test in Virsa Singh, that is, whether the accused had intended to inflict that particular bodily injury on the deceased. The Prosecution referred to the cases of Ang Sunny v PP [1965–1968] SLR 67, Shepherd v R (1990) 97 ALR 161 and PP v Oh Laye Koh [1994] SGHC 129, submitting that these cases represented the law on circumstantial evidence in Singapore. I reproduce a portion of the judgment in Shepherd v R (per Mason CJ at 165), which is a succinct statement on this aspect of the law of evidence:

As I have said, the prosecution bears the burden of proving all the elements of the crime beyond reasonable doubt. That means that the essential ingredients of each element must be so proved. It does not mean that every fact – every piece of evidence – relied upon to prove an element by inference must itself be proved beyond reasonable doubt. … Indeed, the probative force of a mass of evidence may be cumulative, making it pointless to consider the degree of probability of each item of evidence separately.

88        The Prosecution then highlighted the following series of what it termed objective facts, that had been proved by the evidence of witnesses other than the accused:

(i)         On 28 May 2002, the deceased, her two children and the accused arrived at the office at Bukit Merah Central at about noon.

(ii)        Throughout the day, the accused was looking after the two children in the office.

(iii)       The deceased and accused fed the children lunch.

(iv)       During lunchtime, the deceased complained to her staff that the accused had eaten her son’s food.

(v)        The deceased scolded the accused in front of the staff.

(vi)       At about 5pm, the deceased left the office with the two children and the accused to do some errands.

(vii)      The deceased purchased a new hand-phone at about 6.25pm.

(viii)      They returned to the office at about 7pm with groceries and the new handphone.

(ix)       At about 8pm, Fiona Ong (PW21) left the office and locked the main door, leaving behind the deceased, her two children and the accused. The deceased and the accused were feeding the two children in the playroom.

(x)        At about 8.43pm, a “999” silent call was made from the office.

(xi)       At about 8.46pm, Anthony [Joseph] Lefort (PW35) heard someone shouting “Jangan, jangan” followed by the scream of a young girl.

(xii)      At about 10pm, the accused boarded the taxi of Haron (PW28).

(xiii)      At about 10.08pm, Haron helped the accused to purchase petrol at a Caltex Petrol Station along Jalan Bukit Merah.

(xiv)     At about 10.41pm, the fire was reported to the police.

(xv)      Sometime past 10.30pm, members of the public arrived at the scene and they saw the accused sitting along the corridor outside the office unit with [the baby] on her lap.

(xvi)     At about 10.49pm, the first firemen arrived at the scene.

(xvii)     The deceased and Crystal’s bodies were recovered from the burning premises. They had died before the fire started.

(xviii)    The deceased suffered numerous defensive injuries on her left and right arms as well as her hands. She also sustained two stab wounds, one of them fatal, on her neck.

(xix)     The defensive injuries and the stab wounds found on the deceased were likely to have been inflicted by the knives found in the office premises.

(xx)      The defensive injuries were caused before the stab wounds to the neck.

(xxi)     Crystal suffered a single stab wound to her chest.

(xxii)    The accused lied to the nurses at SGH, ASP Sim (PW49) and Anita Foo (PW36) about the incident.

(xxiii)    The accused suffered 3 bite marks, two of them caused by Crystal, and the other could have been caused by Crystal.

(xxiv)    The accused sustained burns on her right leg and hand.

(xxv)    The accused did not sustain any other injury.

(xxvi)    The accused’s T-shirt, white shorts, bra and panties were stained with the deceased’s blood.

During the course of its final submissions, the Prosecution deleted the words shown in italics in items (xix), (xx), (xxii) and (xxiii).

89        The Prosecution then contended that the circumstantial evidence in this case was compelling against the accused, and as the fatal stab wound was homicidal and not suicidal, the only logical inference was that the accused had stabbed the deceased in the neck. The Prosecution relied on the principle in Ang Sunny v PP ([87] supra) and submitted that the cumulative effect of all the evidence led to the irresistible inference that the accused intentionally attacked the deceased and inflicted the injuries to the deceased’s arms and hands and further, she intentionally inflicted the two stab wounds on the deceased’s neck. One of these stab wounds to the neck was then sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, thereby coming under s 300(c) PC.

The Prosecution’s arguments on the veracity of the accused’s evidence

90        The Prosecution next submitted that from the evidence, it was clear that the accused had given two versions of the events of 28 May 2002 and/or including the events leading up to 28 May 2002: the first was her version to the people at SGH and the second, that gleaned from her statements to ASP Ang and Insp Bahar, and her testimony in court. The Prosecution contended that the fact that there were two differing versions of events spoke volumes about the accused’s veracity, or lack of it. Additionally, the Prosecution argued that the accused’s second version of events was riddled with lies and inconsistencies.

91        The Prosecution argued that the accused had repeatedly lied in court and that her evidence in the oral and written statements she had provided out of court were filled with lies and material inconsistencies. The Prosecution submitted that the lies told by the accused out of court, in her statements, corroborated her guilt. The Prosecution relied on the case of R v Lucas [1981] QB 720 in support of this proposition. I reproduce the relevant portion of the judgment in R v Lucas, where the court (at 724) enunciated a four-fold test in determining whether the lies of an accused could amount to corroboration of that accused’s guilt:

To be capable of amounting to corroboration the lie told out of court must first of all be deliberate. Secondly, it must relate to a material issue. Thirdly, the motive for the lie must be a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth. The jury should in appropriate cases be reminded that people sometimes lie, for example, in an attempt to bolster up a just cause, or out of shame or out of a wish to conceal disgraceful behaviour from their family. Fourthly the statement must be clearly shown to be a lie by evidence other than that of the accomplice who is to be corroborated, that is to say by admission or by evidence from an independent witness.

92        The Prosecution highlighted that this four-fold test was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal in PP v Yeo Choon Poh [1994] 2 SLR 867. The Prosecution then highlighted what it alleged were crucial lies made by the accused. I reproduce the Prosecution’s submissions as follows:

In Exhibits P209, P211, P213 and even in Court, the accused lied that the deceased had cut her hands and stabbed herself twice in the neck. This is in contrast to the expert evidence by Dr Lau (PW23), who opined that the first deceased’s injuries were homicidal and not likely to be self-inflicted.

In Exhibit P212, the accused lied that the deceased had bit her on her left shoulder blade and left chest. Dr Goh found three bite marks on the accused and opined that two of the bit marks matched Crystal’s dentition and not the deceased (S2 and S3).

In Exhibits P209 and P211, the accused lied that the deceased had splashed hot water on her. In Exhibit P212, the accused claimed that she knocked over the flask causing hot water to fall on her lower hand and lower leg. However, the medical evidence shows that the accused did not suffer any scalding injuries.

In Exhibit P212, the accused lied that the deceased had scratched her face. Furthermore, in her evidence in court, the accused lied that the deceased had poked her ear with a spoon, thrown soiled tissues at her and thrown a computer mouse at her. She also lied that she sustained several injuries during the fight with the deceased. Despite this, the medical evidence shows that no injuries were found on the accused apart from the burn wounds on her arm and leg, and the 3 bite marks.

The accused lied to ASP Sim (PW49) that three female persons and nine male persons had entered the office and the fire started. The accused also lied to Nurse Aidah (PW48) and Nurse Ashikin (PW43) that three women came into the office and switched off all the lights. The accused alleged to Nurse Ashikin that the three women were wearing stockings over their faces and one of them shouted at her to keep quiet as the baby was crying. The evidence shows that there were no signs of forced entry into the office and no other person was involved in the incident. Further, it was the accused who had poured the petrol and set off the fire in the office.

The accused lied in her police statements and in Court that the deceased had stabbed her daughter.

The accused lied to Haron (PW28) about the reasons for wanting to buy petrol.

93        The Prosecution submitted that the accused’s alleged lies in her statements could not be cursorily dismissed as mistakes made out of confusion or fear. The Prosecution argued that the various witnesses who came into contact with the accused were struck by her calmness and lack of emotion. Moreover, Exhibit P208 was written by the accused herself. The Prosecution argued that the length and details to which the accused narrated the events showed that she was able to give a full account of what had happened. The number of lies in her statements only served to show that the accused was trying to cover up her lies with even more lies.

94        The Prosecution therefore submitted that these lies were deliberately made up by the accused. The Prosecution also argued that the lies obviously related to material issues, since a large number of them pertained to the circumstances surrounding the deceased’s death. As the lies went directly to exculpate the accused, they were clearly motivated out of guilt and a fear of the truth. Further, the Prosecution contended that a number of independent witnesses had provided evidence to show that the various statements made by the accused amounted to lies. As such, the Prosecution argued that the test in R v Lucas was satisfied, and that the accused’s lies not only went towards her credibility, but were also evidence corroborative of her guilt.

The Prosecution’s arguments on the exceptions to s 300 PC

95        Lastly, the Prosecution argued that the burden was on the Defence to prove that the exceptions to s 300 PC applied in this case: Mohamed Kunjo v PP [1975–1977] SLR 75; Somwang Phatthanasaeng v PP [1992] 1 SLR 850. The Prosecution then argued that the Defence would not be able to discharge this burden, since the accused’s position from the outset was that she did not kill the deceased and that the deceased had killed herself.

96        As such, the Prosecution submitted that the moment the Defence failed to show that the accused did not kill the deceased, the accused ought to be convicted as charged, with no room for the application of the exceptions. However, for the sake of completeness, the Prosecution did make submissions pertaining to whether the exceptions to murder applied in this case.

Exception 1: Provocation

97        The Prosecution submitted that two requirements must be met before the defence of grave and sudden provocation can be raised successfully. In support of this proposition of law, the Prosecution cited the cases of PP v Kwan Cin Cheng [1998] 2 SLR 345, Lau Lee Peng v PP ([76] supra) and Seah Kok Meng v PP [2001] 3 SLR 135. First, there is a subjective requirement that the accused must have been deprived of her self-control by the provocation. Second, there is an objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and sudden”, which incorporates the application of the “reasonable man” test. This latter test involves considering whether an ordinary person of the same gender and age as the accused, sharing such of his/her characteristics as would affect the gravity of the provocation, and placed in the same situation as the accused, would have been so provoked as to lose her self-control. Individual peculiarities which merely affect the accused’s power of self-control but not the gravity of the provocation should not be taken into account: Ithinin bin Kamari v PP ([76] supra).

98        A further relevant consideration to the second requirement would be the test of proportionality. I reproduce a part of the judgment in PP v Kwan Cin Cheng, where the court (at [69]) described this requirement in succinct terms:

However, in our view, a “proportionality” criterion would be more accurately expressed in the following terms: in deciding if an accused had exercised sufficient self-control for the objective test, a relevant question may be whether the degree of loss of self-control was commensurate with the severity of the provocation.

99        The Prosecution made submissions on the first issue of whether the accused was deprived of her self-control. This was the subjective requirement. It was argued that in ascertaining this, the accused’s behaviour during the material time would be of great evidential value. The Prosecution raised the case of Lim Chin Chong v PP [1998] 2 SLR 794 in support of this argument. There, the Court of Appeal held that the appellant in question did not lose his self-control. Instead, the appellant “went about killing the deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way”, which was an indication that the murderous acts “were not the acts of a man who has lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They were calculated and premeditated acts”.

100      The Prosecution relied on the judgment of the court in Lim Chin Chong v PP and drew parallels to the present case. It was submitted that no evidence was adduced to show that the accused was in fact deprived of her self-control when she killed the deceased. The Prosecution argued that the accused’s version of events had always related to how she was reacting to the deceased’s alleged aggressive behaviour. Based on the accused’s own version of events, she was seen to have had the presence of mind to use the children as human shields and to run to the kitchen in search of a knife to defend herself with. From this, the Prosecution argued that it was clear that the image of the accused was not one of an enraged killer who had lost her self-control, but one very much in control of her mental faculties.

101      Additionally, the Prosecution argued that the behaviour of the accused following the commission of the offence should be taken into account in considering if there was a deprivation of self-control: Lau Lee Peng v PP ([76] supra). The Prosecution submitted that in this case, it could not be inferred that the accused had lost her self-control, as she had shown great composure and acumen in moving the bodies, washing the knives, ensuring that her clothes were clean of bloodstains, applying Colgate to her scalds, taking a taxi to purchase the petrol and eventually setting the office on fire. Further, witnesses, including the taxi driver (Haron), had observed that the accused seemed calm and composed at all times.

102      The Prosecution thus argued that these calculated and methodical actions did not depict a person who had lost her self-control, but showed a person who was very conscious and aware of what she was doing at all times. As such, the Prosecution argued that the accused failed to show that she had subjectively lost her self-control. The Prosecution then addressed the objective second requirement of whether there was grave and sudden provocation.

103      The Prosecution argued that there were two important elements in this objective requirement, that is, the provocation must be grave and sudden. No matter how grave the provocation is, if it did not take place contemporaneously or shortly before the killing, the exception would not apply. Likewise, no matter how contemporaneous a provocation is to the act of killing, the defence would not be available if the provocation is not sufficiently grave. The Prosecution then detailed a series of alleged abuses the accused endured at the hands of the deceased. It was argued that first, the alleged abuses never occurred and second, even if these allegations were true, they could not have amounted to such grave and sudden provocation that would have caused a reasonable person in the accused’s position to lose her self-control.

104      The Prosecution recapitulated the testimonies of the husband and some of the deceased’s staff, who had testified that apart from the deceased scolding the accused, they did not observe the deceased abusing the accused in any other manner. The Prosecution posited that the accused had on one occasion left a previous employer because they had been too “fussy”. As such, it was argued that the accused knew her avenues of recourse if she had indeed been abused by the deceased, that is, to lodge a complaint with her agent, the police, the Ministry of Manpower or the Indonesian Embassy. However, she did none of the above. The Prosecution submitted that this was an indication that the allegations of abuse were suspect.

105      The Prosecution also attempted to play down the accused’s claims that she was deprived of food prior to the events leading up to the death of the deceased. It was argued that there was ample evidence that food was readily available in the deceased’s office and home. The accused had also admitted that on the morning of 28 May 2002, the deceased had given her two packets of instant noodles.

106      The Prosecution then went on an alternative argument and submitted that even if one were to assume that the accused was a truthful witness, the deceased’s abusive acts would still not amount to grave and sudden provocation. First, the Prosecution argued that much of the accused’s accounts of abuse occurred before the accused and the two children left with the deceased to run some errands. As such, the requirement of suddenness was not satisfied, and thus these acts of abuse could not be relied upon as grave and sudden provocation. However, the Prosecution did concede that these abusive acts could still be relevant to the “mental background” they created in the accused on the evening in question.

107      A similar issue of a “mental background” was discussed in PP v Kwan Cin Cheng ([97] supra), where the accused had been subjected to derogatory remarks made by his girlfriend prior to him killing her. However, the Prosecution submitted that unlike in the case of PP v Kwan Cin Cheng, the acts of abuse here did not contribute significantly to the question of whether a reasonable person would have lost his/her control at the material time. The Prosecution added that not only were some of the acts of abuse trivial, but there was also a significantly long cooling-off period between the alleged abuse and the killing, which would have mitigated their effects on the accused’s mind.

108      The Prosecution then dealt with the English Court of Appeal decision of R v Ahluwalia [1992] 4 All ER 889. In that case, the accused contended, inter alia, that the history of violence and humiliation caused by her husband amounted to provocation and that the trial judge erred in failing to consider that she suffered from a “battered woman syndrome” when she killed her husband. As such, she argued that her conviction for murder should be reduced to manslaughter. In coming to its decision, the court (at 896) held:

We accept that the subjective element in the defence of provocation would not as a matter of law be negatived simply because of the delayed reaction in such cases, provided that there was at the time of the killing a “sudden and temporary loss of self-control” caused by the alleged provocation. However, the longer the delay and the stronger the evidence of deliberation on the part of the defendant, the more likely it will be that the prosecution will negative provocation.

109      The Prosecution then considered the applicability of the accused’s arguments in R v Ahluwalia, and noted several points. First, the tests for provocation in England and Singapore are different. The requirement of suddenness relates not to the provocation but to the loss of self-control. Second, the accused person in R v Ahluwalia had suffered years of physical and psychological abuse before killing her husband. This abuse was far more serious than that alleged by the accused in the present case. Third, while the court did not dispute that mental characteristics of a person should be taken into account in determining if a reasonable person with the same characteristics would have lost his/her self-control, the court (at 898) found that:

[T]here was no medical or other evidence before the judge and jury, and none even from the appellant, to suggest that she suffered from a post-traumatic stress disorder, or “battered woman syndrome” or any other specific condition which could amount to a “characteristic” as defined in R v McGregor [1962] NZLR 1069.

110      The Prosecution then argued that the same could be said in the present case, as there was no evidence that the accused was labouring under any “battered woman syndrome”. As such, the Prosecution urged that in applying the objective reasonable person test, this factor should not be taken into account.

111      The Prosecution then made submissions relating to the acts of abuse that occurred after the accused, the two children and the deceased had arrived at the office unit after finishing with the errands. The Prosecution argued that although the accused claimed that the deceased told her to eat faeces on three occasions, the deceased did not force her to do so. Further, the accused claimed that she had eaten the baby’s faeces on 28 May 2002 voluntarily, in order to spite the deceased. This act, the Prosecution claimed, depicted a person with resolute will and self-control, rather than a person who had been overwhelmed by grave and sudden provocation.

112      The Prosecution also submitted that the acts involving the deceased pulling the accused’s shirt, making her lose her balance and throwing the computer mouse at her would not be sufficiently grave or sudden to make a reasonable person lose his/her self-control. It was also argued that the same could be said of the allegations that the deceased scolded the accused. Such scolding would not be serious enough to warrant any drastic action by any reasonable person.

113      The Prosecution also asserted that the severity of the injuries inflicted on the deceased suggested that the objective element of the test for provocation had not been satisfied. In PP v Kwan Cin Cheng, it was held that a relevant question to be asked in considering if the objective element was present is whether the degree of loss of self-control is commensurate with the severity of the provocation. The Prosecution argued that if indeed the accused had lost her self-control, the severity of the injuries she had inflicted on the deceased indicated that the degree of loss of self-control far surpassed the severity of the provocation. The Prosecution relied on the words of the Court of Appeal in Seah Kok Meng v PP ([97] supra) where it was held at [26] that “[a] reasonable person, who was not out to get even, would not, in the circumstances, have gone on to search for some weapon and carry out an assault of this kind”.

114      The Prosecution’s final submission in relation to provocation was that even if it was accepted that the deceased’s alleged acts were sufficient to have provoked the accused, the provocation would clearly have “evaporated” when the accused strangled the deceased until she became limp. The accused could, and should have, left the office or tied the deceased up. In relation to this submission, the Prosecution referred to Lim Chin Chong v PP ([99] supra), where it was held at [31]:

Neither, in our view was the provocation, if indeed there was provocation, grave and sudden. … If it did, then the immediate and spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which on our understanding of the appellant’s own evidence immobilised the deceased to such an extent that he was able to leave the room, find the electrical wire and return to tie the deceased up and gag him. On any objective test the provocation of being sodomized had simply evaporated …

115      On these bases, the Prosecution argued that Exception 1 to s 300 PC, the exception of provocation, ought not to apply. The Prosecution then turned to the other exception relied on by the accused, the right of private defence.

Exception 2 – The right of private defence

116      The Prosecution’s argument on this issue was that the right of private defence never arose in favour of the accused, since it was the accused who was the aggressor from the outset, and not the deceased. The Prosecution then relied on Dr Lai’s evidence regarding the defensive injuries on the deceased’s arm, arguing that it was an indication that the deceased was on the defence against the accused’s attacks at all times.

Exception 4 – The defence of sudden fight

117      The Prosecution submitted that contrary to the Defence’s claim, there was no evidence of any sudden quarrel between the deceased, which then erupted into a sudden fight. It was also argued that there were no injuries found on the accused, apart from some burn injuries sustained by the accused, and the three bite marks. This was submitted as an indication that no fight or struggle had taken place involving the accused. The Prosecution also argued that it would have been impossible for the accused not to sustain any injuries, considering the struggle and the knife-fight, all within the confines of a narrow office space. As such, since the sudden fight exception to murder was premised upon the occurrence of a fight to start with, the lack of a fight would make the defence unavailable.

118      Additionally, the Prosecution argued that the amount of injuries found on the deceased’s body, coupled with this lack of injuries on the accused, showed that the accused was the aggressive attacker throughout the incident. In the alternative, the Prosecution argued that even if there was a sudden fight between the two women, the accused had clearly taken undue advantage and acted in a cruel and unusual manner. The Prosecution submitted that there was no evidence to suggest that the deceased was armed, since the accused suffered no knife wounds. This, the Prosecution claimed, was clear evidence that the accused had taken undue advantage of the deceased. In this respect, the Prosecution referred to the case of Phua Soy Boon v PP [1995] 1 SLR 285, where the Court of Appeal (at 291–292, [31]) held, in relation to the issue of sudden fight:

Even if we were to accept that there was a sudden fight, which we were not inclined to, the fact that the appellant used a sharp chopper against the unarmed deceased showed that he had taken undue advantage of the deceased. There was no evidence that the appellant suffered any injury from the alleged fracas with the deceased, yet he had inflicted, not one, but two gaping wounds on a very vulnerable part of the deceased’s body.

119      The Prosecution then submitted that it was Dr Lau’s evidence that the fatal stab wound to the deceased’s neck was inflicted after the various defensive injuries were caused to her left arm. Therefore, the accused clearly had an “unfair advantage”, to use a phrase adopted by the court in Mohamed Kunjo v PP ([95] supra) as another meaning of “undue advantage”, when she delivered the fatal stab to the deceased’s neck, as the latter was already severely injured and in a vulnerable state.

120      The Prosecution also submitted that the horrific injuries suffered by the deceased were evidence of an unmistakably savage and cruel attack by the accused. There were no less than ten slash wounds found on the deceased’s left arm alone. The Prosecution posited that these slash wounds were probably inflicted when the deceased raised her arms to fend off the accused’s attacks, which were targeted at the deceased’s head region. This was further evidence of the viciousness of the accused’s attack. As such, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s arguments in relation to the defence of sudden fight could not succeed.

The decision

121      I considered both the Prosecution’s and the Defence’s arguments in their entirety before arriving at my decision to convict the accused on a lesser charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. My reasons are as follows. From my analysis of the arguments from both sides, three main issues emerged. They were:

(a)        whether the accused’s version of events in relation to how the deceased had died should be accepted;

(b)        whether the accused was guilty of murder under s 300(c) PC; and

(c)        whether the exceptions to s 300 PC applied in favour of the accused.

Issue 1 – The accused’s version of events

122      Much of the difficulty about this case revolved around the fact that apart from the accused’s version of the events of 28 May 2002 from 8.00pm to 10.41pm (“the material time”), no other versions were available. There were no eyewitnesses to what occurred during the material time, and therefore no witnesses to corroborate most parts of the accused’s story.

123      The only witness available to speak of the incident as it was unfolding was Joseph Lefort, and even then, his account was merely with regard to what he had heard, not what he had seen. Nothing conclusive could be arrived at from the shouts of “jangan, jangan” that Joseph Lefort heard, although it pointed more strongly to the possibility that they could have been uttered by the accused. Even then, this account did not reveal anything about the actual events during the material time, only weakly confirming that a fight had occurred. The situation being such, I had to turn to the objective evidence at hand and infer from these facts the most likely account of what happened during the material time.

124      In this respect, the only evidence I could refer to was the pathologist’s report on the post-mortem performed on the deceased’s body. I found Dr Lau’s report of strong evidential value. It was a detailed description of all the injuries suffered by the deceased, and a clear explanation as to her death. After closely scrutinising Dr Lau’s report together with his testimony in court, I accepted his description of the deceased’s injuries as “defensive”, and his finding that the fatal stab wound to the deceased’s neck was not self-inflicted.

125      This therefore neutralised one crucial part of the accused’s version of the events during the material time. This was the part where the accused claimed that it was the deceased who cut her own left hand and stabbed herself in the neck, following threats from the accused. The only persons present at the scene during the material time were the accused, the deceased and the deceased’s two children. As such, apart from the accused, no other person could have inflicted the injuries and the fatal wound on the deceased, considering the nature of these injuries.

126      At this juncture, I noted that the accused had clearly abandoned her initial version of events regarding the 11 persons who had entered the office and turned off the lights, electing to proceed with the version that was under scrutiny at trial. There was then a credibility gap between the accused’s initial and final versions. As the trial proceeded on the basis of the accused’s final version of events only, I found little difficulty in throwing out the accused’s initial version of events. I therefore found the circumstantial evidence in this case to be strong enough to lead me to infer that it was indeed the accused who had inflicted the injuries and the fatal wound on the deceased. I then turned to the implications of this finding on the charge of murder against the accused.

Issue 2 – s 300(c) PC

127      Before I proceeded with my decision on this issue, I would like to make some observations on the state of the law with regard to s 300(c) PC. Recently, I read with interest an article by Stanley Yeo, “Academic Contributions and Judicial Interpretations of Section 300(c) Murder” in The Singapore Law Gazette, April 2004 at p 21. The article discussed several Singapore cases in relation to the interpretation our courts have attributed to s 300(c) PC. I found this article extremely helpful to my own observations on s 300(c) PC.

128      Most recently, our law pertaining to s 300(c) PC has taken a shift in terms of the interpretation that has been given to it. The Court of Appeal in Tan Chee Wee v PP [2004] 1 SLR 479 at [43] held that:

[I]n examining whether s 300(c) has been made out, the court’s approach to mens rea is only to determine whether the accused had intended to cause the injury that resulted in the victim’s death.

Until recently, the interpretation our courts have attributed to s 300(c) PC has remained very much objective. However, the court in Tan Chee Wee v PP has taken a step towards a subjective interpretation of the said section. As such, I feel that some comment on the recent state of the law would be merited. I therefore take this opportunity to revisit the local judicial interpretation pertaining to s 300(c), up till the decision in Tan Chee Wee v PP, before coming to my decision.

129      Essentially, much of our jurisprudence pertaining to s 300(c) PC has involved some discussion of the Indian Supreme Court’s decision in Virsa Singh v State of Punjab ([86] supra). However, not many of our decisions have managed to capture the essence of the test in Virsa Singh. Some of our former decisions have attributed an entirely objective interpretation to s 300(c) PC, interpreting it to mean that once it has been proved that an accused intended to cause some form of bodily injury, the remaining inquiry immediately becomes an objective one of whether the injury in fact inflicted was indeed sufficient to cause death. That being the case, even if an accused intended to inflict only a minor injury, it was sufficient to result in a conviction for murder so long as the injury actually inflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

130      I found this situation to sit very oddly with the test in Virsa Singh, which takes a different approach to interpreting s 300(c) PC. One need only turn to another Indian Supreme Court decision for a clear explanation of the test in Virsa Singh. In Rajwant Singh v State of Kerala AIR (53) 1966 SC 1874, it was held at 1878:

As was laid down in Virsa Singh v State of Punjab, … for the application of this clause it must be first established that an injury is caused, next it must be established objectively what the nature of that injury in the ordinary course of nature is. If the injury is found to be sufficient to cause death one test is satisfied. Then it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that very injury and not some other injury and that it was not accidental or unintentional. If this is also held against the offender the offence of murder is established. [emphasis added]

From this, it would appear that it was necessary to establish that an accused did not intend any other injury but that very injury that indeed caused the death of the deceased. With this principle in mind, I proceeded to analyse the application of s 300(c) PC on the facts of the present case.

131      I scrutinised the Prosecution’s submissions in relation to the test in Virsa Singh and found that the Prosecution’s division of the test into four limbs was largely accurate. However, I held that in terms of structure, it would have been more appropriate to lay out the test in this manner:

(a)        show that a bodily injury was present;

(b)        establish objectively the nature of the bodily injury and whether it was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death; and

(c)        prove that there was an intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other kind of bodily injury was intended.

In this way, the objective factual inquiry pertaining to the presence and the nature of the bodily injury (limbs (a) and (b)) is established first as a matter of course, before the subjective legal test as to whether the accused had an intention to inflict that particular injury that indeed caused the death of the deceased is applied. I found that it was important to maintain this clear separation between the two inquiries in order to avoid any confusion between the terms “objective” and “subjective”. The first inquiry is thus an objective forensic inquiry and the second, a judicial one. This then took me to my decision on the main issue, which is whether the accused was guilty of an offence under s 300(c) PC.

132      I had to rely on Dr Lau’s evidence in relation to the factual inquiry encompassed in limbs (a) and (b) of the test I laid out above. I had already accepted Dr Lau’s evidence in relation to the fatal injury found on the deceased’s body. This was the second stab wound that incised the deceased’s right carotid sheath, the middle third of the right common carotid artery, and terminated at an estimated depth of 6cm, resulting in extensive, severe and acute haemorrhage that ultimately caused the death of the deceased. As such, I found that the medical evidence before me clearly showed that there was indeed a bodily injury, the nature of that bodily injury was clear and it was established that this bodily injury was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. I was therefore convinced that the first two limbs were satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt.

133      The next inquiry was the judicial one. Here, as mentioned by me earlier, the circumstantial evidence was clear enough for me to infer that it was the accused who had inflicted the injuries on the deceased, including the second fatal stab wound. From the nature of the multiple injuries that had been inflicted on the deceased’s body, it was clear to me that the injuries had not been caused by accident. The inflictor of the injuries must have intended to inflict them. In this regard, I took into consideration Dr Lau’s evidence that the injuries were inflicted with “tremendous force”. Such use of force must have been deliberate.

134      I then turned to consider the two injuries found on the deceased’s neck, one of which was the fatal blow. Taking these injuries, inflicted on a most vulnerable part of the human body, in light of all the other injuries that had been inflicted, it was clear to me that the fatal wound too was not caused by accident.

135      I was convinced that the Prosecution had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused had intended to inflict the particular neck injury that was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death, and that had indeed caused the death of the deceased. With this, I moved to the last issue, that of whether the exceptions to s 300 PC raised by the accused were indeed available to the accused.

Issue 3 – The exceptions to s 300 PC

136      As detailed earlier, the Defence relied on three exceptions to s 300 PC, those of provocation, right to private defence and sudden fight. I dealt with each exception in the order in which they were raised.

Provocation

137      I found that the key factor here was the accused’s version of events regarding the acts of alleged abuse committed by the deceased. I had to make a finding of whether these acts of abuse had indeed occurred, and if they did, whether they amounted to provocation within the meaning of Exception 1 to s 300 PC. In a nutshell, the Defence attempted to portray the accused as a maid in an abusive employer-employee relationship, who had completely lost her self-control during the material time, whereas the Prosecution attempted to portray the accused as a calm, methodical killer who was in full control of her senses. In this respect, the Prosecution also made submissions to the effect that the accused was not a credible witness. As such, the Prosecution urged that her accounts of abuse be discredited.

138      I first turned to the Prosecution’s submission that the accused was not a credible witness because she had given two very different versions pertaining to the events of 28 May 2002. I agreed with the Prosecution that the accused had indeed lied in her initial version of events. The Prosecution urged me to apply the test in R v Lucas ([91] supra), where it was held that an accused’s false statements out of court could be used at her trial in order to corroborate her guilt. Likewise, it was argued that the accused’s statements out of court must be held against her different version in court, thereby corroborating her guilt. I thoroughly understood the Prosecution’s point. However, what I was being invited to do was to disregard the accused’s final version of events relied upon in court solely on the basis of her false statements out of court.

139      I was unable to accept this contention. On my perusal of the accused’s testimony in court, I found that there was some truth to various aspects of the accused’s version of events. I scrutinised the accused’s version of events in three main parts. First, there were the accounts of abuse. Second, there was the account pertaining to the quarrel and scuffle between the two women (which commenced at the point when the deceased scratched the accused’s face). Finally, there was the account where the accused claimed that the deceased cut her arms and stabbed her neck pursuant to threats by the accused. The objective evidence before me has already led me to a finding that it was the accused who had caused most, if not all, the injuries found on the deceased’s body. Therefore, I rejected the last part of the accused’s version of events.

140      I then scrutinised the first part of the accused’s story pertaining to the abuse she suffered. The Prosecution urged me not to accept the accused’s accounts, arguing that she had falsified them entirely. In this regard, the Prosecution adduced evidence from the husband and some of the deceased’s staff to show that apart from scolding the accused, they did not see the deceased abuse the accused. However, one had to bear in mind that many an act of abuse is usually carried out when no inquisitive eyes are present.

141      I recalled that the Prosecution made an attempt to disclaim each of the accused’s alleged episodes of abuse. For instance, it was argued that even if the accused had eaten the children’s faeces, this could not have been abuse since the deceased did not force the accused to eat the faeces. I felt that it was not necessary to analyse whether each and every incident of abuse actually occurred before I made a finding that the accused was indeed abused in general. I was convinced that the accused was telling the truth with respect to some, if not all, of her accounts of abuse.

142      In this regard, I accepted the accused’s story that the deceased had ordered the accused to eat noodles in the toilet. Here, I noted that the accused’s story was corroborated by the fact that the police had actually discovered the noodles in the toilet. I found that the accused must have felt humiliated by being disallowed to eat on a chair like a normal person, but being made to eat in the toilet instead. Further, I also accepted the accused’s assertions that the deceased had refused to give her food. In this respect, I found that the accused’s assertions were corroborated by the evidence of Rose Ang, to whom the accused had complained of hunger, and of not being fed for a few days. Margaret Low’s evidence also confirmed the accused’s claim that the deceased prevented other people from giving the accused food. These are but a few incidents. In all probability, there might have been more.

143      I then came to the next part of the accused’s version of events pertaining to the scuffle between the two women. I accepted that there had indeed been a struggle between the two women during the material time. In this respect, I referred to Joseph Lefort’s testimony pertaining to what he had heard during the material time. Although his testimony did nothing to reveal what actually happened, it was sufficient to convince me that, at least, a fight had broken out between the two women.

144      I therefore accepted the accused’s version of events pertaining to the abuse she had suffered and the fight between her and the deceased. However, I rejected the part of her story regarding the actual slashing and stabbing of the deceased. At this juncture, I recalled that I was entitled to accept one part of a witness’s story while rejecting another part: PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris (No 2) [1977] 1 MLJ 15; Ng Kwee Leong v PP [1998] 3 SLR 942. This brought me back to the issue of the test in R v Lucas ([91] supra) raised by the Prosecution. I found that although the accused had lied in her statements out of court, holding these falsified statements against her to corroborate her guilt or to discredit her as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly acceptable portions of her testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate reaction, especially in a trial where the capital punishment was involved. Having found that parts of the accused’s evidence in court were indeed truthful, I declined to make a finding that the accused’s falsified statements out of court corroborated her guilt.

145      I noticed that the Prosecution also argued that in the course of the trial, the accused clarified some of her evidence and was thus inconsistent. For instance, the Prosecution claimed that the accused first mentioned that there was no food in the office for lunch and then later clarified that there was some bread in the office. In my evaluation, the said clarification is not such a significant inconsistency as to undermine the accused’s defence of grave and sudden provocation.

146      I accepted the Prosecution’s submissions pertaining to the law on provocation in Singapore. Essentially, there are two requirements to be met, the first being the subjective requirement that the accused must have been deprived of her self-control by the provocation, and the second being the objective requirement that the provocation must have been grave and sudden.

147      In relation to the first requirement, the crux of the issue was really whether the accused had lost her self-control as a result of the provocation that she had been placed under. In this respect, I noted that the Defence relied on the long series of abuse suffered by the accused and the fight that had occurred between the two women as being the provocation in this case. I had already accepted that on the facts, there was indeed a series of abuse and a fight during the material time. The inquiry into whether this provocation was then “grave and sudden” enough fell within the ambit of the second objective requirement. I will therefore discuss this issue in greater detail later.

148      I encountered some difficulty in relation to the first requirement of a loss of self-control. The accused’s story throughout the trial had been that she had not stabbed the deceased. As such, it became difficult for the accused to turn around with another story saying that she had stabbed the deceased, but had been provoked into doing so. This sort of difficulty is not unexpected in any case where an alternative argument of this kind is submitted. However, having already found that it was the accused who had inflicted the injuries found on the deceased’s body, the only issue that was still left to be determined remained at whether the accused had lost her self-control when she inflicted these injuries. I noted that Dr Lau’s evidence was highly pertinent in this regard. I reproduce, again, the aspects of his evidence that was crucial to my decision on this issue:

There were at least 10 wounds on the deceased’s left forearm. The injuries were arranged in a haphazard manner and their distribution suggest that they were inflicted by downward blocks of a cleaver or chopper with tremendous force to such an extent that the deceased’s left hand was nearly dismembered at the wrist … The distribution and haphazard nature of these injuries would indicate that they were sustained in self-defence and the depth and severity of the injuries would also indicate that a great or large amount of force had been used.

149      The pathologist’s description of the nature of the injuries found on the deceased’s body was chillingly graphic. I found it necessary to repeat his description here. Dr Lau recorded that the deceased’s left forearm, wrist and hand had a series of gaping, and deep incised wounds. The deceased’s muscles, tendons, nerves and blood vessels were cut. There was a fracture of the left wrist joint and near dismemberment of the left hand at the wrist. There were also several incised wounds on the deceased’s right arm and right hand. In particular, Dr Lau noted that deliberate, downward blows directed at the head or neck with tremendous force caused the severe injuries to the deceased’s forearms. The question that then struck me was what could have led the accused to participate in such a bloody attack.

150      The accused appeared to me to be a mild-mannered, soft-spoken person, frail in appearance with a light frame. At the material time, she was also weak with hunger and had been involved in a violent and gruesome encounter with the deceased.

151      From the objective facts before me, I found that to inflict the kind of injuries found on the deceased’s body, the accused had to have been in a frenzy of sorts. She must have been so blind with rage that she lost all control over herself and lashed out repeatedly at the deceased, resulting in the “haphazard” nature of the injuries. The loss of self-control must have also been of such magnitude that she was able to inflict the severe wounds on the deceased “with tremendous force”. This was despite the fact that the accused was probably drained of energy during the material time. I found this to be a strong sign of an enraged attack committed by one who had lost all self-control. I emphasise that this was not a view I arrived at based only on the number of injuries suffered by the deceased. It was an irresistible inference I drew from the nature of the injuries and the surrounding circumstances as well.

152      At this juncture, I wish to make it abundantly clear that it is not the case that in all situations where a deceased has suffered multiple wounds that there will invariably be a finding of a frenzied attack. If this were so, situations of a purely intentional, vicious attack would slip through the cracks and allow an unmeritorious accused the defence of provocation. Everything depends on the facts of each case. On these facts, there was sufficient evidence to show that the accused had indeed lost her self-control due to the lengthy term of provocation she had endured.

153      I then observed that the Prosecution relied on the case of Lau Lee Peng v PP ([76] supra) and urged me to consider the accused’s behaviour after the material time. The Prosecution submitted that the accused looked calm and in control of herself. It was argued that her actions after the killing were calculated and methodical, depicting a person who was conscious and aware of what she was doing at all times. I was unable to accept this argument. I agreed that the manner in which a person behaved after the commission of an offence is important. However, there is no definite formula in cases of this kind.

154      It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviour must be observed on the part of an accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her self-control during the time of the killing. Different people react differently in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the actions of the killer post-killing in PP v Kwan Cin Cheng ([97] supra) differed from the actions of the killer in Lau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts of the individual case. A general submission that the calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm throughout the time of the killing was not convincing. I therefore found that the subjective requirement that the accused had lost her self-control as a result of the provocation was satisfied. I then turned to the objective requirement of a “grave and sudden” provocation.

155      The Prosecution argued that the requirement of suddenness, for one, was not satisfied on the facts of this case, as the accounts of abuse occurred long before the events of 28 May 2002. I agreed, in so far as the Defence sought to adduce the entire period of abuse prior to 28 May 2002 as going towards the acts of provocation, that these acts of abuse were too remote in time from the killing to constitute a “sudden” provocation. However, I found that these acts of abuse were still relevant to the question of whether the provocation that was offered was “grave” enough. The Prosecution had itself conceded that the abusive acts could still be relevant to the “mental background” that they created in the accused during the material time.

156      In this regard, I found that these seemingly separate events of abuse linked up with each other like a chain. The effect of each separate event was consistent, ie the deceased had acted in a manner that humiliated the accused and caused her physical pain. As such, I was able to find that these many separate events were actually closely linked to each other, as they presented an overall picture of an abusive and poor employer-employee relationship. This was extremely relevant to establishing the accused’s “mental background” at the time of the killing. This thus went towards showing whether the events of 28 May 2002 satisfied the requirement of a “grave” provocation.

157      The Prosecution then argued that the events of 28 May 2002 were not so serious as to justify the reaction from the accused. I do not accept this argument. The Prosecution’s contention seemed to ignore the totality of the provocative acts together with the accused’s “mental background”, choosing to focus on the individual events of abuse only. A mild scolding or a nagging from the deceased on one day would not be considered a grave provocation. However, a series of nagging, scolding, insults, humiliation, physical abuse and lack of food over a period of time, culminating in a quick succession of abuse on 28 May 2002, would be sufficiently grave to provoke a reasonable person in the accused’s position.

158      At this juncture, it might perhaps be instructive to refer to the facts and findings of an English case. The appellant in R v Roberts [2002] EWCA Crim 1069 was a man who had cared for his aunt in her old years. However, his aunt’s response to his care was to nag at him constantly. I found these portions of the findings of the English Court of Appeal at [7]–[15] particularly instructive:

7          … Quite apart from the daily routine, on the occasions when she went to the hairdresser for an appointment, he was responsible for washing her and helping her dress. She claimed that she could not wash her genitalia, and although he found the process profoundly distasteful, he did what was necessary. He would then take her to the hairdresser in a wheelchair, collecting her afterwards and returning her home. On Sundays he would take the lunch prepared by his wife to his aunt’s. She insisted that her food was cut up so that she could use a spoon rather than a knife and fork. When he used one of her knives in order to cut the food, she complained that the food looked like scraps, so he took to bringing a knife from his home for the purpose. Without going into any further detail, the responsibilities for his aunt meant that the appellant had only been on holiday three times in the previous 10 years, and then only for a few days. When he suggested that he might go away, there was always a row in which he was accused of neglecting her. He had taken to altering dates on documents, to pretend that he was attending seminars in connection with his work.

8          None of these essential features of the case was in dispute. Equally, his aunt’s reaction to all this care and devotion was the opposite of kind. She nagged constantly at him, complaining generally about the lack of care, and his inadequacies. The nagging descended into abuse, and sometimes hysteria. We can summarise the effect of the evidence by quoting the language used by the trial judge:

There is ... a vast amount of unchallenged evidence that this old lady was persistently and ungratefully offensive to Mr Roberts, who had been looking after her for years. The evidence you may think indicates that during all this time his response, at worse, had been to shout at her in frustration.

…

11         Events on 7 June 1993 itself can be described shortly. Before leaving for work, the appellant visited his aunt as usual that morning. He set about the chores. Although she normally woke up during this process, on this occasion she did not do so, and he decided to save time, and probable trouble, by leaving her asleep. He went home, changed into his work clothes, and drove to work. He realised that his failure to wake his aunt would be likely to cause trouble when he next returned, so as a distraction, he tried to make arrangements for her to visit a relative. He felt tired at work all day, and as he drove home that evening he kept nodding off. By the time he arrived home he was ‘totally shattered’. He flopped into a chair and, as a ‘tonic’ he had [a] wine glass full of elderberry wine. Mrs Edwards [the aunt] was visited during the day by the community nurse, and a former neighbour. They found her in good form. At about 7.30 pm the community nurse returned and stayed for between 5 – 10 minutes. She noticed that Mrs Edwards was upset about some mail that had arrived during the morning post.

12         At about 8 pm the appellant went, as he saw it, to ‘face the music’ with his aunt. As he anticipated she was annoyed at him for not waking her. She waved a bank statement at him, complaining that she was heavily overdrawn at the bank. An argument developed. It was heard by a neighbour. He told her about the possibility of a trip to a relative. The argument continued. He explained that the bank statement was out-of-date. There had been a recent payment in. The argument turned to money. He reminded her that she was getting more rent from one of her properties because he had intervened to help. She dismissed this, saying he had done nothing to help her. When he insisted that he had, she kept shouting at him ‘no, no, no’, and would not let him get a word in. He lost his temper, put his hand over her mouth shouting at her ‘yes, yes, yes’. He then left her house. He went to the Park Place Hotel, where according to his evidence, he drank two soft drinks and one pint of beer. In the meantime Mrs Edwards telephoned a neighbour in a distressed state. She also telephoned the doctor complaining that she had suffered a heart attack. Such complaints were not unusual. Mrs Duncan, the neighbour, went to see her, remaining until 9.10 pm. The doctor visited her, staying for about 15 minutes. Mrs Duncan returned about 1/2 hour later, staying for another 10 minutes. In the meantime the appellant went to his wife’s home. He said he was distressed about his aunt. He wanted to talk the situation over. Unfortunately there was a row with his wife. He left her house in a temper. He slammed the door. He put his fist through the glass. He hurled a bicycle to one side. He returned to his one address in Mwrog Street. There he drank two half pint tumblers of elderberry wine, and pottered around the house.

13         At about 9.50 pm, he was standing by his own front door, preparing himself and plucking up the courage, as he put it, to go back to his aunt’s house to sort out her food and settle her down for the night. Mrs Duncan saw him standing by his own front door. She thought, from the movements of his hands and general attitude, that he was in a bad mood about something. He said that he did not want to respond to her, because he had already had enough for that night, and still had to face his aunt.

14         He walked over to his aunt’s house. He was carrying a knife, for use in the preparation of her food. It was common ground that there was nothing unusual or significant about him taking a knife with him for this purpose during his evening visits to his aunt. When he arrived at his aunt’s home, and she saw him, she immediately started screaming and shouting at him that he was ‘rotten’. Something inside him snapped. He stabbed her. He could not recall how many times he had stabbed her and indeed he did not really realise what he had done for a little while. When he did, he made a telephone call to the police. At 9.58 pm a telephone call was received in which he admitted that he had killed his aunt at her home. He also telephoned his brother-in-law. At 10.08 two police officers arrived at Mrs Edwards’ house. They found the appellant at the rear living room standing at the foot of a single bed. Mrs Edwards was lying there. He said ‘I’ve killed her, fuck me, there’s the knife, I’ve stabbed her’, and pointed to a telephone table.

15         The appellant was arrested and cautioned. He replied, ‘Yes, okay, I am not going to try to run away otherwise I would not have rung you’. He was escorted out of the room into the front living room. He then became agitated saying, ‘Fuck me, I’ve done it now I am a murderer. I am really in the shit now. I cannot believe I killed her’. On medical examination at the police station, minor superficial injuries were noticed to his right wrist, left hand and left shin, which were consistent with the earlier outburst of bad temper at his wife’s home. …

159      The question before the Court in R v Roberts pertained to whether the defence of provocation was adequately canvassed before the jury. The court held (at [25]) as follows:

By current standards, provocation was not adequately canvassed before the jury. The issues which arise are not new found. There was a significant body of evidence before the jury, relevant for their consideration on provocation, but confined at trial to diminished responsibility. If that evidence, and the further evidence which would have been available to support provocation [in] its full modern ambit had been appreciated, in our judgment there would have been a realistic prospect that the trial jury would not have excluded provocation. We are troubled by this conviction. We do not think it safe. Accordingly the appeal will be allowed. The conviction for murder will be quashed. A verdict of manslaughter will be substituted. A new trial would serve no useful public interest.

[emphasis added]

Although the question in the present case was different from that in R v Roberts, the similarities in the facts of both cases could not be ignored. In my view, each instance of abuse should not be taken apart and scrutinised separately.

160      I have already established that these individual events of abuse over a period of time went towards forming the “mental background” in the accused at the time when the acts of provocation, ie the events of 28 May 2002, were offered. In R v Roberts, it was apparent that the incessant nagging of the deceased formed such a “mental background” (although the court in R v Roberts did not use these very words) in the appellant, so much so that the deceased’s accusation of his being “rotten” caused him to lose his self-control. On a normal occasion void of any “mental background”, the word “rotten” might not have sparked the appellant into a frenzied rage. However, when the word “rotten” is observed alongside the appellant’s “mental background”, it is understandable why that particular word was a sufficiently “grave” provocation.

161      Likewise, in the present case, I found that the instances of abuse added up over a period of time and weighed on the mind of the accused. The accused’s words to the deceased before the scuffle between the two women was an example of the total effect the separate instances of abuse had on her: “Ma’am why you do to me everyday like that, I very pain.” The question to be asked then was whether a reasonable maid in the position of the accused, that is a maid with this sort of “mental background”, would have been so provoked by the acts of the deceased at the material time. I would have to answer this in the positive. The “mental background” caused by the sustained abuse suffered by the accused generated enough tension, such that the provocative actions of the deceased on 28 May 2002 became sufficiently “grave” the moment they occurred. Therefore, I found that the element of a “grave” provocation was met.

162      I then turned to consider the requirement of “suddenness”. The Prosecution argued that the accused could not be allowed to rely on the events of 28 May 2002, as there had been a significantly long cooling-off period between the alleged abuse the accused suffered on 28 May 2002 and the killing. The Prosecution submitted that this cooling-off period negated the possibility that the acts of provocation were sudden. The Prosecution also submitted that during the scuffle, there were moments when the accused had time apart from the deceased in order to cool down. I disagreed with this argument.

163      I was unable to find that there was a sufficient break in time that provided the accused with a cooling-off period. From the accounts of the events of abuse and fighting on 28 May 2002, up to the point when the deceased was killed, I found that the incidents between the two women were part of an ongoing process. The events were actually contemporaneous and not spaced out, as the Prosecution contended.

164      One of the Prosecution’s main contentions was with regard to the point in time when the accused choked the deceased till she became limp. The Prosecution argued that this was a sufficient break in time for the accused to “cool off”, putting an end to the provocation. I disagreed. I found that the Prosecution failed to consider that after the incident where the accused choked the deceased till she became limp, the deceased had gotten up after a while and kicked the accused, sparking off another series of fights. There was therefore sufficient evidence before me to find that the provocation from the deceased had also continued throughout the material time.

165      The Prosecution’s arguments, while understandable, failed to take into account the fact that the provocation was ongoing on the facts of this case. There were most certainly the odd moments when the accused had a breathing space of a minute or so. However, the deceased would then re-ignite the fight. The “breathing spaces” in between were thus not so significant or lengthy enough to constitute a cooling-off period sufficient to put an end to the provocation. I was therefore able to find that the provocation offered by the deceased was indeed real and present during the material time, thus satisfying the requirement of a “sudden” provocation.

166      Although this would be sufficient to determine the issues pertaining to the exception of provocation, I noted that the Prosecution raised the English Court of Appeal case of R v Ahluwalia ([108] supra). The Prosecution raised this argument as a pre-emptive one, as the Defence did not raise this case in their arguments. The Prosecution attempted to distinguish this case by arguing that the abuse suffered by the appellant in R v Ahluwalia was far worse, and over a longer period of time, than by the accused. As such, the Prosecution argued that the principles in R v Ahluwalia were not helpful to the Defence’s case.

167      The most interesting position in the case of R v Ahluwalia was in relation to the “battered woman syndrome”, and I noticed that the Prosecution brought most of its arguments in respect of this part of the judgment. However, I found that the Prosecution’s arguments were premature. The accused did not rely on the principles pertaining to the “battered woman syndrome”, found in R v Ahluwalia. If indeed the Defence had raised the case of R v Ahluwalia in support of an argument that the accused was suffering from the “battered woman syndrome”, I would have in the end dismissed the argument. This was because there was no evidence before me to hold that the accused was indeed suffering from such a depressive condition. In fact, this was the very reason why the appellant in R v Ahluwalia could not prove to the court that she was suffering from the “battered woman syndrome”.

168      Additionally, I found that the Prosecution’s arguments, that the abuse suffered by the appellant in R v Ahluwalia was far worse than that suffered by the accused in the present case, led nowhere. At most, this argument assisted the Prosecution in factually distinguishing the case of R v Ahluwalia from the present case. However, as the Defence itself had not raised R v Ahluwalia in support of any aspect of its arguments, I found that the Prosecution’s arguments were essentially against a non-issue.

169      As I found that the exception of provocation was indeed available to the accused, I held that the accused was only guilty of the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. As such, the charge of murder had to be reduced accordingly. Although this would have been sufficient to dispose of this case, for the sake of completeness, I must deal briefly with the two other exceptions to s 300 PC that were raised by the accused.

Right of private defence and sudden fight

170      Here, I was in agreement with the Prosecution. The exceptions hardly applied to the accused in this instance. Going by the defensive injuries found on the deceased’s body and the fact that the accused was not harmed, it could not be said that the accused had an extending right of private defence.

171      As for the defence of sudden fight, I found that there had indeed been a fight between the two women that came within the meaning of Exception 4 to s 300 PC. However, I also found that the accused did not meet the proportionality requirement for a successful invocation of the exception.

Conclusion

172      This is an exceptionally tragic case. It is tragic and sad both for the deceased and the accused. The baby has lost his mother and sister. The husband has lost his wife and a daughter. The court heard that the deceased’s family has a strong Christian background and persuasion, and I trust that the abiding faith and the love of the Lord in them will heal their wounds and give them the solace and strength which they much deserve. I must say that I feel their pain and share their sorrow.

173      As for the accused, the situation is no less tragic. She is a frail and helpless-looking woman who came from Indonesia to work as a domestic maid. She came here to eke out a living in order to support herself and members of her family. Now, she faces a grave charge which attracts the death penalty.

174      The question is, why did all of this happen on the fateful evening of 28 May 2002? What went wrong so suddenly that caused the mayhem and the death of two persons? What triggered all of this? Was this a mindless killing carried out by a cold-blooded killer, as was suggested by the Prosecution, or was it an act due to a sudden burst of pent-up feeling and rage, as a result of insults and ill-treatment brought to bear on the accused?

175      In sum, the Prosecution’s case was that the accused wantonly killed her employer and having done it, tried to conceal it by not only lighting a fire to the office where the incident took place, but also endeavouring to fabricate a host of stories to escape the consequences.

176      The accused, who was the only person alive to tell what happened on that day, was found to be wanting in her explanation as to how the injuries seen on the deceased came to be inflicted. Her claim, that after a struggle between them the deceased dealt the mortal blows on herself, cannot possibly be true, having regard to forensic evidence that conclusively proved that the injuries found on the deceased were defensive in nature, and that they could not have been self-inflicted. Available evidence inescapably pointed to the conclusion that it was the accused who had caused the injuries on the deceased, and that it was she who dealt the mortal blows. The question is, why?

177      The story of the accused that she was deprived of food and suffering from hunger, at least on 28 May 2002, received a measure of confirmation from some of the Prosecution’s witnesses. First, Rose Ang, the cleaning lady working for the deceased, said that on the fateful day, around noon, the accused told her that she was hungry and had not eaten for sometime. Rose Ang then gave the accused some biscuits out of pity. Second, Esther Hong, Margaret Low and Nancy Ee, all employees of the victim, confirmed that the deceased was seen scolding the accused for eating spoonfuls of the baby’s food. Third, Margaret Low confirmed that when she offered some fruits to the accused that evening at a handphone shop, the deceased prevented her from doing so.

178      Next, the account of the accused that on the morning of 28 May 2002, she practically had to gulp in a hurry a few mouthfuls of noodles in the kitchen toilet, as she was rushed by the deceased, was corroborated when the police found a plastic container with the remnants of noodles floating in some red coloured liquid in the kitchen toilet of the deceased’s flat. Furthermore, there was also evidence of some serious unhappiness on the part of the deceased towards the accused for many a lapse on the part of the accused, such as not doing her work properly, carrying Crystal in the middle of the night for no reason and allegedly eating the baby’s food. Despite all the lies uttered by the accused to extricate herself from her guilt, there was cogent evidence to conclude that the deceased subjected her to some measure of ill-treatment. However, I must add that I found the accused’s claims that the deceased made her eat faeces to be extravagant. These claims were discounted in the final analysis.

179      Nevertheless, given the simmering tension and a readiness on the part of the deceased to fault and be severe to the maids in her employment where there was any shortcoming or any further deficiency, a reasonable inference was that there was a sudden eruption; the accused, having had enough, lost her self-control and went berserk in fatally attacking the deceased. The nature of the injuries found on the deceased strongly suggested to me that these were the acts of a person possessed of a frenzy and denuded of self-control. In my view, the cord of reason suddenly snapped when the accused could no longer control her emotions and feelings of despair. No doubt, she told many lies to extricate herself from the dilemma she was found to be in. However, the evidence from the prosecution witnesses showed that there were acts on the part of the deceased to bring about the frenzied reaction from the accused, availing her to the defence of grave and sudden provocation.

180      Blackstone in his Commentaries on the Laws of England (15th Ed, 1809) vol 4, at p 190 says that there are degrees of guilt, which divide the offence of criminal homicide into manslaughter and murder. He further says that “manslaughter arises from the sudden heat of the passions, murder from the wickedness of the heart”. It was not lost on the court that whatever the accused did that day should be juxtaposed with her act of holding on to the baby and saving him from the very fire that she lit. This act clearly evinced to the court that the accused was not an embodiment of wickedness and evil, but a woman of normal emotions who went awry momentarily.

181      In my view, having regard to all the objective facts, notwithstanding the untruths uttered by the accused in court over the injuries, the Defence had proved on a balance of probabilities that Exception 1 to s 300 PC, namely the defence of grave and sudden provocation, applied in this case. This was sufficient to reduce the charge to the lesser offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Consequently, I find the accused guilty of the lesser charge punishable under s 304(a) PC and convict her accordingly. I shall hear counsel on the question of sentence.

2664140,Boege v Attorney General of New South Wales [2016] NSWSC 1469,"Judgment


	
	HIS HONOUR: Petronella Boege applies for an inquiry into her conviction at Bega Local Court on 5 January 2000 for one offence of common assault contrary to s 61 of the Crimes Act 1900. The prosecution case was that Ms Boege punched her husband several times in the head during a disagreement over a number of photo albums in the wider context of the breakdown of her marriage. The offence occurred in the presence of a police constable. Ms Boege was convicted and fined $500.
	
	
	Ms Boege appealed against her conviction to the District Court of New South Wales. On 8 March 2001, Shillington QC DCJ dismissed the appeal.
	
	
	Ms Boege now applies for an inquiry into her conviction pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001.
	
	
	This application is not the first such application made by Ms Boege. There have been three previous applications. The first was considered by her Honour Adamson J in reasons delivered on 27 March 2012. The application was dismissed.
	
	
	Following the dismissal of that application, Ms Boege petitioned the Governor of New South Wales asking for a review of the conviction pursuant to s 76 of the Act. That petition was declined on 30 January 2013.
	
	
	Ms Boege made a second application to this Court pursuant to s 78 of the Act. Her Honour Wilson J refused that application: see Further application of Petronella Boege pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 [2015] NSWSC 1925.
	
	
	Ms Boege made a third application to this Court pursuant to s 78 of the Act. Her Honour Adams J refused that application: see Application of Petronella Boege pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (No 3) [2016] NSWSC 729.
	
	
	It is unnecessary for present purposes to refer to these applications in any more detail.
	


The application


	
	Ms Boege’s application is supported by extensive and detailed written submissions dated 25 July 2016, to which is annexed a significant bundle of documents. Ms Boege has also filed submissions in reply to the Attorney-General’s submissions dated 27 September 2016. In summary, Ms Boege now contends as follows:
	



	
	Both her former husband and senior constable van der Hout fabricated parts of their evidence given at the Bega Local Court before Magistrate O’Connor.
	
	
	Mr Boege sought an apprehended violence order against her in order to retain possession of her personal property which he sought to sell in contravention of orders made by the Family Court.
	
	
	The apprehended violence order in question obtained by the police on 15 October 1999 was not tendered in evidence before the magistrate and witnesses were not cross-examined about it.
	
	
	Magistrate O’Connor erred in admitting evidence adduced in relation to the common assault charge in the apprehended violence order matter.
	
	
	Ms Boege’s children were subpoenaed to give evidence but were not called to do so.
	
	
	A statement by Mr Boege dated 18 October 1999 and a breach report dated 7 November 1999 were not tendered at the hearing before the magistrate.
	
	
	Ms Boege did not strike Mr Boege as described by the prosecution witnesses and she no longer has a relationship with her children or grandchildren.
	



	
	I have read Ms Boege’s submissions and considered all of the annexed material.
	


Consideration


	
	Section 79 (3) of the Act provides relevantly as follows:
	


“79 Consideration of applications

(1) After considering an application under section 78 or on its own motion:

(a) the Supreme Court may direct that an inquiry be conducted by a judicial officer into the conviction or sentence, or

(b) the Supreme Court may refer the whole case to the Court of Criminal Appeal, to be dealt with as an appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.

(2) Action under subsection (1) may only be taken if it appears that there is a doubt or question as to the convicted person’s guilt, as to any mitigating circumstances in the case or as to any part of the evidence in the case.

(3) The Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application. Without limiting the foregoing, the Supreme Court may refuse to consider or otherwise deal with an application if:

(a) it appears that the matter:

(i) has been fully dealt with in the proceedings giving rise to the conviction or sentence (or in any proceedings on appeal from the conviction or sentence), or

(ii) has previously been dealt with under this Part or under the previous review provisions, or

(iii) has been the subject of a right of appeal (or a right to apply for leave to appeal) by the convicted person but no such appeal or application has been made, or

(iv) has been the subject of appeal proceedings commenced by or on behalf of the convicted person (including proceedings on an application for leave to appeal) where the appeal or application has been withdrawn or the proceedings have been allowed to lapse, and

(b) the Supreme Court is not satisfied that there are special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action.

(3A)…”


	
	This matter has previously and obviously been dealt with under Part 7 of the Act. Three separate applications have been considered by three separate Supreme Court judges who all reached what amounts to the same conclusion. For what it is worth, I have revisited all of those decisions. The conclusions reached in each case are unexceptionable. I would also have reached the same conclusion as the judges who dealt with them.
	
	
	Nothing promoted or provided by Ms Boege in the present application is new. I am completely satisfied that there are no special facts or special circumstances that justify the taking of further action. In the circumstances I refuse to consider or otherwise deal with this application. It is clearly frivolous and vexatious and a monumental waste of this Court’s time. In any other litigious context it would arguably amount to an abuse of the process of the Court.

Cur Adv Vult
 
(delivering the judgment of the court): 
 Factual background 
The three accused in these Criminal Appeals were charged with the offence of rape under s 376 of the Penal Code. Rape is a non-bailable offence, as provided in Sch A to the Criminal Procedure Code. The preliminary inquiry into charges was held in the Subordinate Courts on 19 December 1985 at the conclusion of which the accused were committed for trial in the High Court.
Counsel for each of the accused then applied, by way of criminal motions, to the High Court for the accused to be admitted to bail pending their trial. These applications were made pursuant to what is now s 354 of the Criminal Procedure Code (1985 Rev Ed). (All references to statutory provisions hereinafter shall be to the 1985 Rev Ed of the Statutes.) The applications came before Sinnathuray J who refused to grant bail but directed an early trial instead.
The three accused appealed against the decision of the learned judge. We dismissed all the appeals. We now give our reasons.
Is an order on a bail application appealable?
Section 354 of the Criminal Procedure Code is as follows: 
 
(1) The High Court may, in any case whether there is an appeal on conviction or not, direct that any person shall be admitted to bail or that the bail required by a police officer or Magistrate`s Court or District Court shall be reduced or increased.
(2) The High Court may at any stage of any proceeding under this Code cause any person who has been released under this section to be arrested and may commit him to custody.
 
 
 
In Singapore, there is no general right of appeal in criminal cases except such as is provided by law. This is made clear by s 241 Criminal Procedure Code which provides: 
 
No appeal shall lie from a judgment, sentence or order of a criminal court except as provided for by this Code or by any other law for the time being in force.
 
 
 
The Criminal Procedure Code contains no provision for an appeal against an order of the High Court made under s 354 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The appellants can only appeal under `any other law for the time being in force.
We now turn to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. Section 44, which spells out the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal to entertain appeals from the High Court, reads: 
 
(1) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any appeal against any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought.
(2) An appeal by a person convicted shall be either against the conviction or against the sentence or against both: Provided that where an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted on such plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence. 
(3) An appeal by the Public Prosecutor shall be either against the acquittal of an accused person or against the sentence imposed upon an accused person by the High Court. 
(4) An appeal may lie on a question of fact or a question of law or on a question of mixed fact and law. 
(5) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine matters brought before it in accordance with section 59 or 66.
 
 
 
Sections 59 and 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) have no relevance to the proceedings before us. The key words in s 44(1) are `any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction`.
Section 44, before it was repealed and substituted in its present form by the Supreme Court of Judicature (Amendment) Act 1973, was in the following terms: 
 
(1) The Court of Criminal Appeal shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine any appeal by a person convicted by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought.
(2) An appeal by a person convicted shall be either against the conviction or against the sentence or against both: Provided that where an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted on such plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence. 
(3) An appeal may he on a question of fact or a question of law or on a question of mixed fact and law. 
(4) The Court shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine matters brought before it in accordance with the provisions of ss 58, 59 or 60 of this Act.
 
 
 
The Amendment Act of 1973 also made certain changes to ss 42, 46, 49, 54 and 58 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. For example, s 42 was altered so that `appellant` includes the Public Prosecutor.
It is plain from the legislative history of all these sections that the words `any decision made by the High Court` in s 44(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act were inserted to accommodate appeals by the Public Prosecutor, thereby enlarging the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal in that respect. The words were, in our opinion, not inserted as a `catch-all` phrase. They must be read in the context of the other provisions. In s 44(2), the appellant is the `person convicted` and the appeal is against conviction, or sentence, or both. In s 44(3), the appellant is the Public Prosecutor and the appeal is against acquittal, or sentence. Even when questions of law are referred to the Court of Criminal Appeal under s 59 or 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act, they are done only at the conclusion of the trial or the appeal, as the case may be. The only logical conclusion, therefore, is that the jurisdiction of the Court of Criminal Appeal is to hear appeals against orders of finality, ie those resulting in conviction and sentence, or acquittal.
What then is the nature of an order made on an application for bail? It is helpful to refer to 
 Re Balasundara Pavalar 
 AIR 1951 Madras 7. There the question before the Madras High Court was whether a convicted person, whose application for bail pending his appeal had once been rejected, could renew that application for the same relief. The court decided that there was no prohibition against entertaining such an application. Govinda Menon J, who delivered the judgment of the court, said (at p 9 of the report): 
 
It has to be remarked that an order on a bail application does not finally determine the guilt or innocence of a person accused or convicted of an offence. All that such an order postulates is that pending an enquiry or trial, and in the case of a convicted person, pending an appeal by him, it is not absolutely necessary that his liberty should be curtailed.
 
 
 
It seems to us, therefore, that an order on a bail application is nothing more than an interlocutory and tentative expression of the conclusion as to whether a person should be set at large pending trial, or disposal of his appeal, and nothing more.
The court then went on to consider (at p 10 of the report) whether an order rejecting the bail application amounted to a `judgment` under s 369 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, which prohibits judgments from being altered or reviewed once they have been signed: 
 
Such a reconsideration will be prohibited only if the order already rejecting the bail application amounts to a judgment under the Criminal Procedure Code. It need hardly be stated that the Criminal Procedure Code does not define the word `judgment` as is done in the Code of Civil Procedure. One of us had occasion to refer to it recently in the case reported in 
 Suryarao v Sathiraiu
 1948 MWN Cr 65; (AIR (35) 1948 Mad 510; 49 Cr LJ 754). Reference was made there to the definition of `judgment` in 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England
, Hailsham Ed, Vol IX, paras 260 to 264 as meaning a final order in a trial terminating in the conviction or acquittal of the accused. That this is the meaning of the word `judgment` even under the Criminal Procedure Code is evident from the, decisions quoted therein, ... If by the word `judgment` is understood a final order in a trial terminating in the conviction or acquittal of the accused, it necessarily follows that a tentative order directing the release of an accused person pending the hearing of his appeal by an appellate court cannot be termed a `judgment` under the Code. Therefore, s 369 of the Criminal Procedure Code can have no application to a bail application.
 
 
 
We agree with the observations quoted above. It therefore follows that an order made on a bail application, being interlocutory and tentative in nature, does not fall within the purview of s 44 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and is thus a non-appealable order.
It is also not a `judgment` under s 217(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which is our equivalent of s 369 of the Indian Criminal Procedure Code. Section 217(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code reads: 
 
No court other than the High Court, when it has recorded its judgment, shall alter or review the judgment.
 
 
 
The prohibition against alteration or review does not apply to the High Court in any event. Accordingly, successive applications for bail can be made in the High Court. But once an application for bail has been rejected, the court would be extremely reluctant in granting bail on subsequent applications, unless there has been a material change of circumstances or new facts have since come to light.
We would add that what we have said applies equally to the Subordinate Courts. We are of the view that an order made on a bail application by a Subordinate Court does not come within the meaning of the words `any judgment, sentence or order pronounced by any District Court or Magistrate`s Court in a criminal case or matter` contained in s 247 of the Criminal Procedure Code. It is certainly not a judgment or sentence, and neither is it an `order`. In 
 Gng Eng Hwoo v R 
 
 
 
[1954] MLJ 256
 , Whitton J had this to say about the word `order` appearing in a subsection similar in terms to the present s 241 of the Criminal. Procedure Code: 
 
I have been unable to find any definition of the word `order` which appears to fit its use in this section, but my research into the matter has led me to the conclusion that in connection with a criminal cause or matter the word is confined, broadly speaking, to those final decisions of a court which affect parties to the proceedings in respect of their person or property.
 
 
 
We have already said that an order made on a bail application is interlocutory and tentative in nature.
That was apparently why the Public Prosecutor`s appeal in 
 PP v K Suppiah & Ors 
 (MA 19/67) (unreported) was dismissed. There, the accused were charged in a magistrate`s court with non-bailable offences on 2 February 1967. The magistrate rejected the accused`s application for bail, and ordered that they be remanded until 11 February 1967. On 8 February 1967, the accused again appeared before the magistrate to renew their application for bail. It was common ground that the basis for opposing bail no longer existed. However, the prosecution raised a preliminary objection that the magistrate had no jurisdiction to entertain the fresh application for bail on the grounds that the magistrate, having made the remand order effective till 11 February 1967, wag functus officio until that date, and that the matter was res judicata. The defence counsel urged, the magistrate to act in accordance with the prevailing practice that an application for bail could be renewed again and again. The magistrate ruled that he had the jurisdiction to hear the fresh application for bail and granted bail. Against that decision the prosecution appealed to the High Court, which, in our opinion, rightly dismissed it.
Likewise, therefore, successive applications for bail can be made in the Subordinate Courts, subject to the same principle that we have stated. This accords both with the law as well as with time-honoured practice.
There is one final point. The Court of Criminal Appeal can entertain bail applications pending appeal from persons convicted by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction. This is allowed under s 51(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act which provides: 
 
Except in the cases mentioned in sub-s (3) no appeal shall operate as a stay of execution, but the trial court or the Court of Criminal Appeal may stay execution on any judgment, order, conviction or sentence pending appeal on such terms as to security for the payment of any money or the performance or non-performance of any act or the suffering of any punishment ordered by or in such judgment, order, conviction or sentence as to the court may seem reasonable.
 
 
 
When an accused has been tried and convicted by the High Court and wishes to apply for bail pending appeal, he should in the first instance apply to the trial court. If the trial court refuses bail, he may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal. He may of course choose to make a second application to the trial court instead of applying to the Court of Criminal Appeal. We again emphasize here the principle to be applied in hearing a second or any subsequent application, namely, that there should be a material change of circumstances or that new facts have since come to light, before such an application will be granted. The applicant and his counsel should bear this in mind before contemplating such an application.

This is an appeal by all six appellants who were jointly charged with and convicted by the Subordinate Court for 19 offences under s 3(1) of the Copyright (Gramophone Records and Government Broadcasting) Act (now Cap 64) for having in their possession for sale on or about 25 February 1983 at No 296 Lucky Plaza, Second Floor, Orchard Road, Singapore 0923, a number of pirated copies of gramophone records of various songs which included `Sheena Easton - 9 to 5`, `Beatles - I Saw Her Standing There`. They were sentenced to a fine of $200 each for each charge or in default ten days` imprisonment for each charge. The court further ordered that all tapes seized be forfeited to the complainant for destruction.
The evidence adduced by the prosecution was as follows. On 25 February 1983, the police, armed with a search warrant, and in the company of representatives of the record company, entered and searched the shop premises of a firm known as Supreme Record Centre at Lucky Plaza. The party identified and picked out 793 cassette tapes on display which were suspected to be pirated copies of songs which were protected by copyright in Singapore. There were two salesgirls at the shop. One of them telephoned the owners to call at the shop but no one turned up.
At the trial, the various cassette tapes which formed the subject matter of the charges were proved to be pirated copies by affidavit evidence and admitted in accordance with s 5 of the Act.
The prosecution also produced in evidence to prove the identities of the partners of Supreme Record Centre a document from the Registry of Companies with the title `INSTANT INFORMATION SERVICE` (exh P20). Counsel for the accused did not object to the admission in evidence of P20. This document was a computer printout obtained from the Registry of Companies and Businesses. It contained, inter alia, the following information: the name of the firm, its constitution (ie sole proprietorship or partnership), its principal place of business and branches, the date of registration, its activities, the names and addresses of the partners and the manager and their dates of entry to and withdrawal from such positions. At the end of this document is a statement as follows: `The above information is updated to seven days from the date shown below.` The date shown below was 5 March 1984 and the document was initialled by an unidentified person `for Registrar of Companies & Businesses`.
The above, in short, was the state of the evidence at the close of the prosecution`s case. Counsel for the accused made a submission of no case to answer on various grounds which have been abandoned in this appeal. However, counsel for the accused, in and for the purpose of his submission, `conceded that the accused had in their possession for sale the alleged pirated copies of gramophone records` (ie within the statutory definition of that term).
The district judge called for the defence. The accused elected not to give evidence and they were accordingly convicted.
On appeal, counsel for the appellants submitted that the conviction was wrong as there was insufficient evidence to support an essential ingredient of the offence, namely `possession` by the appellants. This submission contained two separate elements: (1) there was no evidence to connect the appellants to the cassette tapes and (2) `possession` in s 3 of the Act required mens rea, of which there was no evidence in regard to the appellants.
On the first point, counsel submitted that the computer printout from the Registry of Companies & Businesses was hearsay evidence and that evidence from such Registry, to be admissible, must comply with s 16 of the Business Registration Act (Cap 32) which reads as follows: 
 
(1) Any person may, upon payment of such fees as may be prescribed, require a copy of a certificate of registration issued to any person, or a copy of or an extract from any document filed with the Registrar, to be certified by the Registrar.
 
 
 
 
(2) Any copy or extract given under sub-s (1), if duly certified to be a true copy or extract under the hand of the Registrar, shall be received as prima facie evidence in any proceedings without proof being given that the certificate was signed by the Registrar.
  
 
 
It was submitted that the computer printout did not satisfy the requirement of s 16 of Cap 32 on three grounds (a) it was not duly certified to be a true copy; (b) although initiated by someone for the Registrar, it was not [certified] under the hand of the Registrar: see 
 Waterson`s Trustees v St Giles Boys Club 
 [1943] SC 369; (c) the computer printout was not a document contemplated by s 16 of Cap 32. I agreed with this submission on the said grounds. What s 16 contemplates is a `copy of or an extract from any document filed with the Registrar`. The Instant Information Sheet contained information retrieved from a data base. The data base itself holds and is a record of all the relevant information abstracted from documents filed with the Registry. The computer printout was not a copy of or an extract from any document filed in the Registry. It was, as conceded by the deputy public prosecutor, an original document. It contained information retrieved from some kind of data base or a memory bank of a computer. But it was an original document containing evidence which was hearsay. Therefore, even if the Registrar had, in this case, purported to certify under his hand the Instant Information Sheet as a true copy of the documents filed in the Registry, it would not have complied with s 16. Had he purported to certify the Instant Information Sheet to have been an extract, it would have been arguable whether the certification would be correct in point of fact as a document containing abstracted information might not be an extract for the purpose of the Act.
The deputy public prosecutor, in reply, submitted that exh P20 was tendered under s 35 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). This section provides for the admissibility in any proceedings of computer printouts as evidence of the facts stated therein of which direct oral evidence would be admissible if four conditions relating to the statement and the computer in question are satisfied. This submission had no merit as the prosecution had not adduced any evidence to satisfy any of the four conditions.
The deputy public prosecutor also contended that even if exh P20 were wrongly admitted the prosecution had made out a case to answer on the grounds that the defence counsel (1) had not objected to the admission of exh P20 and had conducted his defence on the assumption that the accused persons were, at the material time, the partners of Supreme Record Centre and (2) had in his submission conceded that the accused were in possession of the pirated tapes.
I did not accept this submission. On the first point, it is clear law that inadmissible evidence does not become admissible because, of failure of counsel to object to its admission. On the second ground, counsel`s concession was, submitted by counsel for the appellants, made on the assumption (wrongly, as it turned out) that there was admissible evidence to prove that the accused persons were the partners of the firm. In any event, where the prosecution has failed to prove a case which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction, then, in my view, the prosecution may not rely on counsel`s submission (which, strictly speaking, is merely his view on the evidence, and may be wrong, as in this case) to provide the requisite additional evidence to prove its case. As it turned out in this case, this piece of evidence ie the identities of the partners, was vital to the prosecution`s case. Without it, an essential ingredient of each of the charges was not proved.
As her final submission, the deputy public prosecutor contended that any error in the admission in evidence of exh P20 had not occasioned a failure of justice and that s 396(c) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) applied to this case. Counsel for the appellants contended otherwise and referred to 
 R 
 
 v 
 
 Tay Choon Huat 
 [1947] MLJ xxiii where Murray-Aynsley CJ held that the improper admission of a chemist`s certificate resulting in the conviction of the accused for strong dutiable liquor on his licensed premises could not be said not to have occasioned a failure of justice.
In my view, s 396 had no application where the prosecution had not proved an essential ingredient of an offence. This was not a case where the improper admission of exh P20 had occasioned a failure of justice in the sense contemplated by s 396. This was a case where, if exh P20 had not been admitted, the prosecution had not crossed the threshold of proving a prima facie case for the accused to answer.
In regard to the concept of possession, counsel for the appellants submitted that even if exh P20 had been properly admitted, it was not, by itself, evidence that each and every one of the accused was in possession of the pirated tapes. It was contended that possession in s 3 of Cap 64 had to be proved against each partner and that there was no presumption that things in the possession of one partner was, in law, in the possession of an other partners. Here, of course, no partner was in the shop premises when the pirated tapes were seized. It was further submitted on the authority of 
 Toh Ah Loh & Anor v R 
 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 54
  that `possession` in order to incriminate a person, must have the following characteristics:
 
 
(a) the person must know the nature of the thing possessed; 
 
(b) he must have in him a power of disposal over the thing; and 
 
(c) he must be conscious of his possession of the thingand that, in the present case, no evidence had been adduced to show that the accused persons had known that the tapes were made in breach of copyright.
  
 
 
I found it unnecessary to decide on these two submissions, although I was not inclined to agree to the second submission that mens rea was necessary to prove an offence under s 3(1) of Cap 64. As to the first submission, whether or not all the partners, or some of them or the managing partner or the manager might be presumed to be in possession of pirated tapes seized in circumstances as here was an issue which would have to be decided at some other time in some other case.
In the circumstances, I found that there was no admissible evidence which proved that the appellants were at the material time the partners of the firm in whose premises the pirated tapes were seized and thus no link was established between the tapes and the appellants.
Accordingly, I allowed the appeal, quashed the conviction and ordered that the fines be refunded to the appellants. The order for the forfeiture and destruction of the pirated tapes was confirmed.

This case concerns the extent of the obligation of a surety under a surety bond for the appearance of an appellant in the High Court for the prosecution of his appeal against sentence of imprisonment.
The bond which was signed by the surety together with the appellant on 29 July 1986 read as follows: 
 
... I, Yap Yin Kok, the abovenamed appellant, having been granted bail pending appeal pursuant to s 247 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113), do hereby bind myself as follows:
 
 
 
(1) That in the event of my failing to lodge a petition of appeal as provided by s 246(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, I shall personally appear at Court No 26, Subordinate Courts at Singapore on the eleventh day after I have received the signed copy of the grounds of judgment provided by s 246(3) of the said Code then and there to surrender myself forthwith to undergo the sentence ordered by the said court, and
 
 
 
 
(2) That in the event of my lodging a petition of appeal as provided by s 246(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code, I shall personally appear at the High Court during the hearing of the appeal then and there to abide by the decision of the said High Court on the said appeal and surrender myself forthwith to undergo the sentence or pay the penalty ordered or which may be ordered by the High Court on the said appeal; 
 
(3) That for so long as this bond shan remain in force, I shall not, without the permission of the court, proceed beyond the limits of Singapore.
  
 
 
... I, Wong Ee Tay, I/C 0753178H of Blk 56 Sims Dr #05-1091 do hereby declare myself surety of the above-named appellant that he shall abide by the conditions of this bond as stated above and in the case of his making default herein, I bind myself jointly and severally to forfeit to the Government the sum of dollars five thousand.
The relevant appeal was fixed for hearing on 28 January 1987 before the Chief Justice. The appellant appeared with his counsel who applied to be discharged. Counsel was discharged. The hearing was then adjourned to a date to be fixed and bail was extended.
By a notice dated 4 March 1987 from the Supreme Court Registry, the appellant and the surety were duly informed that the date of hearing of the appeal had been fixed for 6 April 1987.
On 16 April 1987, both the appellant and the surety failed to appear. The court then ordered that a warrant of arrest be issued against the appellant and also directed that the surety be asked to show cause on his bond. The hearing of the appeal was adjourned to a date which was subsequently fixed as 28 April 1987.
On 28 April 1987, a notice dated the same day was issued by the assistant registrar of the Supreme Court addressed to the surety requiring him to pay the sum of $5,000 for defaulting under his bond or to appear before the High Court on 29 June 1987 to show cause why payment of the said sum should not be enforced against him.
On 28 April 1987, the appellant surrendered himself at the High Court. His appeal against sentence was then heard and dismissed by the court.
On 29 June 1987, the surety`s son attended the hearing to show cause. He submitted a letter stating that his father was in the United States and would be returning at the end of July 1987. He requested for an adjournment so that his father could appear personally.
The surety has now appeared to show cause. His evidence was that on 28 January 1987, he was outside the court room when the hearing of the appeal was adjourned. After the adjournment, he asked the appellant when the next hearing date was and the appellant replied that he did not know as he had not been given a date yet. The surety, who was a dealer in furniture, left Singapore for New York on 19 February 1987 and returned to Singapore on 25 August 1987. When cross-examined, the surety said that he had not expected to be away from Singapore for six months.
Counsel for the surety made two submissions: (1) on the law, that the surety`s obligation under the bond to produce the appellant at the High Court for the hearing of the appeal ended on 28 January 1987 when the appellant appeared before the Chief Justice; and that as bail was extended unilaterally without the surety`s express consent, the surety was no longer bound by the bond; (2) on the facts, since the surety had no knowledge of the date of the subsequent hearing, he had shown sufficient cause for the remission of the penalty.
The deputy public prosecutor contended that the surety had no excuse and that his bond covered the duration of the appeal. She referred to that part of the affidavit dated 29 July 1986 made by the surety in connection with the giving of the bond where he deposed: 
 
I am willing and ready to stand as surety for Yap Yin Kok in the sum of dollars five thousand ($5000) until all proceedings relating to the case/s have been disposed of.
 
 
 
I reject the first submission of counsel for the surety that his client`s obligation to produce the appellant at the hearing of the appeal ended on 28 January 1987. The extent of the surety`s obligation under the bond is determined by the terms of the bond. A surety bond is no different from a guarantee given in a civil contract (see 
 R v Southampton Justices, ex p Green 
 
[1976] 1 QB 11
). Any breach of the conditions of the bond gives rise to a forfeiture and the amount forfeited is in the nature of a civil debt. Under s 36(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code, this debt is enforceable by the court by issuing a warrant for the attachment and sale of the property belonging to that person but this remedy does not prevent the Government from enforcing the bond under the Government Proceedings Act (see s 36(5)). Therefore ordinary principles of construction apply in the interpretation of the terms of the bond to determine the extent of the surety`s obligation thereunder.
The relevant part of the bond executed by the surety provides that the surety shall abide by the conditions of the bond which, in this case, were that the appellant: 
 
shall personally appear at the High Court during the hearing of the appeal then and there to abide by the decision of the said High Court on the said appeal and surrender myself forthwith to undergo the sentence or pay the penalty ordered or which may be ordered by the High Court on the said appeal. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In my view, there is no room for doubt as to the meaning of these words. They impose on the surety an obligation to produce the appellant at every stage of the hearing of the appeal, including any adjournments thereof from time to time, for whatever reason, until its final disposal. If the surety did not understand the bond to have this effect, he would not have asked the appellant the date of the next hearing. If I accept counsel`s submission, I have to construe these words to apply to the first appearance only with the consequence that the appellant`s bail has to be extended for every subsequent day of his trial or appeal. That cannot be right. It is true that in this case bail was extended but that was probably applied for as a matter of long practice ex abundanti cautela.
In respect of the obligation of the surety to procure the attendance of the accused at his trial or appeal, it cannot be emphasized too strongly or frequently that the obligation is a very serious one. Donaldson LJ (as he then was) had these observations to make in
 R v Waltham Forest Justices, ex p Parfrey 
 [1980] Cr LR 571: 
 
The obligation entered into by someone who enters into a recognisance as a surety is a very serious obligation indeed. I hope that nothing. I say today will suggest the contrary. There is an obligation on a surety to be fully satisfied that he or she can meet the liability which will arise if the accused person does not surrender to his bail. This failure to surrender is not a theoretical possibility, though a surety may think it is. The unhappy event of arrested persons not surrendering happens frequently. There is a real risk. Indeed it is difficult to conceive of a set of circumstances in which a surety can be absolutely sure that the accused will surrender to his bail. So let no one think that this is an obligation which can be entered into lightly. Furthermore, the burden of satisfying a court that the fun sum should not be forfeit is a very heavy one, so again let no one think that they can simply appear before the magistrates and tell some hard luck story, whereupon the magistrates will say, `Well, be more careful in future.` We are not dealing with that character of obligation at all.
 
 
 
In 
 R v Knightsbridge Crown Court 
 [1980] Cr LR 715, Donaldson LJ said: 
 
It has been said by this court, and by other courts time and again, that entering into suretyship (going bail for someone, to use the common phrase) is an extremely serious matter not to be lightly undertaken, and those who go bail must understand that, if the accused fails to surrender to his bail, it is only in the most exceptional cases that the court will be prepared to modify the prima facie position, which is that the amount for which the person concerned has stood surety will be forfeit in full.
 
 
 
Thus, because of the serious nature of the obligation, it cannot be said: 
 
the mere fact that every effort to secure the appearance of the accused man had been made and that there was no want of diligence involved the proposition that the amount of the obligation should be remitted entirely.
 
 
 
per Donaldson LJ in 
 ex p Parfrey 
.
What degree of diligence has the surety shown in this case? On a scale of 10, probably one. He had merely asked the appellant when the new date of hearing was and on being told that it had not been given yet, he went to New York. The notice of hearing was sent to his home address. In his evidence, he has not denied receiving it. During his long sojourn overseas, he appeared to have done nothing at all to keep in touch with the appellant or his son to ensure that any official communication as to the next hearing date was transmitted to him. In contrast, he was able to and did communicate with his son in respect of the notice dated 28 April 1987 to show cause. There was therefore no excuse at all.
This is not an exceptional case for remitting any part of the penalty. The surety must pay the full sum of $5,000.
