Judgment:
 
 
The facts which the parties displayed before the court fall within a narrow compass. The third defendant, a property broker, was the prime mover of the events that brought the parties before the court. Property speculation in Singapore was his sideline. He persuaded his brother, (the second defendant) and the first defendant to purchase two units of office space in the building known as Orchard Towers (""the property"") in Singapore. The purchase price for both units was S$854,900. As in most speculative ventures, it was not the defendants' intention to make an outright payment but apply leverage finance. This brought the plaintiffs into the picture. They agreed to advance $700,000 on the security of the property and a personal guarantee of the third defendant. The third defendant negotiated the loan with the plaintiffs. Eventually the plaintiffs and the defendants retained solicitors to act for them in the preparation and execution of the loan documents.
In the documents their address was given as Suite 11A2, 11th Floor, Yen San Building, 258 Orchard Road, Singapore, which was the office address of the third defendant. Subsequently, the market did not move the way the defendants expected. There was default in the payment of instalments. It became a buyer's market. The property was realised by the plaintiffs by forced sale. There was still a substantial amount due and payable to the plaintiffs. Hence this action.
The Defence
All three defendants refused to pay and raised an unmeritorious but not unfamiliar defence. It was said that the second defendant was at all material times a Malaysian resident in Malaysia. He failed to obtain permission to take the loan. By that fact, it was argued the loan made by the plaintiffs was made illegal by the Exchange Control Act, 1953 of Malaysia and a directive issued by Malaysian authorities. Secondly the loan was illegal under the Bretton Woods Agreement Act (Cap 27) of Singapore. It was submitted that a judgment for the plaintiffs would be contrary to public policy of Singapore and it would jeopardise the friendly foreign relations between Singapore and Malaysia.
The court must be alive to what the implications would be if the defendants' contentions are right. They could be raised in hundreds of transactions in which foreigners raise loans in Singapore. It will encourage unscrupulous borrowers to raise that as a stalk defence. Bankers and others interested in commerce will find it necessary to investigate the intricacies of foreign law before they transact any business with foreigners, or purchase from or sell goods to a foreign country. This is not conducive to fair dealing in business. The defence requires careful consideration.
Illegality Point No.1 (Foreign Exchange Control Law)
An analysis of the authorities on the matter leads to the conclusion that the defence of illegality on the facts of this case has no place in the scheme of things under our law. In 1987 well after this action was set down for trial A P Rajah J in Four Seas Communication Bank v Sim See Kee < 1990 > 3 MLJ 226 rejected the points of defence taken as in this case. In that case the plaintiffs a bank incorporated in Singapore gave overdraft facilities to the defendant a Malaysian. The overdraft account was operated in Singapore dollars in Singapore. Summary judgment was obtained by the plaintiffs against the defendant for moneys advanced and credit facilities extended. The defendant appealed against the summary judgment given by the Registrar on the ground that the loan was not enforceable due to (i) a breach of s 4 of the Exchange Control Act 1953 of Malaysia and (ii) a breach of Article VIII s 2(b) of the Bretton Woods Agreement Order 1966 read with Bretton Woods Agreement Act (Cap 27) of Singapore. A P Rajah J in dismissing the defendant's appeal held that based on the facts the proper law of the contract was that of Singapore. He applied the statement of the law in Paragraph 5 of Encyclopaedia of Banking Law Vo1 2 1124 against the defendants :
It should further be noted that if the contract is lawful by the proper law and lawful at the place of performance, then it is immaterial that the party liable to perform would by doing so violate the laws of the foreign country in which he is resident or carries on business or of which he is a national. The result is that a borrower or lender could be committed to perform a contract even though performance of the contract violated the laws of the country of its incorporation, eg an exchange control law, provided that there is an external proper law and the illegality does not arise where payments have to be made.
It was submitted by the defendants in this case that the decision of A P Rajah J did not bind me and the decision of House of Lords in Regazzoni v Sethia < 1958 > AC 301 was not considered by the learned Judge.
True, the decision of A P Rajah J is not binding on me but the decision reflects the true law and reason. Further his decision was not discordant with Regazzoni v Sethia. Let us look at the concepts.
When courts are asked not to enforce an agreement because the performance on the dependence of the common law doctrine of illegality as distinct from statutory law, a line of demarcation must be drawn between lex fori and foreign law. In the former case everyone before the tribunal is deemed to know the lex fori for ignorance of the law is no excuse. Foreign law however is fact and ignorance of fact is excusable. Ignorati facti excusat, ignonantia juris no excusat. Because foreign law is fact it must be pleaded and proved but not the lex fori.
Thus in Miller v Karlinski (1945) 62 TLR 85 the plaintiff and the defendant entered into an employment contract which involved a fraud on the revenue. The parties were ignorant of the illegal nature of the transaction. The court of appeal held that where parties enter into arrangements which would be lawful the courts would not entertain an action to enforce them even if the parties are ignorant of the illegality. In an earlier case, Waugh v Morris (1873) LR 8 QB 202, Blackburn J said : ""where a contract is to do a thing which cannot be peformed without violation of law, it is void, whether the parties knew the law or not."" The law in these cases was the lex fori.
Contrast that with Fielding & Platt Ltd v Najjar < 1969 > 1 WLR 357. The defendant in that case, a Lebanese citizen, had a special fondness for false invoices. He ordered goods from an English manufacturer. He wanted the English manufacturing company to render an invoice for half the cost, instead of the whole: so as to save customs duties. He asked the English company to write a false letter (which he drafted) to delude the Lebanese customs authorities. The English company refused. When the English company sued the defendant in England for price of goods the defendant raised the defence that the contract was tainted with illegality under Lebanese law. The defence failed because the suggested illegality originated with the defendant and there was no evidence that the English company was knowingly a party to any illegality. In the earlier case of Foster v Driscoll < 1929 > 1 KB 470 Sankey LJ said at 518 :
In my view the present position of the law is that the mere fact that a vendor of goods knows that the purchaser proposes to run them into a country where they are prohibited by some revenue law is not sufficient to render the contract of sale illegal, but if beyond mere knowledge the vendor actively engages in an adventure to get the goods into such country, the Court will not resist the parties to the adventure by entertaining or settling any dispute between the parties arising out of the contract.
In deciding the question of enforcement of an agreement involving breach of foreign law a two-fold test should be applied: First whether it would be unlawful under the law of the place of performance and secondly whether the person seeking the enforcement had at the time of making the contract knowledge that foreign law would be breached by performance of the contract. In Regazzoni v Sethia it was pleaded that ""the said contract, if any, was to the appellant's knowledge an illegal contract and/or was void and unenforceable in that it had for its purpose an object which was illegal and/or contrary to public policy namely, the taking and shipment of jute goods from India where the ultimate destination was the Union of South Africa, in breach of a certain Act of the Indian Parliament and Regulations made thereunder"". Sellers J in giving judgment for the defendants said < 1956 > 2 QB 490 at 504 :
In my judgment, this contract to the knowledge of both parties at the time of contracting, could not in fact have been performed without the performance in a foreign and friendly country of an act which was illegal by the law of that country, and I must hold the contract to be invalid and unenforceable.
The headnote which accurately reflects the decision of the Court of Appeal states :
While the English courts will not enforce foreign revenue or penal laws, they will not entertain an action based on a transaction which is knowingly intended to involve a breach of such laws; accordingly, the appeal must fail even if the same rules applied to political as to revenue laws and this was such a law.
The House of Lords based its decision to dismiss the plaintiff's appeal on the finding and principle that the performance of the contract would be illegal in India the place of performance of the contract and the appellant/plaintiff had knowledge of the illegality.
It was submitted for the defendants that even if the court found that the plaintiffs had no knowledge of s 4 (2) of the Exchange Control Act of Malaysia the court in order to ensure that the intention of s 4 of Malaysian Exchange Control Act was not defeated should rule in favour of the defendants. They cited Re An Arbitration Between Mahmoud and Ispahani < 1921 > 2 KB 716. In that case the Seeds, Oils and Fats Order 1919 made under the Defence of the Realm Regulations prohibited sale and purchase of linseed oil whether situated within or without the United Kingdom without a licence issued by the Food Controller to be obtained both by the buyer and the seller. The plaintiff who had a licence sold the linseed oil to the defendant in the mistaken belief that the defendant in fact had a licence. The defendant subsequently refused to accept delivery of the linseed oil on the ground that the contract was illegal as he had no licence under the order. In a claim for damages for non-acceptance of the linseed oil the English Court of Appeal held that as the defendant had no licence and the contract of sale was prohibited by the order it was illegal. As the prohibition was in the public interest no claim can be made under the contract. Scrutton LJ said:
The contract was absolutely prohibited. If an act is prohibited by statute for the public benefit, the Court must enforce the prohibition, even though the person breaking the law relies upon his own illegality.
It will be observed that the English Court of Appeal was enforcing the lex fori and accordingly it was outside the principles of Regazzoni v Sethia outlined above. There can be no doubt that had the court was enforcing foreign law the decision would have been different.
It was therefore vital that the pleadings in the case at hand declare and cogent evidence be produced to show that the performance of the contract would be illegal in Singpaore, the place of its performance, and that the plaintiffs were aware of the illegality.
In this case there was no allegation in the pleading that the performance of the loan contract was illegal by the law of Singapore. In any event even if its performance involved Malaysia it was not pleaded or proved that the plaintiff had knowledge of the Malaysian law.
A nebulous suggestion was made to the effect that an employee of the plaintiffs was aware that the first and second defendants were foreign nationals and were not resident in Singapore. The employee, according to the defendants in order to avoid the inconvenience of having to go through the foreign exchange processing suggested that the borrowers should not be disclosed to be foreign residents. Accordingly a Singapore address was recorded. This was validly refuted by the plaintiffs by their testimony. In any event the knowledge of the employee cannot be imputed to the plaintiffs. Furthermore the ground was so vague that no reliance can be placed on it. There was no question of the parties transgressing the foreign exchange laws of Singapore. Thus there was no illegality under the laws of Singapore and in any case the plaintiff had no knowledge of any illegality under Malaysian law.
Illegality Point No. 2 (Bretton Woods Agreement)
In a capsulized form the Bretton Woods Agreement point is this : The Bretton Woods Agreement Act (Cap 27) is a Singapore statute. The Act read with the Bretton Woods Agreement Order 1966 gave the Bretton Woods Agreement the force of law in Singapore. The purpose of the Agreement was for Singapore to respect the currency laws of all other countries which had legislated a similar obligation on the basis of reciprocity. It is a cross-border legislation to enforce the currency laws of another country. Malaysia has a reciprocal enactment: Bretton Woods Agreement Ordinance 1957. Under the Singapore Act foreign currency laws caught by the Bretton Woods Agreement must be given the same effect as domestic laws. The principles summarised in relation to foreign laws do not apply to currency laws caught by the Bretton Woods Agreement. The difference between illegality point and Bretton Woods point is that the former depends on knowledge whereas Bretton Woods does not. Article VIII s 2 (b) of the Agreement reads as follows :
Exchange contracts which involve the currency of any member and which are contrary to the exchange control regulations of any member maintained or imposed consistently with this agreement shall be unenforceable in the territories of any member.
In Batra v Ebrahim (unreported) discussed in United City Merchants v Bank of Canada < 1982 > QB 208, CA, the plaintiff, an Indian resident in England, agreed to pay in sterling to the defendant (another Indian resident in England) in exchange for Indian rupees to be paid in India. Both England and India had signed the Bretton Woods Agreement. The English Court of Appeal held that the agreement to exchange sterling for rupees was exchange contract and unenforceable by virtue of the English Bretton Woods Agreements Act.
The term ""exchange contracts"" has received varying interpretations. In Wilson, Smithett and Cope Ltd v Terruzzi < 1976 > QB 683 Kerr J took the view that it referred to contracts for the exchange of currencies. According to F.A. Mann's The Legal Aspect of Money, 4th Ed, Nussbaum in Money in the Law, National and International suggested that it ""contemplated contracts to exchange the currency of one country for that of another as well as contracts which are monetary transactions in disguise"". Finally, in United City Merchants v Royal Bank of Canada < 1983 > AC 168 Lord Diplock with whom four other law lords agreed held that the expression ""exchange contracts"" in Article VIII s 2 (b) of the Bretton Woods Agreement is ""confined to contracts to exchange the currency of one country for the currency of another; it does not include contracts entered into in connection with sale of goods which require the conversion of the buyer of one currency into another in order to enable him to pay the purchase price. The court in considering the application of the provision should look at the substance of the contracts and not at the form. It should not enforce a contract that is a mere monetary transaction in disguise.""
In Four Seas Communications Bank Ltd v Sim See Kee A P Rajah J held that loans and advances made by a bank in Singapore and in Singapore currency could not be an exchange contract because it was not a contract to exchange the currency of one country for another. The fact that the borrower was a Malaysian citizen residing in Malaysia was not pertinent to the issue of his liability to the bank.
Applying the law stated above the transaction between the plaintiffs and the defendants was not an exchange contract. Malaysian currency did not feature in the transaction at all. It was a loan connected with the purchase of land very much similar to purchase of goods mentioned by Lord Dipolock. It was not a monetary transaction.
The defences raised in this case had nothing attractive about them. The defendants stated that one of them strayed from the straight and narrow way and sought to avoid a legitimate claim. The courts should be wary of such defences. Four Seas Communications Bank Ltd v Sim See Kee is a highly satisfactory decision and I have no hesitation in applying it to this case. There will, therefore be judgment for the plaintiffs for S$311,810.73, interest at 6% from 28 August 1991 and costs in favour of the plaintiffs.
