s 5(a) Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49)
 
 
Cur Adv Vult
 
On 21 July 1991 the appellant was arrested after a police raid at Block 81 MacPherson Lane #08-33, Singapore. Investigations showed the appellant to be involved in the illegal collection of 10,000 characters lottery tickets. The documents seized during the raid contained records of bets amounting to 3,700 `big` and 11,000 `small` tickets valued at $13,620 approximately. The appellant was charged with the offence of assisting in carrying on a public lottery under s 5(a) of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49) (`the Act`) and he pleaded guilty. He was sentenced to six months` imprisonment and a fine of $50,000 or in default, three months` imprisonment. The appellant now appeals against the sentence.
Section 5(a) of the Act provides that any person who 
 
assists in the carrying on of a public lottery ... shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $20,000 and not more than $200,000 and shall also be punished with imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years.
 
 
 
The minimum sentence that could be meted out under s 5(a) is therefore a fine of $20,000 and one day`s imprisonment.
The main ground of the appellant`s appeal rested on the argument that the sentence imposed on him was manifestly excessive having regard to sentencing precedents. In particular, the court was referred to the case of 
 PP v Ang Nguan Tong & Anor, 
, 
PP v Ang Nguan Tong & Anor
 (Unreported) which was considered by the district judge. In that case, the first accused, who pleaded guilty to a charge under s 5(a), was sentenced to eight months` imprisonment and fined $100,000 or in default, ten months` imprisonment. Counsel for the appellant pointed out that the first accused in that case had been described as an `operator` of an illegal lottery, as opposed to being a `collector` of bets, like the appellant. The argument appeared to be that being an `operator` was a more serious offence than being a `collector` and that sentencing practice should reflect the difference. Thus, by way of contrast, the court was also referred to 
 PP v Lee Kim Hia 
, 
PP v Lee Kim Hia
 (Unreported) in which a `collector` of 10,000 character lottery tickets was sentenced to two months` imprisonment and fined $30,000.
Upon an examination of the relevant cases, however, it would appear that the terms `operator` and `collector` are often loosely used without any satisfactory explanation as to what they really mean. What does an `operator` do that a `collector` does not? Is the `operator` the person responsible for organizing and supervising the illegal public lottery in question? Does an `operator` recruit the `collectors` and issue them instructions? I am of the view that if terms such as `operator` and `collector` are to be used at all, adequate details should be given of the activities in which an accused has engaged; otherwise the use of such terms is of no help in itself and may even be misleading.
In the present case, having regard to the above observations, I do not find it instructive to draw comparisons between the sentences imposed in cases such as 
 PP v Ang Nguan Tong & Anor 
, 
PP v Ang Nguan Tong & Anor
 (Unreported) and 
 PP v Lee Kim Hia 
. 
PP v Lee Kim Hia
 (Unreported) In particular, it must be reiterated that the sentence imposed in any case depends on the particular facts of that case. Bearing in mind the vagueness of the terms `operator` and `collector`, it is not enough in the present case to say, for example, that the appellant was a `collector` just like the accused in 
 PP v Lee Kim Hia, 
 
PP v Lee Kim Hia
 (Unreported) and therefore that the sentence imposed on the appellant should not greatly exceed that imposed on the accused in 
 PP v Lee Kim Hia 
. 
PP v Lee Kim Hia
 (Unreported) For one thing, if the amounts involved are relevant, the bets collected by the accused in 
 PP v Lee Kim Hia 
, 
PP v Lee Kim Hia
 (Unreported) amounted to $2,298 while in the present case the bets collected by the appellant were valued at $13,620.
I have also reviewed the other cases which were cited as examples of sentencing precedents in respect of s 5(a) of the Act. For the sake of clarity, I now set out in brief their crucial features.

 (Unreported) the accused, who had been found guilty of collecting bets on the `chap-ji-kee` lottery amounting to a value of $810, was sentenced to two months` imprisonment and a fine of $30,000 or in default, 12 months` imprisonment. She had a previous conviction for gambling. Her appeal against sentence was dismissed.

The mitigating factors raised were that he was a first offender; he had been in financial difficulties; and he was the sole breadwinner of his family. His appeal against sentence was dismissed.

She was sentenced to five months` imprisonment and a fine of $50,000 or in default, 12 months` imprisonment. The mitigating factors raised were that she was a first offender; she had two young children aged three and one respectively; she had been assisting Phang Tee Ann because he was her brother and not for motives of personal gain. On appeal, her sentence of imprisonment was reduced to two weeks.
In 
 Tay Khoon Hoo v PP 
, 
Tay Khoon Hoo v PP
 (Unreported) the accused, who had collected bets amounting to $33,845.40 for the `unlimited sweep`, was sentenced to two months` imprisonment and a fine of $100,000 or in default, one year`s imprisonment. He was at the time of conviction 52 years old and had three school-going children. It was his first offence. His appeal against sentence was dismissed.
In regard to the above-mentioned cases, I would also repeat the observation I made earlier, which is that I do not think it is useful in such cases for terms such as `collector` and `operator` to be loosely bandied about, unless some description is given of the different activities involved and of the lines of demarcation between the two terms.
Having reviewed the above cases, I am of the view that the sentence of six months` imprisonment and a fine of $50,000 or in default, three months` imprisonment in the present case was not contrary to sentencing precedents. It was certainly far from being manifestly excessive.
One should also remember that the offence in question, ie that of assisting in carrying on a public lottery, is one where a court is particularly concerned to impose deterrent sentences. Illegal lotteries are a public evil which are unfortunately widespread in Singapore. As the district judge noted in his grounds of decision, the lucrative nature of these illegal lotteries means that those who participate in them are usually undeterred by the imposition of fines alone. Thus, although the minimum sentence of imprisonment under s 5(a) is one day, a court may be justified in imposing a longer custodial sentence for deterrent purposes.
Counsel for the appellant further submitted that the district judge failed to adequately consider the mitigating factors in this case. A perusal of the notes of evidence shows that the mitigating factors raised by the appellant before the district judge were that he was a taxi driver; that he had to support his family; and that he suffered from diabetes. These factors were taken into consideration by the district judge, as his grounds of decision show. Counsel for the appellant argued that the appellant had not been able to put forward all relevant mitigating factors before the judge because he had had no legal representation then. It appears to me, however, that the mitigating plea put forward by counsel before this court is in essence similar to that put forward by the appellant before the district court, with perhaps the exception that the medical problems the appellant is said to suffer from are now stated to be `joint pains and gout, as well as ... some back problems`. Having regard to the above, I am of the view that the appellant was neither hampered nor prejudiced in not being legally represented before the district judge. I find that the district judge had all relevant mitigating factors before him and that he took adequate consideration of them.
I would point out that s 261 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) provides that `no judgment, sentence or order of a district court or magistrate`s court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case`. For the reasons given above, I am unable to find that the trial judge erred in law or in fact, or that the sentence he imposed was manifestly excessive.
Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal by the public prosecutor against the decision of the learned magistrate to acquit the respondent on the second charge after he had called for the defence. The respondent was charged as follows: 
 
First charge
 
 
 
You,
 
 
 
Kum Chee Cheong (SNRIC 1676842/A)
 
 
 
are charged that you, on 11 April 1987, at about 10.50am at Thomson Road, did use motor car No QEJ7371X for which a vehicle licence was not in force (declared as non-user from 28 February 1987 to 31 January 1988) and you have thereby committed an offence under s 15 and punishable under s 15(a) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276).
 
 
 
Second charge
 
 
 
You,
 
 
 
Kum Chee Cheong (SNRIC 1676842/A)
 
 
 
are charged that you, on 11 April 1987, at about 10.50am at Thomson Road, did use motor car No QEJ7371X whilst there was not in force in relation to the use of the said vehicle such a policy of insurance in respect of the third party risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks And Compensation) Act (Cap 189), and you have thereby committed an offence under s 3(1) and punishable under s 3(2) of the aforesaid Act.
 
 
 
The respondent pleaded guilty to the first charge. He was convicted and ordered to pay a fine of $500 on the first charge. The respondent claimed trial on the second charge.
At the end of the trial, the learned magistrate found that the essential ingredients of the second charge had not been proved at the close of the prosecution`s case. Saying he should not have called for the defence, he acquitted and discharged the respondent on the second charge. The public prosecutor is appealing against the order of acquittal.
 The prosecution`s case
The prosecution`s case was that on 11 April 1987, Toh Sew Lan, W/Cpl 3919, attached to the Registry of Vehicles, checked motor car No QEJ7371X which was then being driven by the respondent. She found an expired road tax disc being displayed. She booked him for the offence of not displaying `a valid road tax disc`. She did not give evidence saying that she requested the respondent to produce his certificate of insurance. She filed her report for the offence of `non-display of valid road tax disc`.
The investigator with the Registry of Vehicles, Najir Ahmad, testified that the vehicle had been declared by its previous registered owner to be a non-user for the period from 28 February 1987 to 31 January 1988. Messrs Seng Lee Impex Pte Ltd were the registered owners of car No QEJ7371X from 30 March 1987. On being given the report, the investigator assumed that because the vehicle had been declared a non-user, there was no valid insurance policy. The investigator sent two letters to the respondent. On 6 May 1987, he sent a letter to the respondent`s address at Joan Road asking the respondent to see him in connection with the report. The report refers to road tax. On 25 May 1987, a further letter was sent to the same address. The respondent was again asked to see the investigator over his failure to display a valid vehicle licence. The letters do not make any request for a certificate of insurance or refer to an insurance policy. The respondent did not respond to the letters. The investigator admitted that he would not be aware if a cover note had been issued for the car.
It was part of the prosecution`s case that a cheque was paid to the Registry of Vehicles on 11 April 1987 to renew the road tax. The reverse side of the cheque carries the number of motor vehicle No QEJ7371X and the rubber stamp of the Registry of Vehicles. When the cheque was dishonoured, cash was paid. A certificate of insurance must have been produced under the Road Traffic (Third-Party Insurance) Rules 1946. This inference was not drawn by the learned magistrate but it is open to this court to do so. Whether a certificate of insurance was produced to the Registrar under r 10 of the Road Traffic (Third-Party Insurance) Rules 1946 when the application was made to renew the road tax was a fact `especially` within the knowledge of the Registrar.
 Respondent`s case
The respondent`s case was that he was a marketing executive. In April 1987 he was employed by Accent Properties Pte Ltd and had his own car. Seng Lee Impex Pte Ltd, which was managed by his brother, was the owner of QEJ7371X. To satisfy the requirements of the Companies Act, his name was used, but he did not concern himself with the affairs of the company. On 11 April 1987, he was driving QEJ7371X on an errand for his brother. That was the first time he was driving the car and he did not know whether it had a valid road tax disc or a valid policy of insurance. He did not receive the letters sent by the investigator. He had sold his house to which the two letters had been sent in June 1987.
The respondent had told his brother about the invalid road tax disc. As far as he was aware, the road tax was paid and the car was subsequently sold. If the road tax was paid, he thought the insurance must also have been paid. In cross-examination he was asked: 
 
 
Q: Can you show that the car was covered? 
 
A: Yes, but I need the time. 
 
Q: (Put) That there was no insurance coverage? 
 
A: Yes, I believe there was insurance coverage. We had the cover note.
  
 
 
It may well be that a cover note was obtained on 11 April 1987 after the respondent had told his brother about the invalid licence. On the other hand, a cover note may already have been in existence and the application for the vehicle licence made on the afternoon when the failure to renew the road tax was discovered.
At the end of the trial, the learned magistrate found that the prosecution had not adduced any evidence to establish the ingredients of the charge against the respondent. With commendable courage, he has admitted in his grounds of decision that `On hindsight, I should not have called for the defence.` He then acquitted and discharged the respondent.
 The appeal
The appeal is on the ground that the learned magistrate erred in law and in fact in finding that the burden of proving the non-existence of a policy of insurance rests on the prosecution when in fact the burden of proof lay not with the prosecution but with the respondent, as s 108 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) (`the Act`) provides that: `When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him.` The other grounds were not seriously pursued by the prosecution, although the finding of the learned magistrate that an ingredient of the charge had not been established was also challenged.
Two questions have to be decided: 
 
 
(a) whether the prosecution had made out a prima facie case; and 
 
(b) whether mere proof of driving (that not being an unlawful act) is enough for the prosecution to rely on s 108 of the Act.
  
 
 
The appellant relied on the English cases of 
R v Oliver
 
[1944] KB 68
 and 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 and the case of 
PP v Koh Chin Mong
 
 
[1962] MLJ 104
  where Adams J took the magistrate and counsel to task and said: 
 
I was under the impression that this matter had been settled once and for all by the case of 
 PP v Chin Yoke
 
 
 
[1940] MLJ 47
  which was followed in 
 Khoo Teck Yam v PP
 
[1955]MLJ 112
. If any more support were needed for the proposition that in a prosecution for an offence of doing something for which a licence is required under the Road Traffic Ordinance, it is unnecessary to call a licensing officer to prove the non-issue of the licence and that the burden is on the accused to negative the averment of being unlicensed by producing in this case (a) the vehicle licence, and (b) the certificate of insurance, there are the two further cases of 
 R v Oliver
 and 
 John v Humphreys
. All the above cases apply in practice the proposition of law laid down by s 106 of the Evidence Ordinance of which both the learned magistrate and Mr Paramjothy must be well aware.
 
 
 
It is useful to examine the cases cited by Adams J. In 
PP v Chin Yoke
 
 
[1940] MLJ 47
  the prosecution had, inter alia, adduced evidence: 
 
 
(a) that the respondent was driving a motor cycle; 
 
(b) that the respondent failed to produce his licence when called upon to do so; and 
 
(c) that the motor cycle was driven by the respondent without the consent of the owner after the owner had left his motor cycle outside his house.
  
 
 
The question of whether there was a necessity to call a licensing officer to prove the non-issue of a licence was considered in the above matrix of facts. The court, construing s 106 of the Evidence Enactment (Cap 10) which provides, `When any fact is especially within the knowledge of any person, the burden of proving that fact is upon him`, said [at p 48]: 
 
This section and others of a similar nature codify what is and has been for years the English law in this respect. ... The burden is, of course, on the accused to negative the averment of being unlicensed, by producing his licence.
 
 
 
It is important to note that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case to shift the onus of proof.
In 
Khoo Teck Yam v PP
 
 
[1955] MLJ 112
  there was a third-party insurance policy but the policy did not cover the carriage of goods in connection with any trade or business. The prosecution had adduced prima facie evidence that the policy did not cover the use of vehicles. We are therefore left with the English cases.
On much the same kind of facts as in 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 on which the appellant relied, the problem was considered by both the High Court and the Supreme Court in Eire. Both courts ruled to the contrary in 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 In the case of 
Garda Michael McGowan v Arthur Carville
 
[1960] IR 330
 the defendant was the driver of a motor van when he was stopped and requested to produce his driving licence which he failed to do so then, but stated that he would do so later. The defendant was charged with driving the vehicle without having a driving licence, contrary to s 22(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1933 of Ireland. He did not answer the charge nor was he represented, and the complaint was heard in his absence. No evidence was given as to whether or not he had produced his driving licence at the station as he had earlier promised to do. The district justice dismissed the complaint, being of the opinion that the onus was on the complainant to prove that the defendant had no driving licence, and that he had failed to discharge the onus. The case was stated for the opinion of the High Court as to whether he was correct in law in dismissing the charge. The High Court held that the district justice was correct in law in dismissing the summons.
The court said that in 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 Ormerod J who had expressed some hesitation, considered himself bound by 
R v Oliver
 
[1944] KB 68
 The Irish court said that it was not bound byR v Oliver1 and pointed out that 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 had `some unusual features`. In a letter to the justices purporting to be written by the defendant, the defendant in 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 admitted that he had no licence.
The Chief Justice, at p 343, said: 
 
Proof of the fact that a person does not possess a valid driving licence may not, of course, be a simple matter. ... On the other hand, acceptance of the `peculiar knowledge` principle, even in the modified and restricted form suggested by Mr McCarthy, would have curious consequences. If he is correct, every person who drives a mechanically propelled vehicle on a public road is, prima facie, committing an offence. There is no need to stop him and ask for his licence. Provided that he is seen and recognized. or can otherwise be identified, he can be prosecuted and made to establish his innocence by proof that he had at the material time a valid driving licence. It is no real or satisfactory answer to say that this would not be done except in a proper case. That is quite possibly true; but true or not I am not in favour of unnecessarily adopting any principle which could turn out to be a dangerous weapon in the wrong hands. If dangerous weapons are left available for use they are apt to fall into the wrong hands.
 
 
 
The court held that in the absence of evidence that the defendant had failed to produce his licence, the proper view for the district justice to have taken was that the onus of proof had not shifted, that it still rested on the complainant and had not been discharged.
In 
Buchanan v Moore
 
[1963] NI 194
 the accused was charged with using a motor vehicle without insurance contrary to the statutory provisions of the Road Traffic Act (Northern Ireland) 1955. He was further charged with failing to produce a certificate of insurance as required by s 61(3) of the Act. Both summonses were heard together.
Evidence was given by a constable that he saw a motor car parked at the side of the road. There was no one in the car and there was no tax disc displayed. Five minutes later, the constable spoke to the defendant who admitted that the car belonged to him and that it had not been taxed. When asked for his driver`s licence and certificate of insurance, he said that he had not got them on him but that he would produce them at the police station within five days. He told the constable that he was selling the car that day and that it was insured. The defendant failed to produce the licence or the certificate when subsequently interviewed.
The prosecution submitted that it was a case where the negative averment that the defendant was not insured was sufficient to put on him the onus of proving that he was covered by insurance as this was a matter peculiarly within his own knowledge. The magistrate declined to accept the submission and dismissed the charge of using a motor vehicle without a policy of insurance. On the charge of failing to produce the certificate of insurance, he fined the defendant o10. The case was stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal as to whether he was correct in holding that the prosecution must prove the absence of insurance cover.
Lord MacDermott LCJ stated the law in the following terms: 
 
It appears to me to be a well-established rule that where one of the elements of a criminal charge consists of an averment of a negative nature, and where the averment relates to a fact which is peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, then the burden of disproving that averment falls upon the defendant.
 
 
 
On the authorities it would seem that the burden may either rest upon the defendant ab initio, or may shift to him after the prosecution has proved a prima facie case. The decision in 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 which related to a driving licence, seems to indicate that in such a case the rule would apply, as it were, ab initio.
The other view is that the prosecution has to do something to establish a prima facie case before the rule can be applied. For my own part, I have considerable sympathy with the doubts expressed by Ormerod J in 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 and it may be that in some cases this other view is the right view.
The prosecution had proved that the respondent, when asked to produce, not only failed to produce the certificate at the time when he was stopped by the police or within the next five days, but also that when he was seen on two occasions after the expiry of the five days, he made excuses and still failed to produce the document. The police gave him every opportunity of bringing in the certificate and indeed exercised a considerable degree of patience. His Lordship therefore said: 
 
In this case, however, I do not think it necessary to come to a definite conclusion as to which view should prevail on the facts here, for I find in the case stated that the prosecution clearly proved a sufficient prima facie case to shift the burden to the respondent. ...
 
 
 
Lord MacDermott LCJ was doubtful about the validity of the prosecution`s submission that with charges of this kind, there was no need to establish a prima facie case. The court did not rule on this point because the prosecution had proved a prima facie case, but it is clear the court regarded the `other view`, where the prosecution has to establish a prima facie case, as the `right view`.
The Irish cases and the English decisions in 
R v Oliver
 
[1944] KB 68
 and 
John v Humphreys
 
[1955] 1 WLR 325
 were considered by the English Court of Appeal in the case of 
R v Edwards
 
[1975] QB 27
 where the defendant was convicted of selling intoxicating liquor without a justices` licence contrary to s 160(1)(a) of the Licensing Act 1964. On his appeal against conviction on the ground that since the prosecution had access to the register of licences under s 34(2) of the Licensing Act, the prosecution should have called evidence to prove that there was no justices` licence in force, the court, dismissing the appeal, held that there was an exception to the fundamental rule of criminal law that the prosecution had to prove every element of the offence charged, which was limited to offences arising under enactments which prohibited the doing of an act but subject to provisoes or exemptions; and that its application was not dependent upon either the fact, or the presumption, that the defendant had peculiar knowledge enabling him to prove the positive of a negative averment. The court said [at p 40]: 
 
Whenever the prosecution seeks to rely on this exception, the court must construe the enactment under which the charge is laid. If the true construction is that the enactment prohibits the doing of acts, subject to provisoes, exemptions and the like, then the prosecution can rely upon the exception. ...
 
 
 
Two consequences follow from the view we have taken as to the evolution and nature of this exception. First, as it comes into operation upon an enactment being construed in a particular way, there is no need for the prosecution to prove a prima facie case of lack of excuse, qualification or the like; and secondly, what shifts is the onus: it is for the defendant to prove that he was entitled to do the prohibited act. What rests on him is the legal or, as it is sometimes called, the persuasive burden of proof. It is not the evidential burden.
Section 108 of the Act, however, cannot be properly construed by relying on the decision in 
R v Edwards
 
[1975] QB 27
 alone.
The Supreme Court of India considered s 106 (our s 108) and s 101 (our s 103) of the Evidence Act in the case of 
Shambhu Nath Mehra v The State of Ajmer
 
[1956] SC 404
 The appellant had been convicted of offences under s 420 of the Indian Penal Code. The substance of the offences for which he was convicted lay in obtaining various sums of money from the government for two journeys by train. The money represented the second-class railway fares for the journeys. The allegation against him was that either he did not travel at all between those places on the relevant dates, or, if he did, that he did not pay the fare.
The only question was whether he paid the second-class fares which he later claimed and obtained from the government. The only proof that was adduced was that no second-class tickets were issued at the Ajmer Railway Station on the relevant dates. This was proved by the booking clerk but the witness also testified that tickets are not always issued and that passengers can pay the fare on the train, and that if the second class is fully booked, no further tickets are issued.
The railway registers and books would have shown whether or not any such payments were made on those dates, and the state could have proved the absence of such payments as easily as it was able to prove, from the same sort of material, that no second-class tickets were issued. Instead of doing that, the state contented itself by saying that no second-class tickets were issued and relied on illustration (b) to s 106 of the Evidence Act, contending that the burden of proving that the accused did pay the second-class fares was on him.
The court said: 
 
Section 106 is an exception to s 101. Section 101 lays down the general rule that in a criminal case the burden of proof is on the prosecution and s 106 is certainly not intended to relieve it of that duty. On the contrary, it is designed to meet certain exceptional cases in which it would be impossible, or at any rate disproportionately difficult, for the prosecution to establish facts which are `especially` within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience. The word `especially` stresses that. It means facts that are pre-eminently or exceptionally within his knowledge. If the section were to be interpreted otherwise, it would lead to a very startling conclusion that in a murder case the burden lies on the accused to prove that he did not commit the murder because who could know better than he whether he did or did not.
 
 
 
The appellant`s case was that two-and-a-half years after the alleged offence, `It is humanly impossible to give accurate explanations for the journeys in question after such a lapse of time.`
The court looked at the prosecution`s position: 
 
And what of the prosecution? They have their registers and books, both of the railway and of the department in which the appellant works. They are in a position to know and prove his official movements on the relevant dates. They are in a position to show that no vouchers or receipts were issued for a second-class journey by the guard or conductor of the trains on those days.
 
 
 
This information was as much within their `especial` knowledge as in that of the appellant; indeed it is difficult to see how, with all the relevant books and other material in the possession of the authorities, these facts can be said to be within the `especial` knowledge of the appellant after such a lapse of time however much it may once have been there.
 Duty to ask
Section 16 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks And Compensation) Act (Cap 189)(`the Motor Vehicles Act`) reads: 
 
 
(1) Any person driving a motor vehicle on a road shall on being so required by a police officer give his name and address and the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle and produce his certificate and if he fails to do so he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months: 
 
Provided that if the driver of a motor vehicle within 5 days after the date on which the production of his certificate was so required produces the certificate in person at such police office or police station in Singapore as may have been specified by the driver at the time its production was required he shall not be convicted of an offence under this subsection by reason only of failure to produce his certificate to the police officer. 
 
(2) ... 
 
Provided that a person shall not be ... 
 
(3) It shall be the duty of the owner of a motor vehicle to give such information as he may be required by or on behalf of the Deputy Commissioner of Police to give for the purpose of determining whether the motor vehicle was or was not being driven in contravention of section 3 on any occasion when the driver was required under this section to produce his certificate and if the owner fails to do so he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months. 
 
(4) In this section, `produce his certificate` means produce for examination the relevant certificate of insurance or certificate of security or such other evidence that the motor vehicle is not or was not being driven in contravention of section 3 as may be prescribed.
  
 
 
The section requires a police officer to require any person driving a motor vehicle on a road to `produce his certificate` for examination or such other evidence that the motor vehicle is not or was not being driven in contravention of s 3 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Time is given to produce his certificate. The respondent or the owners of the vehicle were not asked to `produce the certificate` at any time. When the respondent was asked to do so in court for the first time, he wanted time. Time was not given.
Rule 10 of the Road Traffic (Third-Party Insurance) Rules 1946 requires any person applying for the registration of a motor vehicle to produce to the Registrar a certificate of insurance indicating that on the date when the payment of tax is made, there will be in force a policy in relation to the user of the motor vehicle by the applicant. Rule 11(4) of the same rules further provides for the furnishing to the Registrar or to any chief police officer particulars of records the company issuing policies must keep.
Rule 6 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Rules 1960 provides for the evidence that a motor vehicle is not being used in contravention of s 3 of the Motor Vehicles Act to be produced by the owner or driver of such vehicle on the request of a police officer as an alternative to a certificate of insurance.
Adams J who took the magistrate to task in 
PP v Koh Chin Mong
 
 
[1962] MLJ 104
  advised magistrates on the need to make out a prima facie case in 
Re Tan Kheng Cheng
 
 
[1962] MLJ 310
  It was a case of driving a vehicle without there being in force a valid certificate of insurance contrary to s 74 of the same ordinance. Adams J said [at p 310]: 
 
Although the fact that the vehicle is insured is in the knowledge of the defendant or his employer and therefore s 106 of the Evidence Ordinance applies and, once a prima facie case has been made out, it is for the defence to show that he was properly insured, the prosecution must make out a case which, if unrebutted would entitle the court to convict before it can call on the defence. 
 The police must adduce evidence to say that they asked the defendant for his certificate of insurance and that he was unable to produce it or that having asked him for it and inspected it, they found that it did not cover the use for which the vehicle was being put at the time that it was stopped. This, I may say, is most important. I strongly advise magistrates to ask to see both the certificate of insurance and the policy if they do call on the defence. They may very well find that the policy in fact covers the use of the vehicle.
 There was not, therefore, at the end of the case for the prosecution any evidence at all upon which the magistrate could find that a case which if unrebutted would have entitled him to convict the defendant on the second charge, and he should not have called upon the defence. (Emphasis is mine.)
 
 
 
The prosecution had not made out a prima facie case because the prosecution did not require the respondent to produce his certificate which he thereafter failed to do. Mere proof of driving is not enough to shift the burden of proof. The driver must be asked to produce his certificate as required under s 16 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Section 108 of the Act is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its duty to require the respondent to produce his certificate.
The failure of the prosecution to produce the evidence of facts especially within the knowledge of its officials which rested upon it under s 108 of the Act, taken together with the failure to require the production of the insurance certificate, resulted in a failure to establish a prima facie case.
The decision of the learned magistrate on hindsight was more than an act of judicial valour. He put right a wrong that he did when he called upon the respondent to enter his defence.
The appeal is dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an application by the plaintiffs (`Reebok`) against the defendants (`Royal`) in Suit No 1685 of 1988 in which Reebok has sued Royal for, inter alia, damages for infringement of their registered trade mark `REEBOK` in having imported into Singapore shoes bearing the said trade mark which were not of Reebok`s manufacture or origin. Royal has denied that the shoes were counterfeit shoes.
By an order of court dated 23 August 1988 (`the Anton Piller order`), Reebok was given leave to enter a PSA warehouse to, inter alia, (a) locate and remove into the custody of Reebok`s solicitors, shoes bearing the name `REEBOK` in accordance with the terms of the order; and (b) use any articles, materials and documents obtained as a result of the Anton Piller order for the protection of their trade mark rights whether in Singapore or elsewhere.
Upon execution of the Anton Piller order, approximately 35,832 pairs of shoes (`the said shoes`) bearing the name `REEBOK` in six containers were taken into the custody of Reebok`s solicitors on 23 August 1988, subject to their express undertaking to keep them in safe custody. These shoes, in four different models (A - 8,052 pairs; B - 12,780 pairs; C - 7,500 pairs; and D - 7,500 pairs) were allegedly purchased by Royal from Naka Enterprises Corp (`Naka`) of 2383 Lomita Boulevard, Suit 106, Lomita, California 90717, USA. The said shoes are now placed in a secured warehouse.
By an order of court dated 2 July 1991, it was ordered, inter alia, that 50 pairs of A, C and D models and 75 pairs of B model be selected randomly from the said shoes as samples for preservation until the trial and the balance of the shoes be destroyed. The order of court had not been carried into effect at the date of hearing of this application.
Reebok`s action against Royal is pending. Reebok`s application before me is for the following orders: 
 
 
(1) that they be at liberty to send ten pairs of each of the four models of the said shoes to each of the countries where Reebok is currently involved in pending legal proceedings, viz Japan, Taiwan and the USA, for the purpose of using them as evidence in those proceedings; and 
 
(2) that for that purpose, Reebok`s solicitors be released from their undertaking contained in the Anton Piller order to keep safe the said shoes taken into their custody, in so far as the undertaking is inconsistent with the use of the said shoes as evidence.
  
 
 
Prior to the commencement of Suit No 1685 of 1988 on 23 August 1988, Reebok had commenced civil proceedings in Japan on 16 March 1988 against Royal and another party for infringement of the same trade mark in Japan in connection with the said shoes. It is alleged that dealings by Royal in respect of the said shoes formed part of the Japanese action as the said six containers containing the said shoes had arrived in Nagoya during April-May 1988 and had been kept at the Nagoya port free trade zone. Royal`s defence in the Japanese action is the same as their defence in this action, ie the said shoes are not counterfeit. Reebok say that the said shoes are relevant and important evidence in the Japanese proceedings.
In Taiwan, Reebok has been involved in criminal proceedings against a director and an employee of a Taiwanese company, Keyworld Footwear Enterprise Co Ltd. Both of them were charged and convicted of an offence of having infringed the REEBOK trade mark. On appeal, the conviction was set aside on two grounds: (a) the lower court cited the wrong section of the statute to convict the accused; and (b) that part of the charge based on the unauthorized manufacture of the said shoes was not investigated or tried, the appellate court holding that it should have been investigated and tried with the other charges on the ground that they constituted one offence. A retrial has been ordered and Reebok now desires that samples of the said shoes be produced as evidence at the retrial. However, there is no documentary evidence before me that the retrial is in fact concerned with the criminal charges of unlawful manufacture of the said shoes.
Reebok has also commenced civil proceedings against the same director and employee for damages for infringement of their trade mark in Taiwan arising from the alleged unauthorized manufacture of the said shoes. They also need samples of the said shoes for the same reason. However, the documentary evidence in respect of this action which has been adduced before me is subject to technical objections in that the dates given therein in relation to the seizure of the said goods in Singapore are wrong (probably due to faulty translation of the dates) and also they are not official translations.
In the USA, Reebok has commenced two civil actions in California in connection with REEBOK shoes. The first, No CV 88-1210 CBM is against American Sales Corp, Naka and others, inter alia, in connection with counterfeiting and trade mark infringement based on the seizure of a container of REEBOK athletic shoes in Belgium in August 1987. The second, CV 90-3816 CBM (Tx), is against BLS Sales Inc, Royal and Nakane Corp d/b/a Cima Sales and Iwai Nakane in connection with the sale of counterfeit REEBOK shoes, including the said shoes. Counsel for Reebok has confirmed that this application is made in connection with action No CV 88-1210 CBM. However, no documentary evidence has ben produced to this court on this action.
The first argument of counsel for Reebok in support of this application is founded on para 7 of the Anton Piller order which expressly allows Reebok `to use any affidavit, affirmation, information, articles, materials or documents obtained as a result of this order for the protection or further protection of their rights the subject matter of this action whether in Singapore or elsewhere`. It is argued that the court has, in principle, allowed Reebok to make use of the said shoes for the purpose of commencing or prosecuting court proceedings to protect their trade mark rights in any foreign country, but that Reebok has to make this application for two reasons: (1) there is a doubt as to whether the order allows the said shoes to be used in the manner applied for, ie to be tendered as physical evidence; and (2) in any case, Reebok`s solicitors need to obtain a discharge from their express undertaking to retain custody of the said shoes.
Counsel for Royal contends that para 7 of the Anton Piller order is limited to the protection of Reebok`s Singapore trade mark rights. I do not accept this argument as it is contrary to the express terms of that paragraph. He has also submitted that para 7 might be contrary to established principles if Reebok`s interpretation is accepted. It is not necessary to decide whether this issue can be reopened at this stage of the proceedings (Royal having not appealed against this part of the order) as I am satisfied that the first argument of counsel for Reebok is unsound. Read in the context of the whole order, I am satisfied that para 7 was not intended to allow Reebok to send abroad, without leave of this court, the said shoes or any of them to be used in foreign courts as evidence of infringement of the trade mark REEBOK by Royal or any other party. I have two reasons for coming to this view: Firstly, the express undertaking of Reebok`s solicitors to keep safe the said shoes without qualification meant that they could not release the shoes into the custody of someone else. This immediately qualified the ambit of para 7. Secondly, the other parts of the Anton Piller order referred to the said shoes specifically as `shoes` and `goods` and not as articles or materials, which are the expressions used in para 7. Accordingly, I shall approach this application without the weight of para 7 bearing on me.
The next argument of Reebok`s counsel is that the court has the power to allow samples of the said shoes to be used in foreign proceedings, both civil and criminal, against Royal as well as third parties to protect the interest of Reebok, and that in this case the court should exercise the power in favour of Reebok. Counsel refers to the following authorities which I shall consider later: 
 Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc, 
 
Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
 (Unreported) 
Sony Corp v Anand,
 
[1981] FSR 398
 
Roberts v Jump Knitwear Ltd,
 
[1981] FSR 527
 and 
Crest Homes plc v Marks.
 
[1987] 3 WLR 293
[1987] 2 All ER 1074
Counsel for Royal contends that the court has no power to allow evidence disclosed in discovery proceedings by a party to be used against that party in civil or criminal proceedings without the jurisdiction. As against third parties, he concedes that the court has such power provided that they have been involved in the wrongful handling of or dealing with the relevant infringing goods or materials. He relies on 
Sony Corp
 
[1981] FSR 398
 Additionally, he contends that even if the court has a dispensing power in both cases, Reebok`s application fails to satisfy the conditions for the exercise of the power in regard to both Reebok and the third parties.
I shall now try to summarize the current state of the law in England on the use of information obtained in discovery proceedings against the same party and/or third parties in other proceedings within or without the jurisdiction. In this context, two species of discovery proceedings can be distinguished. The first is the general discovery proceeding where the parties are compelled to disclose material documents to each other under the court`s procedural rules. Discovery under a subpoena issued as a result of an order made under the Bankers` Book Evidence Act 1879 (corresponding to Part IV of the Evidence Act [Cap 97, 1990 Ed]) appears to fall within this category: see 
Sybron Corp v Barclays Bank.
 
[1985] Ch 299
 The second is the Anton Piller discovery process. They seek to achieve different goals.
 The Riddick principle
The first principle (for convenience, I shall refer to it as `the Riddick principle`) is that where a party to litigation has been ordered to give discovery, the other party may not use the information so obtained for a collateral or improper purpose, ie for any purpose other than the further pursuing of the action in which the discovery is given. In the absence of an express undertaking given to the court, there is implied an undertaking that the discovering party may not use the information against the other party for any other improper or collateral purpose. The rationale for the undertaking is the encouragement of full and frank disclosure in court proceedings in the interest of administration of justice. The Riddick principle has been applied in cases like 
Home Office v Harman,
 
[1983] 1 AC 280

Riddick v Thames Board Mills,

Sim Leng Chua v JE Manghardt.
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 153
  In 
Manghardt,
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 153
  this court held, following 
Riddick
 
[1977] 3 WLR 63
[1977] 3 All ER 677
 that a defamatory letter disclosed by the defendant in another action before the High Court between the same parties could not be used by the plaintiff to launch a libel action against the defendant.
The Riddick principle is not an absolute principle. The court has a discretion to release or modify the undertaking, whether express or implied. In 
Crest Homes
 
[1987] 3 WLR 293
[1987] 2 All ER 1074
 Lord Oliver of Aylmerton (whose judgment was concurred to by all the other members of the House) said: 
 
Your Lordships have been referred to a number of reported cases in which application has been made for the use of documents obtained under Anton Piller orders or on general discovery for the purpose of proceedings other than those in which the order was made. Examples were 
Halcon International Inc v Shell Transport & Trading Co
 
[1979] RPC 97
 and 
Sybron Corp v Barclays Bank plc.
 
[1985] Ch 299
 I do not...think that it would be helpful to review these authorities for they are no more than examples and they illustrate no general principle beyond this, that the court will not release or modify the implied undertaking given on discovery save in special circumstances and where the release or modification will not occasion injustice to the person giving discovery. 
Crest Homes
 
[1987] 3 WLR 293
[1987] 2 All ER 1074
 was concerned with documents discovered under an Anton Piller order and not general discovery. However, the House of Lords treated the two forms of discovery process as being subject to the same implied undertaking. At p 297 of the judgment, Lord Oliver said that an Anton Piller order operated as an order for discovery in advance of pleadings. Similarly, in 
Sybron
 
[1985] Ch 299
 it was also held that the Riddick principle applied to information obtained from documents produced to the court under a subpoena duces tecum. In all such applications, the burden is on the discovering party to satisfy the court why the implied undertaking should be released or modified: see Lord Oliver at p 303E.
 
 
 
What are exceptional circumstances depends on the facts of each case. An overriding public interest would be an exceptional circumstance. Two illustrations of public interest considerations which failed to override the public interest in encouraging full disclosure are (1) 
Medway v Doublelock Ltd
 
[1978] 1 WLR 710
[1978] 1 All ER 1261
 [P in application for security for costs against D was not allowed to use evidence disclosed by D to his wife in matrimonial proceedings], and (2) 
The Distillers Co (Biochemicals) Ltd v Times Newspapers
 
[1975] 1 All ER 
 [public interest in publishing thalidomide story not sufficient]. In 
Manghardt,
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 153
  I adopted the approach of balancing the public interest in the better administration of justice against the private interest of the applicant in protecting his private rights and was of the view that it would be an extremely rare occasion that a private interest could outweigh the public interest. An illustration where another public interest consideration prevailed is 
Crest Homes
 
[1987] 3 WLR 293
[1987] 2 All ER 1074
 (second Anton Piller order ferreted out evidence of breach of terms of first Anton Piller order on different copyright work, such evidence admissible in contempt proceedings arising from breach). The House of Lords also held that use of the information for the purpose of the contempt action against the defendant was not a collateral purpose in terms of the implied undertaking. Other relevant considerations, but not material to this application, are considered in 
Bibby Bulk Carriers Ltd v Cansulex Ltd.
 
[1989] QB 155
[1988] 2 All ER 820
 The Anton Piller order
The Anton Piller form of discovery is a different species from general discovery. The primary purpose of the Anton Piller order is to preserve the evidence of infringing acts which may otherwise be destroyed, removed or concealed. The secondary purpose is to obtain information with a view to taking proceedings against third parties involved in the infringing acts. Anton Piller jurisdiction is derived from the principle of a 
 right 
 to discovery of information which was revived by the decision of the House of Lords in 
Norwich Pharmacal Co v Customs & Excise Commissioners.
 
[1974] AC 133
 It was enforceable by the old Chancery bill for discovery, the purpose of which was to enable A to obtain information from B to pursue his remedies against C: see Browne-Wilkinson J in 
Sony Corp
 
[1981] FSR 398
 at p 402.
In discovery by means of the Anton Piller order, the public interest in encouraging frank and full disclosure is not as dominant as in general discovery proceedings. In reality, it is largely absent as the defendant is compelled to obey the order of court or be in contempt of court. In 
Crest Homes
 
[1987] 3 WLR 293
[1987] 2 All ER 1074
 at pp 301-302, Lord Oliver addressed counsel`s concern with a relaxation of the implied undertaking upon the performance of the obligation to make full and frank disclosure in these words: 
 
In the first place, that obligation can be of little relevance in relation to the seizure of documents and materials under an Anton Piller order, the whole purpose of which is to gain possession of material evidence without giving the defendant the opportunity of considering whether or not he shall make any disclosure at all. Indeed the justification for the application is the likelihood that, short of immediate and unheralded intervention, relevant material is likely to be spirited away or destroyed. Second, so far as concerns free and frank disclosure under the compulsion of that part of the order which requires the defendant to swear an affidavit, the point may have some general validity but in a case where, if Crest is right, the absence of free and frank disclosure on a previous occasion is manifest, an appeal to it has a somewhat hollow ring.
 
 
 
However, in spite of those observations and the compulsory nature of this form of discovery, Lord Oliver treated the two forms of discovery as being subject to the Riddick principle. If, or course the rationale of the Riddick principle is to encourage candid and full discovery, then a distinction can be made between the Anton Piller form of compulsory disclosure and the ordinary form of general discovery where the parties have the opportunity not to make full discovery. The need to protect the integrity of the implied undertaking is less under the Anton Piller form of discovery. But this difference is not, in itself, a strong factor on which the court will exercise release or modify the implied undertaking.
 Foreign proceedings - against same defendant
 
 
(1) Civil proceedings:
  
 
 
In this action, the said shoes themselves are the very subject matter of the proceedings before the court. Reebok`s application is for leave to use part of the subject matter of the proceedings as evidence in some other proceedings against Royal not in Singapore but in Japan, Taiwan and the USA. The question of principle before me is whether this court has such a dispensing power, and if so, in what circumstances will the court exercise it.
Counsel for Royal makes the following submission: Firstly, he contends that in principle the court has no jurisdiction (in the sense it cannot make the order according to established principles) to grant Reebok`s application for the said purpose. He says that no court has made such an order: see counsel`s reservation of this argument before a higher court in 
Bayer AG v Winter (No 2).
 
[1986] FSR 357
[1986] 2 All ER 43
 Secondly, he contends that as a matter of discretion the court should not grant this application on the following grounds: (a) there are no special circumstances within the 
Crest Homes
 
[1987] 3 WLR 293
[1987] 2 All ER 1074
 principle to justify the release or modification of the implied undertaking, the integrity of which should be preserved whenever possible; (b) there is a multiplicity of actions on the same subject matter, as Reebok`s proceedings against Royal in Japan and the USA are founded on Royal`s dealings with the said shoes, which may lead to different courts arriving at different decisions; and (c) there is injustice to Royal by reason of the multiplicity of proceedings.
Counsel for Reebok contends that as a matter of principle the court has the power to grant the application. He cites in support 
 Apple Corp v Apple Computer 
, 
Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
 (Unreported) and 
Bayer AG (No 2)
 
[1986] FSR 357
[1986] 2 All ER 43
 and 
Crest Homes
 
[1987] 3 WLR 293
[1987] 2 All ER 1074
 On the question of the exercise of discretion, he says the discretion should be exercised in Reebok`s favour for the following reasons: (1) no prejudice will be caused to Royal in this action or to the administration of justice in Singapore, as the application affects 40 [times ] 3 pairs of shores, out of 35,832 pairs now in custody; (2) as the court has already granted an order for the destruction of the majority of the said shoes, it is not in the interest of the administration of justice if these shoes which are of no use to anyone should be prevented by the court from being tendered as evidence in foreign proceedings; (3) the only real prejudice to Royal is that Reebok may succeed against Royal in these jurisdictions.
In 
Bayer AG (No 2),
 
[1986] FSR 357
[1986] 2 All ER 43
 Hoffman J allowed, on an ex parte application, evidence obtained under an Anton Piller order in English proceedings to be used by Bayer against Winter in Switzerland (for the primary purpose of attaching any funds held in a Swiss bank account by Winter), and Austria (for the primary purpose of attaching any funds held there by any defendants and to assert claims against Austrian defendants identified by the Anton Piller documents). In the inter partes hearing to discharge the order, counsel for Winter argued that there was no case in which the court had permitted the use of such information to start actions abroad based on the same cause of action against persons already parties of the proceedings in England. Hoffman J said, at p 362: 
 
I am not troubled by the lack of precedent if the order would not offend against principle or policy and I do not think that it does. In my earlier reasons I acknowledged the undesirability of encouraging a multiplicity of suits in different jurisdictions. But I drew a distinction between proceedings taken for the purpose of obtaining protective measures to preserve assets and the litigation of the substantive merits of the dispute. The plaintiff says that it has no wish to litigate the merits in Austria or Switzerland and it is willing to undertake, once the protective measures are in place, to apply to the Swiss and Austrian courts to stay the proceedings pending the decision of the English court on liability.
 
 
 
Hoffman J was of the view that the application in question was not objectionable in principle or on policy.

 was cited as an authority that the courts would not allow Anton Piller documents to be used abroad against the same defendant, but Hoffman J distinguished 
Halcon
 
[1979] RPC 97
 as a case where the Dutch proceedings and the English proceedings, although involving the same issues, were independent of each other. In the case before him, Hoffman J held that the foreign proceedings were ancillary to the English action in the sense of being in aid of the enforcement of any judgment that might be obtained in that action. In other words, it was not for an improper or collateral purpose.
In 
Bayer AG (No 2),
 
[1986] FSR 357
[1986] 2 All ER 43
 there was an earlier application in the same action before Whitford J who, in refusing leave in general terms to use the Anton Piller information and documents for the purpose of commencing or prosecuting civil proceedings against any of the defendants or any other person which were `proceedings connected with the sale of counterfeit Baygon` (the subject matter of the action), said, at p 359: 
 
I do not say that when a proceeding has in fact been instituted in some foreign jurisdiction it might not be appropriate at some proper stage for an application to be made, if it were necessary, to use this material in that foreign proceeding ....
 
 
 
In the later application, Hoffman J referred to this statement but did not dissent from it. He gave leave in specific terms, confining the use of the information to the action in so far as it related to the discovery of the assets of the defendants in Switzerland and Austria in aid of the Mareva injunction obtained by Bayer. He did not permit Bayer to use the Anton Piller information for the purpose of litigation on the substantive merits. One of the considerations referred to by him was that `In general it is desirable that the issues between the parties should not simultaneously be litigated [on the merits] in more than one jurisdiction`.
In 
 Apple Corp, 
 
Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
 (Unreported) the first plaintiff and the first defendant had concluded an agreement on 24 November 1981 whereby they agreed to mutual `no challenge` and `field of use` restrictions in relation to the registration and use of certain trade marks. The plaintiffs sued to enforce the agreement, and one of the issues was whether the agreement infringed the provisions of art 85 of the Treaty of Rome. There were parallel proceedings between the parties in relation to art 85 issue before the European Commission, and an oral hearing had been fixed before the Commission on 16 April 1991. The plaintiffs sought liberty to disclose to the European Commission in those proceedings certain documents which had been read to or by the court or referred to, in the proceedings while in camera.
A number of issues were raised in that case. The issue that is relevant to this case was whether the court should allow the plaintiffs to use the information disclosed in the English action in the proceedings between the same parties before the European Commission. Ferris J held that the circumstances, ie the European Commission and the court having to consider the same issue and to apply the same criteria, and the desirability of each tribunal having the same materials for consideration, constituted `cogent and persuasive reasons` within the meaning of the 
 Crest Homes 
 decision.4
Counsel for Royal submits that 
 Apple Corp 
, 
Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
 (Unreported) is a special case as it involved the Treaty of Rome to which the United Kingdom is a party. He submits that the same consideration does not apply to courts in Japan and USA deciding the same issue which is now before this court. I agree. 
 Apple Corp 
, 
Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
 (Unreported) is an exceptional case in that it was decided in the context of the United Kingdom being a signatory to the Treaty of Rome. It was highly desirable that the issue of whether there was a breach of art 85 should be decided by the European Commission. I would imagine that a decision of the European Commission would be conclusive in the English proceedings but that a decision by the English court would not have the same effect. The decision in 
 Apple Corp 
, 
Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
 (Unreported) may also be explained on the basis that the use of the said documents before the European Commission was not an improper or collateral purpose. Nevertheless, 
 Apple Corp 
, 
Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
 (Unreported) is an illustration of the court exercising its power to release the discovering party from its implied undertaking. It should also be noted in 
 Apple Corp, 
 
Apple Corp Ltd v Apple Computer Inc
 (Unreported) the information was not obtained under an Anton Piller order.
Having regard to the above authorities, I am of the view that this court has a dispensing power in relation to the implied undertaking. This power, in relation to foreign proceedings between the same parties, whether or not the cause of action is the same or otherwise, cannot be less than its power in relation to other actions between the same parties within the same jurisdiction. How it is to be exercised depends on the circumstances of each case in accordance with the general principle set out in 
Crest Homes
 
[1987] 3 WLR 293
[1987] 2 All ER 1074
 
 
(2) Criminal proceedings:
  
 
 
In England, the legal position as to whether the privilege against self-incrimination extended to a liability to penal proceedings abroad was not settled. The said privilege, if it existed, has now been abrogated by s 14 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968. In 
Sony Corp
 
[1981] FSR 398
 an express undertaking was given by the plaintiffs not to use the information in criminal proceedings in Hong Kong: see Hoffman J in 
Bayer AG (No 2)
 
[1986] FSR 357
[1986] 2 All ER 43
 at p 363. Whether or not there is a privilege against self-incrimination in criminal proceedings abroad under Singapore law has yet to be decided. This issue does not arise in this application as no criminal proceedings against Royal are contemplated abroad by Reebok.
 Foreign proceedings - against third parties
It is established law that Anton Piller information obtained against a party may be used in civil proceedings against a third party within or outside the jurisdiction. That is one of the purposes of the Anton Piller order.
With respect to criminal proceedings against third parties in foreign courts Browne-Wilkinson J said in 
Sony Corp
 
[1981] FSR 398
 at p 402: 
 
I do not consider that there is any limitation which prevents information obtained pursuant to an Anton Piller order being used for the purposes of instituting or supporting criminal proceedings against third parties. Accordingly, apart from the terms of the existing order, there would be no need for the leave of the court to be obtained before information is so used. However, even if I am wrong in that, I would be prepared to give leave in this case permitting the plaintiffs to use the information they have obtained to pursue criminal remedies against persons, other than the defendants, outside the jurisdiction. My reason for that is that there is evidence showing in Hong Kong at least the criminal remedies against infringements of copyright and trade mark are, in some instances, thought to be superior to the civil remedies.
 
 
 
I would not wish to lay down the rule that, in the absence of an express undertaking by the discovering party, Anton Piller information may be used by him in criminal proceedings in 
 all 
 foreign jurisdictions against third parties without leave of the court under whose jurisdiction the information is obtained. In my view the discovering party is subject to the implied undertaking as regards the use of such information against third parties in foreign jurisdictions. If I am wrong and he is not, he should be made to give an express undertaking so that the court may retain control over the documents or information. Browne-Wilkinson J`s unqualified statement is made in the context of Hong Kong as the foreign jurisdiction and should be read in that context. Hong Kong is a British colony with a legal system based on the legal system of the United Kingdom. The Anton Piller order is granted in the exercise of the court`s equitable jurisdiction which originated from the need to administer justice based on conscience and fairness. This court should have regard to the potential penal consequences that may befall the third party if such information is allowed to be used against him. The nature of the offence and severity of the penal sanctions that may be imposed on him may be entirely out of the proportion to the need to protect the economic interests of the discovering party. Unless compelled by higher authority, I am not prepared to allow such information to be used against a third party in criminal proceedings abroad if, for example, the punishment for an offence involving an infringement of intellectual property rights may be imprisonment for life, or worse, or some other form of cruel or unusual punishment.
The above considerations do not apply in this application as Reebok has adduced evidence to show that the maximum punishment for an offence relating to infringement of trade mark rights in Taiwan is a maximum fine of NT$150,000 and/or imprisonment or detention for a term not exceeding five years.
 Nature of evidence
In addition to issues of principle, an argument has also been raised by counsel for Royal on the nature of the evidence that is the subject matter of this application. All the authorities which have been cited were concerned with documents or information derived from documents. The objection to such documents or information being used abroad is that the court may lose exclusive control over such documents or the information, and where such documents contain sensitive information, its abuse may be injurious to the other party: see 
Bibby Bulk Carriers
 
[1989] QB 155
[1988] 2 All ER 820
 at pp 166-167 where this risk of prejudice was accepted by Hirst J. In the present case, there is no risk of the type that is present in cases such as 
Bibby Bulk Carriers.
 
[1989] QB 155
[1988] 2 All ER 820
 The only argument that counsel for Royal has been able to put forward is that there is no reported decision of any court allowing physical evidence to be sent out of the jurisdiction.
I do not accept this argument as valid in the circumstances of this case even though the said shoes are the very subject matter of this action. Lack of precedent is not a sufficient ground. As Hoffman J has said in 
Bayer AG (No 2),
 
[1986] FSR 357
[1986] 2 All ER 43
 the question is whether such an order would offend principle or policy. That would include the question as to whether injustice would be done to Royal if leave is given for samples of the said shoes to be so used. I cannot see that it does in relation to third parties or to Royal in this action. There is no prejudice or risk to Royal in this action should the samples be accidentally lost, destroyed or otherwise irrecoverable. They form a tiny number of the shoes that are available as evidence at the trial of this action. As physical evidence of infringements of Reebok`s trade mark abroad, the said shoes are no different from documentary evidence as evidence in a court of law. It is not necessary to have recourse to s 3 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) to treat the said shoes as documents, although they fall within the definition of the expression `documents` therein.
 Findings in present application
Applying the above principles to the application before me, my findings on this application are as follows: 
 
 
(a) as regards the criminal proceedings in Taiwan against the alleged manufacturers of the said shoes, there is no objection in principle against Reebok using ten pairs of models A, B, C and D as evidence in such proceedings provided that there is documentary evidence to show that they concern the said shoes. On the same principle, there is also no objection to similar samples being used in civil proceedings against the alleged manufacturers subject to proof that they concern the said shoes. Reebok has not produced satisfactory evidence of both sets of proceedings. 
 
(b) as regards the civil proceedings against Royal in Japan, Reebok has not shown that there is any exceptional circumstance which justifies the release or modification of the implied undertaking or the express undertaking given by Reebok`s solicitors; on the contrary, the evidence before me shows that the undertaking should be preserved. It is desirable that the issue of infringement be decided by the same court and not different courts, and it is also unjust to Royal that they are made to defend two other sets of claims based on the same cause of action; 
 
(c) as regards action No CV88-1210 CBM in California, USA, Reebok has not produced any documentary evidence to show the basis of Reebok`s claim against Naka. Unless the claim is based on Naka having dealt with or handled the said shoes, Anton Piller evidence cannot be used in such proceedings against Naka.
  
 
 
Accordingly, on the evidence before me, Reebok`s application is dismissed except for that part relating to the criminal proceedings in Taiwan on which I shall adjourn to allow Reebok to adduce evidence to satisfy me that the criminal charges against the alleged manufacturers concern the manufacture of the said shoes. I have taken this course of action because counsel has informed me that the retrial is scheduled to start on 16 October 1991. Otherwise, I would have dismissed the entire application. As this is an interlocutory application, I have given leave to Reebok to make fresh applications in relation to the civil proceedings in Japan, Taiwan and USA where they would have succeeded but for the lack of evidence in this application. The costs of this application will be Royal`s in any event.

s 361 Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
The appellant stood bail in the sum of $20,000 as the one and only surety for one Ong Kim Ay who was charged with two offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). Ong Kim Ay did not appear in court on 22 July 1991, the date of the trial. On 26 July 1991, after a show cause hearing, the $20,000 was forfeited.
It is worthy of note that the first offence with which Ong Kim Ay was charged was under s 5(a), that is the offence of trafficking in 4.77g of heroin which carries, I am told, a minimum sentence of five years and I believe, also some strokes of the cane. The second charge with which she was charged was under s 8(a), that is possession, in this case, of 9.64g of heroin which carries a maximum sentence, I believe, of ten years or fine of $20,000. or both. One wonders whether the prosecution in this case was serious about proceeding on the trafficking charge. I make this comment because although a custodial sentence is mandatory for a conviction on a charge of trafficking, bail was set in the sum $20,000 in one surety. Further, I note that Ong Kim Ay is a Malaysian who lives in Johore Bahru. Learned counsel has drawn my attention to it and I also note from the bond and the bail bond which is in the court file signed by Ong Kim Ay and the appellant on 16 February 1990, that she undertook to the court not to proceed beyond the limits of Singapore without the permission of the court. However, and this has been stated by the learned counsel for the appellant, she was granted leave by the court to leave Singapore for a period between 16 February 1990 and 15 March 1990, and with the consent of the appellant, her passport, which was impounded by the Central Narcotics Bureau (`the CNB`) on her arrest, was released to her. I am told that subsequently she may have surrendered her passport to the CNB but there is nothing in the file to that effect and the learned DPP is unable to assist me because there is nothing in his file as well.
Ong Kim Ay was required to attend court on 16 March 1990 which she duly did together with the appellant. There were also a number of further attendances in court before the date of trial was fixed. The date of trial originally fixed for this case was 9 May 1991 and there was in fact a period of one year between the last mention and the date fixed for trial, namely, 9 May 1991. The trial did not proceed on that day because learned counsel who was representing her asked for the date to be vacated because he was taken ill, but what is important to note is that Ong Kim Ay did attend court for her trial on 9 May 1991. A further date was then given which was 22 July 1991, and it was on that date that she did not present herself at the trial court. The appellant, however, was present and he was asked to show cause and a warrant of arrest was duly issued for the arrest of Ong Kim Ay.
At the show cause hearing on 26 July 1991, the appellant, who was then unrepresented, gave evidence on affirmation and stated that he was a renovation contractor who did casual work. He had known Ong Kim Ay`s husband for about a year before he stood bail. They were colleagues. He knew that Ong Kim Ay and her husband lived in Johore Bahru. He knew their address in Johore Bahru and I am told by learned counsel this morning that he had in fact visited them once at their home in Johore Bahru. It was also pointed out to me that the appellant is a Chinese national or a national of the Republic of China. He holds a blue Singapore identity card and requires a visa to enter Malaysia.
On 16 or 17 July 1991 he was reminded by Ong Kim Ay`s lawyer that the trial was due to commence on 22 July 1991. He was asked to attend court and to make sure that Ong Kim Ay would be present. Since he could not himself go to Johore Bahru because of the difficulties or problems in getting a visa to travel, he sent his friend, Chye Chye, to Johore Bahru and asked him to remind Ong Kim Ay to attend court on 22 July 1991. Chye Chye could not find Ong Kim Ay when he went in search of her in Johore Bahru.
The appellant also gave evidence of his means. He said he earned $500 to $600 per month as a renovation contractor; that seven or eight years ago he purchased an HDB flat at Block 336 Hougang Avenue 7 for $50,000, for which he pays $300 per month, and that the flat has not yet been fully paid up. He said he does not own a motor car. He has a wife, four sons and a daughter, and he was at the date of the show cause hearing 56 years old.
By way of security, he deposited with the court two fixed deposit receipts totalling $20,000. He maintained, and it was again mentioned to me this morning by his counsel, that he had to borrow the money to place it on fixed deposit so as to be able to produce the fixed deposit receipts as security for the bail. He also said that he stood bail because of his relationship with Ong Kim Ay`s husband who was his colleague, and as learned counsel stated this morning, since Ong Kim Ay and her husband were Malaysians, the husband could not stand bail for her and had to get a Singaporean or a resident of Singapore to stand bail. But the appellant did also say or gave as one of his reasons for standing bail that he believed that Ong Kim Ay would not play him out.
The learned district judge in his judgment quoted extracts from the judgment of Donaldson LJ in 
R v Waltham Forest Justices, ex p Parfrey,
 
[1980] Crim LR 571
 where Donaldson LJ spoke of the seriousness of the obligation when someone entered into a recognizance as a surety, that is in our language, a person who stood as a bailor or stood bail for an accused person, and the risks the bailor ran which were real risks and not a theoretical possibility when the accused failed to surrender to his bail when required to do so. He quoted another extract from the judgment of Donaldson LJ in the case of 
R v Knightsbridge Crown Court, ex p Newton
 
[1980] Crim LR 715
 much to the same tenor as from the earlier case which cautioned that if an accused failed to surrender to his bail, it was only in the most exceptional cases that the court would be prepared to modify the prima facie position, which was that the amount for which the person concerned had stood surety, that is stood bail, would be forfeited in full.
He then referred to a few magistrate`s appeals where the appellate court had not interfered with the forfeiture of the full amount of the bail, and then proceeded to conclude his judgment with these words: 
 
The bailor would be the best person to know the extent to which he could rely on the accused to turn up in court as and when required. This the court will never be in a position to know. When an accused is a foreigner the possibility of the accused leaving the jurisdiction of Singapore is another factor which the bailor has to weigh before entering into the bond. The accused had absconded and may possibly never be arrested and brought to justice. The bailor in giving his explanation for the non-appearance of the accused in court and all that he said when showing cause why the $20,000 bail should not be forfeited had not in my view shown sufficient cause against forfeiture. Were the circumstances such that the whole sum ought not to be enforced? In my view the circumstances were such that the whole sum ought to be forfeited.
 
 
 
That is the end of the judgment.
With all due respect to the learned district judge, he has failed to ascertain and apply the correct principles by which he ought to have been guided: firstly, in dealing with the question of whether or not the bail ought to be forfeited, and secondly, if sufficient cause is not shown, whether in the exercise of his discretion the full amount or only a part ought to be forfeited.
Both sides have cited a number of English cases to me. I consider it necessary only to refer to one, namely, 
R v Uxbridge Justices, ex p Heward-Mills
 
[1983] 1 All ER 530
 in which McCullough J considered all the relevant cases on this point starting with the judgment of Lord Denning MR in 
R v Southampton Justices, ex p Green.
 
[1975] 2 All ER 1073
 Although McCullough J did not refer to the case of 
R v Wells Street Magistrates` Court, ex p Albanese,
 
[1981] 3 All ER 769
 a case which is contained in the learned DPP`s written submission, I do not consider that that was a serious omission which detracts from the judgment of McCullough J, since, in my view, what is stated in the 
 Wells Street Magistrates` Court 
 case5 is not particularly relevant, and it does not take this matter any further than the judgment of McCullough J does.
Before I refer to the judgment of McCullough J, it would be appropriate for the completeness of this judgment to read into it the provisions of s 361 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`). It reads as follows: 
 
 
(1) Whenever it is proved to the satisfaction of a court that any bond taken under this Code has been forfeited, the court shall record the grounds of such proof and may summon before it any person bound by the bond and call upon him to pay the penalty thereof or to show cause why it should not be paid. 
 
(2) If sufficient cause is not shown and the penalty is not paid, the court may proceed to recover the penalty by issuing a warrant for the attachment and sale of the property belonging to that person. 
 
(3) If the penalty is not paid and cannot be recovered by such attachment and sale, the person so bound shall be liable, by order of the court which issued the warrant, to imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months. 
 
(4) The court may, in its discretion, remit any portion of the penalty mentioned and enforce payment in part only. 
 
(5) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the penalty or any portion thereof of any bond under this Code being recovered under the Government Proceedings Act.
  
 
 
I now propose to quote extensively from the judgment of McCullough J in 
R v Uxbridge Justices, ex p Heward-Mills.
 
[1983] 1 All ER 530
 He starts off his judgment with these words [at p 531]: 
 
It has been suggested that there is some difficulty in understanding the principles to be applied when questions of this kind fall for consideration. Therefore, it may be helpful if, as briefly as possible, I take the relevant cases in chronological order, and extract from them the material paragraphs of principle.
 
 
 
This is what he then proceeded to do. He first considered the case of 
R v Southampton Justices, ex p Green.
 
[1975] 2 All ER 1073
 I should state that some of the cases he referred to were reported and some were not reported but he had the relevant material before him. The passage he quoted from 
R v Southampton Justices, ex p Green
 
[1975] 2 All ER 1073
 is at pp 1077-1078 of the report of that case, and it reads as follows from the judgment of Lord Denning MR: 
 
By what principles are the justices to be guided? They ought, I think, to consider to what extent the surety was at fault. If he or she connived at the disappearance of the accused man, or aided it or abetted it, it would be proper to forfeit the whole of the sum. If he or she was wanting in due diligence to secure his appearance, it might be proper to forfeit the whole or a substantial part of it, depending on the degree of fault. If he or she was guilty of no want of diligence and used every effort to secure the appearance of the accused man, it might be proper to remit it entirely.
 
 
 
The next case McCullough J considered was 
R v Southampton Justices, ex p Corker.
 
[1976] 120 SJ 214
 He observed that he had not seen the report but he had a transcript of the judgment. The court consisted of Lord Widgery CJ, Kilner Brown and Watkins JJ. The passage that he quoted from that transcript is as follows: 
 
The other two points, I think, are points on which justices must have further guidance than that which the decision in 
 ex p Green
 presently affords to them. It is said, and no doubt absolutely correctly, that the degree of culpability of the surety is a factor which must be taken into account when deciding whether to forfeit the whole or part of his recognizance. One first of all has to ask oneself on whom is the onus in these matters, and it seems to me that the onus is clearly on the surety. The surety has undertaken a recognizance for a certain sum of money, and prima facie he can and intends to pay it. If he wants to say he cannot afford it, or that it is not fair he should pay it, he ought to make the running. It is he who should set the scene. When it comes to culpability one has to remember, I think, that the great majority of sureties have very little opportunity to control the movements of the accused person. If surety and accused live in the same family that is one thing, but if they live apart it may be that the surety will have very little opportunity of seeing whether or not the accused attends court. It cannot be right in my judgment that a surety who has entered into an obligation for several hundreds of pounds is able to excuse himself when the time comes by simply saying, `Well, of course I have very little chance to observe him and therefore it really was not my fault.` These are all things that ought to be taken into account when the decision to give the recognizance is taken, and the same with means. It would defeat the whole system of bail, I think, if it became generally known that the amount payable was strictly limited according to the surety`s means and that anybody who had no means would not have to pay. Imagine the relish and speed with which persons would accept the obligation of surety if they were penniless and knew that that was a total answer to any kind of obligation on the recognizance. The real pull of bail, the real effective force that it exerts, is that it may cause the offender to attend his trial rather than subject his nearest and dearest who has gone surety for him to undue pain and discomfort. But be that as it may, it cannot be the law, I venture to think, that a surety can escape entirely by saying that he was not culpable and was penniless. These are matters which he should have some regard to before he enters into his recognizance, and it must in turn be the subject of regard when any question of forfeiture arises.
 
 
 
The next case considered is the one referred to me by counsel, 
R v Horseferry Road Magistrates` Court, ex p Pearson.
 
[1976] 2 All ER 264
[1976] 1 WLR 511
 The passage quoted was from the judgment of Lord Widgery CJ at pp 266-267 and it reads as follows: 
 
I find it difficult, with all respect to Lord Denning MR, entirely to follow this passage that I have read because the forfeiture of recognizance is in no sense a penalty imposed on the surety for misconduct. I do not doubt that the magistrate, before forfeiting the recognizance, must consider amongst other things the conduct of the surety and see whether it was open to criticism or not. But one must, I think, start all these problems on the footing that the surety has seriously entered into a serious obligation and ought to pay the amount which he or she has promised unless there are circumstances in the case, relating either to her means or to her culpability, which make it fair and just to pay a smaller sum. Looked at from that point of view, 
 R v Southampton Justices
[and by that, of course he meant 
 ex p Gree
 
 n
] is a helpful authority in the present instance and I would apply it accordingly.
 
 
 
The next case considered was 
R v Tottenham Magistrates` Court, ex p Riccardi.
 
[1977] 66 Cr App R 150
 This is a decision of Lord Widgery CJ sitting with Eveleigh and Forbes JJ. I propose to read the passage which McCullough J quoted from the judgment of Eveleigh J because I am placing some reliance on it. At p 155 of the report, Eveleigh J said: 
 
I would, however, wish to emphasize that the question under s 96(3) of the Magistrates` Courts Act 1952 [which I would add is not dissimilar from our own provision] is in no way to be regarded as a case of justices determining a fine as it has been put forward in this case. The recognizance is not a fine and it is not a punishment either.
 
 
 
The next case was the case of 
R v Waltham Forest Justices, ex p Parfrey.
 
[1980] Crim LR 571
 McCullough J read from the transcript of Donaldson LJ`s judgment the following passage. The learned district judge relied heavily on this passage: 
 
The obligation entered into by someone who enters into a recognizance as a surety is a very serious obligation indeed. I hope that nothing I say today will suggest the contrary. There is an obligation on a surety to be fully satisfied that he or she can meet the liability which will arise if the accused person does not surrender to his bail. This failure to surrender is not a theoretical possibility, though a surety may think it is. The unhappy event of arrested persons not surrendering happens frequently. There is a real risk. Indeed it is difficult to conceive of a set of circumstances in which a surety can be absolutely sure that the accused will surrender to his bail. So let no one think that this is an obligation which can be entered into lightly. Furthermore, the burden of satisfying a court that the full sum should not be forfeit is a very heavy one, so again let no one think that they can simply appear before the magistrates and tell some hard luck story, whereupon the magistrates will say, `Well, be more careful in future.` We are not dealing with that character of obligation at all.
 
 
 
I do not propose to read the other two passages referred to. The next case which McCullough J referred to was 
R v Knightsbridge Crown Court, ex p Newton,
 
[1980] Crim LR 715
 the second case on which the learned district judge relied. The learned judge noted that in one respect the report of this case was inaccurate when compared with the transcript of the judgment as approved by the judge who gave it, Donaldson LJ, and proceeded as follows: 
 
In the transcript one finds this statement of principle from Donaldson LJ, who was sitting on this occasion with Mustill J:
 
 
 
`It has been said by this court, and by other courts time and again, that entering into suretyship (going bail for someone, to use the common phrase) is an extremely serious matter not to be lightly undertaken, and those who go bail must understand that, if the accused fails to surrender to his bail, it is only in the most exceptional cases that the court will be prepared to modify the prima facie position, which is that the amount for which the person concerned has stood surety will be forfeit in full.`
And then McCullough J quotes or cites from the case of 
R v Crown Court at Ipswich, ex p Reddington
 
[1981] Crim LR 618
 by Forbes J which is also unreported. The passage quoted is, I think, important and it is this: 
 
Of course, anyone who stands surety for someone`s attendance must have solemnly undertaken that they are good for the amount of the surety, that they have sufficient resources available. So that when considering the question of means it is a little difficult for a surety to say that he has not got the money which, when entering the recognizance, he must have indicated that he had at that time. But it clearly would be right, and that case ( 
 Ex p Green
) is authoritative, that courts considering the estreatment of recognizance must consider not only the extent of the surety`s resources and the ability to meet what is in effect a financial penalty in those circumstances.
 
 
 
Lastly, McCullough J says, for the sake of completeness, he would mention his own judgment in 
 R v Crown Court at Oxford, ex p Jones and Jacobs. 
 
R v Crown Court at Oxford, ex p Jones and Jacobs
 (Unreported) He read from the transcript of his judgment the following passage: 
 
One has to arrive at a decision which is fair and just in all the circumstances. In doing so one must assess the surety`s culpability. One must also consider his means. One must remember that one is not fixing a penalty for misconduct. One is deciding whether to mitigate the ordinary principle which is that if somebody says: `I promise to pay o20,000 if X does not turn up at court`, and X does not turn up at court, then o20,000 is forfeited.
 
 
 
And finally at p 535 of the report of the 
 R v Uxbridge Justices 
 case,3 McCullough J summarized the principles which he extracted from the various cases that he had referred to, and which I very respectfully adopt. This is what he said: 
 
Having summarized all the passages in the cases where this topic falls to be considered as a matter of principle, so far as I know and as far as the research done by counsel has shown, I would draw together the more important principles to be derived from the authorities, as follows. (1) When a defendant for whose attendance a person has stood surety fails to appear, the full recognizance should be forfeited, unless it appears fair and just that a lesser sum should be forfeited or none at all. (2) The burden of satisfying the court that the full sum should not be forfeited rests on the surety and is a heavy one. It is for him to lay before the court the evidence of want of culpability and of means on which he relies. (3) Where a surety is unrepresented the court should assist him by explaining these principles in ordinary language, and giving him the opportunity to call evidence and advance argument in relation to them.
 
 
 
Now applying these principles to the present case, it cannot be said, in my view, that the appellant is 100% culpable for the failure of Ong Kim Ay to attend court on 22 July 1991. The court was aware that she was a Malaysian and although there was the condition not to proceed beyond the limits of Singapore without the permission of the court, the court relaxed the condition by permitting her to do so and released her passport to her, which must surely have disadvantaged the appellant although the appellant must have realized at the time he stood bail that the condition being relaxed and her passport returned to her, his duty as bailor was all that more onerous. But I am told that the relaxation of this condition was with his knowledge and he accepted it. So he then accepted a slightly more onerous task.
Another point which, in my view, reduces the appellant`s degree of culpability is the fact that Ong Kim Ay did attend court with the appellant on all the dates she was required to attend, including 9 May 1991, the date fixed for her trial, but which had to be vacated due to counsel`s indisposition and a further date for trial, namely, 22 July 1991 was fixed. It was the latter date that she failed to keep.
In the Malaysian case of 
Ramlee & Anor v PP,
 
 
[1969] 1 MLJ 42
  Abdul Hamid J (now the Lord President) held that sufficient cause had been shown against forfeiture considering the fact that the accused appeared on several occasions in court and that sufficient steps were taken to ensure the accused`s attendance. With all due respect to the learned judge, I would not myself go that far. Even so, what is lacking in the case before me is that the appellant does not appear to have kept in touch with Ong Kim Ay, and only at the last moment sent his friend, Chye Chye, to look for her as he himself could not go to Malaysia without a visa.
So the appellant must take some of the blame for Ong Kim Ay`s failure to surrender to her bail on 22 July 1991. I do not see his evidence as some hard luck story, to use the words of Donaldson LJ, on which the learned district judge relied unduly to reject it altogether. To use Donaldson LJ`s words again, `the standing of bail is an extremely serious matter`.
However that may be, it must be appreciated that the administration of criminal justice cannot function effectively without the bail system, and persons must not be discouraged from coming forward to stand bail. It was said by Eveleigh J in 
R v Tottenham Magistrates` Court, ex p Riccardi
 
[1977] 66 Cr App R 150
 at p 155 that `recognizance is not a fine and it is not a punishment either`. At the same time it must, however, be understood that standing bail is a most serious matter and this must be brought home to all bailors and potential bailors.
Section 361(4) of the CPC gives discretion to the court to remit any portion of the penalty and to enforce payment in part only. I see s 361(4) and the exercise of discretion thereunder as most important as it gives the court the opportunity to weigh the culpability of the bailor and to act fairly and justly in determining whether the full amount of the bail should be forfeited or a lesser sum or none at all. The learned district judge, to my mind, did not apply his mind to this, nor did he apply his mind to the means of the appellant, although it must be said that a bailor entering into a bond, ex facie, is declaring his ability to pay the full amount of the bail. All that the learned district judge did was to ask himself the question `Were the circumstances such that the whole sum ought not to be enforced?` and answered it: `In my view the circumstances were such that the whole sum ought to be forfeited.`
This is not a proper exercise of discretion. I cannot infer that by that simple question and answer the learned district judge purported to weigh the degree of culpability of the appellant from the evidence he gave on affirmation. As was said by Lord Greene MR in 
Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corp
 
[1948] 1 KB 223
 at p 229: `... a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to consider.`
In all the circumstances of this case, it would be a proper exercise of discretion to remit half the amount of the bail and enforce payment of the other half. Accordingly the amount to be forfeited is $10,000. Since the full forfeiture of $20,000 has been paid, I direct that a sum of $10,000 be returned to the appellant. The appeal is allowed to that extent.

Peter Tham Wing Fai (the respondent) was convicted and sentenced on 36 charges of forging documents which purported to be valuable securities, being offences punishable under s 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed). He was sentenced to four years` imprisonment on each of the 36 charges, to run concurrently except sentences in two of the charges to be served consecutively. Effectively, the respondent has to serve a total of eight years` imprisonment.
Section 467 of the Penal Code provides for a punishment of either life imprisonment, or ten years` imprisonment and, in addition, a fine.
The trial judge said in his grounds of decision (at p 218 of the record): 
 
In my view, as regards sentence, the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113), ie the provisions as they stood prior to 1 March 1986 and 31 August 1984, respectively, apply with regard to the present offences.
 
 
 
Prior to 1 March 1986, the district court`s sentencing powers were governed by s 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) and s 11(3)(a) imposed a limit of five years` imprisonment and s 11(3)(b) imposed a limit of $5,000 fine that a district court could impose.
Section 11(3)(a) and (b) were amended by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act (No 5 of 1986) (which came into force on 1 March 1986) whereby the district court`s sentencing powers were increased to a maximum of seven years` imprisonment and a maximum fine of $10,000.
The powers of the district court to order consecutive sentences were, prior to 1984, governed by s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code which is still in force. Section 17 provides the court with a discretion to order consecutive sentences in cases where a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences. However, in 1984, by the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment No 2) (Act No 24 of 1984) (which came into force on 31 August 1984), a new s 17A was enacted which provides that where a person is convicted of and sentenced to imprisonment for at least three distinct offences at one trial, the court shall order the sentences for at least two of those offences to run consecutively.
The Public Prosecutor now appeals against the decision of the trial judge that his sentencing powers were governed by the law prior to the amendment in 1984 and 1986.
At the hearing of the appeal, the deputy public prosecutor informs the court that the Public Prosecutor does not now appeal against the sentences imposed against the respondent on the ground that they are manifestly inadequate.
In the present case, the respondent committed the offences in 1979 but was convicted and sentenced in October 1986.
The Public Prosecutor`s argument is that the amendments to s 11(3)(a) and (b) of the Criminal Procedure Code are procedural amendments and that the amendments would apply to all sentencing after the date on which the amendments came into operation irrespective of when the offences were committed.
The authorities are clear that, apart from any special circumstances appearing on the face of the statute in question, statutes which make alterations in procedure are retrospective (see 
 Lim Sing Hiaw v PP 
 
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 85 
, 
 Teo Cheng Leong v PP 
 
 
 
[1970] 2 MLJ 275
 ;
 The King v Chandra Dharma 
 
[1905] 2 KB 335
).
It is the contention of the respondent that an enhancement of the sentencing powers of the district court is in effect a substantive change in the law and any retrospective application of changes of the court`s sentencing powers would infringe art 11(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore which provides: 
 
No person shall be punished for an act or omission which was not punishable by law when it was done or made, and no person shall suffer greater punishment for an offence than was prescribed by law at the time it was committed.
 
 
 
The doctrine which one gathers from the authorities is this: when a statute alters the rights of persons, or creates fresh liabilities with regard to persons, or creates or imposes obligations on persons and thereby alters the law, it ought not be held to be retroactive in its operation unless the words are clear, precise and quite free from ambiguity (see 
 Director of Public Prosecutions v Lamb 
 [1941] 2 All ER 499).
The punishment for the offences which the respondent was convicted is prescribed in s 467 of the Penal Code. There has been no change in the punishment prescribed in s 467 by the amendments. The amending statutes have not increased the penalties for the offences, which the respondent was convicted, over and above those which were in existence at the time of the commission of the offences by the respondent. The only change has been to increase the sentencing powers of the district court. No new disabilities or obligations have been created by the amending statutes, they do not alter the character of the offence or take away any defence which was formerly open to the respondent. It is a mere matter of procedure and according to all the authorities, it is therefore retrospective.
The respondent relies on the second limb of art 11(1) of the Singapore Constitution. His contention is that the phrase `prescribed by law` does not strictly refer to sentencing under any substantive sections of the Penal Code; that it is wide enough and should be liberally construed, since the liberty of an accused person is concerned, to include sections governing the sentencing powers of a court since the latter affects the maximum sentence that can be imposed in respect of any offence. With due respect to counsel for the respondent, I am unable to agree with this submission. In my view, the second limb of art 11(1) of the Singapore Constitution was not infringed. That article protects accused persons from greater punishment for an offence than that prescribed at the time of the commission of the offence.
In my opinion, the trial judge was wrong in his view which he took as to his powers in the matter.

The appellant pleaded guilty to 36 charges of forging documents which purported to be valuable securities, being offences punishable under s 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed). He was sentenced to four years` imprisonment on each of the 36 charges, to run concurrently except sentences in two of the charges to be served consecutively. Effectively, the appellant has to serve a total of eight years` imprisonment.
The 36 charges preferred by the prosecution can be divided into two sets of 18 charges each. The charges in each set of charges are identical except where they refer to individual share certificates, transfer forms and the respective dates on which the offences were committed. They took the following forms: 
 
 
(a) First set:
  
 
 
You, Peter Tham Wing Fai, NRIC No 0295616/B, are charged that you on or about 11 September 1979 at the office of Associated Asian Securities (AAS) on the 22nd Floor, CPF Building Robinson Road, Singapore together with one Krishna Kumar s/o Balasundram in furtherance of the common intention of you both forged a document which purported to be a valuable security, namely, an Ambassador Hotel Ltd (AHL) share certificate numbered 10902 for 100,000 AHL shares of $1 each fully paid and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 467 read with s 34 of the Penal Code, (Cap 103).
 
 
 
 
(b) Second set:
  
 
 
You, Peter Tham Wing Fai, NRIC No 0295616/B, are charged that you on or about 11 September 1979 at the office of Associated Asian Securities (AAS) on the 22nd Floor, CPF Building, Robinson Road, Singapore together with one Krishna Kumar s/o Balasundram in furtherance of the common intention of you both forged a document which purported to be a valuable security namely a duly attested transfer form for an Ambassador Hotel Ltd (AHL) share certificate numbered 10902 for 100,000 AHL fully paid shares of $1 each and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 467 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
The appellant entered an equivocal plea of `guilty` to forging the share certificates in respect of the first set of charges, but disputed that the share certificates were `valuable securities` within the meaning of s 30 and s 467 of the Penal Code.
The trial judge, therefore, treated the appellant`s plea as one of `not guilty` and, after hearing submissions for both the prosecution and the defence, he held that a share certificate is a `valuable security` within the meaning of s 30 of the Penal Code. The appellant then entered an unequivocal plea of `guilty` to each of the charges and was convicted.
In respect of the second set of charges, the appellant pleaded guilty thereto at the outset and was duly convicted.
Upon the appellant`s conviction on all the 36 charges, the appellant`s counsel submitted that s 71(1) of the Penal Code applied to the appellant`s case in that by virtue of that section the appellant could only be given one sentence. However, the trial judge ruled that that section did not apply.
 Short facts of the case
The appellant was, in 1979, the majority shareholder and managing director of Associated Asian Securities (AAS), a stockbroking firm, in which he held 64% of its shares. He was also a director of AAS Nominees as well as a major shareholder of Ambassador Hotel Ltd (AHL), a public listed company incorporated in Singapore, holding 1.1 million shares and he also had virtual control over an additional 830,000 shares held by his brother, Tham Chong Fai, in the same company. He was effectively in control of AAS, AAS Nominees and AHL. Krishna Kumar s/o Balasundram (Kumar) was then the general manager of AAS and the secretary of AAS Nominees.
In 1978 and 1979 the appellant, in the course of his firm`s business, committed AAS to substantial purchase contracts, amounting to over $11m, for shares listed in Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and London Stock Exchanges on behalf of one Eng Chin Ah (Eng), a Malaysian, as well as for the Goodyield group of companies of which Eng was also a director. In respect of these contracts and upon the delivery of the shares purchased thereunder, AAS encountered difficulties in meeting its payment obligations. In addition to this, AAS was confronted with demands from its bankers, the United Overseas Bank, for the repayment of a sum of over $1.1m that had been overdrawn by AAS on its account with them. Faced with these financial problems which beset AAS, the appellant made several trips to Kuala Lumpur to request for funds from Eng in order to alleviate the financial position of AAS.
The result of these meetings was that Eng proposed that the appellant should hand to him AHL shares with which Eng could then pledge with banks in Malaysia, thereby increasing his (Eng`s) credit facilities with those banks and through which the needed funds could be raised and remitted to AAS.
The appellant had by then already pledged all his substantial AHL shares and all his brother`s (Tham Chong Fai`s) AHL shares with the United Overseas Bank, the bankers of AAS, for overdraft facilities.
As a result of the meetings the appellant had with Eng, what then happened was that the appellant approached Kumar with a proposal to forge AHL share certificates, with accompanying `blank transfers`. This exercise commenced on 11 September 1979 in the appellant`s office to which Kumar had been summoned. There the appellant produced 20 blank (unused) AHL share certificates, each for 100,000 fully paid AHL shares, which were numbered 10901 to 10920. The name of AAS Nominees were typed therein as the registered shareholder of the shares in question. The AHL seal was also affixed on each of the certificates. The appellant signed these certificates using the name of his brother, Tham Chong Fai, as a director of the company, while Kumar also affixed thereon a signature purporting to be that of the actual secretary of AHL, one Eu Eng Kong, as secretary. The appellant also directed Kumar to obtain unused share transfer forms to accompany each of the forged share certificates, to be similarly forged. The transferor in each of these forms was made out to be AAS Nominees. Kumar also affixed the seal of AAS Nominees on each of these forms. The appellant then signed each of these forms with a signature purporting to be that of Lam Lian Seet, a director of AAS Nominees, who had resigned. The appellant explained to Kumar that he did so in order not to show any connections between himself and the forged forms. Kumar himself affixed his own signature to these forms as the secretary of AAS Nominees, an appointment that he actually held. The rest of the forms were left blank as is the custom.
Sometime late in September, after the forgeries were completed, 11 of the forged AHL share certificates, Nos 10901 to 10911, with corresponding forged `blank transfers`, were delivered by the appellant to Eng in Kuala Lumpur. Eng then pledged them with Bank Bumiputra Bhd in Kuala Lumpur as collateral for credit facilities. Subsequently, on 17 September 1979, a Bank Bumiputra cashier`s order for M$1.75m and a cheque for M$50,000 from Goodyield Holdings were given by Eng to the appellant. These cheques were banked into an AAS account in Malaysia, from where a sum of M$1.1m was drawn and paid to the United Overseas Bank in Singapore, thereby acceding to the bank`s earlier demands for the reduction of the overdrawn account of AAS.
Following this, the appellant informed Kumar that Eng could obtain more funds if Eng had more AHL shares. Accordingly, sometime in mid-October 1979, more AHL share certificates, Nos 10921 to 10940, together with corresponding share transfer forms were forged by the appellant and Kumar, which was carried out in a similar way as was done on the earlier occasion in respect of AHL share certificates Nos 10901 to 10920 and their corresponding share forms.
In mid-December 1979, Eng paid several visits to the appellant at the latter`s office. The appellant subsequently informed Kumar that Eng was finalizing credit facilities at the Moscow Narodny Bank, Singapore. In late December, seven forged AHL share certificates, Nos 10927 to 10933, with their corresponding forged `blank transfers`, were given by the appellant to Eng. These were deposited as collateral at Moscow Narodny Bank to secure credit facilities for Shin-Nikko, a company belonging to Eng. Forged letters confirming that the shares belonged to AAS Nominees dated 3 January 1980 were also submitted by the appellant to the bank. One Phoon Ah Lek, a director in Shin-Nikko and a close associate of Eng, also requested the bank not to register the share certificates so deposited. This was done at the specific request of the appellant. On 4 January 1980, Eng gave to the appellant a cheque for $1.7m drawn on the account of Shin-Nikko with the said bank. This sum was deposited with an AAS bank account.
In March 1981, the Moscow Narodny Bank threatened to enforce its security against Shin-Nikko by using the forged AHL share certificates and `blank transfers` in its possession. The appellant came to know of the bank`s threats and on 1 April 1981, he instructed Kumar to issue a cheque to Shin-Nikko for $1,773,712 from an AAS account in Malayan Banking Bhd. This cheque was deposited at Shin-Nikko`s account in the Moscow Narodny Bank and the seven forged certificates and `blank transfers` were then returned to the appellant, who shredded them.
Of the initial 11 forged AHL share certificates, Nos 10901 to 10911, together with their `blank transfers`, two were recovered by officers from the Commercial Affairs Department (CAD) from two financial institutions, namely, the Bank of Tokyo, Singapore branch, and Nanyang Finance. Certificate No 10908 was recovered from the Bank of Tokyo where it was pledged by AAS in October 1985 as collateral for credit facilities for AAS. The second certificate, No 10911, was recovered from Nanyang Finance where Eng had pledged it as collateral for a loan of $400,000. A third certificate, No 10902, was seized by CAD investigators from Eng. The rest of the forged certificates and their `blank transfers` were returned to the appellant, either by Eng or Phoon Ah Lek, at various times between 17 September 1979 and June 1985, who shredded them.
It was also discovered that before the certificates and the `blank transfers` were returned to the appellant or seized by CAD investigators, they had been variously pledged at several different financial institutions by Eng, Phoon Ah Lek, Sng Hock Seng and AAS.
The appellant is now appealing against the decision of the trial judge in respect of his two rulings, ie that a share certificate is a valuable security and that s 71(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed) does not apply. The appellant is also appealing against the sentences imposed.
 Is a share certificate a `valuable security`?
Section 30 of the Penal Code (Cap 103) defines `valuable security` as follows: 
 
The words `valuable security` denote a document which is, or purports to be, a document whereby any legal right is created, extended, transferred, restricted, extinguished, or released, or whereby any person acknowledges that he lies under legal liability, or has not a certain legal right.
 
 
 
The trial judge, in his ruling that a share certificate is a valuable security, said (at p 187 of the record): 
 
Whilst it is not incorrect to say that share certificates are indeed documents which are prima facie evidence of the title to its holder to shares in a company (vide s 123(1), Companies Act (Cap 185)), it would be too narrow an interpretation to conclude that that is all it signifies. With such a document in his name the holder also becomes, inter alia, entitled to a legal right to be registered as a shareholder of the company, which is in addition to other concomitant rights, such as, for example, entitlement to the shares specified in the certificate. For the purposes of the present case, however, it suffices to say that when one becomes the holder of a share certificate there is created for the benefit of that holder a legal right to be registered with the company as a shareholder. This is personal to the holder and where the shares in that certificate are properly transferred to another there is created afresh for the benefit of that transferee the right to be registered. Section 30 of the Penal Code (Cap 103) refers to `any legal right` which, in my view, includes such a right. Accordingly, it was ruled in the course of this trial that a share certificate is a `valuable security` within the meaning of ss 30 and 467 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant says that the trial judge misunderstood the concepts of share certificates and registration of shareholders; and submits that his ruling that when one becomes the holder of a share certificate there is created for the benefit of that holder a legal right to be registered with the company as a shareholder and therefore this legal right refers to the legal right referred to in s 30 and therefore a share certificate is a valuable security is clearly wrong.
It is argued that it is the registration of a shareholder in a company`s register of the number of shares in his name that entitles him to the right he is entitled to be issued with a share certificate or share certificates together with his other rights, for example, voting at company`s meetings, bonus issues, dividends and also the right to transfer his shares. The holder of a share certificate does not by itself allow him to be registered unless the share certificate is accompanied by a transfer form or other memorandum to indicate that he is the new owner of the shares.
The key words in s 30 are `any legal right` and the words `whereby any person acknowledges that he lies under legal liability`.
The concept of legal right was considered in the Indian case of 
 Daniel v The State 
 (1968) Mad 349. In that case, an American national obtained a British passport under the false name of a deceased British subject by forging his signature on the application for a British passport. He used the passport issued to obtain entry into India. He was charged, inter alia, for forging a document which purported to be a valuable security, namely, the passport. The court held that the passport creates a legal right as mentioned in s 30 of the Indian Penal Code and is a valuable security. Section 30 of the Indian Penal Code defines `valuable security` and is in pari materia with our s 30 of the Penal Code. Reddy J said (p 354 para (21)): 
 
Legal right is a difficult concept. It is not defined. It is, therefore, necessary to note carefully what the eminent jurists have said about this concept of legal right.
 
 
 
He then went on to consider what the eminent jurists said and he said (p 355): 
 
From the statements made by the jurists noted above, the following principles can be deduced broadly to understand what a `legal right` is: (1) legal right in its strict sense is one which is an assertable claim, enforceable before courts and administrative agencies; (2) in its wider sense, a legal right has to be understood as any advantage or benefit conferred upon a person by a rule of law; (3) there are legal rights which are not enforceable, though recognized by the law; (4) there are rights recognized by the International Court, granted by international law, but not enforceable; and (5) a legal right is a capacity of asserting a secured interest rather than a claim that could be asserted in the courts.
 
 
 
It is, therefore, clear that the test of enforceability, though it may be a normal one, is not the only test for determining a legal right: A legal right may be one recognized by rule of law, either by municipal law or international law, without the capacity of being enforced. A legal right may be asserted even before administrative agencies. It includes the liberty of freedom from penalty. In short, it can be said that a legal right is one which is either enforceable or recognized.
Section 123(1) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) provides that a share certificate is prima facie evidence of title to shares. It is argued by counsel for the appellant that it is in fact nothing more than a material piece of evidence to show that a person is a shareholder of a company; that it is a document which evidences title but does not of itself convey or purport to convey any legal night or to do any of the things envisaged in s 30 and that no legal light exists per se from a share certificate.
In the Indian case of 
 Hari Das Mundhra v The State 
 [1962] Ind LR All 451 a big industrial magnate was convicted under s 471 read with s 467 of the Indian Penal Code of fraudulently and dishonestly using as genuine share certificates and transfer deeds which he knew or had reason to believe to be forged documents, by depositing them with a business firm in order to secure the sale of cloth worth seven hundred thousand rupees. The court held that the share certificates were valuable securities within the meaning of s 30 and s 467 of the Indian Penal Code. Section 471 and s 467 of the Indian Penal Code are in pari materia with ss 471 and 467 of our Penal Code.
The important public function of share certificates was explained by Cockburn CJ and Blackburn J in 
 Re Bahia and San Francisco Railway Co 
 (1868) LR 3 QB 584. Cockburn J said (p 594): 
 
The company is bound to keep a register of shareholders, and has power to issue certificates certifying that each individual shareholder named therein is a registered shareholder of the particular shares specified. This power of granting certificates is to give the shareholders the opportunity of more easily dealing with their shares in the market, and to afford facilities to them of selling their shares by at once showing a marketable title, and the affect of this facility is to make the shares of greater value. The power of giving certificates is, therefore, for the benefit of the company in general; and it is a declaration by the company to all the world that the person in whose name the certificate is made out, and to whom it is given, is a shareholder in the company, and it is given by the company with the intention that it shall be so used by the person to whom it is given, and acted upon in the sale and transfer of shares.
 
 
 
Blackburn J said (p 595): 
 
When joint stock companies were established, the great object was that the shares should be capable of being easily transferred; and the legislature has made provision by 25 & 26 Vic c 89, s 25 (Companies Act 1862) that the company shall keep a register of the members ...
 
 
 
He continued (p 596): 
 
The statute further provides that the company may give certificates specifying the shares held by any member; and the object of this provision is expressly stated to be that this certificate should be prima facie evidence of the title of the person named to the shares specified; and the company, therefore, by granting the certificate, do make a statement that they have transferred the shares specified to the person to whom it is given, and that he is the holder of the shares. If they have been deceived and the statement is not perfectly true, they may not be guilty of negligence, but the company and no one else has power to inquire into the matter; and it was the intention of the legislature that these certificates should be documents on which buyers might safely act.
 
 
 
So the purpose of share certificates is to give to the holders of shares additional facilities of dealing with and transferring their shares and to make them more negotiable in the market and thus to add to their value. This is done for the benefit not only of the company but also of the public in general.
The facts of that case were these: T, being the registered holder of five shares in a registered joint stock company, left the share certificates in the hands of her broker for safe-keeping. A forged transfer, purporting to be made by T to S and G, together with the certificates, was left with the secretary of the company for registration. The secretary in the ordinary course of business wrote to T, notifying that the transfer had been so left, and receiving no answer after ten days, registered the transfer and removed the name of T from the register of shareholders and substituted the names of S and G on the register as holders of the five shares and delivered to them certificates certifying that they were the registered holders of the five specific shares. These shares were afterwards sold, through brokers, and transferred to B and C, who bought them bona fide without notice of the forgery or of any fraud. The names of B and C were registered in the register of shareholders as holders of the shares and share certificates were given to them. Upon discovery of the forgery, the company was called upon by T to restore her name to the register as the holder of the shares and the company was advised to restore T`s name to the register by rule of court under the Companies Act 1862. It was held that the giving of the certificates by the company to S and G amounted to a statement by the company, intended by the company to be acted upon by purchasers of shares in the market, that S and G were entitled to the shares and that B and C having acted upon that statement, the company was estopped from denying its truth. That B and C were therefore entitled to recover from the company damages for the loss of the shares.
The holder of a share certificate has a right to register his interest and is a condition precedent to the passing of title, as a share certificate cannot be registered without its production to the registrar of the company.
In 
 Societe Generale de Palls v Janet Walker & Ors 
 
(1886) 11 App Cas 20
 it was decided that a complete legal title to shares could not be acquired without registration and that in most cases registration can only take place upon production of the share certificate, and that a `blank transfer` in itself is inadequate. The requirement that a share certificate be produced is more than a mere formality.
The Earl of Selborne had this to say about share certificates and share transfers. He said (p 29): 
 
But, in this case, I am of opinion that the appellants had not, on 4 January 1883, any such right (an absolute and unconditional right to be registered as shareholders) even if the transfer, after the blanks were filled up, had been delivered as his deed by James Montgomery Walker. That transfer was not accompanied by 
 the certificates which, in companies of this kind, are the proper (and, indeed, the only) documentary evidence of title in the possession of a shareholder
, and which, according to the usual course of dealing with such shares, ought to come into the hands of a bona fide transferee for value. The respondents, when they took their prior security, did obtain possession of those certificates; and on the face of each such certificate there was an engagement under the company`s common seal that no transfer of any portion of the shares thereby represented should be registered without delivery of the certificate at the company`s office. [The emphasis is mine.]
 
 
 
The share certificates of AHL stated that no transfer of the shares or any portion represented by the certificate could be registered without the production of the certificate to the registrar of the company. Every share transfer is therefore incomplete without the share certificate.
As the Earl of Selborne in
 Societe Generale de Paris 
 
(1886) 11 App Cas 20
 said (p 30): 
 
The respondents not only had the certificates, but they had the company`s undertaking under seal that there should be no change of the registered title unless those certificates were produced.
 
 
 
It is an acknowledgement by the company that it would be liable for damages if the transfer took place without the share certificates.
Share certificates were introduced to prevent problems arising as to identity of shareholders. Lord Blackburn in 
 Societe Generale de Paris 
 said (p 35): 
 
But very soon (I cannot tell how soon) those who took as security from the holder of shares as engagement by which he bound himself not to part with the shares to any one else until that security was discharged, perceived that the security would practically be much better if they had the certificates in their possession. The registered holder of the shares still might, if dishonest enough, in violation of his contract, execute a transfer, but he would have much more difficulty in finding a transferee who bona fide would be led to believe that he was entitled to do so.
 
 
 
Lord Blackburn commented on the case of 
 Re Bahia and San Francisco Railway Company 
(1868) LR 3 QB 584 in these words (p 36): 
 
In 
 Re Bahia and San Francisco Railway Co
 the facts were very similar but the point decided was not quite the same. The certificate is set forth in the special case, and probably had not on it such a note, at all events it is not there set out. But the point decided was that the company were liable to make good their loss to persons who had purchased and paid for the shares from those who produced genuine transfers from those who had been registered along with genuine certificates granted to them, although that register was set aside. All the judges put it on the ground that in the usual course of business the production of the certificates along with the transfer entitled the transferee to pay on the faith of the certificate, which therefore amounted to a preclusion against the company.
 
 
 
Lord Blackburn then goes on to suggest that the share certificates would serve to give notice of title. He said (p 37): 
 
... it does make it important for those who purchase shares to see that the transfer is not only by a deed duly executed, but is accompanied by the certificate. Unless that is so, the transfer, to use the phrase of the witnesses in this case, is `not in order`. And without going further, it at least makes it not wrong for the company to pause and make some inquiry before exercising their powers.
 
 
 
Lord Fitzgerald in the same case said (p 44): 
 
Now, the statute and the articles of association must be taken together. 
 The former shews that the certificates are to be prima facie evidence of the title to the shares; and the latter that the certificates are the only instruments and evidence of title which the member is entitled to have delivered to him. The certificate is his title deed
. The 12th article provides that the share capital is issued `on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the board may think fit`; and one of those conditions is expressed to be that `no transfer of any portion of the shares represented by the certificate will be registered until the certificate has been delivered at the company`s office`.
 
 
 
It seems to me that the parties are not in all respects in an equal position - that 
 the 
 
 defendants have the earlier pledge rendered effectual by the possession of the certificates, and that their prior and superior title has not been displaced by the evidence given by the plaintiffs 
. [The emphasis is mine.]
The importance of the share certificate is clear. Without it, legal title does not pass. It gives the holder or possessor of the certificate the right to demand to be registered as a shareholder.
The authorities clearly established that a company is estopped from denying the share certificate holder`s title to the shares specified in the certificate and from disputing the holder`s right to be registered. In 
 Re Ottos Kopje Diamond Mines Ltd 
 [1893] 1 Ch 618 Lindley CJ said (p 625): 
 
A purchaser of shares can come to the company and produce the certificate and transfer, and say, `Register me as the holder of these shares`, and if the transfer is in order and the company is estopped from denying the validity of the shares, they fail in their duty towards him if they do not register him, and an action for that breach of duty will lie.
 
 
 
A share certificate is therefore a representation upon which both the named holder and subsequent transferees for value can rely. The company is estopped, by virtue of the certificate, from denying that the person named therein is a shareholder.
The registered holder of a share certificate is entitled to exercise certain rights as against the company (see
 Re Bahia 
). This right is founded on the representation in the certificate issued by the company that the person named therein is a shareholder.
Such a representation can operate to make an instrument transferable or even negotiable. In 
 Rumball v Metropolitan Bank 
 
(1877) 2 QBD 194
 Mellor J said (p 197): 
 
The scrip itself would be a representation to any one taking it - a representation which the appellant must be taken to have made or to have been a party to - that if the scrip were taken in good faith and for value, the person taking it would stand to all intents and purposes in the place of the previous holder. Let it be assumed, for the moment, that the instrument was not negotiable, that no right of action was transferred by the delivery, and that no legal claim could be made by the taker in his own name against the foreign government; still the appellant is in the position of a person who has made a representation on the face of his scrip, that it would pass with a good title to any one on his taking it in good faith and for value, and who has put it in the power of his agent to hand over the scrip with this representation to those who are induced to alter their position on the faith of the representation so made.
 
 
 
In 
 Hart v Frontino and Bolivia South American Gold Mining Co Ltd 
(1870) LR 5 Ex 111 the court there held that the plaintiff, having relied on the company`s representation to his detriment, was entitled to damages from the company for the value of the shares. (See also 
 Dixon v Kennaway & Co 
 [1900] 1 Ch 833.)
In 
 Balkis Consolidated Co Ltd v Frederick Tomkinson 
 
[1893] AC 396
, P, the owner of numbered shares in a joint stock company, transferred them to persons who were registered in the company`s books as proprietors of the shares. P afterwards fraudulently executed a transfer of the shares for value to T, who sent the transfer to the company, and received from them a certificate under their common seal stating that he was the proprietor of the shares. T, acting bona fide on the faith of the certificate, sold the shares; but the company refused to register the purchaser as the proprietor, on the ground that after granting the certificate to T they had discovered that he was not the real owner of the shares. T then, to fulfil his contract with the purchaser, bought other shares in the market and sued the company for the price. The House of Lords held that the company were estopped by their certificate from denying that T was the proprietor of the shares, and that he was entitled to recover from the company the damages which he had in fact sustained owing to their refusal to register the purchaser.
It is clear from the authorities that rights are created by the issue of a share certificate. Similarly, the company in issuing the share certificate acknowledges certain legal liabilities.
The trial judge was correct in deciding that a share certificate is a valuable security within the meaning of s 30 of the Penal Code.
 Application of s 71(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 103, 1970 Ed)
Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law in holding that s 71(1) of the Penal Code was inapplicable in the present case and that each of the charges would be treated as a distinct and separate offence for the purpose of sentencing.
Section 71(1) reads: 
 
Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more than one of such offences, unless it be so expressly provided.
 
 
 
The submission of counsel is this. Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 113, 1970 Ed) provides that for every distinct offence of which any person is accused there shall be a separate charge and every such charge shall be tried separately. In the present case all the 36 charges are in fact one distinct offence and that s 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code does not arise and consequently the provisions of s 71(1) of the Penal Code would apply, necessitating the imposition of only one sentence.
To support this argument that there is only one distinct offence, counsel says that the facts show that the offences are so closely inter-related by community of purpose in that all the forgeries were done for the single purpose of alleviating the financial crisis that beset AAS for which Eng was responsible and Eng either could not or would not pay the large sum of around $12m owed by him to AAS; that the appellant was propositioned by Eng `to lend` him AHL shares to enable him (Eng) to borrow funds from banks and other financial institutions; that the appellant embarked on the forgeries with that original intent in mind; that there was one agreement between Kumar and the appellant, namely, to provide Eng with a number of forged share certificates. Counsel submits that, in these circumstances, there is only one offence for the purpose of s 71(1).
Section 17 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that the court may sentence a person to several punishments when he is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences. Counsel referred to two Indian cases where the word `distinct` in s 133 of the Indian Penal Code (which is in pari materia with our s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code) received judicial consideration. The cases are 
 Chunnoo v State 
 [1954] Cr LJ 1762 and 
 Banwarilal v Union of India 
 AIR 1963 SC 1620. The judges in those cases stated in effect that for an offence to be `distinct` `there should be no connection between the various acts which give rise to criminal liability` (per Kidwai J in 
 Chunnoo 
 `s case at p 1764 para (10)) nor `in any way inter-related` (per Raghubar Dayal J in 
 Banwarilal 
 `s case at p 1624 para (14)).
Counsel also cited the Malaysian case of 
 Sheikh Hassan bin Sheikh Ibrahim v PP 
 
 
 
[1940] MLJ 54
 . In that case the appellant was charged first with criminal breach of trust in respect of $23 paid to him on 23 separate occasions within a space of one year. The second charge alleged that with intent to defraud he committed falsifications of accounts by wilfully omitting to enter the 23 payments in his cash book. The Court of Appeal held that the criminal breach of trust charged was one offence, though made up of the 23 items, and that when the falsifications charged were confined to those items, the criminal breach of trust and the falsifications were so closely inter-related that the 23 falsifications became a single offence like the 23 breaches of trust which formed a single offence and that the falsifications were related to the criminal breach of trust items by community of purpose and they stood to one another in the relationship of cause and effect.
Counsel submitted that the charges against the appellant come nowhere near any of the definitions of distinct offences but is on point with 
 Banwarilal 
 and 
 Sheikh Hassan 
 as the offences alleged are so closely inter-related by community of purpose in that all the forgeries were done for the single purpose of alleviating the financial crisis which AAS was facing, that there was one agreement between Kumar and the appellant to provide Eng with a number of forged share certificates. In those circumstances, it is submitted that there is only one offence.
Counsel also submits that there is a difference between `separable offences` which come within the provisions of s 71 of the Penal Code and `distinct offences` under ss 17, 167-169 of the Criminal Procedure Code and as the 36 offences are `separable offences`, s 71(1) of the Penal Code should apply to the facts of this case.
The trial judge in his ruling said (p 199 of the record): 
 
It is my view that the mere fact that several offences are committed in the same transaction and a person is charged for such offences in one trial does not bring into play s 71(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 103). This provision will only come into play where, as in 
 Nilmony Poddar v Queen-Empress
 (supra), the offender is not only charged for the principal offence but also with the component Parts of it which are offences in themselves. As such, it was ruled during these proceedings that s 71(1) of the Penal Code (Cap 103) was inapplicable in the present case and that each of the charges would be treated as a distinct and separate offence for the purpose of sentencing.
 
 
 
Section 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code is a general provision which provides that there should be separate charges for distinct offences and that such charges should be tried separately and in certain circumstances jointly. It must be read with ss 168, 169, 171 and 175 of the Criminal Procedure Code which specifically provide for situations where charges may be tried jointly in one trial.
It will be seen from ss 168 and 169 that offences, which though distinct in the sense that each is a completed offence, are nevertheless connected through their similarity to each other (s 168) or by a continuity of purpose and design common to each offence or related to one another as cause and effect (s 169 and see 
 Chunnoo 
 [1954] Cr LJ 1762 and 
 Sheikh Hassan bin Sheikh Ibrahim 
 
 
 
[1940] MLJ 54
 ). It would appear from ss 168 and 169 that `distinct offences` may also be a `series of offences of the same or a similar character` or offences committed in the `same transaction`.
The question arises as to what is meant by `every distinct offence` in s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code. `Distinct` means `not identical`. Two offences would be distinct if they are not in any way inter-related but if there is some inter-relation it would depend on the circumstances of the case in which the offences were committed whether there is only one transaction and only one offence was committed.
As regards the forgeries in this present case, the trial judge said (p 195 of the record): 
 
In the present case the forgeries that were committed on each of the two occasions, namely, on 11 September 1979 and 15 October 1979 were committed at one sitting, so to speak. The accused and Kumar attended to their tasks for the purpose of handing over the forged documents to Eng, who had made it known to the accused that he would be pledging them with financial institutions in Malaysia to obtain more credit facilities whereby the accused hoped the financial problems of AAS would be alleviated. However, each forged document purported to be a `valuable security`. The incidents that were employed to the forgery of each document, namely, the affixing of the seal of AHL or AAS, as the case may be, the affixing of the purported signatures of Tham Chong Fai, Lam Lian Seet and Eu Eng Kong, and the affixing of a separate number to each share certificate and its corresponding `blank transfer`, etc all went to complete each forged document. The forgery of each document, although completed within seconds of the next to be forged, was a separate act from the others and never depended on the completion of the others before being complete in itself. The only connection between the forgeries was the proximity in time and a continuity of purpose that, at most, would qualify them as offences committed within the `same transaction`. In any event, each share certificate and its corresponding `blank transfer` was to be used by Eng with as many banks or financial institutions as he thought fit to use, a fact that was also known to the accused.
 
 
 
The provisions of s 71(1) of the Penal Code refer to `... anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence ...`. Offences coming under the operation of s 71(1) concerned `composite offences`, ie offences which in themselves encompassed specific offences which are ingredients of the `composite offences`. Section 71 applies only where the offender is not only charged for the principal offence but also with the component parts of it which are offences in themselves.
In the present case, s 71(1) would apply if the appellant, who was charged with forging the share certificates, was also charged with forging the company seal, and forging the signatures of his brother Tham Chong Fai as director of the company. Similarly as regards the charge for forging the `blank transfers` the appellant was also charged with forging the seal of AAS Nominees and forging the signatures of Lam Lian Seet, a director of AAS nominees, who had resigned. It will operate if the appellant is charged with every criminal act that had led to the commission of one forged valuable security. The appellant in this case forged 18 separate share certificates, individually numbered, as well as 18 corresponding `blank transfers` on two occasions. The forging of each share certificate and each transfer form stands separately by themselves as separate and completed offences with the same punishments. The precise number of forgeries committed do not represent the component parts of any one offence. Each of the forgeries stands by itself.
The trial judge was right in holding that there were 36 distinct offences and that s 71 (1) of the Penal Code did not apply.
 Sentence
The appellant is also dissatisfied with the sentences on the ground that the sentences are manifestly excessive having regard to all the circumstances of the case. It is contended that in sentencing the appellant, the trial judge failed to take into consideration the following mitigating circumstances: 
 
 
(i) the appellant returned to Singapore from the USA voluntarily; 
 
(ii) the appellant had not intended to cause `permanent` loss to anyone and took steps to prevent loss; 
 
(iii) the trial judge failed to give due consideration to the conduct and acts of Eng which if so taken would mitigate his (appellant`s) criminal acts; 
 
(iv) the forgeries were done with the intention of benefiting AAS and that the appellant did not directly benefit from the forgery of the share certificates but had in fact suffered heavy personal loss; 
 
(v) the appellant had made full restitution and that no financial institution or bank suffered any losses.
  
 
 
It is also contended that the trial judge erred in regarding the offences as serious offences calling for a deterrent sentence.
The mitigating factors raised were also raised in the court below. The trial judge had fully considered them and gave reasons in rejecting them.
I have not been persuaded that the trial judge had misdirected himself on the mitigating factors submitted and dismissed by him. I do not find that he had been influenced by the publicity which was generated in the local press, before the appellant`s return to Singapore, regarding the appellant`s connection with the failure of Pan Electric which was in no way reflected in the 36 charges against the appellant. I also do not find that the trial judge had misdirected himself in respect of Eng`s role. The forgeries were the appellant`s idea. Even Eng thought that the share certificates were genuine.
The forged share certificate`s were deposited with several banks and financial institutions in Singapore and Malaysia. They were accepted at their face value without further enquiries. The fact that the forgeries were undetected for seven years show the inherent trust banks and financial institutions placed on share certificates when accepting them as security for loans. Trust is essential in the financial world.
These offences involved fraud which concerned not just the appellant and Eng but the whole commercial and financial institutions in Singapore. The appellant audaciously carded out these forgeries. The forging of share certificates must be viewed seriously; they represent title to valuable shares. I agree with the trial judge that a deterrent sentence ought to be imposed for what the appellant did.
Section 467 of the Penal Code provides for a punishment of either life imprisonment, or ten years` imprisonment and in addition a fine. The imposition of consecutive sentences in respect of two of the charges was a proper exercise of discretion. The overall sentence of eight years` imprisonment is not manifestly excessive.
In the result this appeal is dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
(delivering the judgment of the court): At about 4.10pm on 18 March 1985, the body of Sng Chiam Hong (the deceased) was found in a one-room flat known as Block 44 Lorong 5 Toa Payoh #01-205. The police had gone there following an anonymous telephone call complaining of a stench emanating from the flat. They caused the door of the flat to be forced open and the decomposed body of the deceased was seen to be sprawled, face upwards, on a mattress which lay on the floor.
Dr Wee Keng Poh, a forensic pathologist attached to the Singapore General Hospital, attended at the flat following the discovery of the body. He removed a towel that was covering the deceased`s face and saw a blue handkerchief knotted lightly around his neck. There were injuries on the body, including stab wounds on the chest. Dr Wee concluded that death had occurred about three days previously, that is to say, on or about 15 March 1985. The deceased, who was aged 39, was removed to the Singapore General Hospital mortuary, and on the following day, 19 March 1985, Dr Wee carried out a post-mortem examination.
The post-mortem disclosed a deep constricting groove encircling the deceased`s upper neck. There were two stab wounds on the chest, one in the abdomen and one in the right thigh. One of the stab wounds in the chest was 7 cm deep. It had penetrated the full thickness of the anterior chest wall and the main pulmonary arterial trunk, and had caused death. It had been inflicted by a sharp, pointed instrument, like a knife, with either one or two sharp edges. The other stab wounds had been caused by the same, or a similar instrument, but were not serious and would not have caused death.
In Dr Wee`s opinion, the deep constricting groove encircling the deceased`s neck was caused by strangulation, which could have resulted in death independently of the fatal stab wound. The ligature used to strangle the deceased had been the handkerchief seen to be encircling his neck.
Other than the groove in the neck, and the stab wounds, Dr Wee found a superficial cut on the deceased`s left knee, and a bruise on his left shin. The cut would have been caused by a sharp instrument like a knife and the bruise by a fall or a blow against a hard surface.
Toh Peng Noi (PW1), a student and part-time tutor, told us that the deceased, who was her godfather, was a medium. She identified a gold ring (P54), with an emblem of a dragon embossed on it, as having belonged to the deceased. Under cross- examination, she agreed that the deceased`s ring bore no distinctive marks, and that the most she could say was that the deceased had a ring like P54. She could remember that when she last saw the deceased at about 7am on 15 March 1985, he was wearing the ring that looked like P54. The deceased had telephoned Miss Toh at about 9.50pm on the night of 15 March, while she was out, and her brother had taken a message for her.
A statement of Liow Tiang Ting (PW3), a pawnshop valuer employed by Ban Kin Pawnshop Pte Ltd, was tendered by the prosecution and was admitted unchallenged. In his statement, Liow said that at about 9.30am on the morning of 16 March 1985, that is to say, the morning following the day on which Dr Wee Keng Poh estimated that the deceased had died, a male Chinese pawned P54 for $180. Low issued a pawnticket no 1842 (P57) for the ring. The particulars of the man who pawned the ring were: Chan Sway Beng, NRIC No 1502682-J, Block 103, Toa Payoh, Lorong 1, #09-331
Two days later, namely, on 18 March 1985, at about 2.30pm another male Chinese, whose particulars were recorded as Sim Kiang Wee, NRIC No 1474325-A, came to Low`s shop, presented the pawnticket P57, and redeemed the ring.
Ho Yun Hin (PW2), whose statement was also admitted without challenge, said that he was employed as a pawnshop valuer by Heng Seng Pawnshop Pte. Ltd, and that on 9 April 1985, at about 4pm, a male Chinese pawned two gold rings for a total of $250. One of the rings was P54, and the other was a plain gold ring, P55. He issued a single pawnticket no 1837 (P56) for both rings and gave it to the man, whose particulars were recorded as: Sim Kiang Wee, NRIC No 1474325-A, Block 101, Lorong 2, Toa Payoh #04-91.
The prosecution sought to introduce the evidence of Sim Kiang Wee by way of a written statement, pursuant to s 378(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Procedure Code, Sim having died on 4 April 1987. The notice called for by s 379(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code was not served on the defence, hence leave of the court was required for Sim`s evidence to be adduced by way of his written statement.
The statement had been made for the purposes of a preliminary inquiry held on 7 November 1985. It had been read and admitted at the preliminary inquiry, at which Sim was available for cross-examination. Counsel for the accused, as he had a perfect right to do, reserved his cross-examination of Sim.
It was common ground that we had a discretion as to whether or not to admit Sim`s statement. The prosecution conceded that his evidence went to crucial facts in the case.
We declined to exercise our discretion in favour of the prosecution and refused to give leave for Sim`s written statement to be adduced in evidence. We concluded that it would be unfair to do so, given that the deponent was not available for cross-examination on important issues and that there would be no opportunity for us to observe his demeanour. The learned deputy public prosecutor submitted, inter alia, that Sim`s statement would corroborate that of other witnesses. That, in our view, rendered it all the more important that Sim`s statement should not go in without the opportunity for cross-examination, and therefore without our being in a position to assess his credibility.
Goh Choon Hui (PW9) is an inmate at the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre, where he has been detained since April 1987. He told us that in March 1985 he was living at Block 106, Lorong 1 Toa Payoh # 04-351 with Sim Kiang Wee, Leong Fook Hing (PW10) and Ong Kok Hua (PW11). Goh had known the accused for some seven or eight years by 1985. They were both house painters, both gambled on horses, and occasionally they went out drinking together.
Goh said that on 16 March 1985, the day after the deceased was thought to have been killed, he saw the accused at the void deck of the block of flats in which Goh lived. The accused said that he owed bookies money, and asked if he could stay at Goh`s flat for a few days to avoid them. Goh agreed.
Goh`s memory of events from that point onwards seemed to fade. He remembered the accused telling him that he had injured somebody in Toa Payoh, identifying the injured person as `Ah Ngoh` or `Ah Boh`, a person whom Goh knew. The accused told Goh that this person had owed him money. He showed Goh a pawnticket, saying that he had pawned a gold ring. Goh identified P57 as the pawnticket the accused showed him. The accused offered to sell the pawnticket to Goh for $50, and as far as Goh could remember he went to the pawnshop and redeemed the ring. He was shown the ring, exh P54, but he could not say whether it was the ring he had redeemed. Later, Goh said that he had given the pawnticket to Sim Kiang Wee, and had asked Sim to redeem the ring and keep it for himself. He said Sim used his own money to redeem the ring.
In cross-examination, Goh agreed that when the accused spoke to him about injuring someone, the accused had said that this person owed him money, and that he wanted to recover it. There had been a quarrel, during which the debtor had raised his voice, and a fight. It was only later, when Sim Kiang Wee had shown him a Chinese newspaper, that he realized that the person with whom the accused had had the quarrel had died.
Leong Fook Hing (PW10) confirmed that he was living with Goh and Sim Kiang Wee in March 1985, and that sometimes Ong Kok Hua (PW11) would stay with them. It was Goh`s flat in which they stayed.
In March 1985, Leong had known the accused for about a year or two. They were both house painters and occasionally worked together.
On 16 March 1985 at about 6.30 pm, Leong was at Goh`s flat when the accused came in. He said he wanted to stay for a few days because he owed bookies some money. Goh and Ong Kok Hua were present. Goh told the accused that he could stay.
Leong said that on the following day he, Goh, the accused and Ong were having dinner at Goh`s flat when the accused said that he had killed somebody in Toa Payoh. Leong did not believe the accused since he reasoned that if the accused had really killed somebody he would not tell others about it.
However, a few days later, the accused showed him English and Chinese newspapers, and Leong read in the 
 Straits Times 
 about a temple medium having been murdered in Toa Payoh. The accused said that he had murdered this man. Leong asked him if he was speaking the truth, and the accused said that he was. Leong became frightened and said no more. When he woke up the next morning, the accused was no longer in the flat. Goh told him that the accused had left, but did not say why.
Leong was cross-examined by counsel for the accused. He was asked what words the accused had uttered when saying that he had killed someone. Leong replied that the accused had said: `I killed one person in Toa Payoh.` He was sure these were the words the accused had used, and did not agree that the accused had said that he was `having a problem with` someone, the Hokkien for `having a problem with` and `killed` being phonetically similar.
It was put to Leong by counsel for the accused that the accused had in fact said: `I had a problem with someone. I had a quarrel and a fight`, and that the accused had not said that he had killed someone. Leong replied that as far as he could remember, the accused said: `I killed one person at Toa Payoh.`
Leong admitted that his evidence differed in a number of respects from a statement he made on 26 October 1985, which was read at the preliminary inquiry. He explained the discrepancies by saying that he could not remember accurately what had happened three years earlier. In one respect, what he said in the earlier statement was correct, and his evidence in court was mistaken, namely, he was correct in having said in his statement that on the morning after the newspapers published the report of the murder, Goh woke the accused up and asked him to leave the flat. Leong had been mistaken in saying in court that when he woke up that morning the accused had already left.
Ong Kok Hua (PW11) is a salesman. He went to live with Goh Choon Hui, whom he has known since they were youngsters, in January 1985. Leong and Sim Kiang Wee were also living there.
Ong told us that he knew the accused. They had known each other since they were boys.
On a Saturday afternoon in March 1985, the accused came to Goh`s flat, and stayed the night. The next day, when he, the accused, Leong and Sim Kiang Wee were having dinner (he could not remember whether Goh was present) the accused said that he had had a quarrel with somebody. There had been a fight, and he had killed the other person with a knife. The person in question had been deceiving the accused. He had promised to lend some money to the accused but had not kept his promise.
Ong told us that he did not believe the accused, but that subsequently (he could not remember how many days later), the accused showed him the Sin Min Daily News, and Ong read a report of someone having been murdered at Block 44, Toa Payoh Lorong 5, that is to say, the block in which the deceased lived, and in which his body was found. The accused said that the person referred to in the newspaper had been killed by him. Later, Ong had left the flat. He wondered to himself why the accused was at the flat if it was true that he had murdered somebody. He went back to the flat the following morning and discussed the matter with Goh and Leong. They decided that it would not be wise for them to accommodate the accused at the flat if he had really murdered somebody. Subsequently Ong left the flat, and when he returned in the evening the accused was no longer there.
Ong said, under cross-examination, that he could not remember whether Goh was present at dinner when the accused first stated that he had killed a person at Toa Payoh. Leong was there because he was in the flat most of the time, and Sim was in the flat because he had returned the previous day from a trip to Indonesia. Ong agreed that he sometimes punted on horses at the same place as the accused. He denied that he had a grudge against the accused as a result of a quarrel over horse-racing tips. As far as he could remember, he had never had a quarrel with the accused, whom he regarded as a friend. He did not like to see the accused in the dock, was worried for him, and was only telling the court what had happened. It was put to him in cross-examination that the accused had said that he had had a quarrel and a fight, rather than that he had killed a person. Ong agreed that the accused had mentioned a quarrel and a fight, but that he had also said that the accused had killed the person in question with a knife.
The accused, who was 23 years old at the time, was taken by officers of the Special Investigation Section (SIS) of the CID from his grandparents` flat at Block 103 Toa Payoh to the CID for questioning at about 6am on 20 April 1985.
He was interviewed at the offices of the SIS between 6.30am and 8am. At about 9.25am he was escorted to the Singapore General Hospital for a medical examination by Dr Henry Kothagoda. Dr Kothagoda found his general condition to be satisfactory, and his vital signs stable. Following his examination, the accused was taken back to the CID and referred to the investigating officer, Inspector T Maniam. Inspector Maniam framed a charge of murder against the accused, in the following terms: 
 
That you Chan Sway Beng between 15 March 1985 and 18 March 1985, at Block 44, Lorong 5, Toa Payoh # 01-205, Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Sng Chiam Hong, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 103).
 
 
 
Inspector Maniam then proceeded to record a statement from the accused. The inspector, who was assisted by an interpreter, Miss Lau Sau Heng (PW12), followed, as he understood it, the procedure set out by s 121(6) (now s 122(6)) of the Criminal Procedure Code. The recording of the statement occupied approximately two hours, after which the accused was again escorted to the Singapore General Hospital where he was examined for a second time by Dr Kothagoda. He was found to be well, fully alert and responsive.
Dr Kothagoda said, under cross-examination, that he was concerned to ascertain whether there were any physical injuries on the accused, and not with his psychological condition. However, the accused did not appear to him to be very anxious or panic-stricken.
Counsel for the defence objected to the admissibility of the statement recorded by Inspector Maniam on two grounds. Counsel`s preliminary objection was that the statement made by the accused was not admissible in that, since it amounted to a confession within the meaning of s 17 of the Evidence Act, and since it was made (as was conceded by the prosecution) while the accused was in the custody of a police officer, s 26 of the Evidence Act operated to exclude the statement by virtue of it not having been made in the presence of a magistrate. Section 26 provides as follows: 
 
Subject to any express provision in any written law, no confession made by any person whilst he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it is made in the immediate presence of a magistrate, shall be proved as against such person.
 
 
 
Counsel for the accused argued that the statement was not saved from the operation of s 26 because there was nothing in s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which governed the admissibility of a statement made under s 121(6), which expressly overrode s 26 of the Evidence Act.
The position would have been otherwise, counsel contended, if s 121(5) expressly provided that a statement amounting to a confession and otherwise falling within its provisions was admissible whether or not its maker was in custody, or alternatively, if it provided that such a confession was admissible `notwithstanding s 26 of the Evidence Act`. Counsel argued that s 121(5) fell short of doing this and must therefore be construed to apply only to confessions made otherwise than when the maker was in custody.
The defence relied substantially for this proposition on 
 PP v Yator bin Bunta 
 
 
 
[1988] 1 MLJ 163
 , a case decided by the High Court in Brunei. Section 26 of the Brunei Evidence Act is in pari materia with s 26 of the Evidence Act of Singapore, but s 117(1) of the Brunei Criminal Procedure Code, which is the equivalent of s 121(5) of our Code, is in significantly different terms in that the opening words of our sub-s (5) do not appear in s 117(1). The latter section reads: 
 
In any criminal proceedings any statement made by any person, whether it amounts to a confession or not or is oral or in writing, made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged and whether in the course of a police investigation or not, by that person to or in the hearing of any police officer shall be admissible in evidence and, if that person tenders himself as a witness, any such statement may be used in cross-examination and for the purpose of impeaching his credit.
 
 
 
Section 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code is in very similar same terms, save that it begins with the words `Where any person is charged with an offence...` instead of `In criminal proceedings ...`. Section 117(1) of the Brunei Act does not contain the proviso to s 121(5) of the Singapore Act.
In 
 Yator bin Bunta 
 `s case, O`Connor J held that s 26 of the Evidence Act `gives a right to an accused person, and the introductory words ... are a guide to the construction of subsequent legislation that appears to bear on the same subject matter.` He went on to observe that it was strange, if the legislature intended a confession made while in custody to be admissible by virtue of s 117(1), that the subsection does not include a phrase such as `Whether in police custody or not`. In the learned judge`s view, the words `made at any time, whether before or after that person is charged` do not relate to the circumstances of the maker of the confession (that is to say whether or not he is in custody), but `relate to a merely temporal matter, to the sequence, in relation to charging`. Nothing, in his opinion, necessitated that s 117(1) be construed to apply to a confession made by a person while in custody.
In so concluding, O`Connor J differed from the decision of the High Court in Brunei in 
 PP v Zainal Abidin bin Ismail & Ors 
 
 
 
[1987] 2 MLJ 74
 , decided by Roberts CJ some months earlier; and from a decision of five judges of the Federal Court of Malaysia in 
 PP v Ng Goh Weng & Anor 
 
 
 
[1979] 1 MLJ 127
 . Both Roberts CJ and the Federal Court held that s 117(1) of the Brunei Code and s 113(1) of the Malayan Code respectively contained an express provision, within the meaning of s 26 of the Evidence Act of both territories, which resulted in a confession made by a person in custody being admissible.
In our respectful judgment, Roberts CJ and the Federal Court were right. If anything, the position in Singapore is clearer. Section 121(5) makes it plain that a statement amounting to a confession, made at any time by a person who has been charged, is admissible if it is made to or in the presence of a police officer above the rank of sergeant, provided that it was not caused by any inducement, threat or promise.
We are unable to accept the contention of the defence that, in order for a confession made while in custody to be admissible, it would be necessary for s 121(5) to contain the words `notwithstanding s 26 of the Evidence Act` or, alternatively, the words `whether in police custody or not`, in relation to a concession so made. The Privy Council has held that, for a provision to be `express`, all that is necessary is that it should not arise by inference alone, but that it should do so `directly from the language used` - see 
 Shanmugam v Commissioner for Registration for Indian and Pakistani Residents 
 
[1962] AC 515
, in which Lord Radcliffe states, at p 527: 
 
Their Lordships are of the view that it is correct to state that express provision is provision the applicability of which does not arise by inference. The applicability, however, of the provision under discussion to the present case does not arise by inference; it arises directly from the language used. the fact that the language used is wide and comprehensive and covers many points other than the one Immediately under discussion does not make it possible to say that its application can arise by inference only. To be `express provision` with regard to something it possible not necessary that that thing should be specially mentioned; it is sufficient that it is directly covered by the language however broad the language may which covers it so long as the applicability arises directly from the language used and not by inference therefrom.
 
 
 
In our judgment, s 121(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code lets in a confession, whether or not made pursuant to s 121(6), so long as the maker has been charged, and whether or not it is made while he is in police custody. That follows directly from the very wide language of the subsection, and not by inference. We are unable to agree that the words `at any time` have only a temporal connotation, and that they must be construed to mean `at any time so long as the accused is not in custody`. Needless to say, a confession made at any time, within the meaning of s 121(5), would be excluded by virtue of the proviso to s 121(5) if it were caused by inducement, threat or promise.
We are fortified in our view of the position because, if counsel for the defence was right, an absurd result could arise if an accused person, who was in custody, made a s 121(6) statement in the presence, say, of a police inspector but not a magistrate, which amounted to a confession but which also included exculpatory passages. It would be open to the prosecution, in that event, to object to the admission of such a statement, which cannot possibly have been the intention of the legislature.
Accordingly, we ruled against the defence in regard to its preliminary objection to the admissibility of the accused`s statement.
A sub-trial followed for the purpose of determining the admissibility of the accused`s statement, having regard to the manner and circumstances under which it was recorded.
Det Sgt Lim Beng Gee (PW5) said in evidence that, having taken the accused to the CID building early on the morning of 20 April 1985, questioning of the accused began in a room on the 4th storey of the building at about 6.30am Initially, only Sgt Lim and Det Choo Wee Guan were present. Other officers walked in and out of the room from time to time, but took no part in the questioning of the accused. Inspector Maniam came into the room `after 7.15am`, and at about 8.10am Sgt Lim placed the accused under arrest, on the instructions of Inspector T Maniam, the investigating officer.
It was put to Sgt Lim, under cross-examination, that he threatened the accused by telling him that he would be beaten up and detained if he did not admit to the crime. Sgt Lim denied this, and he also denied telling the accused that he had to give a positive, ie inculpatory, statement when Inspector Maniam came in. Sgt Lim said that the accused made no admissions before the arrival of Inspector Maniam, and only did so at about 8am, that is to say, about three quarters of an hour after Inspector Maniam arrived.
Det Choo Wee Guan (PW14) was called as a witness in the sub-trial, but his evidence was of no consequence since the defence conceded that he had not taken any part in the questioning of the accused.
Miss Lau Sau Heng (PW12) is an interpreter employed in the CID. She has been certificated for ten years. She told us that on the morning of 20 April 1985, she was requested by Inspector Maniam to assist in the interpretation of a statement which he proposed to record from the accused under s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code. She was introduced to the accused, who indicated that he wished to speak in the Cantonese dialect.
Miss Lau interpreted the typewritten charge (P51) to the accused in Cantonese. He indicated that he understood the charge, and signed it. Inspector Maniam then wrote the charge out on a sheet of paper (P52), and Miss Lau interpreted it to the accused. Having indicated again that he understood it, the accused signed P52, under the words: `The above charge was read over to me in English by the recorder and interpreted in Cantonese by the interpreter Lau Sau Heng and I understood the contents of the charge`, these words having also been interpreted to the accused by Miss Lau.
Inspector Maniam then wrote, on p 52, the following warning: 
 
Do you wish to say anything in answer to the charge. If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general. If you wish to mention any fact now and would like it written down, this will be done.
 
 
 
These words were interpreted to the accused by Miss Lau. The accused indicated that he understood the warning, and signed P52 again, under the following legend which was itself interpreted to him in Cantonese: 
 
The above warning was read over to me in English by the recorder and interpreted to me in Cantonese by the interpreter, Lau Sau Heng, and I understood the contents of the above warning.
 
 
 
A carbon copy of P52 was then served on the accused.
Under cross-examination by counsel for the accused, Miss Lau confirmed that she saw her role that morning as purely that of interpreter. Accordingly, she interpreted word for word what Inspector Maniam read to the accused, and no more. She interpreted everything that was written in the charge, and in the warning. After the accused had been served with a copy of P52, which contained the charge and the warning, in English, he was informed that he could make a statement, if he wished. The accused did not say that he wanted it written down.
The evidence of Inspector Maniam (PW13), with regard to the procedure followed before the recording of the accused`s statement began, generally mirrored that of Miss Lau. He confirmed, in cross-examination, that he read the charge to the accused in English, word for word, as he had written it on p 52. He had done the same with regard to the notice of warning. It was when the accused indicated that he understood the charge, and the warning, following their interpretation by Miss Lau, that he wrote out the words reproduced above, and asked the accused to sign under them.
After the accused had been served with a copy of p 52, he was asked whether he wished to say anything, whereupon the accused `began talking about the events`. The accused did not indicate that he wished what he said to be written down. Inspector Maniam conceded that the word `you` which appears in the last line of the warning set out in s 121(6) was inadvertently omitted by him when he wrote out the warning on p 52.
The Inspector confirmed that at no time did he explain the charge, beyond reading it out. The same went for the warning, although he asked the interpreter to explain both the charge and the warning to the accused.
Inspector Maniam said he had entered the room in which Sgt Lim were questioning the accused at about 7.30am that morning (20 April 1985). Det Choo Wee Guan was the only other person in the room. Det Sim Siew Hua was not present. It was as a result of something which the accused said at about 8.10am that the Inspector instructed Sgt Lim to place the accused under arrest. The accused had appeared normal while Inspector Maniam was in the room with him, and neither the Inspector nor Sgt Lim had threatened him, or offered him any inducement or reward.
In the event, the only prosecution witnesses in the sub-trial were Sgt Lim, Miss Lau, Sgt Choo and Inspector Maniam. Det Sim Siew Hua was not called, although he had given evidence in the main trial, presumably because it had not been suggested in the cross-examination of the other prosecution witnesses in the sub-trial that Det Sim had conducted himself towards the accused in a manner which might have a bearing on the admissibility of the accused`s statement.
The accused gave evidence on his own behalf in the sub-trial. He confirmed that he was questioned by Sgt Lim after being taken to the CID. Sgt Lim asked him whether he had killed the deceased, and when he was silent in response to this question, the sergeant insisted, in a loud, scolding tone that it must have been him. When the accused asked if he could go home, in order to proceed to his place of work, Sgt Lim had said, in a scolding tone: `You sit down. You cannot leave now.` The accused was a little frightened, and it was at this point that Det Sim Siew Hua came in. Sim kept insisting that it was the accused who killed the deceased, and told the accused that it was better for him to admit it. Sim then came up to the accused, held his left hand by the wrist, and placed his right fist against the accused`s cheek. The accused`s heart beat very fast, and he was very frightened because he thought that Det Sim was going to assault him. Sim said: `You are the one who killed the deceased. You had better admit or I`ll put you under s 55.` The accused asked what Sim meant, whereupon Sim replied: `Imprisonment`. Sim spoke in a tone suggestive of a quarrel, and the accused was `very scared`. As Sim`s fist was pressed against the accused`s cheek he made an admission, because he was afraid that Sim would assault him. Det Sim made `a deep impression` on the accused, because it was he who had threatened the accused. He felt that if he did not make an admission, Det Sim would assault him.
After he had made the admission, Inspector Maniam entered the room, spoke to the officers there and then left. Det Sim then came up to the accused again and instructed him to tell Inspector Maniam how he had carried out the killing.
As regards the recording of his statement by inspector Maniam later in the morning, the accused said the charge and the warning written out on p 52 were interpreted to him, but not explained. He did not understand either the charge or the warning fully.
A number of questions were put to the accused by the court. In answer to them the accused said that it was Det Sim alone who frightened him, and it was the act of Det Sim in putting his fist against the accused`s cheek which frightened him most. He confirmed that his counsel in the case, Mr Narindar Singh Kang, had been his counsel for some three years, and he said that he told Mr Kang about the incident concerning the placing by Det Sim of his fist against the accused`s face.
In answer to another question, the accused said that he made no admission when questioned by Sgt Lim and Det Choo, and that he did so only after Inspector Maniam entered the room. Inspector Maniam had not shouted at him or threatened him, and he had not told Inspector Maniam that he had been threatened and frightened by Det Choo because he was afraid to do so.
Insofar as his failure to comprehend the charge and warning was concerned, he did not understand what the words `charge` and `defence` meant.
At the conclusion of the sub-trial, we declined to admit into evidence the statement made by the accused to Inspector Maniam.
In setting out to record a statement from the accused, Inspector Maniam had proceeded under s 121(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code. That subsection provides that a person who is invited to make a statement `shall be served with a notice in writing` (the warning) `which shall be explained to him ...`. The warning incorporates the charge, and it follows that both must be explained.
It was plain from the evidence before us that the charge was not explained to the accused; nor was the warning. Both were read out to him in English, and interpreted to him, word for word, in Cantonese. That is all. It is true that the accused signed statements written out on p 52 to the effect that he understood both the charge and the warning, which statements were themselves interpreted to him, but we were not persuaded that this cured the omission to explain the charge and the warning.
Sections 121(6) and 122(1), now s 123(1), were enacted in 1976. The combined effect of these two subsections is that, where a person in the position in which the accused found himself fails, upon being administered the warning provided by section 121(6), to mention a fact which he could reasonably have been expected to mention, the court may draw adverse inferences against him. Having removed the right, which previously existed, of an accused person to remain silent without adverse consequences, the legislature was, by enacting ss 121(6) and 122(1), conferring upon the accused the right, if he wished, to make a statement in exculpation of himself at a certain stage of the proceedings against him, which the court was entitled to take a full account of.
That, it seemed to us, could well be why s 121(6) required that the warning be `explained`. The Act makes a clear distinction between explanation and interpretation, as will be seen by comparing s 121(6) with s 123(4), the latter dealing with statements or confessions made before a magistrate.
In the present case, it was obvious to Inspector Maniam when he decided to record a statement from the accused under s 121(6), that the accused intended to make a confession, which might not or might contain exculpatory statements. It must follow that Inspector Maniam anticipated that the statement would be used in the proceedings against the accused. The more reason then why the warning and the charge should have been explained. The accused was a primary six drop-out, and he told us that, inter alia, he did not understand what was meant by the word `defence` (in court) which appears in the warning. In our view, he was entitled to fully appreciate that if he had anything to say in exculpation of the alleged offence, that was the time to say it. Admittedly, the accused signed a statement to the effect that he understood the charge, and the warning. He may well have thought he did, when in fact he did not. Had the evidence been that he received an explanation, as required by s 121(6), he could not have been heard to complain.
We declined to admit the accused`s statement by reason of the failure of Inspector Maniam and Miss Lau to explain the charge and the warning to the accused, and for no other reason. We did not accept the contention of the defence that the omission of the word `you` in the phrase `you would like`, which appears in the warning, affected the admissibility of the statement. Nor were we persuaded that the accused made his statement as a result of threats uttered by Det Sim Siew Hua. It was never suggested to Sgt Lim by defence counsel that Det Sim had threatened the accused in any way. The accused conceded that he made no admissions while Sgt Lim and Det Sim were alone with him. He made an admission to Inspector Maniam at least 30 minutes after the Inspector entered the room in which the accused had earlier been questioned by Sgt Lim, and on the accused`s own admission, the Inspector had not threatened him in any way. He had made no complaint to the Inspector concerning the alleged threat by Det Sim. Quite simply, we did not believe the accused`s evidence that he had been threatened by Det Sim.
Following our refusal to admit the accused`s statement in evidence, the prosecution closed its case. Counsel for the accused thereupon submitted that no case had been made out against the accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. The basis for this submission was that such incriminatory evidence as existed was circumstantial; was given by Goh Choon Hui (PW9), Leong Fook Hing (PW10) and Ong Kok Hua (PW11), all of whose evidence was contradictory and inherently incredible and, in any event, did not link the accused with the murder of the deceased. Even if the accused had told witnesses that he had killed a person at Block 44, Lorong 5 Toa Payoh, that was not enough. He did not say that he had killed the deceased. The newspaper articles alleged to have been shown by the accused to PW9, PW10 and PW11 had not been produced, and the murdered person referred to in them had not been named. There might have been another murder at Block 44, who knew? The ring which the accused had pawned on the morning of 16 March 1985 had not been positively proved as having belonged to the deceased, and even if it had, that evidence did not go to a charge of murder.
We rejected the submission of no case to answer because, in our judgment, there existed at the end of the prosecution case credible evidence, which if we accepted it as accurate, established that the accused murdered the deceased, Sng Chiam Hong, within the period specified by the charge.
In our judgment, the prosecution adduced credible evidence that: 
 
 
(i) the deceased, Sng Chiam Hong, was a medium; 
 
(ii) the deceased was last seen at about 7am on 15 March 1985; 
 
(iii) at the time the deceased was last seen, he was wearing a gold ring like P54 with a dragon embossed on it; 
 
(iv) on the evening of 15 March 1985 the deceased made a telephone call to PW1, his god-daughter, and upon having been told that she was not in, said that he would phone again, but did not; 
 
(v) the deceased was murdered on or about 15 March 1985 at Block 44, Lorong 5, Toa Payoh # 01-205; 
 
(vi) the fatal injury was caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife; 
 
(vii) at about 9.15am the next morning, a ring with a dragon embossed on it (P54) was pawned by a male Chinese for $180. The person who pawned the ring produced an identity card which disclosed that he was Chan Sway Beng. The identity card number was 1502682-J and it showed that its holder lived at Block 103, Toa Payoh, Lorong 1 #09-331. A pawn ticket (P57) was issued for the ring; 
 
(viii) later the same day, 16 March 1985, the accused, Chan Sway Beng (who lived at Block 103, Toa Payoh), approached Goh Choon Hui, and asked if he could stay at Goh`s flat in Toa Payoh because he owed money to bookies, and wished to avoid them. Goh agreed to the accused`s request. The accused offered to sell the pawnticket P57 to Goh for $50. Sometime later Goh redeemed the ring (P54), or arranged for it to be redeemed by Sim Kiang Wee; 
 
(ix) on 17 March 1985, while the accused was staying at Goh`s flat, he stated in the presence of Leong Fook Hing and Ong Kok Hua that he had killed a person at Toa Payoh. The accused said that there had been a quarrel and a fight, and that he had killed this person with a knife; 
 
(x) the body of the deceased was found in his flat at Block 44, Toa Payoh, Lorong 5 at about 3.30 pm on 18 March 1985; 
 
(xi) none of the furniture or articles in the room in which the deceased was found was upset, and there were no other visible signs of a struggle or fight; 
 
(xii) the fatal stab wound was likely to have been caused by a curved downward thrust into the deceased`s chest, and was not likely to have been the result of the deceased running into a knife held in a slightly downward position; 
 
(xiii) soon after the accused stated that he had killed a man in Toa Payoh, the murder of a man in Toa Payoh was reported in the 
 Sin Min Daily News 
 and the 
 Straits Times 
. One of these newspapers described the victim as a temple medium. The accused showed these newspapers to Leong Fook Hing and Ong Kok Hua, and told them that the person referred to in the newspaper reports was the person he had killed; 
 
(xiv) the 
 Sin Min Daily News 
 reported that the murder had taken place at Block 44, Lorong 5 Toa Payoh.
  
 
 
It is true that PW9, on the one hand, and PW10 and PW11 on the other, gave differing versions of the statements made to them by the accused. PW9, in particular, said that the accused stated that he had injured someone, and that it was not until PW9 read the newspapers later that he realized that the injured person had died. PW10 and PW11, for their pad, were certain that the accused said that he had killed a person in Toa Payoh following an argument and a fight. We were impressed by the evidence of PW10 and PW11 They had no reason to lie; PW11 in particular had been a friend of the accused since they had been children, and we believed him when he said that he had no quarrel with the accused, and bore him no grudge.
In the event, we rejected the submission of no case to answer because, in our judgment, there existed at the end of the prosecution case credible evidence which, if we accepted it as accurate, established every ingredient of the offence with which the accused stood charged. Accordingly, we were unable to accept the defence contention that no credible evidence existed which linked the accused to the murder of the deceased.
We therefore called upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and gave him the standard allocution prescribed by s 188(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code. After consultation with his counsel, the accused elected to remain silent. We were left with no alternative but to convict the accused of the offence with which he stood charged. We did so, and sentenced him to death.

This is an appeal against the decision of the learned judicial commissioner who dismissed the appellant`s claim for passing-off. The counterclaim was stood down by consent and transferred to the subordinate courts. After the appeal was heard, we dismissed it and we now give our reasons.
 The facts 
The appellant is a company incorporated in Singapore in 1980. In the course of its business it markets and sells peanuts, cashew nuts and almond products under the brand name `Tong Garden`. It is a well established business, its predecessor Tong Guan Products having been set up in 1964. In 1975, Tong Guan Products had introduced clear plastic packs for its products. In 1978, Tong Guan Products had introduced dark blue and white aluminium foil packs for Tong Garden salted roasted peanuts in a narrow shape with arc colour separation. In 1983, after incorporation, the appellant changed the aluminium foil packs for Tong Garden roasted peanuts to the current broad shape and introduced similar aluminium foil packs for Tong Garden salted cashew nuts in dark blue and white with arc colour separation. This was extended to Tong Garden salted almonds in 1988. It is this dark blue packaging in respect of which the appellant alleges that there has been passing-off by the respondent.
The respondent is a company which is also incorporated in Singapore. Among its businesses it also sells the same products as the appellant. In 1985, the respondent marketed its `Deer Brand` salted cashew nuts in pale blue and white aluminium foil packs with wave colour separation. In October 1988 the respondent changed its packaging for Deer Brand salted cashew nuts to dark blue and white with arc colour separation. By November 1988 the respondent also marketed Deer Brand spicy almonds in aluminium foil packs of dark blue and white with arc colour separation.
In November 1988, the appellant took out an interim injunction restraining the respondent from packaging and marketing its cashew nuts and almonds on the ground that the packaging constituted passing-off. On 7 December 1988, the respondent successfully applied to have the interim injunction discharged.
The action was tried in the High Court in April and July 1990. The learned judicial commissioner held that the appellant had failed to prove any reputation in respect of its aluminium foil pack for its cashew nuts and almonds, and that there had been no misrepresentation by the respondent. He dismissed the appellant`s claim with costs, and the appellant appealed to this court.
 The law 
The law of passing-off is well established. The appellant must establish reputation in the get-up, misrepresentation and likelihood of damage. In this case, proof of likelihood of damage rather than damage is needed because the pleadings were amended to reflect this.
 Reputation in the get-up 
Get-up was defined by Fletcher Moulton LJ in 
 JB Williams & Co 
 
 v 
 
 Bronnley & Co Ltd 
 (1909) 26 RPC 765 as `a capricious addition to the article itself - the colour or shape it may be, of the wrapper or anything of that kind.` He added: `I strongly object to look at anything, that has a value in use, as part of the get-up of the article.` In 
 Jarman & Platt Ltd 
 
 v 
 
 I Barget Ltd 
 [1977] FSR 260 Megaw LJ was prepared to be less restrictive in considering what constituted get-up and considered the possibility of get-up consisting of `the characteristics of the product itself such as the shape or colour of the article itself`. He observed however that in such a case the necessary proof of reputation was not easy and held that in the case before him reputation was not proved.
The get-up of the appellant`s packaging for salted cashew nuts can be described as follows. The package is made of aluminium foil. It is rectangular in shape approximately 11cm by 9cm. Looking at it from the side which has the words `Tong Garden`, there is a dark blue arc that runs across the front from left to right with the thickest portion of the arc in the middle. This arc covers about one third of the total area. The words `Tong Garden` are written across the top of the arc in bold yellow letters. Beneath these words is written `Salted Cashewnuts` in white bold lettering of a smaller size than the words `Tong Garden`. Beneath the arc, the package is white in colour. This white portion covers the bottom two thirds of the package. There are photographs of cashew nuts superimposed on the lower half of the package where the white portion is. In 1983 when the package was introduced, 50g of cashew nuts were packed into each pack. At present 45g are packed into each pack.
The exhibits include some photographs of the packaging where the words `Premium Quality` appear in a red circle near the bottom right hand corner. In these photographs, there is also a white rectangle at the bottom left hand corner. In the rectangle is a lion with four Chinese characters. Beneath the words `Salted Cashewnuts` in English are six Chinese characters which state the brand name. However, these markings appear in some photographs of the packages on display, but do not appear in other photographs. It is obvious that there have been some changes in the packaging. Furthermore, during the appeal, it was conceded that these markings are not consistently used. The packaging for the spicy almonds is similar except for the words `Almonds` in place of `Cashewnuts`.
From our overall impression of the packaging, it is clear to us that the appellant is entitled to rely on the packaging as a whole as a distinctive get-up, and that there is a capricious addition to the article itself. This is only one aspect however of what the appellant must establish. The appellant must also show that the get-up is well known in connection with its business, ie the reputation of the get-up must be established. The appellant must prove that the mark, name or other indicia on which it relies is well known in connection with a business in which it has goodwill, or with goods connected with that business, and is distinctive of those goods or that business. In this case, the appellant is relying on the get-up of the cashew nuts and salted almonds packaging. The only way in which a person can acquire reputation in a mark, name or other indicia is by using it in connection with his business or goods. The precise extent of use required depends on the nature of the particular mark, name or indicia used and of the business or goods concerned.
In the case of 
 White Hudson & Co v Asian Organization Ltd 
 
 
 
[1965] MLJ 186
 
 , 
the goods in question were `Hacks` sweets which were wrapped in red coloured cellophane paper on which the word `Hacks` was printed. Lord Guest said on p 188 that: 
 
The essence of a passing-off action is that A is not entitled to represent his goods as the goods of B or enable someone else to do so. (
 John Brinsmead & Sons Ltd v Brinsmead
 30 RPC 493). The first matter which a plaintiff must prove in a passing-off action is that the get-up of his goods has become distinctive of these goods and that it was associated or identified with them. This is a question of fact and upon this the appellants have the finding of the trial judge in their favour. Their Lordships are satisfied that the trial judge was justified in so finding. 
 The fact that non-English speaking customers were in the habit of asking for `red paper cough sweets` shows clearly that to these customers the get-up of the red coloured wrapper had become associated or identified with the appellants` goods
 [our emphasis]. An attempt was made by the respondents to show that the red coloured wrappers were common to the trade. This attempt failed, as it was clear on the evidence that prior to 1953 no wrapper similar to that used on the appellants` sweets had ever been used in Singapore, and from 1953-1958 the appellants` sweets were the only sweets so wrapped which were sold in Singapore.
 
 
 
In 
 Hoffman-La Roche 
 v 
 DDSA Pharmaceuticals 
 [1972] RPC 1, the plaintiffs manufactured and marketed the drug chlordiazepoxide under the registered mark `Librium` in distinctive black and green capsules bearing the word `Roche` on each capsule. The defendants proceeded to market and advertise the drug chlordiazepoxide in black and green 10 mg capsules which were identical to those of the plaintiffs except that they bore the letters `DDSA` instead of the plaintiffs` name. It was held that the public associated the green and black capsules with the plaintiffs even if they did not know the identity of the plaintiffs. Harman LJ said that goods of a particular get-up just as much proclaim their origin as if they had a particular name attached to them, and it is well-known that when goods are sold with a particular get-up for long enough to be recognized by the public as goods of a particular manufacturer it does not matter whether you know who the manufacturer is. It was further held that in spite of the fact that in this case the goods were not sold over the counter and the public had little or no choice, if the defendants were permitted to put an article on the market with an almost identical get-up to that of the plaintiffs` goods, the public would be misled into thinking that they were acquiring their medicine from the same original, reliable, albeit unknown, source as previously. It was significant in this case that the plaintiffs were the only persons who had produced the green and black capsule for the previous ten years, and that in 1968 alone 328 million such capsules were sold. The judges also placed emphasis on the evidence of repeat prescriptions and that patients would be resistant to taking something other than the green and black capsules.
 Hoffman-La Roche 
 v 
 DDSA Pharmaceuticals 
 was distinguished in 
 Roche Products Ltd 
 v 
 Berk Pharmaceuticals 
 [1973] RPC 473; [1973] FSR 3455 which also concerned colour schemes in get-up. The plaintiffs in a passing-off action had for several years marketed on a very large scale a tranquillizer comprising the drug diazepam (DZP) which was sold under the name `Valium`. The drug was made in the form of tablets of different dosages, and in particular there was a 2mg dose in the form of a white tablet and a 5mg dose in the form of a yellow tablet. These tablets, which were circular, each bore the name `Roche` in very small letters and either the number 2 or 5 and also a single score mark. The defendants, having obtained a compulsory licence under the relevant patent to market the drug, put out 2 and 5mg tablets which were in subsidentical in appearance to those of the plaintiffs, save that they bore the name `Berk` rather than `Roche`, and it was conceded that the general appearance of the plaintiffs` tablets had been copied. Russell LJ said at p 484: 
 
It was of course much stressed in argument that there was no ground upon which the defendants could avoid the application to this case of the reasons which particularly led me in the 
 DDSA
 case to conclude that the consumer would have attributed a single source to the green and black capsule in that case. There, as here, the defendants indicated that they had chosen the particular appearance to avoid patients raising queries when the same medicament was dispensed (the product of the defendants) with an appearance different from that in which it had previously been dispensed (the product of the plaintiffs). I took the view that there was nothing to suggest that patients would continue to query the matter if it was explained to them that the difference indicated only a difference in source, unless they attached importance to source, and that the defendants` insistence on the green/black capsule therefore was itself a pointer towards the source-identification in patients` minds of the green and black appearance. But the appearance of the capsule in the 
 Hoffman-La Roche
 
 v
 
 DDSA
 [1972] RPC 1 case was unique in the field of medicaments (see Dr Mars` evidence referred to above) and striking, and as such of its nature far more likely to convey to a patient`s mind an impression of one source than the commonplace tablets in the present case. It may seem a narrow distinction, but in the present case it might well be that if the plaintiffs` tablets had, for example, each been layered in two colours, the result would have been different. 
 On the whole, I conclude that the evidence does not sufficiently establish that the very ordinary appearance of the plaintiffs` white and yellow DZP tablet has led consuming patients to attribute them to one manufacturing trade source or provenance
 [our emphasis]: and unless there be such an attribution, the defendants` substantial copying of that very ordin ary appearance cannot be a representation that their product is the product of the plaintiffs or more than a representation that it contains the medicament DZP.
 
 
 
The case of 
 Sodastream Ltd v Thorn Cascade Co Ltd 
 [1982] RPC 459 was referred to by counsel for the appellant. In that case the plaintiffs marketed refillable carbon dioxide cylinders for use in home carbonating machines. Empty cylinders were returned to the plaintiffs who would refill them and send them back to the retailers for re-sale. Having purchased an initial cylinder, the customer would, by exchanging cylinders, thereafter purchase only the gas consumed. The cylinders were embossed on the valve with the `Sodastream` trade mark; some were painted grey and others (far fewer in number) blue, and prior to being marketed, all the cylinders had a red and white label affixed indicating that they had been filled by the plaintiffs. From 1974 to 1979 these cylinders had been marketed through a company in the defendant`s group. In 1979, having severed their trade connection with the plaintiffs, the defendants entered the market on their own account and in January 1980, produced a home carbonating machine under the name `Thorn Cascade`. The cylinders used in the defendants` machine were, save as to colour, identical to those of the plaintiffs, the cylinders of both parties being fully interchangeable in use. From time to time retailers returned to the plaintiffs empty cylinders originating from the defendants and vice versa. In June and September 1980 the defendants intimated that it was their intention to refill such of the plaintiffs` cylinders as should come into their possession. These cylinders were not to be repainted, but the defendants intended to superimpose `Thorn Cascade` labels upon the name and trademark which appeared upon the plaintiffs` cylinders. In May 1981 the plaintiffs issued a writ and applied for an interlocutory injunction, in essence to restrain the defendants from refilling and marketing cylinders originating from the plaintiffs pending trial. Whitford J refused the applic ation for an interlocutory injunction. On appeal to the Court of Appeal it was held, allowing the appeal and granting an interlocutory injunction, that there was a serious issue to be tried; the colour grey, applied to cylinders, was distinctive of the plaintiffs` product if only because, from 1974 to 1979, the plaintiffs` cylinder were the only ones on the market. 
 Hoffman-La Roche v DDSA Pharmaceuticals 
 was applied.
The mere shortage of time in which the appellants have been using the get-up is not necessarily fatal. Heavy advertising over a short period of time may be sufficient. In 
 Stannard v Reay 
 [1967] FSR 140, three weeks` use of the words `Mr Chippy` for a mobile fish and chip business was held to be sufficient for the purpose of granting interlocutory relief. The plaintiffs were trading on the Isle of Wight and had used a van with `Mr Chippy` painted on the van. The defendants who also traded on the Isle of Wight, obtained a van of the same model, decorated it in the same manner and put the words `Mr Chippy` on the van. In 
 Allen & Co v Brown Watson 
[1965] RPC 191 the plaintiffs were granted an exclusive licence to print and publish a book within a certain geographical area. It became widely known in the book trade through advertisements and press notices that the book would be published by the plaintiffs in the autumn of 1964. It was held that a month and a half`s heavy advertising was considered sufficient for a book title.
In 
 Malaysia Dairy Industries Pte Ltd v Yakult (Singapore) Pte Ltd 
 
 
 
[1980] 1 MLJ 202
  which involved `Vitagen` and `Yakult`, the plaintiffs applied for an injunction to restrain the defendants from selling or distributing cultured milk drinks in bottles so got up as to be calculated to lead the defendants` product being confused with the plaintiffs` product, or from passing off cultured milk drinks not of the plaintiffs` manufacture as and for the plaintiffs` goods. Chua J said on p 204:
What the plaintiffs have to establish first is that the shape of the Vitagen bottle has become by use in Singapore associated exclusively with the plaintiffs` lactic acid drink so that the use of a bottle so shaped will be understood by the trade and public in Singapore as meaning that the goods thus marketed are the goods of the plaintiffs and no one else. (See 
 Jarman & Platt Ltd v I Barget Ltd. 
 ) The plaintiffs say that they have since April 1977, built up a substantial business in Singapore and Malaysia in their lactic acid drink `Vitagen` and the development of the market has been fostered by a skilful and expensive marketing campaign. One important way in which they have succeeded in making their product familiar to the public has been the use of the Vitagen bottle which is of unusual and unique shape. This container does not merely have the virtue of a distinctive appearance - it is functional in that the top makes it easy to drink from.
Let us see how the plaintiffs have developed the market for their `Vitagen` in their marketing campaign. The plaintiffs say that one important way in which they have succeeded in making their product familiar to the public has been the use of this unusual and unique shape bottle. Now, if the shape of the bottle was intended to be and had indeed become distinctive of the plaintiffs` product one would expect the bottle to feature as such prominently in all the plaintiffs` advertisements and other publicity material. This has not been done and instead the plaintiffs have sought to teach the public to identify their product by the brand name `Vitagen`. 
 The advertising emphasis has not been on the shape of the bottle but on the brand name `Vitagen` which is prominently displayed on the containers and is used in advertising material concerning such goods 
. There is no statement in the advertisements to say that the public could recognize the plaintiffs` product by the shape of the bottle. [Our emphasis.]
Further at p 205, Chua J said: 
 
In my view the plaintiffs have failed to establish that the shape of the Vitagen bottle has become by use in Singapore distinctive of the plaintiffs` lactic acid drink ...
 
 
 
Whether or not reputation has been acquired depends very much on the facts of each particular case. In the present case, the cashew nuts or spicy almonds 
 per se 
 are not goods which are unique to the appellant; what the appellant has to show is that the packaging is well known in connection with the appellant`s business. There is nothing about the shape or the size or the material used in the packaging by the appellant that sets these two products apart from the market. There is also nothing distinctive about the use of photographs of the nuts contained within.
The appellant`s efforts at promoting the cashew nuts can be described as follows. The advertising efforts began with a Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) advertising contract which lasted from 15 January 1986 to 11 February 1986. There was also a series of Rediffusion advertisements and sponsored programmes and telephone games and quiz shows. There was also advertising on SBC Radio 3 and 4 programmes in January 1987. The Rediffusion advertising continued until September 1988. Almost all these advertisements were in the Chinese language. The advertisements were by way of non-visual media. The get-up of the cashew nuts and spicy almonds could not have been publicized. In fact, it is a reasonable inference that the words `Tong Garden` must have been spoken, and that consumers would be enjoined in the advertisements to look for `Tong Garden` and not for the blue and white cashew nuts. It was also stated in evidence that in 1983 and 1984, there were advertisements in Kong Chian, Ang Mo Kio and Cathay cinemas. In so far as trade advertising was concerned there were advertisements in `Entrepot` in February 1986, and in some other trade brochures. These advertisements showed a wide range of `Tong Garden` products in their various packaging, some of which were in plastic packs or foil packs and others were in cans. The get-up of the plastic packaging was not similar to the foil packaging as the blue arc with white colour separation did not appear. It is also significant that the get-up for the appellant`s products have changed from time to time - from the clear plastic pack in 1975, to the narrow foil pack in 1978, to the current broad foil pack in 1983.
The only possible promotion which had some visual content would have been the TV advertisements in 1986 and the cinema slides in 1983. However, there is no indication as to what the contents of the advertisements were. Clearly, they could not have used the almond packaging as the get-up for almonds came into being in 1988. These advertisements were placed soon after the appellant changed from the narrow foil packs to the current broad shape. There is no evidence as to the contents of those advertisements. This is unlike the case of the `Hacks` sweets where the trial judge found that the vast majority of non-English speaking customers who were unable to read the words printed on the wrappers asked for the sweets by describing them as `red paper cough sweets`.
Despite the evidence of advertising in Chinese, the managing director of the appellant said in evidence that the English-educated would identify the products by the words `Tong Garden`. There is no evidence as to how the Chinese educated identify the appellant`s products, as to whether they rely on `Tong Garden`, the Chinese characters as and when they appear, the get-up or otherwise. There was a cryptic answer in cross-examination when the managing director said that some customers told him that they bought the products by packaging, but the director in charge of sales and promotion said that the Rediffusion advertisements only emphasized the brand name. `Tong Garden` may well be an established name, but not its packaging. The only inference that can be drawn is that the advertising emphasized the brand name and not the get-up.
In our opinion, the case of 
 Hoffman-La Roche v DDSA Pharmaceuticals 
is distinguishable from the present case because, in that case, there was ample evidence of the reputation of the green and black capsules. It was the only green and black capsules on the market for ten years and more than 328 million capsules were sold in one year.
 Roche v Berk 
is applicable because the key factor was the very ordinary appearance of the `Valium` tablets. In the present case, the appellant`s packaging is very ordinary. It is of a common size, of a common shape and of a common material. Furthermore, the public know the appellant`s product by name. The identification by name is something which featured prominently in the evidence of the appellant`s witnesses.
The facts of 
 Sodastream v Thorn Cascade 
 were rather unusual in that the act complained of was the refilling and marketing of one party`s products by another. Moreover it was an application for an interlocutory injunction where the test is different. Thus it has no application here. In our opinion, the 
 Malaysia Dairy 
case is particularly applicable, owing to the fact that in both that case and the present case, the features relied on are common to the trade, and that the advertising was directed to promoting the brand name rather than the packaging. Counsel for the appellant also submitted that this was a case of creeping passing-off, by which he meant that the respondent`s get-up became progressively more and more like that of the appellant`s. Reference was made by him to the cases of 
 J & J Colman Ltd v Farrow & Co 
(1898) 15 RPC 198
 , Bryant & May Ltd v United Match Industries 
 (1932) 50 RPC 12 and 
 Boh Plantations Sdn Bhd 
 v 
 Gui Nee Chuan 
 
 
 
[1975] 2 MLJ 213
 . We do not think that these cases assist him because reputation must still be established first. Moreover, there are important differences because in all three cases, the get-up which had been registered as trade marks had been in use for many years, ranging from about 20 to 60 years. There is indeed a clear trend in these cases, with which we concur, which shows that where the get-up has not been registered as a trade mark, it is much more difficult to establish reputation. Conversely, if, in addition to other evidence adduced, the get-up has been registered as a trade mark, it has been easier for a party to establish reputation in the get-up. In the present case, the appellant`s get-up had been in use for five years, there had been changes in the get-up, it had not been registered as a trade mark, and th ere is no evidence that the market had identified the get-up with the appellant`s products. Therefore, it is our opinion that the appellant has not proven reputation of the get-up of either the cashew nuts or the almonds.
 Misrepresentation 
The law is settled and there is a series of cases for the following propositions from the last century to the present. The test to be applied has been stated in 
 Newsweek Inc 
 v 
 British Broadcasting Corporation 
 [1979] RPC 441 at p 447 which is whether ordinary sensible members of the public would be confused. It is not sufficient that the only confusion would be to a very small unobservant section of society or as Foster J put it recently, if the only person who would be misled would be a moron in a hurry. It is sufficient that a substantial proportion of persons who are probably purchasers of the goods of the kind in question would in fact be confused. Whether or not there is misrepresentation is always a question of fact to be determined by the court in the light of evidence of surrounding circumstances. The impression is entirely a matter for the judgment of the court and not that of the witnesses. All that can be done is to ascertain in every case as it occurs whether there is such a resemblance as to deceive a purchaser using ordinary caution.
In the present case, the misrepresentation alleged is an indirect one. What the appellant is alleging is that the respondent`s packaging looks similar to that of the appellant. In such cases the point to be decided is whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, the use by the respondent in connection with the goods of the mark, name or get-up in question impliedly represents such goods to be the goods of the appellant or, as it is sometimes put, is calculated to deceive.
It is necessary for the court to take into account the nature of the purchasing public, the extent of confusion and the way in which confusion arises. The test for comparison of confusingly similar names, marks or other distinguishing indicia is not to compare them side by side but to take into account the fact that confusion which may occur will take place when the customer has in his mind his recollection of the appellant`s mark which may well be only an idea of the whole or actual mark. As stated by Lord Radcliffe in 
 De Cordova v Vick Chemical Co Ltd 
 (1951) 68 RPC 103 at p 106: 
 
the likelihood of deception or confusion in such cases is not disproved by placing the two marks side by side and demonstrating how small is the chance of error in any customer who places his order for the goods with both the marks clearly before him, for orders are not placed or often not placed under such conditions. It is more useful to observe that in most persons, the eye is not an accurate recorder of visual detail and that marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole.
 
 
 
In his grounds of decision, the learned judicial commissioner has said that a mere scrutiny of the appellant`s and the respondent`s aluminium foil packaging would reveal that there were many differences. On the respondent`s packaging, the words `salted cashew nuts` were in red letters behind the white background. The appellant`s packaging only showed the words `salted cashew nuts` in white lettering. There was a deer logo on the respondent`s packaging and none on the appellant`s. Most significantly, the brand names were totally different. The appellant uses its brand name `Tong Garden` and the respondent its `Deer` brand. Both brand names were prominently displayed in the front of the packages. Under the respondent`s packaging, the words `Quality Product` were written behind the pink background with the jagged edge, but there were no such words on the appellant`s package. There were also many differences in design on the back of the two packages.
The learned judicial commissioner went on to say that `in my opinion, no brand conscious consumer would ever be misled into buying one brand for another`. There is indeed very little evidence of actual confusion. The first witness for the appellant who was managing director of the appellant said in answer to two questions that there was actual confusion. In the first question, when asked what caused him to take action against the respondent, his answer was, `When we advertised over the radio, some customers produce the defendant`s packages wrongly`, and further on, in cross-examination, when asked, `Do you have any evidence that your customers buy your products by packaging?`, his answer was `Yes, some customers told me.` This was the extent of the evidence of actual confusion. It seems odd, to say the least, that when the appellant advertised over radio, where there cannot be any visual representation, some customers should produce the respondent`s packages wrongly. Furthermore, in the second question, as to whether he had any evidence that his customers buy the products by packaging, the answer was `Yes, some customers told me`. However, there is no evidence that the customers did not also look at the brand `Tong Garden` before purchase. The answer to this question therefore does not support the contention that there is actual confusion. Counsel also referred us to evidence that some packages were put on the wrong racks at one particular shop by the customer. In fact, this may show that the prospective purchaser took a packet and when he saw that it was not the correct brand which he wanted, replaced it on the wrong rack. There may be a whole host of reasons why it was replaced on the wrong racks, such as laziness of the customer in replacing the packets etc. But all this is not evidence of confusion.
The learned judicial commissioner applied the test of the brand-conscious consumer. This test does not appear to be supported by authority and the authorities in fact show that the test is a purchaser using ordinary caution. Given that there is no evidence of actual confusion, we then looked at the packages at hand and the circumstances of sale. The arguments and remarks of Chua J in the 
 Malaysia Dairy 
 case are relevant. Chua J said at p 205: 
 
The plaintiffs say that many potential purchasers of the lactic acid drink will be misled, if the defendants are allowed to market their lactic acid drink in the Yakult bottle, into thinking that the defendants` products are a smaller sized version of the plaintiffs` lactic acid drink. The plaintiffs say that the Yakult bottles bear a substantial resemblance in all material respects to those in which the plaintiffs` lactic acid drinks are sold.
 
 
 
I do not agree with the submissions of the plaintiffs. There is no substantial confusing resemblance between the Yakult Singapore bottle and the Vitagen bottle. It is true that the bottle shapes are the same. Leaving aside the bottle shape there are numerous and obvious differences in the get-up and appearance as appears from a direct comparison ...
The exhibits include some photographs showing the manner in which the products of both parties are displayed. They are displayed on racks or boxes at provision shops and at a cinema. There is no evidence as to whether people ask for assistance from the shopkeeper, choose on their own accord, ask for `Tong Garden` or otherwise. Looking at the various exhibits and taking into account the many differences in the packaging, and the fact that the brand name is important and prominently displayed, we find that there has been no misrepresentation in this case. Further, we should also point out that although illiteracy has been referred to in many of the previous cases, this must be an evaporating consideration in the Singapore of today. We are of the view that an ordinary purchaser using ordinary caution in Singapore would know enough English or Chinese to read the brand name in one of the two languages that appear on the `Tong Garden` products regardless whether they are English or Chinese educated.
 Damage 
In an action for passing-off, damage is an essential element of the tort and it is necessary to establish that the plaintiff has suffered damage. If the goods in question are in direct competition with one another, the court will readily infer the likelihood of damage to the plaintiff`s goodwill, not merely through loss of sales but also through loss of the exclusive use of his name or mark in relation to the particular goods or business concerned. The inference here is rebutted by the evidence. There is nothing to suggest that the appellant has suffered any damage. This is borne out by both sets of figures supplied by the appellant and the oral evidence. Using the first set of figures, the appellant`s sales have in fact been increasing constantly since 1984. In 1984, the sales of cashew nuts locally amounted to $852,000, in 1985 to $1.05m, in 1986 to $1.13m, in 1987 to $1.2m, in 1988 to $1.5m and in 1989 to $1.72m. Sales for the almonds did drop over the 1988-1989 period, but this was not explained in evidence.
From 1988 to 1989, when the respondent`s products were introduced with a similar packaging to that of the appellant, the appellant`s sales in fact increased from $1.5m to $1.72m. Any fluctuation in volume arose partly because `Deer Brand` was cheaper than `Tong Garden` at the wholesale level. A wholesaler said in his examination-in-chief, that `... after I started selling Deer Brand my sales of Tong Garden products dropped by 30%-40% ...`. However, he went on to say that `... Tong Garden nuts are more expensive when I bought it. When I sold to the retailers, the Tong Garden nuts are also more expensive. When the retailers sell to the consumers, they sell the two brands at the same price ... .` The profit margin was lower on the appellant`s products. In cross-examination, he was asked: 
 
Q: When you refer to the reduction of 30%-40%, what did you mean?
 
 
 
 
A: I was referring to the reduction of the quantity of Tong Garden products. 
 
Q: What quantity were you referring to? 
 
A: Initially, I could sell 6,000 Tong Garden packages. It was reduced to 4,000 a month. 
 
Q: What quantity of Deer Brand could you sell? 
 
A: I could sell 1,000 to 1,200 packages a month. 
 
Q: What quantity on average a month when you started selling those brand? 
 
A: Tong Garden was about 4,000 to 5,000 and for Deer Brand, it was about 1,000 to 1,200. 
 
Q: Did the quantity of plaintiff`s products increase after that? 
 
A: No. Sometimes may be less. Sales volume varied. 
 
Q: Can you explain the reduction in sales volume of Tong Garden products? 
 
A: Business is never stable. 
 
Q: The existence of Deer Brand is pure market competition? 
 
A: I cannot answer.
  
 
 
Another witness who from 1979 to 1989 was a sales representative who distributed packaged nuts confirmed this in cross-examination:
 
 
Q: You selected the brand? 
 
A: No. Because Deer Brand was cheaper and we could make more money from it, so I would sell them Deer Brand. 
 
Q: Did any of your customers ask for Tong Garden products? 
 
A: Yes, if they specified Tong Garden. Otherwise, I would sell them Deer Brand.
  
 
 
It would appear to us on the evidence that the reason why the sale of Tong Garden products was reduced in volume was simply that retailers could make more money selling Deer Brand than Tong Garden products. Therefore, they would choose to buy Deer Brand products from the wholesaler rather than Tong Garden products. It is thus a reasonable inference that the reduction in sales volume could have been caused by the competition of Deer Brand products. In any event, the possibility of damage was rebutted by the appellant`s own evidence; the appellant`s sales figures showed that in fact the monetary value of sales increased. As for the likelihood of damage there is absolutely no evidence.
In our opinion therefore the appeal failed on all three grounds in that the appellant was unable to establish reputation, was unable to show misrepresentation and was also unable to show the likelihood of damage. The appeal was accordingly dismissed with costs.

The appellant was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment with effect from 27 September 1984 on a charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, an offence punishable under s 304 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). He appealed against sentence.
On 4 September 1984 at the Westpeak Condothe appellant stabbed a 29-year-old woman and caused her death. The deceased had been in the swimming pool of the condominium together with her husband, nephews and niece. At about 8.45pm she came out of the swimming pool and went to the ladies` changing room to change. In the changing room, she was attacked by the appellant with a knife. Another resident of Westpeak Condominium was near the swimming pool at the time and heard the deceased scream. He ran towards the entrance of the changing room and saw the appellant running out naked. He attempted to strike the appellant with a squash racket which he was carrying, and was stabbed by the appellant on his chin and his left hand. The appellant then fled.
The deceased had in all 21 injuries - three stab wounds, five bruises, 12 incised wounds and some loss of skin on her nose. The fatal injury was a stab would in her left chest which penetrated the left lung to a depth of 7.5cm to 8.5cm. The cause of death was certified to be `left haemothorax due to stab wound of the left lung`.
The appellant was arrested on 27 September 1984. After a trial which stretched from 3 October 1988 to 25 May 1989 he was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code with effect from the date of his arrest. Section 304 reads as follows: 
 
Whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished:
 
 
 
 
(a) with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning, if the act by which death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death; or 
 
(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with fine, or with both, if the act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.
  
 
 
Before he was charged at the commencement of the trial, the appellant was medically examined by a psychiatrist at the request of his counsel and the psychiatrist was of the opinion that he was mentally fit to stand trial and plead. After he was convicted on 29 March 1989, further medical reports on him were obtained from two psychiatrists before he was sentenced on 25 May 1989. In sentencing him, Chua J said: 
 
I have taken into consideration what your counsel has urged on your behalf in mitigation. In assessing sentence, I have taken into consideration the history of your mental illness. You have been mentally ill since you were 15 years of age and you were first diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia, that is a major mental illness, on 29 April 1975 and you have received regular treatment as an outpatient from 1975 to 1980. You suffered a relapse in June of 1980. You were apprehended by the police because you were running around and causing a public nuisance and you were admitted to Woodbridge Hospital on 23 June 1980. You were given the requisite treatment and discharged on 10 July 1980. Then a few days later, you had another relapse and you were re-admitted to the WoodHospital by your father and your father took you to the hospital on 21 July 1980. Then you absconded from hospital on 28 August but you were brought back to the hospital by your father on 1 September 1980 where you continued to receive treatment as an outpatient. Between 1980 and 1983, you received regular treatment as an outpatient. Then you had another relapse in April 1983. You were apprehended by the police for abnormal behaviour and you were re-admitted into the Woodbridge Hospital on 21 April 1983, and after treatment, you were discharged on 9 May. Thereafter, you attended regularly for treatment as an outpatient. On 4 September 1984, it appears that you had a relapse and you killed this unfortunate lady that night. Now, it is clear to me that when you stabbed her, it was done with the intention of causing some bodily injuries as would likely to cause death. Now, while in remand, you received medical treatment for your illness. However, according to the doctor, you showed signs of relapse in November 1987 and January 1988. The doctors have reported that you are suffering from a chronic schizophrenic illness which requires a long-term maintenance drug treatment for an indefinite period and that is to minimize relapses and if you hav e a relapse, you may pose a danger to yourself and to society. Now, the public must be protected against you and the detention, in my view, should be as long as it is permissible under the law. A long-term imprisonment would also be for your own good because whilst in prison, you will get proper medical care and attention. I will be failing in my duty if I do not sentence you to a long term of imprisonment. You are sentenced to imprisonment for life.
 
 
 
Before the Court of Criminal Appeal, the appellant appeared in person to appeal against the sentence of life imprisonment. His appeal consisted of only two statements: first, that he had pleaded guilty to the charge, which was of course not true; and secondly he asked for a lighter sentence of three or four years. Section 304(a) is, on the face of it, rather curiously drafted, because in addition to the sentence to imprisonment for life, there is the alternative possibility of a much lighter custodial sentence up to a maximum of ten years. The only question in the present case was whether the sentence to imprisonment for life was justified.
The deputy public prosecutor referred us to a report on sentencing from the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal in England in the case of 
 R v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson 
 (1968) 52 Cr App R 113 which carried the following statement by MacKenna J, with which we are in broad agreement: 
 
When the following conditions are satisfied, a sentence of life imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1) where the offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) where it appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant`s history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence.
 
 
 
In the present case, the appellant has been suffering from schizophrenia, a major mental illness, since 1975. Both the psychiatrists` reports, which were considered by the court before sentence was passed, were to the effect that he would require a long term drug treatment for an indefinite period to minimize relapses during which he might pose a danger to society and himself. In fact, the appellant had two relapses in 1980, one in 1983 and one in 1984 when he committed the present offence; and, while he was in remand in 1987 and 1988 he had two more relapses lasting one week and one month respectively.
We were of the opinion that the conditions for sentence to imprisonment for life were clearly satisfied in the present case and justified a life sentence. The appellant is clearly a continuing danger not only to himself but also to the public. The trial judge was of the view, which we shared, that he should be detained as long as it was permissible under the law. We might add that, with remissions, life imprisonment in Singapore may be reduced in practice to no more than 14 years, and the appellant may in fact be out of prison in another seven years.

The two appellants had on 25 March 1991 pleaded guilty to the following charge: 
 
You, Er Boon Huai and Lai Ah Kau, are charged that between 11.45am and 11.55am on 27 April 1988, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in `Class A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) by transporting three packets containing a total of not less than 10g and not more than 15g of diamorphine in motor car PBE 9696 from the carpark at Block 75, Pipit Road, to the carpark serving Blocks 54 and 76, Pipit Road, via Circuit Road, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
They admitted the facts outlined by the prosecution and were convicted. The first appellant, Er Boon Huai, who was 33 years of age, was sentenced to 24 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. The second appellant, Lai Ah Kau, who on the date of the conviction was 50 years and nine months old, was sentenced to 27 years` imprisonment. They now appeal against the sentences imposed.
The facts that gave rise to the offence were that on 25 April 1988, the second appellant telephoned the first appellant and told him that he had a buyer for three pounds of heroin at $6,400 per pound. The first appellant made the necessary arrangements with his supplier and told the second appellant that he would deliver the three pounds to the second appellant on 27 April 1988.
At about 11am on 27 April 1988, the first appellant collected the three pounds of heroin from near Beauty World in Bukit Timah area and drove to Pipit Road. He parked his car near Block 75, Pipit Road, and went up to the flat at Block 75, #09-227, where the second appellant was waiting. The buyer arrived at the flat shortly thereafter and left after speaking with the second appellant. The second appellant told the first appellant that the buyer had told him that he would collect the diamorphine later and had asked the second appellant to keep the diamorphine until collection.
The two appellants then went to where the first appellant`s car was parked. Rather than take the drugs from where the car was parked, the two drove off, went into Circuit Road, then returned to Pipit Road and stopped at the car park serving Blocks 54 and 76. The second appellant then took a brown plastic bag containing three bundles of the drug and went to the flat at Block 75, #09-227.
The first appellant drove off but was intercepted and arrested by officers of the Central Narcotics Bureau. Other officers raided the flat at Block 75, #09-227, arrested the second appellant, searched the flat and seized the brown plastic bag containing the three bundles that the second appellant had earlier been carrying. The contents of the three bundles on analysis by the Department of Scientific Services were confirmed to be diamorphine with a total weight of just under 255g.
The first appellant, in support of his appeal, told the court that he was remorseful and would never commit the offence again. He urged the court to show leniency. The second appellant told the court that he committed the offence because he was himself a drug addict and needed money. He told the court that he was a sick man and was undergoing treatment for hypertension and heart problems. In view of his age and medical condition he urged the court to reduce the term of imprisonment imposed on him.
The punishment prescribed by law for this offence was a maximum of 30 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and a minimum of 20 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane. Bearing in mind the quantity of drugs involved and the minimum and maximum sentences prescribed by law, the sentence of 24 years` imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane imposed on the first appellant could not be said to be manifestly excessive. We therefore dismissed the appeal by the first appellant.
The second appellant was over 50 years of age when he was convicted for this offence. In view of his age, he could not, by virtue of s 231 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), be punished with caning. The learned trial judge in sentencing the second appellant took the provisions of s 231 into account and imposed an additional three years` of imprisonment on the second appellant in lieu of the caning. This is evident from his grounds of judgment where the learned trial judge states: 
 
Lai, having passed the age of 50 when he appeared before me, was not liable to caning and in view of this, I felt an additional three years of imprisonment was justified and I accordingly sentenced him to 27 years` imprisonment.
 
 
 
Section 231 reads as follows: 
 
No sentence of caning shall be executed by instalments and none of the following persons shall be punishable with caning:
 
 
 
 
(a) women; 
 
(b) males sentenced to death; 
 
(c) males whom the court considers to be more than 50 years of age.
  
 
 
Section 231 places the three categories of persons stated therein in a special position in that any provision in any law imposing a liability to caning would not be applicable to such persons. That being so, unlike the first appellant, the maximum penalty that the second appellant was liable for was therefore 30 years` imprisonment (without any caning) and the minimum penalty was 20 years` imprisonment (without any caning). The additional three years` imprisonment imposed on the second appellant in lieu of the caning cannot be justified as the second appellant, in the absence of any facts to distinguish his case from that of the first appellant`s, must be sentenced to the same term of imprisonment as the first appellant for this offence.
We allowed the appeal against sentence by the second appellant and set aside the sentence imposed. In the circumstances of this case, we considered that a term of imprisonment of 24 years from the date of his arrest would be the appropriate sentence to impose on the second appellant and we so ordered.
 Order accordingly

In Criminal Case No 25 of 1989, Chan Chuan @ Chan Kah Chen, the first accused (who faced two charges) and Kwang Swee Ling, the second accused, have each appealed against their respective sentences.
The second accused who faced another charge in Criminal Case No 26 of 1989 (wherein he is referred to as `the accused`) has also appealed against sentence.
Each accused pleaded guilty before me to each of the charges against him. The first accused appeared in person and the second accused was represented by counsel.
The amended charges against the first accused in Criminal Case No 25 of 1989 read: 
 
First charge
 
 
 
You, Chan Chuan @ Chan Kah Chen, are charged that on or about 26 February 1987 at about 9am at No 642-A Geylang Road, Singapore, in the company of one Kwang Swee Ling, committed a scheduled offence, to wit, robbery, and at the time of the commission of the aforesaid offence, you had on your person an arm, to wit, a .38 inch calibre revolver, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 3(3) of the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14).
 
 
 
Second charge
 
 
 
You, Chan Chuan @ Chan Kah Chen, are charged that on or about 26 February 1987 at about 9.05am, at the junction of Lorong 38 Geylang and Geylang Road, Singapore, committed a scheduled offence, to wit, abduction, and at the time of the commission of the aforesaid offence, you had on your person an arm, to wit, a .38 inch calibre revolver, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 3(3) of the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14).
 
 
 
The amended charge against the second accused was: 
 
You, Kwang Swee Ling, are charged that on or about 26 February 1987, at about 9am, at No 642-A Geylang Road, Singapore, were in the company of one Chan Chuan @ Chan Kah Chen, who was unlawfully carrying an arm, to wit, a .38 inch calibre revolver, in circumstances which raised a reasonable presumption that you knew that the said Chan Chuan @ Chan Kah Chen was carrying such arm, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 7 read with s 3(2) of the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14).
 
 
 
The first accused was 49 years old. He was unem. The second accused was 46 years old. He was a hawker. The complainant, one Koh Kiang Soong, was 47 years old. He was described as the managing director of Wee Hwa Enterprises Co at No 642-A Geylang Road, Singapore.
On 26 February 1987 at about 9am, the complainant arrived at his office. The two accused approached him as he was opening the door to his office. The first accused was carrying a .38 inch calibre revolver and the second accused was carrying a knife. The latter pointed the knife at the complainant and warned him not to raise any alarm. He then relieved the complainant of the following items:
 
 
(1) cash of $4,000; 
 
(2) two credit cards; 
 
(3) a Rolex watch valued at $5,000; 
 
(4) a Dupont ballpoint pen valued at $400; 
 
(5) a diamond ring valued at $2,000; 
 
(6) two cheques; and 
 
(7) some house and office keys, a pager and some documents.
  
 
 
After robbing the complainant, the first accused stopped a motor van at the junction of Lorong 38, Geylang and Geylang Road and ordered its driver to drive him off. He directed the driver and got off at the hawkers` centre at Block 117, Aljunied Avenue 2.
From the scene, the second accused ran into Lorong 38, Geylang.
Later, the first accused sold the Rolex watch for $3,500 and the diamond ring for $800. According to counsel for the second accused, his share of the loot was $3,750.
The first accused was arrested at his friend`s house on 3 September 1987. The second accused surrendered himself to the police on 6 October 1987. After the surrender, he led the police to recover the revolver (which he had used in a later offence) and five rounds of ammunition at a rented room.
In Criminal Case No 26 of 1989, the charge against the accused was amended to read: 
 
You, Kwang Swee Ling, are charged that on or about 26 July 1987 at about 9.30am at Block 122 Yishun Street 11, Singapore, in the company of one Nang Chang Hut and one Ang Boon Seng, committed a scheduled offence, to wit, robbery, and at the time of the commission of the aforesaid offence, you had on your person an arm, to wit, a revolver and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 3(3) of the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14).
 
 
 
The complainant in this case was one Tay Chee Seng, 48 years old, who lived at the aforesaid address.
On 26 July 1987 at about 8.30am, the accused was armed with a revolver. This was not made known to his two accomplices (who he had recruited), one Nang Chang Huat (Nang) and one Ang Boon Seng (Ang) until he produced it during the robbery. Nang was armed with a knife. Ang had a coil of wire with him. Together they waited for the complainant to leave his house.
When the complainant came out, the accused and Nang accosted him. The accused took out his revolver while Nang held up the complainant at knife point. They then relieved him of the following items:
 
 
(1) a wallet containing cash of $2,500, an identity card, a driving licence and some car keys; 
 
(2) a gold chain valued at $1,500; 
 
(3) a gold bracelet valued at $2,000; 
 
(4) a Rolex watch valued at $5,000; and 
 
(5) a pair of glasses valued at $100.
  
 
 
Meanwhile, Ang tied the complainant`s hands and legs with the coil of wire. After the robbery, the accused and his two accomplices pushed the complainant onto the floor and fled.
The accused later sold the gold chain, gold bracelet and Rolex watch for $10,300. His share of the loot, according to his counsel, was $4,500.
Each accused admitted the facts as read out by the learned deputy public prosecutor on each of the respective charges against him. Each also understood the nature and consequences of his plea of guilty to each charge in each case.
I convicted both accused on the charges each faced. No antecedents of a similar nature were known of both accused.
 Mitigation 
The first accused: The first accused through the court interpreter said that he was getting on in age. He pleaded for leniency.
The second accused: Counsel for the accused admitted the charges were serious infractions of the laws of our society. The accused realized and acknowthat he would have to suffer the punishment meted out.
The accused claimed he committed these offences only because of the pressure put on him by loan sharks from whom he borrowed money from time to time. He incurred debts in the course of business as an owner of a coffee shop. He was introduced to the first accused who had a revolver and had a plan to commit robbery.
In the first case, he himself did not carry the revolver. In the second case, he carried the revolver. In neither instance, although the revolver was carried and displayed to the victim, was it discharged and there was no loss of life.
He is married and has three small school-going children. He also has an aged mother. Before he was arrested, he was the sole supporter of his family.
The accused was remorseful of what he had done. He demonstrated this when he surrendered himself to his detective friend even though he was advised that it was a life sentence that he would be facing. Since his surrender, he had fully cowith and assisted the police. In all his statements, he had admitted to the commission of the offences and he had also led the police to recover the revolver and the ammunition.
Counsel further added that his plea of guilty was itself a mitigating factor. The sentence under s 3(3) of the Act is mandatory - life imprisonment with six strokes of the cane. The minimum sentence under s 3(2) of the Act is five years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. Counsel urged the court to impose the minimum sentence under s 3(2) of the Act and to backdate the sentence to the time of his surrender.
 Sentences 
The punishment provided under s 3(2) of the Act is imprisonment for a term of not less than five years, not more than 14 years and caning of not less than six strokes. Under s 3(3) of the Act, it is life imprisonment and caning of not less than six strokes.
The first accused
On the amended first charge under s 3(3) of the Act, I sentenced the first accused to life imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane.
On the amended second charge under s 3(3) of the Act, I sentenced the first accused to life imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane.
The terms of imprisonment were made concurrent and to commence from the date of his arrest. The total punishment is life imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane. I will deal with the 18 strokes later.
These offences involving the use of a revolver are of a very serious nature. The victim was an innocent man going to work. He was waylaid and held up with a revolver. He was deprived of the valuable items enumerated above.
On each charge, I meted out three more strokes of the cane than the minimum punishment. I did so because he was the provider of the arm used and it was obviously he who recruited the second accused to join him in committing the offence. In my view, these factors warranted something more than the minimum punishment.
The second accused
As for this accused who faced a more serious charge in Criminal Case No 26 of 1989, I sentenced him to life imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. The prison sentence is mandatory under s 3(3) of the Act. The six strokes are the minimum mandatory sentence under that provision.
The minimum mandatory sentence under s 3(2) of the Act is five years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane.
I sentenced the second accused in Criminal Case No 25 of 1989 to six years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. He played a secondary role in this case.
The terms of imprisonment were made concurrent which meant the six years` imprisonment on the charge in Criminal Case No 25 of 1989 was of no effect in view of the life imprisonment under the charge in Criminal Case No 26 of 1989. His total punishment was life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The imprisonment term was to start on the day of his surrender.
I had taken into account the fact that he surrendered to the police although this must necessarily be qualified by his undoubted knowledge of the first accused`s arrest almost five weeks earlier. I had also noted that the second accused co-operated with the police. What was more important, the second accused indicated an intention to plead guilty at the commencement of the preliminary inquiry. These factors led me to give him the effective minimum punishment on the two charges.
The reason I made the distinction in the sentencing of the two accused was that the gun originally came from the first accused. It was obviously passed by the first accused to the second accused for use by the latter in the later offence.
 Caning for two offences at one trial 
There is no provision in the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) which provides for two or more sentences of caning where an accused is found guilty of more than one offence (with caning in the punishment of each) to be `concurrent`. The only provision remotely material is s 230 which reads: 
 
When a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences any two or more of which are legally punishable by caning the combined sentence of caning awarded by the court for any such offences shall not, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding, exceed a total number of 24 strokes in the case of adults or 10 strokes in the case of youthful offenders.
 
 
 
Section 229 also imposes a maximum of 24 strokes for adults at one trial. In my view, where ss 229 and 230 apply, the sentences of caning are to be aggregated provided that, in the case of an adult, the maximum of 24 strokes is not exceeded. Sections 229 and 230 also provide certain safeguards for a convicted person ordered to be caned.
My view that the sentences for caning for two or more distinct offences resulting in convictions at one trial do not merge but instead are aggregated is supported by s 17 of the CPC. Section 17 enables a court in convictions in identical circumstances to direct the sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently. Where the legislature has made provision for concurrence or merger with regard to sentences of imprisonment but is silent on caning except to impose a limit of 24 strokes, it can only mean that subject to the specified maximum, the number of strokes for one offence shall be aggregated to the number of strokes for another.
I have given my reason for ordering strokes in excess of the minimum of six for each offence for which the first accused was found guilty.
As far as I can see, the only ground for complaint either accused may have on the caning sentences is that the number of strokes he is to receive for one offence did not merge into the number of strokes for the other. In my view, with the provision for minimum sentences of strokes of the cane for the two offences each respectively pleaded guilty to and my reading of the effect of s 17 upon the punishment of caning, I had no alternative but to direct that the number of strokes for one offence in each case shall be aggregated with the number of strokes for the other offence for which that accused was convicted. In my view, the aggregation will take place even without my direction.
I also ordered that the exhibits used in the above two criminal cases be retained by the police until another related case is heard and that the exhibits be disposed of by the judge who will hear that case.
 Order accordingly

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff is a bank incorporated in the People`s Republic of China and carries on banking business in Hong Kong, Singapore and elsewhere. The defendant is a publisher of, among other things, a magazine in the Chinese language known as 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
 (which is the Chinese edition of
 Asiaweek 
 ). The magazine is circulated and read in Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and elsewhere. In the edition dated 18 June 1989 of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
, which was published prior to that date, there appeared on p 22 thereof a paragraph, which as translated into English reads: 
 
As Singapore is highly sensitive to any forms of opposition, the Chinese there did not stir up waves of protests against Beijing. However, as a protest against the atrocity of Beijing, they made a run on the Bank of China Singapore Branch which is directly under Beijing. The deputy general manager of the bank, Min You Chi, told 
 Asiaweek
: `In the light of what has happened, the feeling of depositors is understandable.` 
 Up to last Thursday, a total of about US$75m was withdrawn, leaving the bank no alternative but to suspend business temporarily.
 (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The plaintiff complained that the words contained in that paragraph, and in particular the italicized words, were defamatory of the plaintiff and demanded that the defendant should immediately publish a complete retraction of the words complained of and an apology on terms to be approved by the plaintiff. Upon the defendant`s refusal to comply with such demand, the plaintiff on 24 June took out a writ against the defendant claiming damages for libel.
There followed correspondence between the solicitors for the defendant and the plaintiff respectively with a view to an amicable settlement; unfortunately, the proposals made and discussed between them did not lead to fruition. The suit accordingly proceeded. The plaintiff delivered the statement of claim on 14 July 1989 and the defendant delivered the defence on 31 July 1989. On 1 August 1989, the defendant filed an affidavit affirmed by its director and editor-in-chief, Michael O`Neill, on 26 July 1989, which was purported to be filed pursuant to s 7 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75) (the Act). I shall have occasion to refer to the pleadings and this affidavit in greater detail in a moment.
On 16 August 1989, the plaintiff took a bold step by applying by SIC 4767/89 for an order under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of the SuCourt 1970 and under the inherent jurisdiction of the court that the defence be struck out and the plaintiff be at liberty to enter judgment against the defendant for damages to be assessed and costs. The application was heard before the senior assistant registrar who allowed the application; he struck out the defence and gave leave to the plaintiff to enter interlocutory judgment. Interlocutory judgment was subsequently entered. Against that decision, this appeal was brought. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found myself in entire agreement with the learned senior assistant registrar and dismissed the appeal with costs. I now give my reasons.
Striking out the whole of a defence to a claim for libel is an extraordinary step and is only allowed in a plain and obvious case. In 
 Drummond-Jackson v British Medical Association & Ors 
 
[1970] 1 WLR 688
; [1970] 1 All ER 1094, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendants for libel in respect of an article published in the 
 British Medical Journal. 
The defendants applied to strike out the statement of claim. The application was dismissed by the master and, on appeal, by Milmo J. On further appeal, the Court of Appeal, by a majority, dismissed it. Lord Pearson after referring to O 18 r 19 of the English Rules of Supreme Court said, at pp 695-696: 
 
Over a long period of years it has been firmly established by many authorities that the power to strike out a statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action is a summary power which should be exercised only in plain and obvious cases. The authorities are collected in 
 The Supreme Court Practice 1970
, under the heading `Exercise of powers under this rule` in the notes under RSC O 18 r 19 p 284. One which might be added is 
 Nagle v Feilden
 
[1966] 2 QB 633
, 648, 651. Reference has been made to four recent cases: 
 Rondel v Worsley
[1969] 1 AC 191
; 
 Wiseman
 
 v Borneman
 
[1969] 3 WLR 706
; 
 Roy v Prior
[1970] 1 QB 283
; and 
 Schmidt v Home Office
[1969] 2 Ch 149. In each of these cases there was an important question of principle involved, and the hearing of the application under RSC O 18 r 19 was much longer and more elaborate than is usual, but the final decision was that the alleged cause of action was clearly unsustainable, and so the statement of claim disclosed no reasonable cause of action and was ordered to be struck out. There was no departure from the principle that the order for striking out should only be made if it becomes plain and obvious that the claim or defence cannot succeed, but the procedural method was unusual in that there was a relatively long and elaborate instead of a short and summary hearing.
 
 
 
The present case is, in my opinion, a plain and obvious case, though counsel for the plaintiff and the defendant each developed prolonged and serious arguments before me - both counsel took more than a day on their arguments. But, in the words of Sir Gordon Willmer in 
 Drummond-Jackson 
 at p 700, the question whether a point is plain and obvious does not depend upon the length of time it takes to argue. Rather the question is whether, when the point has been argued, it has become plain and obvious that there can be but one result.
On the question of striking out, counsel for the plaintiff also referred me to following pronouncement of Lord Templemen in 
 Williams and Humbert v W & H Trade Marks (Jersey) Ltd 
[1986] AC 368
 at pp 435-436: 
 
My Lords, if an application to strike out involves a prolonged and serious argument the judge should, as a general rule, decline to proceed with the argument unless he not only harbours doubts about the soundness of the pleading but, in addition, is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity for a trial or will substantially reduce the burden of preparing for trial or the burden of the trial itself.
 
 
 
This is a much stronger case than that stated by Lord Templemen. I harbour more than doubts about the soundness of the defence; indeed I have not the slightest doubt at all, as I shall show in a moment, that the defence is wholly unsound and unsustainable, and I am fully satisfied that striking it out will obviate the necessity for a trial.
I turn first to the pleadings. The statement of claim by paras 3, 4 and 5 averred as follows: 
 
3 In their edition of the magazine dated 18 June 1989, the defendant caused to be published at p 22 thereof an article containing libellous words referring to the plaintiff`s branch in Singapore. The following libellous words (in Chinese characters) appeared in the said article: ... The libellous words (as translated into English by a High Court interpreter) are as follows:
 
 
 
`Up to Thursday, a total of about US$75m was withdrawn, leaving the bank no alternative but to suspend business temporarily`.
 
 
 
The said words referred and can only be understood to refer to the plaintiffs.
 
 
 
4 The said words in asserting that the plaintiff had `no alternative but to suspend business temporarily` were malicious and false in that the plaintiffs had at no material time suspended its business temporarily or at all nor was it unable to meet the withdrawal requests of its customers.
 
 
 
5 The said words in their natural and ordinary meaning meant and were understood to mean:
 
 
 
 
(i) that the plaintiff and/or its Singapore branch after the withdrawal of US$75m from their Singapore branch were insolvent and/or temporarily insolvent; 
 
(ii) the plaintiff had inadequate funds to meet the withdrawal requests of its customers; 
 
(iii) the plaintiff were not bankers of high standing and creditworthiness as they were unable to meet withdrawal requests in excess of US$75m; 
 
(iv) the plaintiff had failed to adequately protect and safeguard the interests of its customers by failing to maintain adequate liquidity reserves with its Singapore branch; 
 
(v) the plaintiff did not have sufficient standing to obtain credit lines from other banks and hence had `no alternative` but to suspend business temporarily; and 
 
(vi) the plaintiff was untrustworthy.
  
 
 
In response, the defendant in the defence pleaded in paras 2 to 6 as follows:
 
 
(2) Save that it is denied that the words complained of were libellous, paras 2 and 3 of the statement of claim are admitted. 
 
(3) Save that it is denied that the words complained of were malicious, no admissions are made in respect of para 4 of the statement of claim. 
 
(4) The defendant denies that the words complained of bore or were understood to bear any meaning defamatory of the plaintiff and accordingly paras 5 and 6 of the statement of claim are denied. 
 
(5) The words complained of were published by the defendant innocently in relation to the plaintiff and an offer of amends under and for the purposes of s 7 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75) was formally made by the defendant by letter dated 28 July 1989 as soon as practicable after the defendant received notice that the words complained of might be defamatory of the plaintiff, and the said offer has not been withdrawn. 
 
(6) Paragraph 7 of the statement of claim is denied. Before the filing and delivery of the statement of claim herein, in the 25 June 1989 issue of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
at p 29 thereof, the plaintiff published the following words as translated from the Chinese language into English by a High Court interpreter.
  
 
 
Particulars
 
 
 
See Annexure A
 
 
 
The publication in Annexure A, as translated into English, in so far as material, said: 
 
... there was a run on the Bank of China in the said country. The deputy general manager of the said bank, Singapore Branch, Mr Min You-Chi told Asiaweek:
 
 
 
`some of those who withdrew did so out of protest but I believe many more withdrew because they do not know the asset condition of the Bank. They are afraid that something may happen to their hard earned money.`
 
 
 
The Monetary Authority of Singapore at that time immediately stated that the assets of the Bank of China are sufficient to meet the withdrawals. There were also sufficient cash to cope with the run on the bank.
 
 
 
Purely on these pleadings, the defendant has raised only two defences: (i) a bare denial that the words complained of were defamatory of the plaintiff or were understood to bear the meanings as alleged by the plaintiff or any other meaning defamatory of the plaintiff, and (ii) the statutory defence under s 7 of the Defamation Act. A careful examination of the pleadings and other documents before me - I shall set out these documents in detail shortly - have led me to the inescapable conclusion that both of these defences are manifestly unsustainable, that they are frivolous and vexatious and a sham, and that the raising of these defences appears to be a delaying strategy and, in effect, amounts to an abuse of the process of the court.
I now turn to the first defence, and in that respect it is necessary to consider, first, the meaning of the words complained of and, secondly, whether the words bearing such meaning are defamatory of the plaintiff. The plaintiff relied on the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, and in such case no evidence is admissible of their meaning of the sense in which they were understood or of any facts giving rise to any inferences that could be drawn from the words used: see para 1311 of 
 Gatley on Libel & Slander 
(8th Ed). The natural and ordinary meanings of the words, in the context they are set out, is to be determined by the court. In 
 Slim & Ors v Daily Telegraph Ltd & Ors 
 
[1968] 2 QB 157
 at pp 174-175, Diplock LJ said: ` ... where an action for libel is tried by a judge alone without a jury, it is he who has to arrive at a single `right` meaning as `the natural and ordinary meaning` of the words complained of ... `. He repeated this at p 176: 
 
But where a judge is sitting alone to try a libel action without a jury, the only questions he has to ask himself are: `Is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words that which is alleged in the statement of claim? and: `If not, what, if any, less injurious defamatory meaning do they bear?
 
 
 
And at p 177 he said: 
 
What then is this court to do? I do not think we need send it back for a retrial. No oral evidence given at the trial throws any light upon the natural and ordinary meaning of the words to readers of the correspondence columns in the 
 Daily Telegraph
. This court is in as good a position as the judge to determine what is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words, and in so far as any action for libel can be a simple case, I think that this one is.
 
 
 
In this case, I was in as good a position, on the hearing of the appeal, as a judge trying the action to determine the natural and ordinary meaning of the words.
What then is the natural and ordinary meaning of the words complained of? The question is one purely of construction of the words, and the approach to be adopted in construing these words is to consider what meaning the words would convey to ordinary reasonable persons using their general knowledge and common sense. Such meaning is not confined to a literal or strict meaning of the words but includes any inferences or implications which could reasonably be drawn by such persons: para 4.04 of 
 Duncan and Neil on Defamation 
(2nd Ed). Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest in 
 Jones v Skelton 
 [1963] 3 All ER 952 said at p 958: 
 
The ordinary and natural meaning of words may be either the literal meaning or it may be an implied or inferred or any indirect meaning: any meaning that does not require the support of extrinsic facts passing beyond general knowledge but is a meaning which is capable of being detected in the language used can be a part of the ordinary and natural meaning of words (see 
 Lewis
 
 v Daily Telegraph Ltd
 [1963] 2 All ER 151). The ordinary and natural meaning may therefore include any implication or inference which a reasonable reader, guided not by any special but only by general knowledge and not fettered by any strict legal rules of construction, would draw from the words. The test of reasonableness guides and directs the court in its function of deciding whether it is open to a jury in any particular case to hold that reasonable persons would understand the words complained of in a defamatory sense.
 
 
 
The plaintiff in para 5 of the statement of claim ascribed to the words no less than six meanings cumulatively (the details of which I have earlier set out). I do not think that to ordinary reasonable persons the words would convey such a comprehensive range of meanings. In my judgment, they would convey some of the meanings ascribed to them by the plaintiff. In particular, they would convey the meaning that the plaintiff`s branch in Singapore after a total withdrawal of US$75m by its depositors had no funds or financial resources to meet further withdrawal by its depositors and had become temporarily insolvent.
The next question is whether the words in the natural and ordinary meaning as I have found are defamatory of the plaintiff. I have not the slightest doubt that they are. They impute an inability to discharge its obligations as a bank to its depositors, insolvency and lack of financial resources on the part of the plaintiff as a bank; they tend to injure the credit of the plaintiff as a bank; applying the test laid down by Lord Atkin in 
 Sim v Stretch 
 [1936] 2 All ER 1237 at p 1240, they tend to lower the plaintiff in the estimation of right-thinking members of society generally.
In an old case 
 Forster & Ors v 
 
 Lawson 
(1826) 3 Bing 451; 130 ER 587 the defendants published a statement which said, among other things, that the plaintiff bank had `stopped payment`, and it was held that such publication was defamatory. Best CJ said, at pp 456-457: 
 
It has also been urged that the words contained in the paragraph are not actionable. I have no hesitation in deciding, that to say of any bankers they have suspended payment, is actionable. For, what can be the meaning of such a statement, except that they are no longer solvent? Saying that a banker has suspended payment is saying that he cannot pay his debts. A temporary inability to pay debts is insolvency. The charge of suspending payment is a charge of insolvency. Such a statement will instantly bring all the creditors of a banking-house upon it, and completely stop their business by preventing any one from taking their bills.
 
 
 
Counsel for the plaintiff argued that the words complained of were, on the face thereof, defamatory of the plaintiff. The offending article stated, inter alia: `as a protest against the atrocity of Beijing, [the Chinese in Singapore] made a run on the Bank of China Singapore Branch which is directly under Beijing ... Up to last Thursday, a total of about US$75m was withdrawn, leaving the bank no alternative but to suspend business temporarily`. Counsel submitted that the words meant that owing to the withdrawal of that huge sum of money, the plaintiff as a bank failed to meet its financial obligations and became insolvent; such words clearly injured the credit of the plaintiff as a bank. I am inclined to agree with this submission.
It is of no small consequence that the defendant admitted that the words were defamatory of the plaintiff. The defendant by way of mitigation of damages by para 7 pleaded, inter alia, that the defendant published in the 23 July 1989 issue of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
 an apology which as translated into English is as follows: 
 
Apology Announcement
 
 
 
Our magazine on 18 June 1989, in one of the paragraphs at p 22 mentioned that the Singapore branch of Bank of China temporarily suspended business as they could not cope with the run made on it by its depositors in Singapore.
 
 
 
Bank of China, Singapore Branch pointed out that their branch had met all the demands of their depositors concerning withdrawals. The amount withdrawn by depositors has never affected and will not affect the business of Bank of China in Singapore and internationally. The said bank has never ceased its business operation and activities in Singapore.
Our report on 18 June stating that the Bank of China had suspended business temporarily is incorrect. We express regret and apologize for any inconvenience caused as a result to Bank of China Hongkong Branch, Singapore Branch and branches elsewhere. At the same time, we agree to withdraw the above-mentioned report which 
 cast a bad light on the reputation and position of Bank of China. 
 (Emphasis added.)
In that publication the defendant admitted that the report on 18 June 1989 that the plaintiff had suspended business temporarily was incorrect, it apologized to the plaintiff and agreed to withdraw that report, and further it admitted that the report `cast a bad light on the reputation and position of Bank of China`. This, in my opinion, is a material admission by the defendant.
In the case of 
 Maclaren v Davies 
 (1890) 6 TLR 372, the defendant admitted the libel, but at the trial the judge directed the jury on the question whether there was a libel or not, and the jury returned a verdict in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff moved for a new trial on the ground of misdirection by the judge to the jury. In allowing a new trial on the ground of misdirection, Cave J said, at p 373: 
 
The pleading of the defendant Davis admitted a libel. Throughout the trial and until the summing up there was no question but that it was a libel. The point was called to the learned Baron`s attention by one of the jury, who asked if they could find that there was no libel. To this he had replied that they could. But it would be dangerous to allow a jury to give a finding out of their own head, so to speak, against an admission in pleading on a point not raised or argued during the trial. The jury, therefore, ought not to find that there was no libel, which alone would justify the verdict. The verdict was also complained of as against the weight of evidence. It was impossible to see how any jury could say this was not a libel. The circumstances under which a libel was published could not affect that unless there were terms in it which required explanation.
 
 
 
In the circumstances of the case here, it is impossible to see how it can be maintained, as the defendant sought to maintain, that the words complained of are not libellous.
I now come to the second defence raised by the defendant in the pleadings. The defendant in para 5 of the defence averred that the words complained of were published innocently in relation to the plaintiff and an offer of amends under and for the purpose of s 7 of the Act was formally made by the defendant, ie by its solicitors` letter dated 28 July 1989, as soon as practicable after the defendant had received notice that the words complained of might be defamatory of the plaintiff and that the said offer has not been withdrawn. This is a statutory defence, the success of which depends on whether the defendant has satisfied the requirements under s 7 of the Act. It is necessary and convenient at this stage to set out, in so far as relevant, the provisions of s 7 which are as follows: 
 
(1) A person who has published words alleged to be defamatory of another person may, if he claims that the words were published by him innocently in relation to that other person, make an offer of amends under this section and in any such case -
 
 
 
 
(a) ... 
 
(b) if the offer is not accepted by the party aggrieved, then, except as otherwise provided by this section, it shall be a defence, in any proceedings by him for libel or slander against the person making the offer in resof the publication in question, to prove that the words complained of were published by the defendant or were published by the defendant innocently in relation to the plaintiff and that the offer was made as soon as practicable after the defendant received notice that they were or might be defamatory of the plaintiff, and has not been withdrawn.
  
 
 
(2) An offer of amends under this section must be expressed to be made for the purpose of this section, and must be accompanied by an affidavit specifying the facts relied upon by the person making it to show that the words in question were published by him innocently in relation to the party aggrieved; and for the purposes of a defence under subsection (1)(b) no evidence, other than evidence of facts specified in the affidavit, shall be admissible on behalf of that person to prove that the words were so published.
 
 
 
(3) An offer of amends under this section shall be understood to mean an offer -
(a) in any case, to publish or join in the publication of a suitable correction of the words complained of, and a sufficient apology to the party aggrieved in respect of those words; 
(b) where copies of a document or record containing the said words have been distributed by or with the knowof the person making the offer, to take such steps as are reasonably practicable on his part for notifying persons to whom copies have been so distributed that the words are alleged to be defamatory of the party aggrieved.
 
 
 
(4) ...
(5) For the purposes of this section, words shall be treated as published by one person (referred to in this subsection as the publisher) innocently in relation to another person if and only if the following conditions are satisfied: 
(a) that the publisher did not intend to publish them of and concerning that other person, and did not know of circumstances by virtue of which they might be understood to refer to him; or 
(b) that the words were not defamatory on the face of them, and the publisher did not know of circumstances by virtue of which they might be understood to be defamatory of that other person;
 
 
 
and in either case that the publisher exercised all reasonable care in relation to the publication; and any reference in this subsection to the publisher shall be construed as including a reference to any servant or agent of his who was concerned with the contents of the publication.
 
 
 
(6) Subsection (1)(b) shall not apply in relation to the publication by any person of words of which he is not the author unless he proves that the words were written by the author without malice.
 
 
 
To succeed on the statutory defence under this section, the defendant has to surmount several hurdles as provided in the section. First, under sub-s (1)(b) of that section the defendant has to show that the words complained of were published by it `innocently in relation to the plaintiff,` and by virtue of sub-s (5) the words shall be treated as published innocently in relation to the plaintiff `if and only if` the conditions in paras (a) and (b) of that subsection are satisfied. Neither of the conditions was satisfied in this case. With regard to the condition in para (a), the plaintiff was referred to in the publication by its name and therefore there can be no question that the defendant did not intend to publish the words of and concerning the plaintiff. As for the condition in para (b), the words are defamatory of the plaintiff on the face thereof, as I have found.
In 
 Sandison v Malayan Times Ltd & Ors 
 
 
 
[1964] MLJ 332
  the plaintiff claimed damages for libel in respect of an article published by the defendants. Though he was not specifically named or mentioned in the article, he was, as the trial judge held, `instantly recognizable by all those readers of the newspaper who happened to know him`. One of the defences raised was s 7 of the Defamation Ordinance 1957, which is the equivalent of s 7 of our Act. Ong J who tried the case, rejected this defence, and said at p 334: 
 
The offending article was the result of an interview by the defendants` report with the director of the Anti-Corruption Agency and plainly referred to a particular person whose identity was known or could have been discovered without the least difficulty. Certainly the reporter must have known. When the plaintiff was so clearly pin-pointed in the article, I do not think that the publisher can be heard to say that it was not intended to be published of and concerning the plaintiff or that the publisher had in the circumstances exercised all reasonable care in relation to the publication.
 
 
 
That passage of the judgment, I find, is extremely apt in relation to this case.
Secondly, again under sub-s (1)(b) of s 7, the offer of amends has to be made `as soon as practicable` after the defendant received notice that the words complained of were or might be defamatory of the plaintiff. This the defendant failed to do, as can be seen from the sequence of events that ensued after the publication of the article. Immediately after the article had been brought to the plaintiff`s attention, its solicitors telefaxed a lengthy letter on 15 June 1989 to the defendant complaining that the article was defamatory of the plaintiff and demanding an immediate apology and withdrawal of the article. On the following day, the defendant`s solicitors in Hong Kong replied to the plaintiff`s solicitors also by telefax stating that the defendant was undertaking its own investigation and requesting a draft apology for consideration in the meanwhile. A draft was immediately forwarded by the plaintiff`s solicitors to the defendant`s solicitors. Then on 21 June 1989 came the following letter from the defendant`s solicitors in Hong Kong: 
 
Dear Sirs,
 
 
 
Re: Bank of China vs Asiaweek
 
 
 
Our client has had ample opportunity to consider your letters 15 and 16 June 1989, with enclosures.
 
 
 
It is not disputed and cannot be disputed that the words attributed to Min You Chi were used by him. We have had no hesitation in advising our client that it has a complete defence to the allegations made by Min You Chi, namely, justification and fair comment.
The assertion is that the statement that Bank of China, Singapore, `suspended business temporarily` was made `recklessly and without any prior investigation`. Indeed, the opposite is the case. In publishing such statement our client relied upon the edition 9 June 1989 of `Ta Kung Pao` which we are instructed is under the same ultimate authority as Bank of China. A copy of the relevant extract follows this message.
Whilst the allegations made in previous correspondence are rejected our client has requested we invite Min You Chi to write to it with a view to publication of its letter (in the Chinese language) in the Letters section of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
. Any letter submitted for publication should be sent to us on behalf of our client not later than close of business Thursday 22 June Hong Kong time. 
 
Yours faithfully

The stand taken by the defendant then was unequivocal; it was combative and there was no question of any apology or regret or indication that an offer of amends would be forthcoming. That, of course provoked reply from the solicitors for the plaintiff on 21 June 1989, which I need not set out in any detail, as nothing turns on it. Following that letter, on 24 June 1989, the solicitors for the plaintiff took out the writ against the defendant. Nothing of any importance occurred until 12 July 1989 when the defendant`s solicitors in Singapore, Messrs Chor Pee & Co, wrote to the plaintiff`s solicitors the following letter: 
 
Dear Sirs
 
 
 
Suit No 1206 Of 1989
 
 
 
Bank of China vs Asiaweek Limited
 
 
 
Our clients would like to explore the possibility of settling the action amicably. To that end, our clients are prepared to publish in the forthcoming issue of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan
of 14th instant, an item in terms of the enclosed draft. They are also prepared to pay all reasonable legal costs incurred todate.
 
 
 
We would be grateful if you would let us know not later than noon of 14th instant whether your clients would accept publication of the item and payment of reasonable legal costs in full and final settlement of the action. If they are so prepared, we would be grateful for a breakdown of your legal costs.
Your clients may have noticed that in our clients` most recent issue of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
, they have said in an article that the report in Ta Kung Pao that your clients had temporarily suspended business was in error. A copy of the relevant page of the aforesaid issue together with the English translation is enclosed.
We are instructed that if our clients` proposals as contained in this letter are not acceptable to your clients, then our clients may well seek to establish that these proposals amount to a defence under s 7 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75). 
 
Yours faithfully

That was not an offer of amends under s 7 of the Act; nor was it intended to be so. It was an offer for a settlement which, however, was not accepted by the plaintiff. It is significant that as of 18 July 1989, no offer of amends under s 7 had been made by the defendant; that was more than a month after the defendant had been notified that the article complained of was defamatory of the plaintiff. By then the subject matter of complaint must have been fully investigated. It was certainly considered by no less than two firms of solicitors, and without being too presumptuous, one can assume that the defendant must have taken the appropriate legal advice. Yet it did not hasten to take steps to make an offer of amends or at least give notice that it would be making an offer of amends under s 7. It was quite content to let the matter drift.
Only on 28 July 1989 did the defendant`s solicitors give notice that the defendant formally made an offer of amends under and for the purposes of s 7 of the Defamation Act, and they enclosed a draft affidavit expressed to be affirmed by the defendant`s director and editor-in-chief, Michael O`Neill. The affidavit was filed on 1 August 1989 and paras 3, 4 and 5 stated as follows:
 
 
(3) The words about which complaint is made came to me as a director and editor-in-chief of the defendant in the ordinary and regular course of business from Ta Kung Pao, a newspaper published and printed in Hong Kong known to the defendant and to me personally to be under the ownership of, and to operate at the direction of, the communist party and/or government of the People`s Republic of China. I should add that Ta Kung Pao is known to the defendant generally and to me personally for having a reputation in Hong Kong for factual accuracy. A copy of the article from which the words complained of were taken, appearing in Ta Kung Pao on 9 June 1989, is now produced and shown to me marked `MON-2`. A certified copy of translation of this exhibit will be provided to this honourable court at a later date. 
 
(4) Soon after receipt of this letter 15 June 1989 from the plaintiff`s solicitors herein, a copy of which is now produced and shown to me marked `MON-3`, I caused the defendant to make enquiries as to the accuracy of the item exh `MON-2`. As a result of what I was informed the defendant, in its issues of 
 Asiaweek 
of 18 June 1989 and 16 July 1989, published articles putting the events of the first week June 1989 in perspective. Ta Kung Pao published an apology in its edition 26 June 1989. As a result of such apology the defendant similarly published an apology in its edition of 
 Asiaweek 
 July 1989. There are now produced and shown to me marked `MON-4`, `MON-5` and `MON-6` copies of the three editions of 
 Asiaweek 
to which I have referred. There is now produced and shown to me marked `MON-7` a copy of an extract from Ta Kung Pao 26 June 1989. Similarly, certified translations of these exhibits will be produced to the honourable court at a later date. 
 
(5) By reason of the facts herein before appearing I say that the matter of which complaint is made was published innocently. I refer to the letters of the defendant`s solicitors herein 12 July and 15 July 1989 respectively, copies of which are now produced and shown to me marked `MON-8` and `MON-9` containing an offer of amends within the meaning of s 7 of the Defamation Act (Cap 75).
  
 
 
From this affidavit, it seems to me that the defendant in relation to the publication of the offending article was relying heavily on `Ta Kung Pao`, and after the defamatory article was brought to its attention it merely followed the footsteps of `Ta Kung Pao`. The affidavit said that the defendant published in its issues of 
 Asiaweek 
of 18 June 1989 and 16 July 1989 articles `putting the events of the first week June 1989 in perspective` - between the two articles there was an inexplicable lapse of nearly one month. `Ta Kung Pao` published an apology in its edition of 26 June 1989, and `as a result of such apology` the defendant `similarly published an apology in its edition of 
 Asiaweek 
of 16 July 1989` - again there was an inexplicable lapse of some 20 days. Since it appeared to follow `Ta Kung Pao` on the matter of apology it is curious why it could not have published its apology immediately after 26 June 1989, and why it could not have made its offer of amends soon thereafter, for instance, by 1 July 1989. The various publications referred to in para 4 of Michael O`Neill`s affidavit were in Chinese, and up to the date of hearing of the appeal before me no English translation of any of them had been furnished. I can therefore make no observation on what they published.
On a close examination of these material events as borne out indisputably by the documents before me, I have unhesitatingly come to the conclusion that the defendant did not make the offer of amends `as soon as practicable` after it had received notice that the article it published was defamatory of the plaintiff. The defendant first took a combative stand - in my view, quite unnecessarily - in the defence of its article. Assuming that it was entitled at the first blush to take the stand as it did, the subsequent events unmistakably showed that it was indefensibly lackadaisical in its efforts of making the offer of amends in the circumstances. There is, in my opinion, no reason why it could not have made the offer of amends by 18 July 1989, by which date it must have investigated the matter fully and taken the necessary legal advice.
Lastly, the purported offer of amends has also not complied with the provisions of s 7(3)(b) of the Act. The defendant must have distributed copies of the issue of 
 Yazhou Zhoukan 
 of 18 June 1989. That being so, the offer of amends in conformity to s 7(3)(b) must contain an offer to take such steps as reasonably practicable on the part of the defendant to notify persons to whom copies had been distributed that the words were alleged to be defamatory of the plaintiff. That, however, the defendant had failed to do. Plainly, the defendant has not complied with the several requirements under s 7 of the Act; in consequence, there was no offer of amends made under s 7 of the Act, and even if there was, it was not made within the time frame prescribed in that section. The statutory defence averred in para 5 of the defence therefore cannot succeed, now or at a trial.
In the result, I have inexorably come to the conclusion that the defence filed is incontestably a sham, a hopeless and vexatious defence, and as such constitutes an abuse of the process of the court. No amendment of any kind can in any way improve it.

This is an appeal by the public prosecutor against the sentence imposed by the district court on 30 July 1990, following the respondent`s plea of guilty to a charge under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (the Act) of driving a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of drink and sentenced to a fine of $1,000 in default three months` imprisonment and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for four years.
The public prosecutor submits that the sentence is manifestly inadequate.
The respondent also pleaded guilty to two other charges:
 
 
(a) charge under s 43(3) of the Act for driving a motor vehicle whilst disqualified from holding or obtaining all classes of driving licence for a period of three years and was sentenced to three months` imprisonment and disqualified for six years; 
 
(b) charge under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) and was fined $500 in default three months` imprisonment and disqualified for one year.
  
 
 
On 5 March 1990, the respondent was convicted under s 67(1) of the Act for drunken driving and was fined $1,000 in default three months` imprisonment and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for three years.
When the respondent was convicted on 5 March 1990, it was under the then existing s 67(1) which provided: 
 
Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, and in the case of a second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both.
 
 
 
Section 67(1) was repealed by the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1990 (No 7 of 1990) (which came into force on 2 April 1990) and re-enacted and provides: 
 
67(1) Any person who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months and, in the case of a second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.
 
 
 
The public prosecutor submits that as this is the respondent`s second conviction under s 67(1) the resshould have been sentenced by the district court, in addition to a minimum fine of $3,000, to a term of imprisonment not exceeding 12 months.
Although the elements of the offence created by the re-enacted s 67(1) are substantially the same as the elements of the offence under the repealed s 67(1), the punishment for the offence is not the same: the re-enacted section provides for a heavier punishment.
For a first offender, the punishment under the repealed section was `a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months`. Whereas under the re-enacted section the punishment is a mandatory sentence of `a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months`.
For a second offender, the punishment under the repealed section was `a fine not exceeding $2,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months or to both`. Whereas under the re-enacted section the punishment is a mandatory `fine of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months`.
Now is this a second conviction of the respondent under s 67(1)? Under the repealed section, the court had a discretion as to the punishment. Under the re-enacted section, the court has no discretion as to the punishment.
A distinction should be made between an amendment by deletion or insertion of words from or into an existing legislation, and an amendment by the repeal of the whole section and substituting therefor a new section. The re-enacted s 67(1) is in fact a new section.
Article 11(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore protects a person against retrospective criminal laws.
In my view the respondent was charged and convicted under the re-enacted s 67(1) for the first time, notwithstanding that he had been dealt with under the repealed s 67(1) once before on 5 March 1990.
To treat the respondent as a second offender under the re-enacted section is to apply the re-enacted section to him retrospectively. The words preceding the provision for punishment of a second or subsequent offender under the re-enacted s 67(1) are `in the case of a second or subsequent conviction`. These words can only mean a second or subsequent conviction under the re-enacted s 67(1).

The plaintiff is an employee of the first defendant and at the material time was employed as a storekeeper at the first defendant`s warehouse which is on the ground floor of PSA Multi-Storey Complex, Block 20, Pasir Panjang Road. The first defendant is engaged in the business of a freight forwarder, and its business involves, among other things, unpacking and packing of goods at its warehouse and delivering them to its customers. At the material time, there were provided in the warehouse two forklifts which were used by the first defendant`s employees including the plaintiff, for moving, loading and unloading goods, and one of the forklifts was a Komatsu model FD 20T bearing serial number 1105494, which was the forklift in question in this case.
At the material time, the second defendant was engaged by the first defendant to service the forklifts under a servicing contract, and pursuant to that contract the second defendant`s mechanic serviced the two machines every month.
On 17 February, 1984, one of the forklift drivers, Lim Boon Chong (Lim) complained to the plaintiff that the brakes of the forklift, ie the Komatsu forklift, were not working. The plaintiff called the second defendant, and the latter`s mechanic came and attended to the repair. After the repair was carried out, the plaintiff signed a job completion form. The forklift was subsequently used by Lim and he found that the brakes were still defective. He said he had to depress the brake pedal twice before he could bring the forklift to a stop.
On the following morning, 18 February, the forklift was parked at a corner on the loading platform, which was raised above the ground level by about 4 to 5 ft so that containers could be driven and parked alongside to load and unload goods. The plaintiff who was anxious to move certain goods for the purpose of effecting delivery to customers mounted the forklift and started to operate it. While he was reversing the forklift, he found that the brakes were ineffective, and he could not stop the forklift which continued to move and eventually toppled over the edge of the platform. As the forklift fell, the plaintiff leapt from the driver`s seat but unfortunately could not escape injury. His left arm was pinned underneath the forklift and was severely crushed; the arm was subsequently amputated at the point above the elbow.
In respect of the injuries which he sustained in the accident, he brought this action against the first and second defendants. His claim against the first defendant was for (i) breach of statutory duty in that the first defendant had failed to maintain properly and keep in efficient working order and good repair the forklift contrary to s 31(b) of the Factories Act (Cap 104), and (ii) negligence for failing to take any adequate precautions of the safety of the plaintiff, committing the plaintiff to operate the forklift which was in a dangerous and defective condition and failing to maintain or repair properly the brakes of the forklift. His claim against the second defendant was for negligence for failing to repair the brakes of the forklift which the second defendant knew or ought to know was defective and failing to locate properly the fault or defect in the braking system.
Both the defendants in their pleadings resisted the claim. In the defence of the first defendant, the following defences were raised:
 
 
(i) the plaintiff at the material time drove the forklift outside the course of his employment; 
 
(ii) the first defendant`s warehouse was not a factory within the meaning of the Factories Act and that the forklift appliance or lifting machine within the meaning of s 7(1) of the Factories Act; 
 
(iii) a denial of negligence or breach of statutory duty; 
 
(iv) the accident was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the plaintiff; and 
 
(v) in the alternative, the accident was caused by the negligent and faulty repair of the forklift carried out by the second defendant.
  
 
 
The second defendant in the defence denied that its servant or agent was negligent in repairing the forklift and averred that the forklift had been properly repaired on the afternoon of 17 February 1984. The second defendant further averred that the accident was caused solely or contributed to by the negligence of the plaintiff.
At the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the second defendant informed me that she had not received instructions to defend the action and in fact on that morning her instructions were not to defend the action; thereafter she did not participate further in the proceedings. The hearing proceeded and at the conclusion I found that both the defendants were liable in damages to the plaintiff. At the request of the first defendant`s counsel and on the basis of his submission, I apportioned the liability between the first and the second defendants in the following proportions: 30% to the first defendant and 70% to the second defendant. I now give my reasons.
Before I proceed and for completeness, I should dispose of, first, one point raised in the defence but was not really argued. The first defendant pleaded, and during the cross-examination of the plaintiff counsel for the first defendant suggested, that the plaintiff in driving the forklift was acting outside the course of his employment. I found no substance in such plea or suggestion. The plaintiff`s position was a storekeeper and incidental to his work he had to drive the forklift at times. There was evidence before me, which I accepted, that both he and his manager occasionally had to drive the forklift. On the morning in question, as the forklift driver was not around, he drove the forklift, and he drove it in connection with his work and for the purpose of the first defendant. Clearly, what he did was fully within the course of his employment. The point raised by the first defendant was wholly unarguable on the facts.
I now turn to the claim of the plaintiff against the first defendant for breach of statutory duty. The arguments of counsel for the plaintiff and the first defendant proceeded on the basis that the warehouse, in which the plaintiff was injured, is a factory within the meaning of the Factories Act, and it has therefore become unnecessary for me to determine that point. Counsel for the first defendant also accepted that the forklift is a lifting appliance or lifting machine within the meaning of s 7(1) of the Act. The only point in issue was whether there was a breach by the first defendant of s 31(1) of the Act. The said section, in so far as relevant, provides:
No lifting appliance or lifting machine shall be used unless -
 
 
(a) it and every part of it including all working gear and all plant or gear used for anchoring or fixing the appliance or machine is of good construction, sound material, adequate strength and substance, and free from patent defect; 
 
(b) it is properly maintained; and 
 
(c) ...
  
 
 
The word `maintained` is defined in s 7(1) to mean `maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair`.
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the duty imposed by s 31(1) is an absolute one and that proof of the failure of the brakes of the forklift was sufficient to establish the breach of such duty, and as a result of such breach of duty the plaintiff sustained injuries. On that ground the defendant was liable. He relied on

 O`Donnell or Millar 
 
[1949] AC 275
. In the first case the plaintiff claimed damages for the death of her husband who met with the fatal accident in the course of employment. The deceased prior to his death was a crane-man, and to reach the driving cab he had to use a ladder some 20 ft high. While he was ascending the ladder one of the rungs gave way and he fell to the ground and sustained injuries from which he died. Section 25(4) of the Factories Act 1937 of the United Kingdom provided: `All ladders shall be soundly constructed and properly maintained`, and s 152(1) provided that the word `maintained` means `maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair`. It was held that the obligation imposed by s 25(4) of the Factories Act was an absolute obligation and could not be discharged by the occupier of the factory taking all practical steps to see that the ladder was in an efficient state and good repair. Macnaghten J said, at p 617: 
 
I see no ground for qualifying the words of s 25, sub-s 4, of the Factories Act 1937. The duty to keep all ladders in an efficient state and in good repair appears to me to be as absolute as the duty imposed by the Act to fence all dangerous parts of machinery. It is true that the defendants took great care for the safety of their men, and that this particular failure was one which, apparently, nobody could have anticipated. The fact that none of the other screws in the ladder were affected with corrosion indicates that there must have been something exceptional about this particular rung to bring about the deplorable result that it gave way. It was suggested that the rung must have worked slightly loose and that sulphur fumes from the adjacent factory must have caused the corrosion: but neither the `safety first` committee nor Cole observed that there was anything amiss with the rung, or if they did observe that the rung was at all loose, they did not think it material. However that may be, the ladder was not in fact in an efficient state or in good repair on the morning of the accident.
 
 
 
The decision of Macnaghten J was approved by the House of Lords in 
 Galashiels Gas 
. There, the plaintiff claimed damages for the fatal injuries sustained by her husband in the course of his employment. The deceased was found seriously injured lying at the bottom of the lift shaft, and the lift was found to be at the top of the lift shaft and the liftway gates on the first floor were open. It was found by the court that the brake of the lift in question was not in efficient working order at the time when the accident happened, though it appeared to have worked efficiently before and after the accident. Section 22(1) of the Factories Act 1937 provided: `Every hoist or lift shall be of good mechanical construction, sound material and adequate strength and be properly maintained` and by s 155(2) the word `maintained` means `maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair`. It was held that s 22(1) imposed an absolute and continuing obligation on the factory occupier so that proof of any failure of the equipment established a breach of statutory duty. Lord Morton of Henryton said, at pp 282-283: 
 
My Lords, in my view the Lord Ordinary supplied the correct answer to the whole of this argument when he said: `In my opinion ... there is imposed on the defenders an absolute and continuing obligation binding upon them which is not discharged if at any time their lift mechanism, in this case the brake, is not maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order, and in good repair.` The words of the sub-section are imperative `shall be properly maintained` and I can find nothing in the context or in the general intention of the Act, read as a whole, which should lead your Lordships to infer any qualification upon that absolute obligation.
 
 
 
Lord MacDermott said at p 287: 
 
My Lords, had the legislature thought fit not to define `maintained` Mr Guest`s submission on this aspect of the case would have encountered less difficulty. But when the terms of the definition are regarded the meaning for which he has contended is, in my opinion, at once displaced. To my mind they indicate conclusively that in s 22, sub-s 1, `maintained` is employed to denote the 
 continuance
 of a state of working efficiency. In the ordinary use of language one cannot be said to maintain a piece of machinery in efficient working order over a given period if, on occasion within that period, the machinery, whatever the reason, is not in efficient order. In short, the definition describes a result to be achieved rather than the means of achieving it. I do not think the use of the word `properly` weakens or detracts from the compelling effect of this definition. Why exactly `properly` was inserted is perhaps a matter of speculation, as the Act does not appear to furnish any very obvious explanation. But, however this may be, the word is certainly not incompatible with the duty in question being absolute in character. There may be more than one way of discharging such a duty and I do not see that the quality of the duty need be affected by an additional obligation to discharge it in a proper manner.
 
 
 
And later he said: 
 
There was abundant proof that the mechanism had failed and that that failure resulted in the death of the respondent`s husband. Once the absolute nature of the duty imposed by the statute is established, that is proof enough.
 
 
 
The relevant provisions of our Factories Act are in pari materia with the corresponding provisions of the FacAct 1937 of the United Kingdom and should therefore receive the same construction as laid down in these cases. On this basis, s 31(1) imposes an absolute duty on the employer to maintain properly the equipment within the meaning of the Act, ie in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair. In particular, the word `maintained` in s 31(b) denotes a continuance of a state of working efficiency, and hence s 31(1) imposes on the occupier of a factory, among other things, an absolute and continuing obligation to maintain properly a lifting appliance or lifting machine, which, as both counsel agreed, includes a forklift.
Reverting to the facts before me, it has been proved by the plaintiff, and it was not in any way disputed by the first defendant, that at the material time the brakes of the forklift were defective and accordingly was not `in an efficient state, in efficient working order and in good repair`. That having been established, the first defendant was in breach of the statutory duty and as a result of such breach the plaintiff sustained injuries. The plaintiff therefore succeeded in his claim for breach of statutory duty.
I now turn to his claim at common law for negligence. At common law, an employer is under a duty to use reasonable care to provide, among other things, safe plant and appliances for use by its employees and to maintain them in a proper condition. In 
 Joseph Smith v Charles Baker & Sons 
 
[1891] AC 325
 at p 362, Lord Herschell described the duty as follows: 
 
It is quite clear that the contract between employer and employed involves on the part of the former the duty of taking reasonable care to provide proper appliances, and to maintain them in a proper condition, and so to carry on his operations as not to subject those employed by him to unnecessary risk.
 
 
 
To this may be added what Lord Wright said, obiter, in 
 Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co v English 
 
[1938] AC 57
 at p 84: ` ... the obligation to provide and maintain proper plant and appliances is a continuing obligation`.
An employer cannot escape liability by delegating the performance of such duty to an independent contractor; if he does delegate the performance of such duty, which in some cases he would have to do, and such duty is performed negligently he remains vicariously liable. The leading authority on this point is 
 Wilsons & Clyde Co v English 
 which was an appeal to the House of Lords from the Court of Session in Scotland. The respondent was employed by the appellants to work underground in one of the appellants` collieries and was killed in the course of employment, and action was brought against the appellants for negligence. The contention of the appellants was that they had delegated to competent agent and manager the duty of providing reasonably safe system of working and that any negligence in the provision of such system was that of such delegates and under the doctrine of common employment the appellants were not liable. The arguments were rejected by the House of Lords who held, inter alia, that the provision of a safe system of working in a mine was an obligation of the owner and if he appointed an agent to perform it, he remained vicariously responsible for his agent`s negligence. Four of the five Law Lords who heard the appeal in their speeches made clear pronouncements on the point, and it is sufficient to quote the following extracts from the speeches of Lord Thankerton and Lord Macmillan. Lord Thankerton said, at pp 64-65: 
 
The appellants maintain that the present case is covered by the second proposition, in that they have delegated to a competent agent and manager the duty of providing a reasonably safe system of working, and that any negligence in the provision of such a system is the negligence of these delegates, and, under the doctrine of common employment, that the appellants are not liable therefor.
 
 
 
It seems to me that the fallacy in the appellant`s argument lies in the view that the master, being under a duty to take care in the provision of a reasonably safe system of working, is absolved from that duty by the appointment of a competent person to perform the duty. In my opinion the master cannot `delegate` his duty in this sense, though he may appoint some one, as his agent in the discharge of the duty, for whom he will remain responsible under the maxim respondent superior.
Lord Macmillan said, at p 75: 
 
Now I take it to be settled law that the provision of a safe system of working in a colliery is an obligation of the owner of the colliery. He cannot divest himself of this duty, though he may - and, if it involves technical management and he is not himself technically qualified, must - perform it through the agency of an employee. It remains the owner`s obligation, and the agent whom the owner appoints to perform it performs it on the owner`s behalf. The owner remains vicariously responsible for the negligence of the person whom he has appointed to perform his obligation for him, and cannot escape liability by merely proving that he has appointed a competent agent. If the owner`s duty has not been performed, no matter how competent the agent selected by the owner to perform it for him, the owner is responsible.
 
 
 
That case admittedly was concerned with the duty of an employer to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of working.
It has been applied in innumerable cases to all aspects of the employers` duty of care for the safety of his employee: per Phillimore J in 
 Sumner v William Henderson & Sons Ltd 
 
[1964] 1 QB 450
 at p 457. In my opinion, it is certainly applicable to this case which was concerned with the provision of safe and proper plant and appliances by an employer to his employees to operate. The first defendant had engaged the second defendant to service and maintain the equipment, ie the forklift. The latter`s employee on the day before the accident carried out the repair negligently: he failed to repair the brakes properly, as after the purported repair work had been carried out, Lim operated the forklift and found that the brakes were defective. The first defendant in these circumstances cannot escape liability for breach of its common law duty to its employee.
Quite apart from this breach of duty, the first defendant was also in breach of its duty to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of working. The first defendant had at that time a regular driver of the forklift. That was Lim. But Lim was not around when the mechanic of the second defendant came to repair the forklift. Lim said he was away having coffee; he did not even know if anyone had come and repaired the forklift. He should have been present while the repair was being carried out or should have been around at the warehouse and tested the forklift after the repair had been carried out. No one on behalf of the first defendant did any testing of the forklift after the purported repair work had been carried out by the mechanic of the second defendant. The first defendant ought to have the forklift tested before it was allowed to be used. There was therefore a failure on the part of the first defendant to provide adequate and proper supervision and checking of the maintenance of the forklift.
In the defence, the first defendant averred that in maintaining the forklift it had engaged the second defendant, a `well-known firm of experts in the repair and maintenance of, inter alia, forklifts`. However, no evidence has been adduced to show that the second defendant whom the first defendant engaged was competent or reasonably competent in the repair and maintenance of the forklifts. This burden undoubtedly rests with the first defendant and it has failed to discharge it. The fact that the second defendant did not at the trial defend the action and, so far as I understand, is no longer in business does not speak well of the second defendant`s reputation or competence.
The first defendant relied heavily on Lim`s evidence to prove that the plaintiff was guilty of a rash and negligent act. Lim said that before he left the warehouse that evening at about 10pm he informed the plaintiff that the brakes of the forklift were defective.
He also said that on the following morning when he came to work he saw the plaintiff and told the plaintiff again of the defective brakes and asked the plaintiff not to drive the forklift. I found great difficulty in accepting his evidence. First, before the purported repair work was carried out by the second defendant`s mechanic, the plaintiff already knew of the defective brakes. It was he who sent for the mechanic. Prior to that, he was informed by the forklift driver that the brakes were not working, and Lim was the regular driver of that forklift. It must have been Lim who informed him. But Lim did not know that any repair work to the brakes was carried out by the second defendant`s mechanic. So far as he was concerned, the brakes had never been repaired that day. Therefore, there was no need for him to inform the plaintiff again of the defective brakes that evening at 10pm just before he left the warehouse. That would really be an abundance of caution on the part of Lim which I could not accept. Secondly, he said that when he informed the plaintiff that evening that the brakes of the forklift were not working, the plaintiff did not say anything in response. That indeed is very strange and surprising, because the plaintiff was the one who sent for the second defendant`s mechanic to repair the forklift and he was the one who signed the job completion form of the second defendant. If Lim had informed the plaintiff that evening of the continuing defects in the brakes of the forklift, as he claimed he had, the plaintiff would have reacted with expressions of surprise and annoyance.
I also could not accept Lim`s evidence that on the morning of the accident he did inform the plaintiff of the defective brakes and asked him not to drive the forklift. I think that is pure fabrication. The plaintiff`s evidence was, and I accepted his evidence, that on that morning he did not see Lim at the warehouse, and that was why he went and operated the forklift himself. If Lim was around, he would have asked Lim to operate the forklift instead of doing it himself. That was Lim`s job. There was no rash and negligent act on the part of the plaintiff.
In my judgment, the plaintiff succeeded in establishing his claim at common law for negligence against the first defendant.
The second defendant was not represented before me throughout the greater part of the hearing and no evidence was adduced by it to resist the claim. I found that the second defendant`s mechanic was negligent in repairing the brakes. As I have said, the mechanic did not repair the brakes properly. Accordingly, the second defendant was also liable to the plaintiff.
Counsel for the first defendant asked me to apportion the liability between the two defendants and he submitted that the second defendant was more to blame for the accident. On the basis of his submission, I apportioned the liability in the proportion of 30% to the first defendant and 70% to the second defendant.
On the quantum of damages, there were disputes only on three items:
 
 
(i) actual loss of earnings, ie pre-trial loss; 
 
(ii) special damages for the cost of an artificial limb and the maintenance thereof; and 
 
(iii) damages for loss of future earnings.
  
 
 
General damages for pain and suffering and loss of amenities were agreed at $65,000, and the special damages, other than the costs of an artificial limb and of maintenance thereof and actual loss of earnings, were agreed at $1,150. Having regard to all the relevant circumstances, I awarded a sum of $56,000 for pre-trial loss, a sum of $25,000 for the cost of an artificial limb and maintenance, and a sum of $54,000 for loss of future earnings; and the last amount was based on a yearly multiplicand of $9,000 and multiplier of 6.

The first plaintiff was and is the owner of the Tiger Brand trade marks and their business includes, inter alia, the manufacture, sale and distribution of the tiger balm products in various parts of the world.
On 22 October 1971 a joint venture agreement (JVA) was entered into between the first plaintiff, Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd, and the first defendant with a view to reorganizing and expanding the Tiger Brand trade marks business of the first plaintiff. Pursuant to the JVA, two companies were incorporated, one in Singapore, Haw Par Eng Aun Tong Pte Ltd (HPEAT) and the other in Hong Kong, Haw Par Tiger Balm International Ltd (HPTBI) (hereinafter collectively called the `joint companies`). The first plaintiff and Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd held equal shares in the joint companies. In accordance with the JVA, the first defendant was appointed the managing director and chief executive of the joint companies and is still holding that appointment.
The first plaintiff subsequently transferred its shares in the joint companies to the second plaintiff. Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd similarly transferred its shares in the joint companies, HPEAT and HPTBI, to the second and third defendants respectively. All the transferees (ie second plaintiff, second and third defendants) have agreed to be bound by the JVA as if they were original parties thereto. The first defendant has substantial shareholding in the second defendant. The third defendant is a subsidiary of the second defendant.
Under the JVA, the first plaintiff agreed to grant licences to the joint companies for four consecutive periods of five years each, commencing 1 January 1972, to use the Tiger Brand trade marks and to manufacture, market and distribute the Tiger Brand products in the ASEAN countries, Hong Kong, Macau, Burma, Japan, Korea, the Pacific islands and all countries in the Middle East. Accordingly licence agreements were concluded between the first plaintiff and the joint companies. Pursuant to the JVA certain companies controlled by the first defendant were also engaged to manufacture the Tiger Brand products for the joint companies at costs plus 15%. There is no provision in the JVA for its renewal beyond December 1991.
By separate letters dated 7 November 1989, the second plaintiff drew the attention of the first, second and third defendants to the fact that the JVA would expire on 31 December 1991 and also gave notice to them that the JVA would not be renewed or extended beyond 31 December 1991. The plaintiffs also said that months prior to that letter, oral indications were given to the said defendants that the JVA would not be extended. Though there were some discussions to extend the JVA, including one involving the chairman of the first plaintiff and the first defendant personally, they were not fruitful.
The plaintiffs alleged that in February 1990, they heard from market sources that the first defendant and the companies which he controlled would be launching a new balm product in Singapore and Malaysia. In early March 1990, one Mr Donald Chia, who is the general manager of the joint companies (and who is also a son of the first defendant) informed the president and chief executive officer of the first and second plaintiffs, one Dr Hong Hai, that the first defendant and his companies would be launching a new balm product. However, the plaintiffs were not told that this balm would be in direct competition with the Tiger Balm products and would have a similar get-up.
On 5 March 1990 it would appear that the fifth defendant, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the second defendant, issued a price list for the new balm, known as the Golden Lion Shield Balm (hereinafter called the Lion Balm). The Lion Balm products were being manufactured by the fourth defendant, a company controlled by the first defendant`s group of companies, and were being distributed in West Malaysia by the sixth defendant, a company similarly controlled. In Singapore, the Lion Balm products were, prior to the interim injunctions obtained by the plaintiffs in these proceedings, being imported and distributed by the fifth defendant.
The plaintiffs say that as a consequence of this new product, the sales of the Tiger Balm products carried out by the joint companies were and are going to be adversely affected. Not only has the first defendant raised the prices of the Tiger Balm products in January 1989 and also in February/March 1990 and made them less competitive vis-a-vis the Lion Balm products, the first defendant has also failed in his duty to promote the sales of the Tiger Balm products.
The plaintiffs allege that the Lion Balm products adapt, imitate and copy the get-up of the Tiger Balm products. The plaintiffs further contend that the Mandarin pronunciations of the Lion Balm and the Tiger Balm are phonetically very similar and are likely to cause confusion in the market especially when both products are manufactured, distributed and sold by the first defendant`s group of companies. Tiger Balm in Mandarin is called `Wan Jin You` and Lion Balm `Wan Yin You`. The plaintiffs also complain that the ingredients used in the manufacture of the Lion Balm products are substantially the same as those used for the manufacture of Tiger Balm products.
The plaintiffs aver that the launching of the Lion Balm is intended to compete unfairly with the Tiger Balm products, contrary to the spirit and intent of the JVA where the joint venture partners are expected to use their best endeavours to maximize the profits of the joint companies. Of relevance in this regard is the document entitled `Heads of Agreement` dated 1 November 1977 (HA) which was executed by the parties in order to overcome certain disputes which arose between the parties in the implementation of the JVA, in particular, para 6 thereof.
By a letter dated 15 May 1990 from the plaintiffs` solicitors to the first defendant, and copied to, inter alia, the second and the third defendants, the said defendants were asked to stop all infringing acts and were warned that unless the demand was complied with within 14 days, legal action would be taken. The first defendant and his companies replied through their solicitors in a letter dated 29 May 1990. In it the defendants, while admitting that they were manufacturing and selling Lion Balm products, denied that they were guilty of any infringing act and made the following points:
 
 
(i) The get-up features of the Tiger Balm products were not unique but were common to the trade in such products. Reference was made to other balm products which bore common get-up features, eg `Pahking Balm`, `Star Lion Head`, `Pochun Balm`. 
 
(ii) The profits of HPEAT had not slipped; indeed for the first four months of 1990, it went up by eleven-fold when compared with the corresponding period of 1989. Similarly for HPTBI, the profits there for the same period went up by almost three-fold. 
 
(iii) In 1989, the plaintiffs made direct contacts with the sub-distributors of the joint venture companies, causing confusion. 
 
(iv) The increase in prices for the Tiger Balm products in early 1989 was made with the concurrence of the plaintiffs` nominee who served as the chairman of the board of the joint companies. There was no sinister motive in price increase. 
 
(v) At the meeting between Mr Donald Chia and Dr Hong Hai in March 1990, the question of further co-operation between the two groups was explored. 
 
(vi) The first defendant`s companies had not used any confidential information of the plaintiffs in the manufacture of the Lion Balm products.
  
 
 
In a reply dated 13 June 1990, the solicitors for the plaintiffs refuted the allegations of the defendants. They said that based on published accounts there was a significant drop in the sales and profits of the two joint companies. They also said that the contacts made by the plaintiffs with the sub-distributors were intended to assure them that the Tiger Balm products would continue to be supplied to them after the JVA had expired. Such contacts would not have caused confusion and whatever confusion, if it existed at all, was caused by the emergence of the Lion Balm products in competition with the Tiger Balm products especially when both products involved the same manufacturers, distributors and sales personnel. As Dr Hong Hai had then just joined the Haw Par group, his meeting with Mr Donald Chia was to enable him to meet the partners in the joint venture and also to create better rapport and to smoothen the takeover when the JVA expires in December 1991. The plaintiffs` solicitors reiterated that the first defendant has acted against the letter and spirit of the JVA and has breached his duty as managing director and chief executive of the joint companies in launching the Lion Balm products. The letter noted that while it was true that the plaintiffs agreed to the increase in price of the Tiger Balm products, that was in ignorance of the fact that the defendants would be undercutting those prices with competitive products of their own. The letter ended with an intimation that the plaintiffs intended to proceed to institute legal proceedings against all the defendants and that the plaintiffs would also be seeking interlocutory relief unless the defendants gave an undertaking to cease, pending trial, the manufacture and sale of the Lion Balm products.
There was a further reply on 20 June 1990 by the defendants` solicitors to the letter of 13 June 1990 disputing some of the matters stated therein. I do not think I need touch on those points as they are not relevant to the present stage of the proceedings. If at all they show disputes on fact.
On 19 June 1990 the plaintiffs issued the present writ against the defendants, claiming for injunctions and damages. On 22 June 1990, on an ex parte application, the court granted interim injunctions against the defendants. I do not think I need to set out the entire order. Suffice it if I should just set out that portion relating to the first defendant, as the injunctions against the other defendants are, subject to the necessary modifications, along similar lines: 
 
1 The first defendant by himself, his servants or agents or otherwise be restrained, and an injunction is hereby granted restraining him until further order from doing or from causing, procuring or permitting the second, third, fourth, fifth or sixth defendants to do any of the following acts:
 
 
 
 
(i) manufacturing, packaging, exporting, distributing, offering for sale, selling, supplying, disposing, promoting by advertisement or otherwise or dealing in any way in the Golden Lion Shield Balm products; 
 
(ii) passing off or attempting to pass off or causing, enabling or assisting others to pass off Golden Lion Shield Balm products as or as connected with the Tiger Balm products; 
 
(iii) acting in breach of fiduciary duty or the fiduciary or contractual obligations pursuant to agreements in writing severally dated 22 October 1971, 29 November 1976, 1 November 1977, 4 November 1985 and 18 August 1988 (hereinafter collectively called the JVA) competing with, or causing or allowing or participating in the manufacture, sale or distribution of products competing with those manufactured, sold or distributed by the joint companies and in particular the manufacture, sale or distribution of the Golden Lion Shield Balm products; and 
 
(iv) making unlawful use of confidential or other information acquired by or entrusted to the first defendant as the managing director and chief executive of the joint companies relating to the business and production of Tiger Balm products.
  
 
 
The interim order of 22 June 1990 in so far as it affects the first, second and fifth defendants was by a subsequent order made on 10 August 1990 varied to the extent that certain specified products of the defendants, which do not carry the trade name of Golden Lion Shield Balm, are expressly excluded from the operation of the order of 22 June 1990.
On 28 June 1990, the first, second and fifth defendants applied to have the interim order made against them discharged or varied. On 31 October 1990 the third, fourth and sixth defendants made a similar application. These are the two applications now before me.
The claim of the plaintiffs against the defendants is formulated broadly under three heads: (i) breach of fiduciary duty as regards certain confidential information; (ii) breach of contractual obligations; and (iii) passing-off. The second plaintiff is now the licensee of the Tiger Brand products, including the Tiger Balm products, for countries and territories not covered by the JVA.
During the hearing before me to discharge the injunction, the various containers of the Tiger Balm products and Lion Balm products were tendered to me for my visual inspection. Samples of other balms were also handed to me. I have retained them for my further scrutiny in writing out this judgment.
The principles that govern an application like the present are set out in the landmark judgment of Lord Diplock in 
 American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd 
 
[1975] AC 396
. Before I go into an examination of the facts and see how the 
 American Cyanamid 
 principles should be applied, I think it is imperative that I identify and/or set out some of the pertinent provisions of the JVA and other related agreements.
 The joint venture agreement and other related agreements 
The recital to the JVA states, inter alia, that (i) the first plaintiff `is the owner of the Tiger Brand trade marks and has been manufacturing, selling and distributing under such trade marks products known as Tiger Balm ... in various parts of the world`; (ii) Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd `is manufacturing selling and distributing in various parts of the world pharmaceutical products through its subsidiary and associated companies and is desirous of expanding such business.`
The JVA provides that all plants and machineries used by the first plaintiff in the manufacture of the Tiger Brand products are to be sold to Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd and they were so sold. The JVA expressly declares that the rights to manufacture and sell Tiger Brand products in any country not covered by the agreement would continue to be the exclusive rights of the first plaintiff.
The following are some of the other relevant provisions in the JVA: 
 
Clause 1(g)
 
 
 
Upon the appointment of Jack Chia as the managing director of both the joint companies he shall be the chief executive responsible to the respective boards of the joint companies for their operation. Jack Chia shall not resign or otherwise terminate his appointment as such managing director save with the written consent of the parties hereto or on the grounds of mental or physical incapacity where the parties hereto are satisfied that he is not capable of continuing so to act. Notwithstanding such mental or physical incapacity or the demise of Jack Chia the terms of this agreement shall remain in full force and effect between the parties hereto.
 
 
 
Clause 10(a) and (b)
 
 
 
 
(a) Neither of the joint companies nor (the second and third defendants) nor any subsidiary, associated or parent company of (the second and third defendants) shall register or endeavour to register all or any of the Tiger Brand trade marks for any classification or class of goods in any territory where they are not already registered nor shall they or any of them manufacture, market or distribute or attempt to manufacture, market or distribute all or any Tiger Brand products in any territory whatsoever save strictly in accordance with the provisions of this agreement. 
 
(b) Any and all Tiger Brand trade marks, including all trade names, used in relation to Tiger Brand products, or any other products, whether such trade marks are registered now or in the future, and whether such trade marks or trade names are registered or not, shall be the absolute property of Haw Par, and (the second and third defendants) and the joint companies and neither of them shall question at any time or for any reason Haw Par`s title to and ownership of such trade marks and trade names ...
  
 
 
Clause 14(b)
 
 
 
The joint companies shall ensure that the Tiger Brand products to be manufactured in terms of this agreement are so manufactured or processed at at least the same quality and standard as those maintained by Haw Par for its present products and the joint companies shall ensure that the manufacturers appointed under the provisions of clause 4 hereof shall follow in every detail all instructions in respect of the manufacture of such products from time to time.
 
 
 
Clause 16
 
 
 
... Provided always that in giving effect to his duties as ... managing director of the joint companies to implement the terms of this agreement and to promote the best interests of the joint companies, Jack Chia may hold any appointment ... not contrary to his duties hereunder.
Annexed to the JVA was a draft licence agreement to be entered into between the first plaintiff and HPEAT. Under cl 3(b) it is provided that the first plaintiff `shall make available to the licensee all formula, technical information, know-how, specifications and other data necessary for the manufacture of Tiger Brand products.` And under cl 3(e) it is provided that `the licensee shall treat as confidential all information and formulations supplied to it ... and shall ensure that such information and formulations are used solely to assist in the manufacture ... of the Tiger Brand products in accordance with this agreement while such agreement is in force.`
The eventual licence agreement which was signed on 1 December 1972 by the first plaintiff and HPEAT was not in identical terms with the draft annexed to the JVA; but there were many common features. In the recital the parties recognized that the first plaintiff possessed `certain technical information necessary for or used in the manufacture of the Tiger Brand products`. Clause 1(v) of the licence agreement provides: 
 
(HPEAT) will label and package all products to be sold under the Tiger Brand trade marks strictly in accordance with instructions received from the (first plaintiff) and will not place in use any other labels or packages in connection with the sale of such products without the previous approval of the (first plaintiff).
 
 
 
Clause 2 of the licence agreement reads: 
 
During the period of this agreement and at all times thereafter (HPEAT) shall treat as confidential all information and formulation supplied to it by the (first plaintiff) ... and shall ensure that such information and formulation are used solely to assist in the manufacture ... of the Tiger Brand products under the Tiger Brand trade marks ... while this agreement is in force.
 
 
 
Similar provisions to these are to be found in the licence agreement signed on 5 January 1973 between the first plaintiff and HPTBI.
 Fiduciary duty/confidential information 
I will now deal with the claim based on a breach of fiduciary duty as regards certain confidential information. In the light of the brief facts set out above it is quite clear that the plaintiffs and the first three defendants are in a joint venture, a venture to manufacture, promote, sell and develop the Tiger Brand products, including the Tiger Balm products, for mutual advantage and profit. The confidential information which would be furnished by the plaintiffs to the joint companies should only be used for the purpose of manufacturing the Tiger Brand products by the joint companies and not for any other purpose. Looking at the terms of the JVA, I am inclined to think that there is a fiduciary relationship between the participants to the joint venture arrangements or there is at least an arguable case for it. The establishment of such a relationship was put in this way by Dawson J in 
 United Dominions Corp Pty 
 
 v 
 
 Brian Pty Ltd 
 (1985) 59 ALJR 676 at p 681: 
 
Although the relationship between participants in a joint venture which is to a partnership will be governed by the particular contract rather than extrinsic principles of law, the relationship may nevertheless be a fiduciary one if the necessary confidence is reposed by the participants in one another. Of course, in a partnership the parties are agents for each other and this may constitute a separate reason for the fiduciary character of a partnership. There may be no such agency between participants in a joint venture but, as Dixon J pointed out in 
 Birtchnell
 
 v
 
 Equity Trustees
 ... even in a partnership it is really the mutual confidence between partners which imposes fiduciary duties upon them and the same confidence may, in appropriate circumstances, be found to exist between participants in a joint venture.
 
 
 
In any event where information provided is to be considered as confidential, its use and disclosure under general law is to be limited to the purpose for which the information is given: see 
 Torrington Manufacturing v Smith & Sons Ltd 
 [1966] RPC 285 at p 301.
It is next argued by the defendants that the plaintiffs have not shown that they have imparted confidential information to the first three defendants or the joint companies. The defendants say that the plaintiffs have not been able to identify with necessary precision any information which is confidential.
In further elaboration, the defendants aver that there is nothing confidential about the `manufacturing pro` which they identified to consist of the following five stages:
 
 
(i) mixing active ingredients to form a concentrate; 
 
(ii) mixing the base materials or excipient; 
 
(iii) mixing the concentrate with the base materials; 
 
(iv) filling the mixture into appropriate containers; 
 
(v) packaging the product.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs` answer is that that is not all. Those are the basic steps. What are confidential are the details relating to each step, eg at what temperature the equipment used should be set; at which stage each of the ingredients should be added; and the duration the ingredients are to be kept in that state (see para 43 of the affidavit of Tan Hee Chai affirmed on 16 November 1990).
In so far as the ingredients that are needed to manufacture the Tiger Balm products are concerned, the defendants submitted that there is nothing confidential about that because the ingredients are shown and printed on the product itself; they are matters of public knowledge. While that is true, it seems to me that is not all. The ingredients that go into making a product is one thing; the process another. In this regard I need not go into a discussion about the judgment of Roxburgh J in 
 Terrapin Ltd v Builders Supply Co (Hayes) Ltd 
[1967] RPC 375 where the springboard doctrine was referred to and where he said ` ... springboard it remains even when all the features have been published or can be ascertained by actual inspection by any member of the public.` Perhaps this statement could be reconciled on the premise that information will not necessarily lose its confidentiality by the marketing of a product which embodies the information but which does not embody all the features of the information. That is precisely the situation here. The fact that the ingredients that go into the making of the product are disclosed on the packaging of the product does not mean that all the technical information/know-how needed to manufacture the prohas become public knowledge.
In any event having regard to the express provisions in the JVA and the licence agreements which specifically refer to confidential information being imparted by the plaintiffs to the joint companies, I do not think it is possible for the court at this interlocutory stage, without hearing oral evidence, to rule that the first plaintiff has not imparted any confidential information. Putting it at the lowest, it is an issue to be tried.
Before moving to the second ground, I should say this for completeness. Another aspect of confidential information referred to by the plaintiffs relates to pricing formula. I do not think there is anything very much in this aspect. I note that this information is made known to all sub-distributors and retailers.
 Breach of contractual obligations 
In so far as the first defendant is concerned, the relevant provisions in the JVA are cll 1(g) and 16. Under cl 1(g) of the JVA, the parties agreed to appoint the first defendant as the managing director and chief executive of both the joint companies. It is expressly provided that he `shall not resign or otherwise terminate his appointment as such managing director save with the written consent of the parties hereto or on the grounds of mental or physical incapacity where the parties hereto are satisfied that he is not capable of continuing so to act`. What is just as significant is that the provision went on to say that notwithstanding such incapacity or even the demise of the first defendant, the agreement `shall remain in full force and effect between the parties hereto`.
Under cl 16, the first defendant is allowed to hold any appointment in the second and third defendants, or in their subsidiary or associate companies, provided that they are `not contrary to his duties` as the managing director of the joint companies.
Under cl 2, the joint companies are to take steps to protect the interests of the shareholders in the joint companies and to earn maximum profits.
As regards the position of the second and third defendants, under cl 10(a) they (as successors to Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd) are estopped from manufacturing, marketing etc any Tiger Brand products in any territory save strictly in accordance with the the provisions of the JVA. Under cl 20(c), the obligation under cl 10(a) shall continue notwithstanding the termination of the JVA.
Under cl 12(b), the second and third defendants are obliged to use their best endeavours to improve the existing formulations of the Tiger Brand products.
Under para 6 of the Heads of Agreement, the parties to the JVA `agree to implement the provisions of the same in the spirit of joint venture and mutual co-operation and 
 will use their best endeavours to maximize the profit of the joint companies 
 ` (emphasis added).
In the light of these provisions, it seems to me abundantly clear that the first, second and third defendants are contractually bound to refrain from doing any act or engaging in activities which would undermine the business of the joint companies and this would include the manufacture of any product which is colourably similar to that of the Tiger Balm products. While it is true that there is nothing express in the JVA which prohibits the first defendant or his companies from being involved in other competitive products, in my view that must be implied. I ask this simple question: can one honestly say that he is maximizing the profits of the joint companies when he is also at the same time manufacturing similar products with a similar get-up which will inevitably undermine the sales of the Tiger Balm products?
As an illustration to show that the first defendant and his companies have not put in their best efforts for the joint companies, the plaintiffs refer to the matter concerning the reduction of the camphor content prescribed by the Malaysian authorities. They ask how is it that the camphor content of the Lion Balm products are made in compliance with the new Malaysian ruling and yet the Tiger Balm products are being made with camphor content exceeding the limit allowed by the Malaysian authorities? The plaintiffs have asked me to draw the necessary inferences. The plaintiffs also allege that the sales of the Tiger Balm products had dropped in 1989. They say it is not true that the sales of the Tiger Balm products for the first four months of 1990 had increased significantly. The plaintiffs have exhibited the management`s accounts for the first seven months of 1990 to substantiate what they say.
A rather instructive case (though I must add that it was a case concerning partnership) which highlights the implied obligation of a co-venturer not to do anything in competition with the joint venture is 
 Lock v Lynam 
(1854) 4 I Ch R 188
 , 
 an Irish case. There the plaintiff and the defendant had agreed to share the profit and loss arising from contracts taken by the defendant for the supply of meat and bread to Her Majesty`s forces in Ireland. While the agreement was in force, the defendant entered into secret agreements with other persons to share with them the profit and loss accruing in respect of similar contracts entered into and taken by them. The defendant was ordered to account. The Lord Chancellor observed that in all cases of this kind the real question was whether, from the nature of the transaction between the partners, there was an express or implied contract against other dealings of a like character; and that although there was no engagement not to enter into any other partnership of the same kind still it never could have been in the contemplation of either of the parties that one partner should, in his own name or in that of any other person, adopt contracts to the prejudice of the other`s interest.
I agree that there is nothing in the JVA or in the other related agreements which expressly precludes the first defendant from engaging in other business. But I think it lies ill in the mouth of the first defendant, while he remains the managing director and chief executive officer of the joint companies to say that he is entitled to be involved in ventures or activities which will directly affect the sales and profits of the joint companies.
 Passing-off 
I now turn to examine the third head of the plaintiffs` claim. The essential ingredients which must be present in order to mount an action for passing-off have been identified by Lord Diplock in 
 Warnink v 
 
 Townend & Sons 
 
[1979] AC 731
 at p 742 to be (i) a misrepresentation; (ii) made by a trader in the course of trade; (iii) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him; (iv) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader; and (v) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so.
The main complaint of the plaintiffs here is that the get-up of the Lion Balm products is too similar to that of the Tiger Balm products. The plaintiffs allege that the get-up of Lion Balm products copies the get-up of the Tiger Balm products in the following respects:
 
 
(i) the glass container of the Lion Balm is hexagonal in shape and similar in size, with its logo at the bottom of the container; 
 
(ii) the packaging of the container of the Lion Balm is similar in style, colour and design. The label and the top-seal are of a jagged-edge tooth format. The whole packaging is then sealed by two circular seals containing the logo; 
 
(iii) the colour of the `screw-on` cover of the hexagonal container of the Lion Balm is of the same shade of bronze; 
 
(iv) the `screw-on` cover is similarly embossed, albeit with its different logo.
  
 
 
I note that there are some differences in detail in the two get-ups. But I do not think that those differences are sufficient to avoid confusion or deception. The defendants have not explained why the get-up of the Lion Balm products has to be in so many ways similar to those of the Tiger Balm products.
It is not necessary for passing-off that every part of the get-up should be imitated. In the present case the adoption of a phonetically similar Chinese name for the Lion Balm further aggravates the situation. It is common usage to refer to the Tiger Balm products by asking for them in retail outlets as `Wan Jin You` and not their full titles in Mandarin. Of all possibilities, the defendants chose to call their Lion Balm products `Wan Yin You`. I think our case here is very close to 
 Reckitt & Colman Ltd v Borden Inc 
 
[1990] 1 WLR 491
 which concerned lemon juice sold in yellow plastic squeeze packs which resembled a natural lemon in size, shape and colour. There the court granted the plaintiff an injunction to restrain the defendant from producing lemon-shaped containers for selling lemon juice. Lord Oliver put the issue thus: 
 
In the end, the question comes down not to whether the respondents are entitled to a monopoly in the sale of lemon juice in natural size lemon-shaped containers but whether the appellants, in deliberately adopting, out of all the many possible shapes of container, a container having the most immediately striking feature of the respondent`s get-up, have taken sufficient steps to distinguish their product from that of the respondent.
 
 
 
He did not think that the test of putting the two products side by side to see whether a person with reasonable apprehension and proper eyesight would be deceived, as advocated by Lord Halsbury LC in 
 Schweppes Ltd v Gibbens 
(1905) 22 RPC 601
 , 
 was correct. Lord Oliver said (at p 609): 
 
The essence of the action for passing-off is a deceit practised upon the public and it can be no answer, in a case where it is demonstrable that the public has been or will be deceived, that they would not have been if they had been more careful, more literate or more perspicacious. Customers have to be taken as they are found.
 
 
 
I accept that a careful purchaser would be able to differentiate between the Tiger Balm products and the Lion Balm products. But I do not think that is an answer to an action for passing-off if people are deceived or are likely to be deceived. The obligation is on the defendant to show that he has taken steps to ensure that there will be no confusion. As Romer LJ observed in 
 Payton & Co 
 
 v 
 
 Snelling, Lampard & Co 
 (1899) 17 RPC 48 at p 56: 
 
... when one person has used certain leading features, though common to the trade, if another person is going to put goods on the market, having the same leading features, he should take extra care by the distinguishing features he is going to put on his goods, to see that the goods can be really distinguished ...
 
 
 
I would also adopt what Warrington J said in 
 Schweppes Ltd v Gibbens 
 (1905) 22 RPC 113 at p 119: 
 
... it is sufficient to enable the plaintiff to succeed if he can show that the get-up, the label, or whatever it may be, is of such a nature as is calculated to enable the retail vendor to deceive the ultimate customer.
 
 
 
Considering the get-up and the shape and size of the two jars, and the phonetic similarity in the Chinese names of the two products, I cannot help but feel that the defendants have deliberately tried to take advantage of the goodwill of the Tiger Balm products and what was done was calculated to enable a passing-off to take place. This is really a case of `cashing-in` now that the JVA is due to expire. This is all the more so when we bear in mind that a fairly substantial proportion of the population in Singapore are Chinese-educated and quite a proportion of the elderly people in Singapore are illiterate. For these people I think the get-up is all that matters. Having seen the jars in which the two products are sold to the public, I have no doubt that the similarity is likely to cause confusion or, to adopt the words of Warrington J in 
 Schweppes Ltd 
 (1905) 22 RPC 113, to cause the retail vendor to deceive the ultimate purchaser. In short, the get-up of the Lion Balm products is deceptively similar to that of the Tiger Balm products. All the more so when it is noted that the two products are manufactured, distributed and sold by the first defendant`s group of companies. There is no need to prove actual deception: see 
 White Hudson v Asian Organization 
 
 
 [1965] 1 MLJ 186 
 . 
It is sufficient if the evidence shows that there is such similarity as to be calculated to cause confusion in the mind of the public.
For purposes of comparison only, as passing-off is generally a question of fact, I would refer to the case of 
 Fisons v Godwin (EJ) (Peat Industries) 
[1976] RPC 653 which concerned growing bags used for planting seedlings. The plaintiffs` bag was partly overprinted with horticultural decorations and marked `Fisons Gro-bag` in bold letters. The defendants` bag also had similar decorations printed on it but it bore the legend `Godwin`s Crop-bag`. Brightman J refused an interlocutory injunction and explained it thus: 
 
I prefer to trust my own eyes. There are obvious similarities between the two bags but it seems to me inconceivable that anyone seeing a growing bag described in very bold letters as `Godwin`s Crop-bag` could possibly suppose that it was a `Gro-bag` produced by Fisons, or that anyone buying a growing bag of the Fison design could fail to observe that it was a Fison product, so prominently displayed is the name `Fisons`. If the Fison `Gro-bag` had not contained the name `Fisons` or if the name `Godwin` had not been so prominently displayed, I might well have reached a different conclusion ...
 
 
 
I would respectfully agree with Brightman J in 
 Fisons 
. But the situation there was quite different from that in the present case. In 
 Fisons 
 the distinguishing features stood out; not so in the present case.
Equally illustrative is the local case 
 White Hudson v Asian Organization Ltd 
which concerned an action to prevent passing-off of medicated sweets. The plaintiff`s sweets were wrapped in red coloured cellophane wrappers on which was printed the name `Hacks`. The defendant imported into Singapore medicated sweets manufactured in Holland which were of similar size, shape and colour to those of the plaintiff and were wrapped in red coloured wrapper which was printed with the name `Pecto`. The High Court of Singapore granted an injunction.
It is submitted by the defendants that the get-up and/or the size/shape of the jar used by the Tiger Balm products are not peculiar to those products only. It is contended that other products have similar get-up. In answer to that the plaintiffs have in exh `THC-12` to the affidavit of Tan Hee Chai, affirmed on 16 November 1990, identified the similarities between the get-ups of the various balms alleged by the defendants to be in the market. From that, one can see that the Lion Balm get-up is most similar to that of the Tiger Balm. The only other balm that comes close is `Lion Balm Dong Woo`. But that balm does not appear to be available in Singapore; the defendants have not been able to identify where that balm could be obtained in Singapore. Even in respect of the `Lion Balm Dong Woo`, on that product being imported into the United States, the plaintiffs have taken action in the Californian court to restrain the owners or manufacturers of that balm. I am persuaded that the get-up of the Tiger Balm products is distinctive and has been identified with those products.
Then there is the argument that the shape/size of the hexagonal jar is not something that is capable of being protected in law. Reference was also made to 
 Re Coca-Cola Co 
 
[1986] 1 WLR 695
 . 
All I need say in answer to that is to quote this passage from Lord Oliver`s judgment in 
 Reckitt & Colman 
 at p 504: 
 
Whether in fact the particular shape or configuration of the very object sold by a trader is incapable as a matter of law of protection in a case where it has become associated exclusively with his business is a proposition which is at least open to doubt. The decision of Buckley J in 
 RJ Elliot & Co Ltd
 
 v
 
 Hodgson
 (1902) RPC 518 suggests the contrary, although it has been doubted: see 
 Cadbury Ltd v
 
 Ulmer Gmbh
 [1988] FSR 385. It is clear at least from the decision of this House in 
 William Edge & Sons Ltd
 
 v
 
 William Niccols & Sons Ltd
[1911] AC 693
 that where the article sold is conjoined with an object which, whilst serving the functional purpose of enabling the article to be more effectively employed, is of a shape or configuration which has become specifically identified with a particular manufacturer, the latter may be entitled to protection against the deceptive use in conjunction with similar articles of objects fashioned in the same or a closely similar shape.
 
 
 
I find it, however, unnecessary to pursue the question further for there is, to my mind, a fallacy in the argument which begins by identifying the contents with the container and is summarized in the central proposition that `you cannot, claim a monopoly in selling plastic lemons`. Well, of course you cannot any more than you can claim a monopoly in the sale of dimpled bottles. The deception alleged lies not in the sale of the plastic lemons or the dimpled bottles, but in the sale of lemon juice or whisky, as the case may be, in containers so fashioned as to suggest that the juice or the whisky emanates from the source with which the containers of those particular configurations have become associated in the public mind ...
On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that a reasonably strong case has been made out by the plaintiffs that the peculiar get-up of the Tiger Balm products has become associated exclusively with the plaintiffs` business. In coming to this view I have borne in mind the following observations made by Lord Watson in 
 Haig (John) & Co 
 
 v 
 
 Forth Blending Co Ltd 
 [1953] 70 RPC 259 at p 261: 
 
No trader by adopting and using a particular style of get-up thereby acquires a right to prevent a rival or second trader using the same or a similar get-up unless the get-up of the first trader has become so associated in the minds of the public with the first trader`s goods as to be distinctive of the goods of the first trader and of no other.
 
 
 
In any event, on the facts it is abundantly clear to me that the plaintiffs have established at least an arguable case of passing-off.
 Locus standi 
Before I leave the subject of passing-off, I have to consider the question of locus standi. It is argued for the defendants that the plaintiffs have no locus to sue for passing-off since the plaintiffs have granted exclusive right to manufacture and sell Tiger Balm products in Singapore and Malaysia to the joint companies. If anyone is entitled to take action for passing-off it is the joint companies. Fiduciary relationship exists only as between the first defendant and the joint companies. However, the defendants concede that prior to the incorporation of the joint companies direct fiduciary obligations might have been owed by the first defendant to the plaintiffs but not thereafter. The defendants say past reputation is not good enough and without trading there is no reputation. They argue that passing-off does not confer monopoly rights in any names, marks or get-ups nor does it recognize them as property in their own right; damage is essential to passing-off in that for a misrepresentation to be actionable it must be calculated to cause damage to the plaintiff`s goodwill.
The reply of the plaintiffs to this submission is as follows. They say that under the JVA and the licence agreements, it is clear that what is granted to the joint companies is only an exclusive right to manufacture and sell in this region (and some others) for a duration of 20 years expiring in December 1991. During the JVA period, the plaintiffs are entitled to royalty and other payments from the joint companies. On the expiry of that period, the goodwill and business will revert to the plaintiffs. They have already given notice to the defendants that there would be no extension or renewal of the JVA. Further, the plaintiffs retain their exclusive rights in the business and goodwill of the Tiger Balm products in all other parts of the world. Accordingly, the plaintiffs are entitled to enforce their rights in the goodwill against all, apart from the joint companies, who are not entitled to manufacture and sell Tiger Balm products.
The plaintiffs rely on the case 
 Warnink v Townend & Sons 
 where the House of Lords held that the fact that the goodwill attaching to the use of a name as a description of a product was shared by a number of traders did not preclude one of the traders from successfully suing on it. Very much the same principle was applied in 
 Dent v Turpin 
 (1861) 2 J&H 139; 70 ER 1003 where Page-Wood VC said that 
 
it is quite enough to aver, as the bill does, that these articles were manufactured and marked with the trade mark in question, without the consent of the plaintiff or of the other person entitled to use the name of Dent.
 
 
 
 
 
 Dent v Turpin 
 
 clearly shows that a plaintiff need not have an exclusive right to use the mark if the defendant has no right to it at all.
In 
 Alfred Dunhill v Sunoptic SA 
 [1979] FSR 337
 , 
 the Court of Appeal held that although the plaintiff did not sell sunglasses or spectacle frames in the United Kingdom and were only involved in negotiations with a view to entering that market, it did not preclude the plaintiff from obtaining an injunction restraining the defendant from advertising and selling sunglasses and spectacle frames under the trade mark `CD Christopher Dunhill-London`. For years the plaintiffs` business in the UK and elsewhere was in the sale of tobacco products, smokers` requisites and a wide range of luxury goods.
A rather interesting case is 
 Star Industrial Co Ltd v Yap Kwee Kor 
[1976] FSR 256
 , 
 a decision of the Privy Council. There the plaintiff, a Hong Kong company, manufactured toothbrushes with a characteristic get-up of which a prominent feature was the words `ACE BRAND`. Prior to 1965, the plaintiff exported the toothbrushes to Singapore for purposes of re-export to Malaysia and Indonesia. There was evidence that some of the toothbrushes were sold in Singapore. The plaintiff had no registered trade mark in Singapore. With the imposition of import duties, the plaintiff ceased exporting the toothbrushes to Singapore from 1965. In 1968, the defendant formed a company with a name similar to that of the plaintiff and marketed toothbrushes under a get-up very similar to that of the plaintiff - instead of `ACE` the defendant used `AGE`. The evidence showed that the plaintiff had no intention of itself resuming this part of the former trade. Instead, they assigned their residual goodwill in Singapore together with the right of user of the mark on an exclusive basis to a company in Singapore in which the plaintiff owned half the equity. Choor Singh J in the High Court said (at p 264): 
 
The plaintiff company, not having evinced any intention of manufacturing ACE Brand toothbrushes in Hong Kong for export to Singapore and not having, at present, any trade in such toothbrushes in Singapore, cannot, under the circumstances, succeed in a claim for passing-off against the defendant or any other person because they have no trade which is being injured or going to be injured by the conduct of the defendant. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
When the case went up on appeal to the Privy Council, Lord Diplock after stating that a passing-off action is a remedy for the invasion of a right of property not in the name, or get-up improperly used, but in the business of goodwill likely to be injured by the misrepresentation made by passing-off one person`s goods as the goods of another, said: 
 
Goodwill, as the subject of proprietary rights, is incapable of subsisting by itself. It has no independent existence apart from the business to which it is attached ... Once the Hong Kong company had abandoned that part of its former business that consisted in manufacturing toothbrushes for export to and sale in Singapore it ceased to have any proprietary right in Singapore which was entitled to protection in any action for passing-off brought in the courts of that country.
 
 
 
I would emphasize the word `abandoned` in the above passage. That factor is certainly absent in our present case.
In 
 Metric Resources Corp v Leasemetrix Ltd 
 [1979] FSR 571
 , 
 Megarry VC reviewed a number of the earlier cases concerning the question whether foreign companies with no place of business in England might have such a reputation in its name in England as to justify the grant of an injunction to restrain passing-off. He felt that the 
 Star Industrial 
 case did not really decide that the owner of a business carried on outside a jurisdiction could establish no protectable goodwill within it before beginning to trade there. At least he felt there was some doubt on the point.
Finally, I would like to refer to a certain passage which appears at p 361 in 
 Kerly on the Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names 
(12th Ed) which seems to have a bearing on the present issue: 
 
A foreign manufacturer who does not trade in this country but whose goods are sold in this country, may well acquire a protectable goodwill in his trade name or trade marks. There will then be what in principle is a pure question of fact, whether the goodwill is that of the foreign manufacturer or the British importer. This is the sort of question of fact on which a court`s finding is easily influenced by its feelings as to the merits of the case; the objection that an importer has no independent goodwill, so often successful when raised on behalf of the manufacturer or of a trader dealing in the manufacturer`s own goods, is likely to be brushed aside as a mere technicality when made by a defendant having no connection with the `genuine` goods.
 
 
 
Whatever it is, the position of the plaintiffs here is certainly unique. At this stage of the proceeding, I do not think I need give a firm decision on the issue. As Lord Diplock said in 
 American Cyanamid, 
 it was no part of the court`s function at this stage of the litigation `to decide difficult questions of law which call for detailed argument and mature consideration`. It is certainly an arguable point where the plaintiffs have locus standi to institute this action and that would suffice. Indeed, I would be inclined to think that in the circumstances the plaintiffs have a protectable goodwill. There is certainly a serious question to be tried. There is nothing frivolous or vexatious in the plaintiffs` claim. They have a real cause for concern as to what the defendants are now embarking to do.
The above is the position under passing-off. In so far as the claim rests on breach of contract and/or breach of fiduciary duty, there can be no question that as owners of the goodwill and confidential information the plaintiffs are entitled to an order to restrain the first three defendants from acting in breach of contract or in breach of fiduciary duty; and in so far as the fourth to sixth defendants are concerned to restrain them from assisting the first three defendants to breach their obligations. Under the JVA the goodwill and confidential information are intended only for the use of the joint companies and no one else. Even though on the expiry of the JVA an action can no longer be based on breach of contract, the fiduciary duty to maintain confidential information nevertheless continues.
There is another basis upon which the first defendant may be restrained. The plaintiffs, as the persons whose interests as shareholders in one of the joint companies, HPEAT, would be affected by the conduct of the first defendant, may apply under s 409A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 1990 Ed) for an injunction restraining the first defendant from engaging in conduct which constitutes a contravention of the Act. The court is also given the power, if it considers it desirable, to grant an interim injunction. The first defendant is the managing director and the chief executive of the joint companies. Under s 157(1) of the Act, a director is required to act honestly and use reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office. By making use of the confidential information furnished by the plaintiffs to the joint companies for the manufacture of the Tiger Balm products for his own benefit and in creating a rival balm with a similar get-up as that of the Tiger Balm products (assuming these are eventually proven at the trial), it seems to me that the first defendant could not be acting in the interest of the joint company, nor was he acting honestly. Further, under s 157(2) of the Act, an officer of a company shall not make improper use of any information acquired by virtue of his posias an officer to gain, directly or indirectly, an advantage for himself or for any other person or to cause detrito the company. What the first defendant has done as aforesaid would appear also to contravene this provision.
 Balance of convenience 
I now turn to examine the question of balance of convenience. This really boils down to determining whether damages would be an adequate remedy for the plaintiff. The defendants say that damages would be adequate and could be based `on any decrease in royalty fees paid to the plaintiffs under the JVA assuming the decrease is attributable to the decrease in sales of the Tiger Balm products as a result of the introduction of the Golden Lion Shield products`; such decrease is easily quantifiable. There is no evidence of uncompensatable loss. The defendants contend that on the other hand, if the interim injunction is to continue there would be considerable difficulties in determining the losses of the defendants; how would it be possible to ascertain the quantity of the Lion Balm products that would be sold? In addition, the defendants would suffer in loss of goodwill and reputation.
The case relied on by the defendants is 
 Boots Co Ltd 
v 
 Approved Prescription Services Ltd 
 [1988] FSR 45
 . 
There the English High Court found that the plaintiffs had established an arguable case of passing-off. The product in question was a drug called ibuprofen (trade name: BRUFEN) in the form of magenta coloured pills of a particular shape. However, the court refused to grant an interlocutory injunction on a balance of convenience. The Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the judge and held that if the plaintiff succeeded in the action they could be adequately compensated in damages for loss of sales prior to the grant of the permanent injunction. The measure of damages would be the profits of the magenta pills which were sold by the defendants and ought to have been sold by the plaintiffs and of that there would be a record. The plaintiffs would not suffer loss of goodwill involving incalculable damage after an injunction restoring their monopoly. In contrast, if an injunction were granted and the action failed the defendants would never be able to prove with any certainty how many pills they would have sold had the injunction not been granted.
It seems to me that there are a number of special features in the 
 Boots 
case. First, the quality of the pills produced by the plaintiffs and defendants was the same. Therapeutically there was no difference between the two. Second, the pills were only obtainable on prescription. If the doctor prescribed BRUFEN the patient would be given BRUFEN. Alternatively, the doctor could prescribe the drug by its generic name, in which case the pharmacist might produce either BRUFEN or some other manufacture of the drug. Third, the product being a drug and subject to control, there was no serious risk that a refusal of the injunction would encourage other competitors to enter the market before the trial.
Now the approach to take in this regard was stated by Lord Diplock in 
 American Cyanamid 
as follows (at p 408): 
 
... the governing principle is that the court should first consider whether, if the plaintiff were to succeed at the trial in establishing his right to a permanent injunction, he would be adequately compensated by an award of damages for the loss he would have sustained as a result of the defendant`s continuing to do what was sought to be enjoined between the time of the application and the time of the trial. If damages in the measure recoverable at common law would be adequate remedy and the defendant would be in a financial position to pay them, no interlocutory injunction should normally be granted, however strong the plaintiff`s claim appeared to be at that stage.
 
 
 
On the facts of this case I am of the view that it would be difficult to assess whether damages would be an adequate remedy for either party. I do not accept that the loss to the plaintiffs could be easily quantified and it could be based on the sales of the Lion Balm products. The defendants are not saying that they would pay damages based on their sales of the Lion Balm. Even on the defendants` own argument they have added the proviso `
 assuming 
 the decrease (in royalties) is attributable to the decrease in sales of the Tiger Balm products as a result of the introduction of the Golden Lion Shield products`. That is really begging the question. Further, we do not know how good or effective the Lion Balm is. If it were not as good as the Tiger Balm, then the damage done to the goodwill of Tiger Balm, following the confusion, would be quite difficult to quantify. The consumers might lose faith in Tiger Balm products and switch to something else. The long term effect would be quite difficult to estimate.
In so far as the financial position of the parties are concerned, it is clear that both the plaintiffs and the first and second defendants are parties of substance and good for their undertakings. The defendants made the point that the plaintiffs have not expressly deposed that they have funds to meet the damages that could be suffered by the defendants. But it is a matter of general knowledge that the two plaintiffs are public listed companies. The first plaintiff has been established for a long time. Further, from the JVA arrangements there will also be royalties and other sums due to the plaintiffs.
On the other hand, the defendants have just started on the Lion Balm products. There is no question of their having to close down any factories or laying off workers as those facilities and personnel are still required to produce the Tiger Balm products until December 1991. In fact, the facilities and personnel are also being used by the defendants to produce other products not the subject of this action.
In any event, in the passage of Lord Diplock which I have quoted above, he said that in a case where damages would be an adequate remedy, no interlocutory injunction should `
 normally 
 be granted`. So what he had declared is not an absolute rule. Taking into account the special circumstances of the present case and considering that the defendants have of their own free will deliberately chose to manufacture a new product in direct competition with Tiger Balm and with a get-up which is likely to confuse or deceive, I think I ought not to allow the defendants to carry on causing confusion even assuming that the damages which the plaintiffs would suffer could be fairly calculated.
I am conscious that the court should not stifle business competition; but such competition must be fair and no undue advantage taken.
For all the above reasons, I would order the continuation until trial of the interim injunctions granted on 22 June 1990 as modified by the order of 10 August 1990. Of course, a case of this kind ought to be heard speedily and I would accordingly order an early trial. As regards the costs of this hearing, I order that costs be in the cause.
 Miscellaneous points 
There remain a few miscellaneous points which I ought to touch on briefly. The first relates to the affidavits affirmed by Mr Tan Hee Chai (THC). The defendants say that some paragraphs in his affidavits offend the rule in O 41 r 5(2), as he did not identify the source of his information. Further, some of the paragraphs consist of arguments/opinions rather than facts. In all the three affidavits affirmed by THC, he said that what he deposed to were from information and knowledge acquired by him personally unless otherwise stated. The contention of counsel for the defendants is that THC did not state whether THC was with the plaintiffs in 1971; so the facts relating to the events in 1971/1972 could not be within his personal knowledge. Further, some of the facts deposed to are technical and it is not stated that he has the technical competence. It seems to me that knowledge/information acquired by THC from the records maintained by the plaintiffs is no less information and knowledge acquired by him. Even if I were wrong here, the defect is extremely slight. The fault of THC was in not stating expressly that the information was also obtained from records maintained by the plaintiffs, which is the information used in the defendants` affidavits. In any case, the events which are crucial for the present proceeding are all set out in the JVA and other agreements and the contents of those instruments are not disputable or are not disputed. As regards the complaint that the affidavits contained arguments/opinions, I am afraid this flaw is to be found in the affidavits of both sides. This, of course, should not be the case.
Then there is the question of delay. The defendants say that there was delay on the part of the plaintiffs in coming to court for reliefs. Let me quickly recount the critical facts. On 8 March 1990 at the meeting between Dr Hong Hai and Mr Donald Chia, the plaintiffs were assured that the new products would not be in direct competition with the Tiger Balm products. The first public advertisement of the new products appear in the 1 May 1990 issue of the NTUC News. On 15 May 1990 the plaintiffs, through their solicitors, wrote a letter to the first defendant, which was copied, inter alia, to the second and third defendants, complaining about the passing-off, breach of contractual obligations and fiduciary duty and unlawful use of confidential information. The letter demanded that the first defendant and his companies cease the infringing acts, failing which action would be taken by the plaintiffs against them. Correspondence followed between the solicitors for the two sides. The writ was filed on 19 June 1990 and the interim orders obtained on 22 June 1990. The plaintiffs have not explicitly stated what was the date on which they actually came across the Lion Balm products in the market. On these facts I do not think there has really been any undue delay on the plaintiffs` part in instituting this action and if there is any delay, it is only a very slight one and not one of such an inordinate nature as to warrant disentitling the plaintiffs to interlocutory reliefs.
The last point that I would touch on is the argument that the interim injunction obtained against the first defendant is effectively a mandatory injunction. I do not see any merit in that. The injunction does not compel the first defendant to do any act. The first defendant is quite free to do anything he wishes other than those he is injuncted from doing.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff was employed by the defendants as a production operator at their wood working factory (hereinafter referred to as `the factory`). On 11 March 1986 the plaintiff suffered personal injuries whilst operating a copy shaper machine (hereinafter referred to as `the machine BL39`). She now sues the defendants for injuries suffered by her as a result of their failure to provide a safe system of work and a breach of their duty as occupiers or owners of the factory to take care or to provide premises which were safe for the plaintiff to work on, and further or in the alternative, a breach of their statutory duty.
It was agreed by the parties that the plaintiff`s bundle of documents be admitted and marked as an agreed bundle of documents for the purposes of the trial. The document was marked as AB1 to AB46. Counsel for the plaintiff asked this court to disregard pp 12 to 35 of the agreed bundle of documents because the defendants objected to the admissibility of those documentary evidence. The plaintiff`s counsel also tendered a supplementary bundle of documents which was admitted and collectively marked as `PBD`.
The plaintiff`s evidence is that she commenced work for the defendants in March 1985. She alleged that when she was employed she was not told that she would have to operate a machine and that her job was to trace patterns onto wooden splats which are then shaped by a copy shaper machine for the purpose of turning them into component parts for furniture. In the course of her employment, she was asked to operate a copy shaper machine and there were two such machines in the department where she was working. She was asked to operate the machines whenever the operators of those machines were absent. She said she was not given formal instructions on the operation of the machines and the chargehand gave her instructions on how to operate the machines. According to her, the chargehand taught her a little at a time and told her that he would come every now and then to teach her further. She started operating the machines about four to five months after she started work with the defendants.
On 11 March 1986 she was asked to operate the machine BL39 when the operator of the machine was absent. She said she had operated this machine once previously. She had worked on a machine next to this particular machine. She had to arrange four pieces of splats onto a jig and then feed the jig and splats into the machine. She had to hold onto the jig and splats until they came into contact with the roller of the machine, and the roller would then apply pressure onto the jig and splats and draw them towards the cutting blades of the machine, which is about 10cm away from the nip point of the roller. The cutting blades of the machine will shape the splats, and the jig and splats are then returned to the operator via the conveyor belt. While the shaping process is under way, the operator prepares another jig with four new splats and the procedure is repeated.
The plaintiff had machined a little more than 200 splats on the morning of 11 March 1986 before she went for her tea-break at 9am. She started work at 7.30am on that morning. After her tea-break, she returned to the machine and continued processing some more splats. At or about 10.10am, while feeding a jig into the machine, the plaintiff said her left index finger was caught in between the roller and the top of the jig. She panicked and with some difficulty managed to use her right hand to reach for the switch located on the left side of the machine for reversing the roller and turned on that switch to reverse the roller and pulled out her hand. However, by the time her left hand was freed, her left wrist was already severed. The plaintiff said she fainted after she had pulled out her hand and when she regained consciousness she found herself in the hospital. In cross-examination she said she regained consciousness after three days.
She was admitted to the orthopaedic department of the Singapore General Hospital on the day of her accident. A report dated 16 July 1986 issued by the consultant orthopaedic surgeon of the department of orthopaedic surgery of the hospital stated that she sustained a traumatic amputation of the left upper limb about the wrist joint and many intervening bones and structures were missing (AB10). The report further stated that an unsuccessful attempt was made to re-attach two fingers and she was discharged from hospital on 1 April 1986 for follow-up treatment at the hospital as an out-patient.
She was seen by one Dr Chan Heng Thye (PW1), an orthopaedic surgeon in private practice, on 3 April 1987 and his description of her left limb as given in his report dated 28 April 1987 is as follows (AB11): 
 
There is a left elbow stump of 22cm long as measured from the left elbow crease. There is a 16-cm scar at distal end of the stump. There is also wasting of the left elbow stump by 3cm as compared and measured 15cm from distal elbow crease with the right.
 
 
 
As to how the accident occurred, the plaintiff`s evidence is that on the day of the accident the splats she was feeding into the machine was of an irregular size and she had to hold the jig and splats until they were quite close to the roller because of the uneven thickness of the splats or else the splats would ricochet and hit her face. As a result her left finger was caught in between the roller and the jig, and her hand was dragged in.
During cross-examination it was suggested to the plaintiff that her finger got caught in between the roller and the jig because she was inattentive and had turned her head elsewhere. It was also suggested to the plaintiff that she was not unconscious after the accident.
In her cross-examination, the plaintiff was referred to the second photograph in AB45 which shows the position of an operator with outstretched hands pushing a jig and splats into the machine. She agreed that an operator need not push the jig and splats all the way in and it is only necessary to push them far enough to reach the roller. It was also suggested to the plaintiff that she had told DW1 at the hospital that the accident happened because she was looking elsewhere.
The evidence of Aziz bin Tecklan (DW1), the defendants` foreman in charge of the department where the plaintiff was working, is that the plaintiff is a production operator at the factory and all production operators have to carry out duties which the chargehand requires them to do and that includes operating the machines at the factory. The defendants` factory produces wooden furniture and every production operator has to work on a machine. New recruits are given light duties first and are then trained to use the machines. The chargehand and sometimes the foreman will show them how to operate the machines. There are different types of machines and a worker has to go through different machines.
DW1`s evidence is that the plaintiff had been using a copy shaper machine for about six months. The plaintiff was the permanent operator of another copy shaper machine which is similar to the machine BL39 except that the roller of the machine BL39 is operated by an air compressor whereas weights are used for the purpose of operating the roller of the other machine. Of the two machines, the machine BL39 is the newer model and it has been installed in the factory for six to eight years and this is the first time an accident of this nature had happened involving this machine. On the day of the accident, the operator of machine BL39 was on leave and if she was not on leave then the plaintiff would have been working at her own machine.
DW1 referred to two photographs in AB44 and another two photographs in AB45 which show what happens when an operator feeds a jig and splats into the machine. He said the splats are placed in a recessed area in the jig and it is not necessary for an operator to push the jig and splats all the way in. When the jig and splats reach the roller, the air compressor or the weights will cause the roller to press down onto the jig and splats. At that point of time the operator can release both jig and splats and both the jig and splats will be automatically drawn towards the cutting blade of the machine. According to him the operator can release her hands at a distance of between 26 to 28cm away from the roller.
At the time of the accident, DW1 said he was about 30ft away from the machine BL39 attending to his own work. He rushed to the plaintiff`s aid when he heard her screams. He alleged that she was conscious at the time of the accident and he brought her to a private clinic about 50ft away from the factory. DW1 and the plaintiff`s sister who was also working in the same factory accompanied the plaintiff to the hospital in an ambulance.
DW1 alleged that at the hospital ward on the day of the accident he asked the plaintiff what happened and the plaintiff told him that the accident occurred because she was looking elsewhere. DW1 also told the court that the splats given to the plaintiff for cutting by the copy shaper machine are of a particular design for a particular backrest of a chair. They are of the same width and length. They are produced by machines in the factory. The splats will not ricochet when they are being cut by the copy shaper machine.
Mr Chew Kok Hwa (PW2), who was a factory inspector with the Ministry of Labour, gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff. His evidence is that on 12 March 1986 he visited the factory to investigate the cause of the accident and his report is at AB1 to AB9. When he examined the machine BL39, he considered it a dangerous machine. Although a topguard was provided for the machine, the in-running nip point of the roller was not securely guarded. The topguard and the nip point are shown in the diagram in appendix 6 of his report (AB9). PW2 was of the opinion that the nip point could have been properly secured by lowering the top guard or extending it to reduce the 5cm gap shown in AB9. He said the defendants took steps to cover the nip point after the accident. This was done by installing an additional guard to cover the exposed area. Its effect is to reduce the 5cm gap and yet allowing the jig and splats to be pushed towards the roller. During cross-examination, PW2 agreed that an operator can release her hold on the jig and splats when they reach the roller and that means that an operator`s hands can be released when they are almost 2ft away from the roller.
Paragraph 7(a) of PW2`s report of the accident states that the plaintiff had admitted that `she might be inattentive when operating the machine BL39`. Paragraph 7(b) of that report states: 
 
The injured had been working with the company since 22 March 1985. She was taught by the chargehand, Shamsudin, to operate all the various machinery including the copy shaper machine BL39. She faced no problems operating the machine prior to the accident.
 
 
 
What actually happened on the morning of 11 March 1986? The evidence given by the plaintiff did not give any explanation of how her hand went into the machine. Was she inattentive, as she had admitted to DW1 and as stated in the report of PW2? Did her fingers somehow get caught in between the splats? Did the accident happen because she had to hold onto the jig and splats a little longer than usual because the splats she was feeding into the machine were of irregular size?
On a balance of probabilities and having heard and seen the witnesses and having studied the report of PW2 and the photographs marked as exhs P1 to P6, I am satisfied and find that the accident happened as a result of the inattentiveness of the plaintiff. The machine had been used in the defendant`s factory for six to eight years and no one was injured prior to the plaintiff`s mishap. The roller and the cutters are visible to the operator. No doubt it is a dangerous machine and an operator`s hand will be severed if it is placed in the cutting zone. The evidence before me shows that an operator can release her hands from the jig and splats when they are about 2ft from the roller. I find that the plaintiff is familiar with the operations of this machine as she had worked on it previously and she is also the operator of the other copy shaper machine.
The defendants admit a breach of regulations against fencing of the machine but they contended that there is contributory negligence on the part of the plaintiff because the accident occurred as a result of her inattentiveness. The question which I have to decide is whether the inattentiveness on the part of the plaintiff constitutes contributory negligence as we understand that expression.
In support of his contention that the plaintiff is guilty of contributory negligence, Mr Benedict Chan, counsel for the defendants, referred to a digest of three cases on negligence in Bingham`s 
 Cases on Negligence 
: 
Boyle v Kodak Ltd
 
[1969] 2 All ER 439
 
Crawford v Erection Services
 
[1953] CA 254
 and 
Taylor v Cass
 
[1945] CA 262
 He submitted that the first two cases show that where there is a danger which a plaintiff should have seen then he will have to be responsible if he does not take steps to avoid it. In our instant case, he submitted that the plaintiff, knowing where spindles are, ought to have released her hands when they were about 1ft away from the roller and if she does not, then she will have to bear at least part of the blame for this accident.
Mr Chan also referred to 
 Mohamed Husin v Shum Yip Leong Rubber Works Lt 
 
d
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 17
  where the plaintiff was injured and the court held that the defendant failed to provide a safe system of work for their workers and there was a breach of statutory regulations to provide a guard or fencing for the machine in question. It was held in that case that the inadvertence on the part of the plaintiff did not go so far as to constitute contributory negligence on his part. Mr Chan distinguished that case as follows. Firstly, there was a complete failure of the defendant in that case to provide a guard. That accident happened not because the plaintiff was careless or inadvertent. The accident happened because his co-worker pulled the sheet towards himself and therefore drew the plaintiff`s hands into the cutting zone and used his foot to press a pedal to release the cutter, and he did so without giving the plaintiff any warning of his intention to drop the cutter. In that case, the plaintiff could not be blamed in any way for the accident. He did not know his co-worker would depress the pedal without warning, which he had been giving all the time. In our instant case we have only one operator. She is responsible for allowing her hand to get close to the danger zone of the machine BL39.
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that mere carelessness on the part of the plaintiff does not amount to contributory negligence. He contended that the machine BL39 was a dangerous machine and it was not fenced. It has only a felt cloth which the factory inspector (PW2) said was ineffective. If the machine was adequately fenced, the plaintiff`s finger would not have been caught between the roller and the jig and therefore her hand would not have come into contact with the cutter.
The evidence of PW2 is that the machine is a dangerous machine. PW2`s evidence is that although there was a topguard and a piece of felt cloth which served as a fence, they were both inadequate as a guard. PW2 also said that after the accident, the defendants took steps to cover the nip point of the roller by installing an additional guard to cover the exposed area of the machine. The effect of the additional guard is to reduce the 5-cm gap between the top of the jig and the previous guard so that the jig and splats can be inserted into the machine without allowing the operator`s hand to be dragged in towards the cutter.
Counsel for the plaintiff referred to the following passage in 
 Mohamed Husin v Shum Yip Leong Rubber Works Lt 
 
d
 
 
[1972] 1 MLJ 17
  [at p 20] in support of his contention that mere carelessness of the plaintiff does not amount to contributory negligence; 
 
I respectfully adopt and apply the same principles to the instant case. In doing so I have not overlooked the fact that a careful and attentive operator would not have allowed his fingers to be drawn to the danger zone or allowed them to remain momentarily too long under the cutter but an employer is bound under the Machinery Regulations to guard against such inadvertence of an employee who is subjected to the dull monotony of constant repetition of the same movement and by fatigue of continuous concentration. Should such inadvertence occur the employee might find his fingers in immediate danger of being amputated by the cutter. It is to avoid such danger caused by such inadvertence that the Machinery Regulations required the employer to erect a guard or fence to prevent them from reaching the danger zone. As pointed out by Ong J (as he then was) that the Machinery Regulations `requiring dangerous machinery to be securely fenced are not confined in their application only to the ""prudent, alert and skilled operator intent upon his task, but also to the careless or inattentive worker whose inadvertent or indolent conduct may expose him to risk of injury or death from the unguarded part"".`: See 
 Lim Thong Eng v Sungei Choh Rubber Co Ltd
 [ 
 
 
[1962] MLJ 15
  at p 16]. I therefore hold that such inadvertence as there was on the part of the plaintiff in this instant case did not go so far as to constitute negligence, contributory or otherwise, of which the court should take cognizance.
 
 
 
In my view, the defendants in our instant case must assume 100% liability for the accident for the reason stated in the above-mentioned passage. Here the defenadmit a breach of statutory regulations requiring an employer to fence a dangerous machine which are, in my view, intended to protect both an alert or careless operator from sustaining injuries. In our instant case, the plaintiff held on to the jig and splats momentarily too long which resulted in her finger being caught in between the roller and the jig. The evidence of PW2 is that the existing topguard is inadequate. Had the topguard been extended before the accident took place, the plaintiff would not, in my view, have lost her hand.
In 
 Boyle v Kodak Lt 
 
d
 
[1969] 2 All ER 439
 the House of Lords did not find that the employee was guilty of contributory negligence. The headnote to the report reads: 
 
On a claim for damages for breach of statutory duty, an employer to avoid liability must show that he has complied with his statutory duty by taking all reasonable steps to prevent his employees from committing breaches of the relevant regulations. Thus, if the employer ought to have realized that there was a substantial risk that skilled workmen would not be sufficiently familiar with the regulations imposing a statutory duty on them, in situations where no danger was apparent, it would be his duty under the regulations to instruct the workmen on what steps they must take to avoid a breach. This duty exists even where failure to give such instructions did not amount to negligence at common law.
 
 
 
At p 440, Lord Reid said: 
 
The doctrine of absolute liability, which was invented by the courts, can lead to absurd results when coupled with the employer`s vicarious liability. It would be absurd if, notwithstanding the employer having done all he could reasonably be expected to do to ensure compliance, a workman, who deliberately disobeyed his employer`s orders and thereby put the employer in breach of a regulation, could claim damages for injury caused to him solely by his own wrongdoing. So the courts have quite properly introduced a qualification of the employer`s absolute liability. A principle of law has been established that, although in general the employer is under absolute liability in respect of such a breach, the employer may have a defence to an action against him by an employee who is also in breach.
 
 
 
Further at p 441 he said: 
 
In my opinion, these and other cases show that, once the plaintiff has established that there was a breach of an enactment which made the employer absolutely liable, and that that breach caused the accident, he need do no more. But it is then open to the employer to set up a defence that in fact he was not in any way in fault but that the plaintiff employee was alone to blame. That does not mean that the employer must lead evidence, he may be able to prove this from the evidence for the plaintiff, but I do not think that I went too far in 
 Ross
`s case [[1964] 2 All ER 454; [1964] 1 WLR 775] in saying that he
 
 
 
`cannot complain if in those circumstances the most favourable inferences are drawn from the appellant`s evidence of which it is reasonably capable.`
 
 
 
The judgment of Lord Reid in 
 Boyle v Kodak Lt 
 
d
 
[1969] 2 All ER 439
 made it clear that an employer who is not at fault can set up the defence of contributory negligence. In our instant case the employer is at fault in that he had failed to comply with the statutory regulations on fencing of dangerous machinery.
In 
Crawford v Erection Services
 
[1953] CA 254
 the plaintiff used a faulty suspension rope for a scaffold. The defendants were held to be in breach of building regulations in that they had done nothing to indicate a better rope was available. The court held that the plaintiff should have seen the defect and that the defendants are 50% liable. In our instant case, the topguard and the felt cloth were inadequate. The plaintiff was not given a choice of using a machine with proper fencing.
I now deal with the damages which the defendants have to pay. By consent the plaintiff`s transport expenses for seeking medical treatment is fixed at $600. On the cost of fixing an artificial limb Mr Chan suggested $13,000 and the plaintiff`s counsel accepted this amount.
On general damages, the plaintiff`s counsel suggested the sum of $45,000. He cited 
Wong Yee Cheong & Anor v Toh Seng Chuan
 
 [1988] 2 MLJ xxx 
 where the award for 
 
 
(a) amputation of right arm at mid-arm level above the elbow is $50,000; and 
 
(b) brachial plexus injury to the left arm rendering the portion of the wrist functionless is $40,000.
  
 
 
He also referred to the case of 
 Ong Moh Chong v Hitachi Chemical (S) Pte Lt 
 
d
 
 
[1987] 1 MLJ 450
  where a sum of $30,000 was awarded as damages for pain and suffering to a plaintiff who lost three fingers. He submitted that a sum of $45,000 would be reasonable considering the plaintiff`s loss of marriage prospects.
Mr Chan suggested a figure of $30,000. He cited the cases of

 He submitted that the plaintiff has not lost the use of a whole arm. This award should also take into account a claim for loss of marriage prospects.
Having regard to the suggestions of both counsel and the authorities cited, I award the sum of $35,000 for general damages.
For loss of future earnings, the plaintiff`s counsel suggested a sum of $50,000. He relied on 
 Ong Moh Chong 
`s case6 where a lump sum of $45,000 was awarded for loss of future earnings. He also referred to 
 Wong Yee Cheong 
`s case5 where the court used a multiplicand of $200 [times ] 22 years and arrived at an amount of $164,274 as the award for loss of future earnings. On pre-trial loss, the plaintiff`s counsel submitted that the plaintiff has a psychological problem in continuing to work at defendants` factory. He submitted that it should commence from January 1987 to date of trial at $300 per month.
For loss of earnings, Mr Chan submitted that the plaintiff had been paid until the time she resigned. Mr Chan submitted that the plaintiff should not be given anything by way of loss of earnings from the date of resignation until the trial. The court heard evidence that the defendants were prepared to retain the plaintiff and the defendant had in fact retained several other people who were injured. The plaintiff did not deny that the defendants offered her continued employment and the defendants are not obliged to pay plaintiffs who fail to mitigate their losses. Mr Chan also cited 
 Ong Moh Chong 
`s case.6 Since the plaintiff was earning $300 per month at the time of the accident, he submitted that it is not difficult for the plaintiff to secure a job at a comparable salary. In making this award the court must take into account the fact that the plaintiff is an unskilled worker. She may not work after marriage. The next job may also be an unskilled job. He suggested a sum of $15,000.
Having regard to the submissions of both counsel and the authorities cited by them, I award the sum of $25,000 which in my opinion is fair compensation for loss of future earnings as well as loss of employer`s CPF contributions for the lost earnings. I am not making any award for pre-trial loss of earnings since the plaintiff resigned from her employment even though the defendants offered to continue to employ her.
Accordingly there will be judgment for the plaintiff in the total sum of $73,600 and costs and interest at the rate of 6% on the sum of $48,600 to be taxed from the date of issue of the writ to the date of judgment. I also order that the sum of $35,000 paid into court by the defendants be paid out to the solicitors for the plaintiff, Messrs Bala & Co.

This appeal involved the assessment of damages for pre-trial loss of earnings and loss of future earnings arising out of a road accident on 17 July 1984 between a motor scooter ridden by the appellant and a motor pickup driven by the first respondent as the servant or agent of the second respondent. The appellant`s left leg was seriously injured in the accident, there being both dislocated joints and fractured bones in his left foot. The injuries caused him pain when he walked or stood for a long time. He was hospitalized for 20 days, and was on medical leave for a further 21/2 months and on light duty for another five months.
The respondents accepted liability on the basis of a 30% deduction for contributory negligence on the part of the appellant. The only dispute between the parties was as to the quantum of damages.
The appellant was 40 years old at the time of the accident. He held two jobs: from 8am to 4.30pm he worked as a chainsaw operator with the Housing and Development Board (`HDB`); from 9pm to 4am the next morning he worked as a security guard for Jensen Security Service. His assigned place of work was the Apollo Nite Club. He had been working at a second job (in addition to his job with the HDB) for four to five years: for about a year as a hawker`s assistant and thereafter as a security guard. Managing on a mere four hours` sleep a night, he explained that he had taken up a second job to supplement his meagre income. As a security guard, his monthly earnings were $200 salary, $60 allowance, and $160 tips. He was able to resume his daytime employment with the HDB in January 1985, half a year after the accident. However, the pain from his injuries made it impossible for him to also continue with his job as a security guard. It was in respect of the loss of this job as a security guard that he claimed damages for pre-trial loss of earnings and loss of future earnings.
At the trial in the district court, the trial judge awarded, inter alia, damages of $10,920 ($15,600 gross) for loss of future earnings based on a multiplicand of $260 per month for 5 years and $7,966 ($11,380 gross) for pre-trial loss of earnings. As a component of the damages for pre-trial loss of earnings, the sum of $100 a month for 28 months was attributed to tips which the appellant would have received as a security guard at the Apollo Nite Club, had it not been for the accident.
The respondents appealed to the High Court against the award of damages for loss of future earnings and the award of tips as part of pre-trial loss of earnings. The appeal was heard by Sinnathuray J, who varied the trial judge`s order by (i) deducting the allowance of $60 per month for transport and laundry (which was conceded by counsel for the appellant) and (ii) substituting a lump sum award of $4,200 ($6,000 gross) for loss of earning capacity for the trial judge`s award of $10,920 ($15,600 gross) for loss of future earnings. He declined to disallow or reduce the sum awarded for tips.
The appellant then appealed to the Court of Appeal on the basis that the district court`s award for loss of future earnings should not have been varied. He also sought to appeal against the award of $100 per month for tips, on the basis that $160 a month should have been awarded.
 Pre-trial loss of earnings
Before us counsel for the appellant submitted that as a figure of $160 per month for tips had been established by the evidence, both the trial judge and appeal judge were wrong to only award $100 per month in respect of tips. We did not think that this point was really open to the appellant. The amount awarded by the trial judge for pre-trial loss of earnings included the figure of $100 for tips, and counsel for the appellant did not challenge the valuation of tips in the High Court, where he was the respondent. He filed no respondent`s notice to the effect that the sum of $100 per month was too low and the matter was not raised in argument. On the contrary, he supported it as being correct. In our opinion, it is not open to the appellant to challenge in the Court of Appeal what he had supported in the appeal before the High Court.
 Loss of future earnings
The learned trial judge applied a multiplier of 5 years to a multiplicand of $260 (the appellant`s monthly income) and awarded $10,920 ($15,600 gross). In selecting the multiplier, he took into account the appellant`s age (43 at the time of the trial) and the fact that the appellant had worked very hard at a second job for four to five years before the accident.
On appeal, Sinnathuray J in the High Court substituted for this an award of $4,200 (based on a lump sum of $6,000 gross) for loss of earning capacity instead of using the multiplier/multiplicand method employed by the trial judge to calculate loss of future earnings. He justified his decision to reduce the damages awarded and to assess them on a lump sum basis on two grounds: first, that damages were to be assessed for the loss of a `part-time` job, and second, that the respondent had failed to mitigate his loss.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that Sinnathuray J, as an appellate judge, should only have disturbed the trial judge`s assessment of damages in very limited circumstances, which were absent here. He referred us to the cases of 
 Flint 
 
 v 
 
 Lovell 
 1 and 
 Nance 
 
 v 
 
 British Columbia Electric Railway Co Ltd 
 .2 We were also referred to 
 Davies 
 
 v 
 
 Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd 
 ,3 where Lord Wright stated (at p 616): 
 
In effect the court, before it interferes with an award of damages, should be satisfied that the judge has acted on a wrong principle of law, or has misapprehended the facts, or has for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage suffered.
 
 
 
We noted that the learned trial judge had taken into account the fact that the appellant worked at two jobs in arriving at the multiplier of 5 years. Furthermore, his written grounds of judgment showed that he had fully considered the evidence and arguments on the question of mitigation of loss. He stated: 
 
Counsel for the defence submits that the plaintiff has not mitigated his losses. I consider the plaintiff`s evidence that he has tried to look for part-time jobs which would not affect his left foot. He had also read the papers to look for suitable jobs. Since he only has primary 5 education in the Chinese stream and has no skill he was not able to get any suitable sedentary job (pp 5, 6 and 13 of the notes of evidence). In the words of the consultant, the plaintiff `has done well to return to the first job`. The learned defence counsel`s submission on mitigation of losses has therefore no merit.
 
 
 
While Sinnathuray J accepted that the appellant could not continue working as a security guard, he was of the opinion, however, that the appellant should have mitigated damages and taken up a job as a hawker. We were unable to agree with this. There was nothing in the evidence which suggested that it would be easier to be a hawker than to be a security guard. On the contrary, the uncontradicted medevidence was that it would be difficult for the appellant to take up the job of a hawker, and that the appellant had done well to return to his full-time job with the HDB.
Before us counsel for the respondents took the additional point that the appellant could have worked in a sedentary job such as that of a lift operator. Neither could we accept this contention. The appellant could only have pursued a second job in the evening and the early hours of the morning. It was highly unlikely, and at best speculative, that there are vacancies for lift operators after office hours. Nor were we persuaded that the appellant could have obtained another job as a security guard which would not require him to walk or even stand. Mindful that the appellant was only under a duty to act reasonably to mitigate his damages, and that whether he had done so was a question of fact, we were of the view that the trial judge`s finding on this point should not have been disturbed.
Counsel for the respondents also submitted that the lump sum award of $4,200 ($6,000 gross) for loss of future earnings provided adequate compensation for the appellant. On the other hand, counsel for the appellant submitted that the appellant had a steady monthly income which provided a firm basis for calculating his loss of future earnings. We accepted the submission of counsel for the appellant, there being nothing in the present case to make an arbitrary lump sum assessment more appropriate than the multiplier/multiplicand method. We did not find the damages awarded by the trial judge to be excessive. Accordingly, we restored the trial judge`s award of $10,920 net ($15,600 gross) for loss of future earnings, and made the necessary consequential orders. The appellant was awarded costs here and below.

The accused, Lim Tee Hian, was charged before me with the offence under s 306 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`) of having abetted the suicide of one Yvonne Lim Poh Yian (`the deceased`) by instigating her to and she did fall to her death from a flat known as Block 39 Chai Chee Avenue, #09-23, Singapore at about 3.30pm on Tuesday, 16 June 1987. That flat was the residence of the accused. He claimed trial. At the conclusion of a ten-day trial, I convicted him of the offence as charged and sentenced him to a term of eight years` imprisonment with effect from 7 February 1991.
The gravamen of the case for the prosecution was that the accused had instigated the deceased, a naive and trusting girl who he knew loved him deeply enough to sacrifice herself, to commit suicide, which he would mask or make to appear as an accidental death, in a scheme to defraud two insurance companies of $500,000 under two policies which he had in early June 1987 procured on the life of the deceased.
The deceased was 22 years old when she died. She was employed as a receptionist at Hollandse Club in Camden Park, off Adam Road (`the club`) from 13 October 1983 until her death. Her last pay was $420 per month. It was at her work place that she first met the accused who worked in the club as a part-time waiter for only the last two days of August 1984. According to the general manager of the club, the deceased was able to handle her work; she was a pleasant and quiet girl who did not talk much. According to records of the club, the deceased had reported for work at 7.57am on 16 June 1987 and left work at about 3.02pm. The general manager learnt of her death at about 5.30pm.
The prosecution also led the evidence of another colleague of the deceased, Jenny Khoo Geok Choo (`PW10`), who worked in the club since 1979. She did not give evidence at the preliminary inquiry and accordingly the prosecution gave notice thereof under s 188(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). She knew the deceased for about two to three years. She recalled that on the morning of 15 June 1987, she saw the deceased crying while talking over the telephone. She again saw the deceased crying at about 2.30pm on 16 June 1987. She saw that the deceased`s eyes were red. She knew the accused was the boyfriend of the deceased. This witness expressed the view that the deceased was a very naive, simple-minded girl. Jenny Khoo said in evidence that the deceased had told her a few months before her death that the accused was a President`s Scholar and was reading accountancy in the National University of Singapore (`NUS`). She said she did not believe this story as she knew that those scholars mostly read medicine. This witness told the court that she had made a statement to the police three years before her appearance in court but she was not called to give evidence.
In June 1987, the family of the deceased lived at Block 166 Bukit Batok West, Avenue 8, #04-256, Singapore. According to her mother, Soh Ah Huay, a housewife, the deceased was the youngest of three children. The deceased was educated in English at Swiss Cottage Primary School and Whitley Secondary School. She left school while in Secondary Two. In 1984, the deceased confided in her that she had a boyfriend at the club. She told the mother that he was an orphan and was a university student on a scholarship. In 1985, Madam Soh met the accused. He told her that he was studying in the NUS and that he was living with his elder brother. His elder brother used to bring friends to the home and they were quite noisy, as a result of which he had to study in the void deck. Madam Soh took pity on the accused and told the deceased to invite him to live with them. The accused declined her invitation, although he had spent nights at her home. The deceased and the accused slept in the hall; she on a collapsible bed and he on a mattress on the floor. Madam Soh testified that her daughter was a filial daughter; that she usually stayed at home if she was not working. She did not know how much her daughter was earning but her daughter used to give her $150 per month as her contributions to the household expenses. The deceased used to be very happy whenever the accused visited her; she never had any other boyfriend. In November 1985, she gave $400 to the deceased who wanted to give it to the accused who said he had lost some diving equipment of a friend which he had to replace. On 10 December 1985, the deceased asked her mother for another loan of $900. She told the mother that the accused needed it to buy books. Madam Soh agreed and gave the loan.
In January 1986, the deceased again asked her mother for a loan of $5,800. She told the mother that the accused was going overseas for further studies and needed the sum of $10,000 as a deposit to pay to the government. The deceased indicated that the accused had borrowed $5,000 from his friends. The deceased also told her mother that the accused would repay the loan within two months after he had sold his flat in Tanglin Halt. Madam Soh agreed and also agreed with the deceased not to inform the other members of the family as the accused did not want it to be known. Madam Soh had worked in an electronics company known as Honeywell Electronics. She was retrenched and she received about $9,000 which she had saved in her POSB account from which either Madam Soh or the deceased could withdraw. Her account at that time showed a credit balance of $9,890.67. She handed the POSB book to the deceased. When it was returned to her, she found that the deceased had withdrawn $6,000 instead. Madam Soh did not make an issue of this. The deceased appeared happy at that time.
In mid 1986, the deceased again asked the mother for a loan of $20,000 which the accused required. Madam Soh refused. She said she was angry that the accused had not gone overseas to study and yet was asking for another bigger loan. After her refusal the accused did not visit her home; the deceased was angry with the mother. The deceased said she was going to move out to live with the accused. She advised her against it and the deceased did not move out.
One morning at about 4am in October 1986, Madam Soh found the deceased lying semi-conscious in the hall next to the telephone with its handset off the hook. The deceased was drowsy. Madam Soh replaced the handset and tried to wake the deceased up. Shortly, the telephone rang. It was Veronica Tan Puay Leng (`PW8`), a very good friend of the deceased, at the other end of the line. The sister of the deceased, Lim Poh Kim (`PW9`), answered the phone. Veronica Tan asked her to check on her sister. She was worried that something might have happened; that her sister had done something silly. Lim Poh Kim later learnt that her sister had taken 12 sleeping tablets. The deceased recovered and was discharged from hospital after a short stay. Lim Poh Kim told the court that the deceased, after her discharge from hospital, told her that she found out that the accused was already married with a son and that his wife was actually the girlfriend of his brother; that his brother had made her pregnant; and that he had married his wife to help her out. The obvious suggestion was that it was a marriage of convenience and that the accused did not love his wife. The deceased further stated that the accused had told her that he and his wife were getting a divorce later. Lim Poh Kim then advised the deceased to have nothing further to do with the accused. She knew that the deceased had broken off with the accused for a while. But the deceased and the accused were reconciled a few months prior to the death of the deceased.
In connection with this incident, the deceased was interviewed by Mrs K Naban (`PW2`), the senior medical social worker attached to the Alexandra Hospital. The deceased denied that she had attempted suicide. She said she had a misunderstanding with her boyfriend and that led to a quarrel. She suffered from insomnia and she took an overdose of sleeping pills to have a good sleep. The deceased refused to divulge the nature of the quarrel nor the identity of her boyfriend.
The deceased had a very close friend, Veronica Tan Puay Leng (`PW8`), a private tutor, who she had befriended in 1982. Since 1984 Veronica knew that the accused was the boyfriend of the deceased. The deceased had told her that the accused had no parents and that he was a university student. She said that at about 2am one morning in October 1986, the deceased telephoned her. The deceased was crying and told her that the accused had another woman and was living with her. The deceased was very sad. Veronica advised the deceased to forget about him but she said she could not. Then, suddenly, the line was cut off; she was worried and kept dialling. Finally, the phone rang and the deceased`s mother came on the phone. Veronica told her that the deceased might have some problem and advised her to take care of the deceased. Later, she was told by the deceased that she had taken some sleeping tablets; that she wanted to commit suicide because she thought she was losing the accused. The deceased had also told Veronica that she had been giving money to the accused for his studies in the university and that she had borrowed money from her mother to give to him.
Veronica then recounted what the deceased had told her in a telephone conversation on or about 9 June 1987. The deceased told her that she was very worried over the safety of the accused. The deceased told her that some gangsters were looking for him over a debt of $200,000 which was incurred by the accused`s employers. The deceased did not explain why in that case the accused was responsible for the debt. Veronica said she advised the deceased not to believe the accused as he could be bluffing her. The deceased did not heed her advice. She told Veronica that she trusted the accused and that the accused would not bluff her.
Veronica also testified that the deceased had, in a conversation with her in June 1987, told her of a dream. The deceased told her that in that dream she saw a person, who looked like the accused, in danger and that she had to sacrifice her life for him. The deceased then told Veronica that she would sacrifice herself to help the accused out of his danger. Veronica advised the deceased to forget about the matter as it was only a dream. She said that the deceased sounded very worried when narrating the dream to her.
According to Veronica, she spoke to the deceased at about 9.30am on 16 June 1987. The deceased had called her from her office. She was crying. She told Veronica that a group of gangsters wanted to kill the accused if he refused to sign an IOU for a debt of $200,000. Veronica told her not to believe the accused but the deceased said that she trusted him as she had seen blue-black marks around his mouth. According to Veronica that was the last time she spoke to the deceased. Veronica was subsequently informed by the sister of the deceased that the deceased had died. Veronica described the deceased as `very naive; very easy to believe people`.
When cross-examined, Veronica confirmed that what she had told the court was exactly what had transpired between her and the deceased. She agreed she could not verify the truth of what the deceased had told her; but she said that to her what the deceased had told her about the debt, the threat of the gangsters and the dream was a coincidence and that was why she decided to tell the police about these matters. She revealed during the cross-examination that she in fact had an argument with the deceased over the deceased`s willingness to trust the accused. When I asked her, Veronica told me that she did not know how the death of the deceased could help the accused. She said the deceased did not tell her anything about this question.
The prosecution then led evidence that two insurance policies were purchased in early June 1987 from Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd and NTUC Income on the life of the deceased. The total sum assured in the two life policies was $250,000; there was the additional $250,000 coverage for comprehensive accidents and benefit on the life of the deceased. The accused was named as the sole beneficiary in these policies. Evidence was also led that the accused paid in cash the initial premiums of $1,163.95 payable under the two policies.
Under the NTUC Income policy, exh P42, which took effect from 1 June 1987, it was a condition of the policy that the policy would be void if the life assured committed suicide within 12 months of the issuance of the policy. The Great Eastern Life Assurance Policy, exh P54, which commenced on 3 June 1987, provided under section III exception 1 that the benefits under the policy would not apply if the death of the life assured should result, either directly or indirectly, from suicide.
Cary Pang Tuck Cheong (`PW12`) was the insurance agent of Great Eastern Life Assurance. In March or April 1987, he got in touch with the accused to revive a policy issued to him by his company which had lapsed on 2 September 1986. He also tried to interest him in taking out a child education policy. Neither the accused nor his wife, who Cary Pang contacted, revived the policy in question nor take up the policy on education. However, in May 1987, the accused got in touch with him and in a telephone conversation the accused asked him the amount of premium payable for a $500,000 life policy. Cary Pang told the accused it was about 2% of the sum insured per year. The accused told Cary Pang that one of his girlfriends wanted to take up a policy and that she did not want the proceeds to go to her family. According to Cary Pang the accused further told him that this girlfriend had seen a fortune-teller who predicted that some misfortune might befall her and that she did not want the proceeds to go to her family. The accused also posed him the hypothetical question as to what he should do if he were to take out a policy and did not intend the proceeds to go to his family. Cary Pang advised him to dispose of the proceeds by a will or by an absolute assignment. The accused told Cary Pang that he would get back to him after discussing the matter with his girlfriend.
They later met on 29 May 1987; the deceased was present. They had a discussion at a steakhouse. Initially, the discussion was on the basis that the accused himself was to be the assured. Cary Pang advised the accused that it would be much cheaper if the accused were to take up a $250,000 basic life policy together with a cover against accident of $250,000. The accused then asked about taking out a policy of $500,000 purely for accident. Cary Pang then told the accused that it was not his company`s policy to issue a policy purely for accident; it has to be issued in conjunction with a life policy. Whereupon the accused indicated that he was interested to know the premium for a $100,000 policy on life and $500,000 for accident. He made the calculations of the premium payable and told the accused about them. The accused found the premium acceptable. He then told Cary Pang, in the first instance, to do the papers for effecting the policy on the life of the deceased. He indicated that he would himself take up a similar policy at the end of the month. Cary Pang then took out the medical proposal form for the deceased to sign; he also took out the assignment form which the deceased and the accused signed in his presence. The deceased signed against the phrase `signature of assignor and the accused signed against the phrase `signature of assignee`. The assignment form did not contain the particulars when it was signed by the deceased; and, as will become clear later, they were filled in by a clerk of the company after the transaction, on different terms, was agreed upon. The assignment form was admitted as exh P48. They then agreed to meet again on 30 May 1987 for her medical examination which, however, was not carried out on that day as there was a long queue.
Cary Pang checked with his superiors in the company the proposals of the insurances for $100,000 on life and $500,000 against accidents. He told his superior, one Tan Peng Chye, that the boyfriend was paying the premium. Cary Pang said he was told that the company would be more comfortable with an insurance covering $150,000 for life and the same amount for accident. Cary Pang passed on the counter-proposals to the accused and told the accused that the deceased was not required to undergo a medical examination. The accused was angry. He raised his voice and told Cary Pang that he would reconsider the counter-proposal. Cary Pang paged for the accused who later told him that the deceased would take up the policy in view of the trouble Cary Pang had taken over the matter. They agreed to meet on 1 June 1987. At about 2pm on 1 June 1987, the deceased telephoned Cary Pang and told him that she would like to pay for the premium and asked for the amount of the premium for a quarter of the year.
At about 4pm the accused and the deceased called on Cary Pang at his office. At this meeting, the accused said that he was told about s 73 of what Cary Pang understood to be the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61). He advised the accused that that section would apply to married couples and that in the case where the assured and the beneficiary are not married, the best way to make the gift of the insurance proceeds was by an absolute assignment. The deceased then signed the new application form, which was admitted as exh P47. Cary Pang said that the information there was transferred from the earlier proposal form of 29 May 1987. Cary Pang transferred every information, including the date of the signature of the deceased, although the deceased had signed the new proposal form on 1 June 1987. The information was given on the earlier occasion by the deceased in the presence of the accused. The deceased said she would pay the premium on a quarterly basis. Cary Pang told her that the premium in that case was $908.45. The accused then took out a $1,000 note and handed it to the deceased saying to her in Mandarin that he was lending her the money and that she could pay him back later. On 2 June 1987, Cary Pang submitted the proposal form and the absolute assignment to his company for processing. He was told that the assignment could be dealt with only after the issue of the policy. On the same day, he sent the receipt and the interim cover certificate (exh `P51`) to the accused. Cary Pang said he was informed by the police on 18 June 1987 that the deceased had died. When cross-examined, Cary Pang said that the accused did most of the talking and that the deceased appeared quite happy with the arrangements. He said he was not wary when the accused first discussed the insurance proposals. But Cary Pang said in answer to counsel for the accused that the accused raised the level of his voice when he told him in terms that his company felt something `fishy` about the initial insurance proposals. Counsel for the accused put to Cary Pang that the accused had on 22 July 1987 made a statutory declaration renouncing `all and any interest` in the policy issued by the Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd.
The circumstances under which the accused had effected the NTUC Income policy of $100,000 for life and $100,000 for accident were narrated by Jerome Lee Kok Keng (`PW14`). Jerome Lee, an insurance agent of NTUC Income, attended to the accused and the deceased at about 1.10pm on 1 June 1987. The accused wanted to buy a life policy for her and asked what the maximum cover NTUC Income was offering without her having to undergo a medical examination. He also enquired whether the policy could take effect immediately upon payment of the premium. Jerome Lee said that the maximum cover was $100,000 as the deceased was under 35 years old. He told the accused that the policy would take effect only from the date of the letter of acceptance which would be issued after acceptance of the proposal and payment of the premium. The accused was not satisfied, remarking that other insurance companies such as Great Eastern Life were different. He said the accused appeared to know a lot about life insurance and even surprised him by bringing up s 73 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act (Cap 61). The accused also asked for the nominee form. They met again in the same afternoon at about 5.30pm. Jerome Lee explained the policies available. The accused then asked about cover for accidents. Eventually, Jerome Lee completed the paper work and the accused paid in cash $255.50 being two months` premium for the policies of $100,000 on the life of the deceased and $100,000 for any accidental death of the deceased. The deceased signed the nominee form (exh `P43`) on 1 June 1987 under which the accused was to receive 100% of all sums payable under the policy. The accused asked Jerome Lee to post the receipt to his address; and the deceased also told Jerome Lee to do that as she did not want her family to know about the policy.
Evidence was led on what transpired between the deceased and her mother and her elder sister during the two days before her death and on what the accused had told the mother when he telephoned at about 5pm on 16 June 1987 to report the death and what the accused had told the mother when he visited the home of the deceased at around 6-7pm that night. On 15 June 1987, the deceased told the sister, Lim Poh Kim, that she was going to swim at the Marine Parade seaside. She also told the sister the following afternoon on the phone that she was not returning that night and that she was going to live with the accused. The sister told her to tell the mother herself. The sister, who had to go to work, asked her father to tell her mother about this. The mother returned home after work in the afternoon. Her husband told her about what the deceased had intended to do. Madam Soh then rang the deceased at the club; she remonstrated with the deceased. She was angry and told the deceased to get the accused to repay the loans. The deceased was also angry. That was the last time the mother spoke to the deceased.
At about 5pm on 16 June 1987, the accused telephoned and told the deceased`s father that his daughter had died. The father broke down and Madam Soh took over the telephone. The accused told her that the deceased had `lept from a building ... jumped from building` at Chai Chee. Madam Soh testified further that at about 6-7pm, the accused visited them at their flat. He returned to them the jewellery of the deceased. He sat at a stool near a wall at the entrance of the kitchen and banged his head against the wall. When cross-examined, Madam Soh said she was very upset and confused with grief. She admitted that the accused gave her the impression that he had nothing to do with the death of the deceased. She got the impression that her daughter had committed suicide from what the accused had told her over the telephone. She was sure that the accused did not tell her that her daughter was trying to do something at the window and accidentally fell out of the window. According to the sister of the deceased, the accused told her that the deceased had fallen out of the window.
I now turn to the evidence relating to the police investigation of the death of the deceased on the afternoon of 16 June 1987. At about 3.32pm, a male voice reported to the police in the following terms: `My girlfriend has fallen from the 10th floor`. The location stated in the first information report (exh `P27`) was Block 39 Chai Chee Avenue. PC Hamdan bin Abdul Wahid was on mobile patrol duty with DPC Goh Poh Swee. He was told to attend to a case of someone who had fallen at Block 39 Chai Chee Avenue. He arrived there at about 3.40pm. He was met by a male Chinese who later turned out to be the accused. The accused led him to the rear of the block where he saw the deceased lying in a pool of blood. DPC Goh was instructed to preserve the scene. PC Hamdan accompanied the accused to his flat. In the flat, he observed that the venetian blinds were folded up and a white foldable chair (exh `P30`) was beneath the window. He ascertained the identity of the deceased. He and the accused then went to the void deck. An ambulance arrived at the scene. Ambulance officer Seah Ai Choo examined the female Chinese and pronounced her dead. Dr Wee Keng Poh, the forensic pathologist, confirmed that the cause of death of the deceased was multiple injuries all of which were consistent with a fall from a height. He also confirmed that there was no seminal fluid in her vagina which was normal in appearance.
Under cross-examination, PC Hamdan confirmed that he saw the foldable white chair on top of a mattress which he further confirmed was near the window. During the cross-examination, it transpired that the accused had given an explanation to PC Hamdan, who was not a sergeant. It might have been exculpatory; so I invited counsel for the accused to think about it. I told him that I was willing to allow him to recall PC Hamdan to give evidence of the `explanation` of the accused if that evidence was admissible under s 122(5) read with s 122(1) of the CPC.
Cpl Tan Hock Hye arrived at the scene at about 4.45pm on 16 June 1987. He was briefed by PC Hamdan. At about 5.20pm he entered Unit #09-231 Blk 39 Chai Chee Avenue together with the accused. It was a one-room flat. He saw a white foldable chair placed below the left hand side of the window as he faced it. The window was ajar. The venetian blind was rolled up and a spool of string of the venetian blinds was placed on top of the rolled-up blinds. He observed that the blinds were slightly lower on the right end. He also saw two pieces of mattresses lying side by side on the floor near the window. He said he saw that the white foldable chair was placed on top of the mattress near the window. A photograph (exh `P5`) showing the window, the venetian blinds with a spool of string as described and the white foldable chair was produced in court. He left the scene at about 6.10pm.
At about 11.15am on 17 June 1987, Cpl Tan visited the scene again with a party of police officers, including ASP Ang Hak Seng. He directed a woman PC to dust the window for fingerprints. No fingerprints or smudges were found on the window. Half an hour later, he seized a proposal for assurance form and a conditional interim cover certificate of Great Eastern Life Assurance Co Ltd from the letterbox in the flat. He left the flat at about 12 noon. Later that day, he handed the investigation to Insp Bakurdeen A Majid (`PW15`).
It was established in cross-examination that Cpl Tan did not touch the chair to see if it was shaky. It also emerged that during his first visit to the flat on the day of the fatal fall the accused had asked Cpl Tan to dust for prints and then the accused `straightaway ... took the chair and removed it`. The accused placed the chair near a round table in the flat. Cpl Tan gave me the impression that he had no time to stop the accused from removing the chair.
Inspector Bakurdeen was instructed by the Head of Investigations, Joo Chiat Police Station, to take over the investigation of this case shortly after 3.15pm on 17 June 1987. He was briefed by AIO Tan Hock Hye. He visited the scene with ASP Ang Hock Seng. He went to the flat and met the accused at about 4.05pm. In the flat, he asked the accused as to how the deceased fell to her death. The accused took a chair from within the flat and demonstrated to Insp Bakurdeen how the deceased faced the window and tried to lower the venetian blinds and how she accidentally fell from the flat. The inspector clarified that the accused did not stand on the chair; as to where the deceased had stood, the accused pointed to the right side of the venetian blinds where the coiled spool of string was. The accused told the inspector that the deceased had stood on the chair in an attempt to uncoil the spool of string and to lower the venetian blinds when she accidentally fell out of the window. The height of the coiled spool was about 2.15m; the height of the deceased was about 1.5m. The inspector explained that he did not dust the chair for fingerprints as it had been handled. It was clear that, in any case, no adverse inference could have been drawn against the accused if his fingerprints were found on the chair as this was his home and any evidence of the presence of his fingerprints could not by itself be evidence that he had moved the chair to the window. I also noted at this stage of the trial that if the fingerprints of the deceased had been found on the chair, that could be some evidence to support the accused`s version that it was she who had taken the chair to the window. About ten minutes later, the inspector left the flat accompanied by the accused and ASP Ang. They went to the Joo Chiat Police Station.
At the police station, the accused made a voluntary statement to Insp Bakurdeen between 4.30pm and 7.15pm. The accused wanted the statement admitted and it was admitted as exh P29. I will summarize the background and quote the material parts of the statement. The accused was 23 when he made the statement. He was unemployed. He was married with a three-year-old son. He had passed `O` levels. He first met the deceased in the club. After knowing the deceased for a few weeks, he had sex with her. He did not tell the deceased that he was married. He used to visit the deceased at her flat in Bukit Batok West Avenue quite regularly. Her family did not know he was married. The deceased in 1986 borrowed $5,000 from her mother saying that he needed the money for attending a course. They later spent the money. Sometime in 1986, he told the deceased that he was married and the deceased attempted to commit suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills. She recovered at the Alexandra Hospital. Her family still did not know that he was married. His wife did not know of his affairs with the deceased. The deceased used to visit him at his Chai Chee Avenue flat whenever his wife was not around; they would have sex there.
The rest of his statement narrated the circumstances under which the insurance policies were effected. According to the accused, it was the deceased who wanted to effect the insurances and it was her wish that he should be named as the sole beneficiary. He then recounted the events leading to what the accused alleged was the accidental fatal fall of the deceased from his flat. In fairness to the accused and for the sake of completeness, I have to set out this part of the statement in extenso: 
 
5 Sometime in May 1987, Yvonne asked me if I knew anyone who sold insurance policies. I told her that she should not bother about insurance policies as we were in financial difficulties. She said that insurance could solve everybody`s problems if anything happened to her. She cited that her brother was a gambler and her father was hooked to horse betting. I discouraged her from buying insurance, however, she kept persisting that she wanted to buy a policy. After she kept persuading me, I contacted an insurance agent whom I knew named Cary Pang from the Great Eastern Ins Co. We met him somewhere in Orchard Road one day (I cannot recall the date). During the meeting, Yvonne told Cary Pang that she wanted to insure her life for $600,000, however, Cary Pang said he could only insure her for a maximum of $300,000. Yvonne agreed to the policy and I lent her $1,000 (which I borrowed from my wife) to enable her to pay the premiums. Yvonne told me that she was naming me as her beneficiary. She also told me that if anything happened to her, I should not let her brother know about the money because he liked to gamble all the while. After the policy was given to Yvonne, she handed it to me and I kept it in my letterbox because I was scared that my wife will see it (note: my wife does not have the key to the letterbox).
 
 
 
6 After about two days after buying the first insurance policy, Yvonne again told me that she wanted to buy another insurance policy from the NTUC Income. She asked me if I had any money to enable her to pay the premiums. I told her that I did not have any money. I asked her why she wanted to buy another policy. Yvonne told me that since she had bought a policy, she wanted to have another policy so that `everybody` could benefit if something happened to her. A few days later, I accompanied Yvonne to the NTUC Income office at Shaw Towers where she bought another insurance policy on her life for about $300,000. Again she named me as the sole beneficiary.
 
 
 
7 A few days later, she made enquiry from another insurance company about buying another policy. She asked me if I had any money to enable her to pay the premium. I told her that I did not have any money. She did not say anything after that and I do not know if she bought another policy.
 
 
 
8 About three weeks ago, Yvonne asked me several times whether drowning was considered as an accident or suicide. I told her that it could be considered an accident. I was suspicious of her and asked her why she was asking about such things and she said that if something happened to her everyone would benefit. I also noticed that for the past three weeks, Yvonne used to cry whenever she spoke to me on the phone. I asked her what the reason was, however, she kept saying that nothing was wrong with her. Whenever I met Yvonne, she kept asking me to accompany her for a swim. I used to tell Yvonne that I was more interested in going for a show than a swim. Yvonne kept insisting that I should accompany her for a swim, however, I refused. She then told me that she would ask her colleagues to go with her for a swim. I suspected that Yvonne was up to something no good, however, when I questioned her, she refused to say anything.
 
 
 
9 On 14 June 1987 (Sunday), I left for Johore Bahru with my wife and son for a holiday. In the evening, I called Yvonne in her house and she told me that she was going for a swim the next day at the seaside. I asked her with whom she was going for a swim. She said that she was going alone. She again told me that if anything happened to her, I should not let her brother know about the insurance policy. I knew that she was a non-swimmer and asked her if she was sure of going for a swim and she replied in the affirmative. I then hung up. On the morning of 15 June 1987 (Monday), I called Yvonne`s house from JB. Her father told me that Yvonne had gone for a swim. I sensed that something was wrong and I immediately checked out of the Merlin Tower Hotel with my family and returned to Singapore. Upon reaching Singapore, I tried calling Yvonne`s house and workplace, however, I could not get her. I finally managed to contact her at about 3.30pm. She told me that she had been to the seaside off East Coast Park earlier. She said that she jumped off from the breakwater and that a windsurfer had saved her. I asked her what she was actually trying to do, however, she said that she was doing nothing. She said that she sustained cuts on her leg and hands. I do not know if what she said was true. I did not see Yvonne on that day, ie 15 June 1987.
 
 
 
10 On 16 June 1987 (Tuesday), Yvonne called me at my house at about 10am. My wife was then at home. I spoke to Yvonne for a short while and hung up. After my wife left the house with my son, I called Yvonne`s working place at about 11am. She said that she wanted to come over to my house. I told her that I would have to tell my wife not to return home and said that I would call her later to confirm. I then called my wife and told her not to return home at night as my friend was with me. Later, I called Yvonne again and told her that she could visit me. Yvonne told me that she had told her mother that she wanted to stay with me and that her mother had a quarrel with her. According to Yvonne, her mother wanted back the $5,000 which she had loaned to Yvonne sometime ago. Yvonne agreed to see me at about 3.30pm after her work.
 
 
 
11 After I spoke to Yvonne, I went out for a haircut and lunch. At about 1pm, I returned to my house. At about 3pm, I went downstairs to wait for Yvonne as she normally came around that time. Before I left the house, I closed the window of my flat, however, I did not latch it. The venetian blinds of the window were pulled up. At about 3.30pm, Yvonne came and we both took a lift up. Upon entering my flat, I closed the door and kissed Yvonne. She then took off her shoes and placed her handbag on the floor. I lay down on the mattress which was placed on the floor on the far end of the hall, near the window which was still in the same position as it was when I left the flat earlier. When I lay down, I called out to Yvonne and told her to come to me. She did not answer me. Yvonne latched the door from the inside and took a chair from the hall, a short distance away from me. She then placed the chair near the window and put one of her legs on the chair. At this juncture, I told Yvonne in Hokkien ` 
 Mai sng sng, mng boh kuai
` (meaning `be careful, the window is not closed`). She replied ` 
 Bueh lah
` (meaning `alright`) and I saw her placing her left hand on the wooden window louvres and leaning against the window which was not latched. As she was doing this, I also noticed that she had already climbed on the chair fully (ie both her legs were on the chair). At this juncture, she suddenly lost her balance and fell out of the window. On seeing this, I immediately got up and looked down from the window. I saw that she had landed directly below the window. I immediately called `999` and reported that someone had fallen from the 10th floor. I immediately rushed out and took a lift down. I went up to Yvonne and noticed that she was lying face downwards. I did not touch her and was shocked at what had happened. I ran to the nearby public telephone and called `999` again. I rushed to Yvonne and I did not know what to do. I again called for `999`. Later the police arrived and shortly after, an ambulance arrived and pronounced Yvonne dead.
 
 
 
12 Later, AIO Tan Hock Hye arrived at the scene and told me to remove Yvonne`s valuables from her body. I did so and removed her gold chain and bracelet. I contacted Yvonne`s parents and informed them about what had happened.
 
 
 
13 I wish to state that my wife, my son and I do not have any insurance policy on our lives. From Yvonne`s appearance lately and her indication that I should not let her brother have the insurance payment if anything happened to her, I suspected that she might have intentions to end her life, however, I do not think she had intentions to end her life when she fell from the window. I think she fell accidentally whilst trying to pull the venetian blinds down. During her past visits to my house, Yvonne used to pull down the blinds, however, she did not use a chair because the cord which is used to pull the screen is long enough. On 16 June 1987, when she came to my house, the cord at the right end of the venetian blinds was stuck to the right end because my son used to play with it if I let the cord down.
 
 
 
At about 8.15pm on 17 June 1987, Insp Lim Kwang Meng, who was attached to the Special Investigation Section, CID, was instructed to take over the investigation of this case. He and another inspector were earlier briefed about the case by Insp Bakurdeen at the Joo Chiat Police Station. The party of police officers and the accused visited the scene. Inspector Lim reconstructed the scene, had the measurements and sketch taken and several photographs were taken of the scene, including the mattresses placed below the window. Inspector Lim then visited and interviewed the family of the deceased at Bukit Batok. At about 3.40am on 18 June 1987, he informed the accused that he was arrested for the murder of the deceased. The accused was sent for medical examination which revealed that his physical condition was normal. DPC Chandran and PC Richard Yee, who had escorted the accused to the hospital for medical examination, returned with the accused and referred the accused to Insp Lim at about 5.40am.
At 5.45am 18 June 1987, the accused was told that a statement would be taken from him. He indicated that he wished to speak in English. Inspector Lim read and explained the typewritten charge to the accused. He wrote out the same charge and read it and explained it again to the accused. He then wrote out the notice of warning in accordance with s 122(6) of the CPC. The accused signed and acknowledged all these documents. The accused volunteered a statement. Inspector Lim concluded the recording of the statement at about 6.30am. The accused did not challenge the accuracy of his statement nor its voluntary nature. In fact, counsel for the accused wanted that statement admitted. It was accordingly admitted and marked as exh P32. The statement was in these terms: 
 
For the cause of death of Yvonne Lim Poh Yian falling from the 9th storey of Block 39, #09-231, Chai Chee Avenue, Singapore 1646, I deny that it was committed by me. It was due to her own subject of falling.
 
 
 
At about 11.40am later the same morning at the CID, Insp Lim began to record a further statement from the accused. This turned out to be a long statement and its recording stopped at about 1pm when the accused was taken back to his cell to have his lunch. The recording of the statement resumed at 2.10pm and it went on till 8pm, after which the accused had a 45-minute break during which he had his dinner. The recording resumed again at 8.45pm and ended at 10.30pm. The accused challenged the admissibility of this statement and a trial of the issues on its admissibility took place.
The accused was released by the police at about 3.35am on 20 June 1987 but the accused was immediately re-arrested and detained under s 44 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) until he was again released at about 12.55pm on 3 July 1987. Inspector Lim told the court that he was instructed to detain the accused under the Act (Cap 67).
In December 1987, Insp Lim was further instructed to arrest the accused and this time it was for the offence of abetment of suicide. At about 1.45pm on 11 December 1987, he arrested the accused and charged him with the offence of abetment of suicide for which he later stood trial before me. At 2pm the accused was sent for a medical examination. Upon his return, Insp Lim recorded a `cautioned` statement from the accused, after stating that he had observed the entire procedure prescribed under s 122(6) of the CPC which the accused had confirmed by signing at the appropriate stages on the statement. After the recording of the statement, the accused underwent another medical examination.
On 12 December 1987 at about 9am, the accused was produced and charged in court. He was ordered to be remanded. At about 3.20pm the same day, Insp Lim recorded a further statement from the accused which was concluded at 5.05pm the same afternoon.
The accused challenged the admissibility of the cautioned statement he was alleged to have made in the afternoon of 11 December 1987 and the further statement he had allegedly made in the following afternoon, after his court appearance in the morning.
His case was further mentioned in the subordinate courts on 26 December 1987. He was released on bail pending the hearing of the preliminary inquiry which was concluded on 4 May 1988. He was committed to stand trial in the High Court and he was granted bail pending trial.
Nearly four days were taken up for the trial within the trial to determine the admissibility of three statements which the accused was alleged to have voluntarily made to Insp Lim on 18 June 1987, 11 and 2 December 1987.
With regard to the long statement allegedly made by the accused on 18 June 1987, the accused alleged that after he was charged with the offence of murder at about 3.40am on 18 June 1987, he kept telling Insp Lim that the deceased had met with an accidental fatal fall in circumstances which he had earlier first told PC Hamdan and later elaborated in his statement to Insp Bakurdeen (exh `P29`). But he said Insp Lim did not believe him. Inspector Lim then instructed Sgt Tay Tee Tee, PC Richard Yee and a then unidentified Indian police officer (later identified in court by the accused to be DPC Alagamalai) to and they did bodily carry him to an open space on the 4th floor of the CID building. They then threatened to throw the accused onto the street unless the accused retracted his statement that the deceased had accidentally fallen to her death. The accused further alleged that Insp Lim told him that he could explain away the accused`s fatal fall by saying that he had jumped and died while trying to escape. The accused also alleged that he was slapped by Sgt Tay Tee Tee once on the back of his head. In cross-examination, he accused Sgt Tay of having slapped him four times. He further alleged that PC Richard Yee also slapped him once. All the officers who were alleged to have taken part in the threat to kill the accused or of the assaults gave evidence. They denied the allegations. In fact, it was proved that DPC Alagamalai was not in the CID building at the material time. At his medical examination, the accused did complain of some pain at the back of his head. But it was clear that this was caused by his banging of the back of his head against the wall in the house of the deceased`s family in the evening of 16 June 1987.
More significantly, according to the accused the manhandling of him and the threat to kill him had taken place before he gave his cautioned statement (exh `P29`) against the charge of murder at about 6.20am on 18 June 1987. In that statement, he denied any responsibility for the death of the deceased and stated that it was due to the deceased`s own falling from the flat. The accused stuck to his original stand in spite of the alleged threat to throw him to death and I did not believe him when he said he was threatened and manhandled in the way alleged. I was satisfied that Sgt Tay and PC Richard Yee did not slap him. It will be recalled that the long statement was recorded much later the same morning beginning at 11.40am.
The accused also alleged that he was very concerned that he was facing a murder charge. He said Insp Lim had lulled him into a false sense of security by saying that as long as he did not admit to causing the death of the deceased he would not be guilty of murder. As Insp Lim obviously did not believe him, he thought at that time that his best way out of his trouble was to embellish his story to make it sound more credible and more acceptable to Insp Lim. He said he had embellished paras 21, 22, 23, 28,29, 30, 31, 33 and 34 of his long statement made on 18 June 1987. He also disavowed the language used in that statement. In giving evidence, he appeared to stutter and was having difficulty explaining himself in English. Inspector Lim told me that the accused was very fluent in speaking English and that fluency stood in sharp contrast to the standard of English used by the accused in court. I was satisfied that the accused was putting on a show. He had worked for sometime as a salesman and was a branch manager of two branches of a fashion shop. As a salesman and a manager he could surely communicate well with his staff and his customers.
The accused told me that the real truth as to why the insurances were procured was not contained in the long statement; that it was true that the deceased had accidentally fallen out of the window of his flat but he attempted, in the trial within the trial, to tell me that the truth about the insurances was something else. I ruled that he was not obliged to tell me anything about that matter in the trial within the trial.
The accused, after denying the murder charge, had many hours in the cell before the long statement was recorded from him. He had ample time to think about what to say to Insp Lim. I was satisfied that he had voluntarily made the long statement. His will was not sapped by any threat, violence or by any trickery, deception or inducement allegedly practised by Insp Lim. I therefore ruled that the long statement was admissible as it was the statement of the accused and it was voluntarily made by him. That statement was admitted as exh P33. I shall return to this long statement after I have dealt with the other two statements made by the accused.
After his re-arrest in December 1987 when he was charged with the offence of having abetted the deceased in committing suicide, the accused gave a `cautioned statement`. I need not take up further space by reciting the steps taken by Insp Lim in accordance with s 122(6) of the CPC. In challenging the admissibility of this statement, the accused alleged that Insp Lim had threatened him that if he did not admit to abetment he would detain him under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) and that the detention could be as long as 131/2 years. Inspector Lim, according to the accused, had also warned him not to make any statement inconsistent with what he had stated in exh P33. Inspector Lim denied those allegations. I again did not believe the accused and had no hesitation in accepting the evidence of Insp Lim, who struck me as a truthful witness and a very able and fair-minded investigator. I accordingly admitted the `cautioned` statement where the accused said: `I admit that I abet her to the suicide. But the moment when she was carrying the chair I was at the loss. I did not see her falling out of the window`.
I now turn to the statement made by the accused to Insp Lim on the afternoon of 12 December. I had no doubt that it was a voluntary statement made by the accused. I accordingly admitted it as exh P40. In that statement, the accused admitted that he abetted the suicide so that he could have the benefits of the insurance. He further explained that when he mentioned that he was at a loss when he saw the deceased carrying the chair, he meant that he was unable to make up his mind at that moment of time whether to stop her from jumping or to allow her to jump.
I should now reproduce the material parts of the long statement (exh `P33`) made by the accused: 
 
22 After my resignation from my job on 15 May 1987, I became broke and was desperate for money. Suddenly this kind of greed for money flashed across my mind. I was thinking of large sums of money where I could enjoy life, buy a decent house for my wife and son and venture into business. Deceased came into mind as on one occasion, she told me that she would sacrifice her life for me. I thought of making the deceased a scapegoat in my scheme to get large sums of money. I thought of getting it from insurance companies. I thought of asking the deceased to buy life and accident policies and name me as the sole beneficiary and then to arrange for deceased`s death by accident. I believe that this scheme would work because the deceased usually listen to me even to the extent of dying for me.
 
 
 
23 One evening in May 1987, I spoke to the deceased over the phone. I told her that I have a plan which could brighten my future and I would be able to buy houses and have many good things in life and for this, I have to sacrifice her. I asked her opinion. Deceased then remained silent for a moment. She later replied that if this scheme of mine were to benefit myself, she would be willing to do anything to please me. She asked for my plan. I told her to insure herself, name me as the beneficiary and then she could go and drown herself and to be witnessed by her colleagues to make it appear like an accident. On this occasion, I spoke to the deceased while she was at home. I called from my house. During our conversation, my wife was sound asleep.
 
 
 
24 On the following day, I called the deceased at her office. I told her that I have located the insurance agent who is my friend. I told the deceased about the insurance agent I had in mind, one Cary Pang from the Great Eastern Life Assurance Co. Cary Pang had previously spoken to me when I was still working for `Top 100 Fashion` to revive an old policy. However, I turned him down. Cary Pang also called me to buy a child education policy for my son. My wife did not agree and the matter was dropped. I then asked the deceased when she could meet the insurance agent to buy a policy. She told me that she would make arrangement for herself.
 
 
 
25 In the meanwhile, I contacted Cary Pang and asked his advice as I intended to buy a life insurance of $300,000 and an accident policy of $300,000 for my girlfriend and how much premium have I to pay. Cary Pang explained that for the whole life policy, the premium would be more than that of accident policy, meaning that accident policy is cheaper than whole life policy. I then told Cary Pang that I would settle for $100,000 on life and $500,000 on accident. Cary Pang told me the premium for the two policies would be about $900 plus. I also asked Cary Pang what if my girlfriend dies and she does not want the money to go to her family and similarly what would happen if I purchase a policy and I do not want the money to go to my wife when I die. Cary Pang then explained to me about the absolute assignment meaning that the money would go to an appointed beneficiary. I then told Cary Pang that I would discuss with my girlfriend and get back to him.
 
 
 
26 I then discussed the matter with the deceased over the phone. I told her that the premium for $100,000 on life and $500,000 on accident would be $900 plus quarterly. She agreed. I then contacted Cary Pang and subsequently met at the Cairnhill Steak House at Orchard Point. Deceased and I met Cary Pang. After some discussion, deceased signed a proposal form for $100,000 on life and $500,000 on accident, on condition that the insured be subjected to a medical examination.
 
 
 
27 On the following day, deceased and I met Cary Pang at a clinic at Mt Elizabeth Hospital as deceased was supposed to be medically examined. However, there was a crowd in the clinic and we left. On the same evening, Cary Pang spoke to me over the phone and he proposed that deceased`s accident policy be reduced to $150,000 and increased to $150,000 on life policy, so that the insured`s medical examination can be waived. I told Cary Pang that I would let him know soon. I then spoke to the deceased about the new proposal by Cary Pang and that she did not have to be medically examined. Deceased replied that as long as this sum of money would satisfy me, she had no objection.
 
 
 
Subsequently, Cary Pang got in touch with me and I told him that we agreed to his latest proposal. On 2 June 1987 at about 12 noon, I met the deceased at the Hollandse Club. Deceased took half a day off. Both of us then proceeded to NTUC-Income at Shaw Towers. I wish to add that I had earlier told the deceased that the total amount insured with the Great Eastern Life Assurance had been reduced to $300,000, she need to insure herself with another insurance company to make the target of $600,000, and that was how we came to the NTUC-Income at Shaw Towers. Thereat, we met one Mr Jerome Lee Keng Kok. We made arrangements with Mr Jerome Lee to contact him later to purchase whole life and accident policies. After leaving Shaw Towers, we proceeded to AIA at Robinson Road. We wanted to seek a second opinion concerning the beneficiary. At the sales department, we consulted one of the staff who reiterated that no one could challenge the absolute assignment if the beneficiary was therein named. After satisfying ourselves, we proceeded to meet Cary Pang of the Great Eastern Life Assurance at OCBC Building, Chulia Street. In the presence of Cary Pang, the deceased signed the alteration form, ie to $150,000 on life and the same amount on accident. After that, I took out $1,000 and handed it to the deceased to make her payment of the premium. I purposely said aloud; meant for Cary Pang`s hearing that I loaned the $1,000 to the deceased to make payment. I had in mind to exonerate myself of any blame if at all in future, anything would happen to the deceased. By that time, the cashier department had closed and Cary Pang told us that he would send by post the receipt to the deceased`s house. Deceased then interjected and said that the receipt be sent to my house at Chai Chee. After leaving the office, I contacted Jerome Lee who told me to meet him at the People`s Park Kentucky Fried Chicken Restaurant. We then proceeded. At the said restaurant, we met Mr Jerome Lee. I told the deceased to discuss with Mr Jerome Lee. I have also a motive because I did not want to create an impression that I was behind the purchase of the policies from the two insurance companies. Subsequently, deceased signed the proposal form to purchase $100,000 life and $200,000 accident, ie from NTUC-Income.
We then accompanied Mr Jerome Lee to his office at Shaw Towers to make the payment. The deceased had earlier given me a $500 bill meant for paying the premiums of the two policies. The premiums amounted to $202. I was also named the sole beneficiary of these policies. The payment was later posted to my address. About ten days later, the official receipt was not returned yet. I contacted NTUC-Income and spoke to Mr Low from the letter of acceptance department at the SLF Building, Thomson Road. Mr Low told me to get the person insured to speak to him. Subsequently, the deceased called Mr Low. On the following day, we went to the head office of NTUC-Income at the SLF Building. Deceased signed an alteration form to insure $100,000 on life and $100,000 on accident as the original of $200,000 was not accepted by the company. 
 
28 Two days later, I accompanied the deceased to the same head office and collected the official receipt. I then told the deceased that the policies of the two insurance companies had been confirmed. Deceased changed the subject and asked me to accompany her on Saturday, 13 June 1987, or else there would not be another occasion. I agreed and on 13 June 1987, deceased and I spent time together at the Burder King Restaurant beside Lido Theatre and at the MacRitchie Reservoir. In the evening, we had dinner at Rasa Singapura, Tanglin. Before we parted, deceased told me that my dream would be fulfilled either on Sunday, 14 June 1987 or on Monday, 15 June 1987.
 
 
 
29 On 14 June 1987, Sunday, at past 9am, I called on the phone and spoke to the deceased who was at home. I told her that I was going to Malaysia with my wife and son. She bade me bye-bye. After that I took my wife and son to Johore Bahru to spend the day there. While in Johore Bahru, I called the deceased on the phone three to four times to her working place. We engaged in casual conversation. My intention was to find out whether any mishap had happened to her. At about 11pm, while still in Johore Bahru, I called the deceased who was at home. She told me that she would be going for a swim tomorrow, ie on Monday, 15 June 1987. I asked her who she was going with. She replied that she would be alone. She then bade me goodbye. My intention was again to find out whether anything had happened to the deceased.
 
 
 
30 On 15 June 1987 at about 10am, I rang up the deceased`s house. Her father told me that the deceased had gone for a swim. I then suspected that something drastic might be happening to her as she had earlier indicated that my dream would either be fulfilled on Sunday or Monday. Immediately, we checked ut of the hotel and came back to Singapore. In the afternoon, I rang up the deceased`s house. I spoke to her father who told me that the deceased, after her swim, would be going to work. She would be back home by tonight. I then contacted her working place. Deceased was not there yet. I became excited and believed that a mishap could have happened to her. I called a short while later again and the receptionist told me that the deceased was taking her bath. In a way, I was happy that she was still safe. But I was also sad that my plan, ie to get her drowned, went bust. At about 3.50pm, I spoke to the deceased over the phone after she paged for me (my pager is 5007015). She cried. She told me that earlier, she had been to Marine Parade and she jumped into the sea from the breakwater. A windsurfer looked at her and she quickly climbed up from the sea. She cried uncontrollably. I knew that her intention of jumping into the sea from the breakwater was to get herself drowned. I then changed the subject of conversation. We then hung up. I wish to add that the deceased also told me that she sustained a few cuts on her hands and legs when she jumped into the sea. I called her on the phone many times after that, just to console her.
 
 
 
31 On 16 June 1987, Tuesday, at about 10am, I called the deceased at her working place. She was on morning shift. I called to say hello. I called the deceased the second time around 11am. She told me that moments ago, she had quarrelled with her mother over the phone when she informed her that she (deceased) wanted to stay out. Her mother told her that why not settle down with me in Singapore and I could also return the loan of $5,000 to her. Her mother was under the impression that I was going overseas for a course and the loan was meant for this purpose. Her mother did not know that there was no such course and the money had been squandered away. Deceased then went on to tell that on 15 June 1987, Monday, she wanted to jump down from the 4th storey of her block. I then told the deceased that if this had happened, this would disrupt my plan, ie for me to collect the insurance money because there would not be any witness to testify whether the jumping was suicide or an accident and if it turned out to be suicide, all efforts would go to waste as insurance would not pay. Deceased then quoted me an example that a few days ago, a female died instantly after falling from the 5th storey. I then challenged the deceased that if she was daring, she could come to my place to jump from the 9th storey and I would be able to make it appear like it happened accidentally and this would enable me to collect the insurance proceeds. I also told the deceased of the plan, ie she was to stand on top of a chair placed by the side of the window which would be closed but not latched, either on the top or at the bottom and as if she stood up to lower the venetian blinds and in the process, she was to lean her arm on one side of the window and when it opened, her upper body would tilt forward. This would conclude the plan. When I spelled out my plan to the deceased, she remained silent. We then hung up.
 
 
 
Note: Accused took his dinner in SIS office at 8pm and statement resumed at 8.45pm, 18 June 1987. 
 
32 I wish to add that I spoke to the deceased from my house. My wife and son had earlier gone to my in-laws` place at Bedok.
 
 
 
33 At about 12 noon, I went to the neighbourhood for a haircut and then took my lunch. After lunch, I went to Bedok Library. I came home after 1pm. I then rang up the deceased and asked her whether she had taken her lunch. After 2pm, I called again. Deceased cried on both the occasions I spoke to her. At about 3.05pm, I left my flat to go to the void deck to wait for the deceased to arrive as earlier, she had informed me that she would be coming to my place. Earlier in the day, when I was in the flat talking to the deceased over the phone, my window was wide open and the venetian blinds was up. When I left for lunch, I closed the window but did not latch it top and bottom. When I came back from the library, the window was ajar, probably caused by the wind. When I left the flat to go to the void deck, I closed the window but did not latch it top and bottom. I also wiped one of the folding chairs of any of my fingerprints. My intention was to get the deceased to commit herself and to follow as planned by taking the chair and to place it beside the window so that her fingerprints could be found on the chair. The chair was left in its original place, ie next to the table. I did not wipe the other folding chair as I knew that deceased would not use it as there was a transistor radio placed on the seat and a towel spread on the rest.
 
 
 
34 At about 3.30pm, deceased arrived by taxi and I took her to my flat. Her eyes were watery and reddish. She must have cried. On the way to my flat, deceased did not speak to me. Deceased was clad in a pink blouse, white skirt, a pair of white shoes and she carried a black sling bag. In my one-room flat, I hugged the deceased. She did not respond, not like usual. I released my hold on her. She then put her sling bag on the floor and she went to latch the door.She had earlier removed her shoes. I again mentioned about the plan to the deceased and asked her whether she had grasped what I earlier told her over the phone. She kept quiet and stared at me for a brief moment. She then walked to the table and carried the folding chair and she turned to look at me again. I was then standing in front of the TV set. I could see tears in her eyes. She then walked to the window. She placed the chair below the window and then looked at me again. At this moment, I turned to face the wall and I closed my eyes. I knew that the deceased was going to `execute` the plan, ie jumping out of the window. I did not do anything to stop her. I did not even utter a word. Moments later, I heard something hitting the wooden window pane and deceased shouted `aah` and followed by a loud thud. I then rushed to the window and I saw the deceased lying on the pavement at the rear of the block. She laid prostrate. I then called the police. After that I came down to the void deck. I then stood beside the deceased`s body for a moment. I was very frightened and I panicked. A short while later, I called the police again at the public phone. After the third time, the police arrived. An ambulance came and deceased was pronounced dead.
 
 
 
At the close of the case for the prosecution, counsel for the accused submitted that defence should not be called as the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction under s 306 of the Code. Section 306 of the Code provides as follows: 
 
If any person commits suicide, whoever abets the commission of such suicide shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to fine.
 
 
 
In relation to the abetment of the doing of a thing within the meaning of the Code, the material parts of s 107 of the Code provide as follows: 
 
A person abets the doing of a thing who -
 
 
 
(a) instigates any person to do that thing;
... 
 
Explanation 1. A person who, by wilful misrepresentation, ..., voluntarily causes or procures, or attempts to cause or procure, a thing to be done, is said to instigate the doing of that thing.
 
 
 
The offence of abetment by instigation was considered in at least two Malaysian cases dealing with abetment by instigation under s 107 of the Penal Code (FMS Cap 45) which is in pari materia with the equivalent kind of abetment under s 107 of our Code. In 
 PP v Datuk Haji Harun bin Haji Idris & Ors 
 ,1 Abdoolcader J (as he then was) stated at p 196: 
 
Instigation consists of acts which amount to active suggestion or support or stimulation for the commission of the main act or offence. Advice can become instigation if that advice is meant to actively suggest or stimulate the commission of an offence: 
 Ragunath Das v Emperor
 (1920) 21 Cr LJ 213.
 
 
 
In my view, mere acquiescence or silence is not sufficient to constitute the offence of abetment by instigation. That the prosecution must show that there has been active suggestion, support, stimulation or encouragement to make good the offence of abetment by instigation was affirmed by Raja Azlan Shah CJ (as he then was) in 
 Haji Abdul Ghani bin Ishak & Anor v PP 
 2 at p 248 in the following terms: 
 
In fact it is an essential ingredient in a prosecution for abetment that there must be some evidence to show that the abettor actively suggested or stimulated the principal offender to the act by any means or language, direct or indirect, in the form of `expressed solicitation` or of `hints, insinuations or encouragement`. ... The word `instigates` in s 107 of the Penal Code does not merely mean placing of temptation to do a forbidden thing but actively stimulating a person to do it ...
 
 
 
The prosecution in this case had to prove two ingredients against the accused to bring home the charge, namely: (1) the commission of suicide by the deceased; and (2) the accused did abet by instigating the deceased to jump to her death thereby committing suicide. My role at that stage of the case under s 188(1) of the CPC was clearly spelt out in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
 3 in which Lord Diplock stated at p 52: 
 
As a decider of law, the judge must consider whether there is some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if he were to accept it as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If such evidence as respects any of those essential elements is lacking, then, and then only, is he justified in finding `that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction`, within the meaning of s 188(1). Where he has not so found, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence, and as decider of fact must keep an open mind as to the accuracy of any of the prosecution`s witnesses until the defence has tendered such evidence, if any, by the accused or other witnesses as it may want to call and counsel on both sides have addressed to the judge such arguments and comments on the evidence as they may wish to advance.
 
 
 
Counsel for the accused submitted that there was insufficient evidence led by the prosecution which was capable of proving the two ingredients of the offence. He observed that the evidence of the mother, the sister and the office colleagues of the deceased did not indicate that the deceased was about to commit suicide. The deceased had sounded normal and appeared normal; she had not left behind any tell-tale sign of any intention to commit suicide which was very odd. With regard to the inculpatory admissions of the accused contained in his long statement (exh `P33`), in the cautioned statement given on 11 December 1987 (exh `P39`) and in the further statement given on 12 December 1987 (exh `P40`), counsel for the accused suggested that they had become inherently incredible in view of the earlier statements of the accused, particularly his statement to Insp Bakurdeen (exh `P29`), where in circumstances closest to and following the death the accused had maintained that the deceased had suffered an accidental fatal fall. He continued to question the evidential value of those inculpatory statements since they were induced out of him by trickery and deception allegedly practised by Insp Lim.
Counsel for the accused also criticized the failures of the investigation officers (a) in seizing and retaining the mattress on which was placed the foldable chair, which would have proved that the deceased had stood on a shaky chair; and (b) in dusting the chair for the presence of the fingerprints of the deceased which would have proved that she had, at least, handled the chair, if not carried it to the window. Counsel for the accused submitted that these failures greatly hampered the case for the accused that it was all an accident. As for the insurances and the fact that the accused was the sole beneficiary, I understood counsel for the accused to say that these facts were at best neutral and that mere suspicion that something was amiss was insufficient.
The deputy public prosecutor (`DPP`), on the other hand, submitted that the confessions of instigation of the suicide and of the plan to make it appear as an accidental death, which were ruled by the court to have been voluntarily made by the accused in exhs P33, P40 and P41, were capable in law of proving the two ingredients of the charge. It was for the court later, at the close of the entire case, to weigh the inculpatory and exculpatory statements made by the accused against the other relevant evidence: see 
 PP v Lai Pong Yuen & Ors 
 ,4 
 Johnson Tan Han Seng v PP 
 .5 The DPP also relied on 
 Osman & Anor v PP 
 6 and 
 PP v Mustari bin Sur 
 
 i 
 7 for the proposition that an accused could be convicted on his own confession even if it is retracted if the court believed it to be voluntary and true, although it was clear to me that at the close of the case for the prosecution, the court was not required nor indeed entitled to make any finding on the truth or otherwise of the confessions. I have decided to make this clear because I did not accept the DPP`s submission when she stated in her written submissions that `(t)he court is urged to accept the statements admitted as exh P33 as the truth of what had transpired on that fateful day, 16 June 1987 ...`. I took the view that at that stage of the proceedings it was only right and proper that I determine whether the confessions of the accused in exh P33 were capable in law of proving the two ingredients of the charge against the accused.
Having considered the submissions and the entire evidence before me, I decided that in law there was evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if I were to accept as accurate, would establish the two ingredients in the alleged offence. I therefore called upon the accused to enter upon his defence and went on to administer to him the usual allocution. He decided to give evidence on oath. He was the only witness for the defence.
The accused was 27 when he gave evidence; he was the only son in his family. His mother passed away when he was in Secondary 4 in Queensway Secondary School. His father died about a year later. He only had an `O` level in Chinese. He had worked as a billiard-attendant, a production operator, a tally-clerk. He last worked as a salesman and a branch manager of two shops in a fashion company known as Top 100 Fashion until 15 May 1987 when he resigned. He first met the deceased at the club; they later became intimate. He met the mother and sister of the deceased who told them that he was a university student. He remonstrated with her but she explained that she wanted them to be proud of her. He admitted that he did borrow $5,000 from the deceased`s mother. He said both of them spent it. They were often broke. He said that in 1986, the deceased bought him a gold chain worth $300 to $400. He felt very bad about having kept away from her the fact that he was a married man with a son. So he told her about it. Later, he learned that she could not sleep and she took an overdose of sleeping pills and was hospitalized at the Alexandra Hospital.
He was broke after his resignation from his job on 15 May 1987. They then hatched a plan to defraud insurance companies. In this plan, they would create an accidental `death` as a result of a swim in the sea. Nobody was supposed to die. That was the truth the accused had wanted to tell me during the trial within the trial. He said the deceased agreed and suggested that after taking out the insurances he should pretend to have died accidentally at sea, disappear for two months, so that she could later claim from the insurance companies. However, he told the deceased that it was not possible for him to disappear as he had a lot of debtors. He told the deceased that he owed a large group of creditors some $200,000. If he disappeared these creditors would look for him and would kill him. To make her believe him, he bandaged himself and told the deceased that he had been beaten up by his creditors. He put on this act a few days before the insurances were bought. He said she had agreed to make him the sole beneficiary of the insurances because her brother was a gambler, her father needed money for an eye operation and her mother was pressing for repayment of the loans.
He borrowed $2,000 from his father-in-law to pay for the premiums; she offered to get some money too. They took out the insurances.
It was initially planned that she would disappear on 14 or 15 June 1987. But she could not carry out the plan as it was difficult and she did not know where to go to hide. She told him this on 16 June 1987 and still expressed very great concern about his creditors` threat to kill him. The deceased telephoned him on 16 June 1987 and told him that she had a quarrel with her mother over the loan of $5,000 and indicated that she wanted to spend a night with him. He arranged for his wife not to return home that night, saying that he had a group of friends coming to stay in his flat that night. At about 3pm, he waited for the deceased who arrived in a taxi. They went to his flat. She put down her bag and took off her shoes. He was lying down on a mattress and his evidence was to the effect that he wanted to have sex with the deceased. She agreed and took a chair and placed it on the mattress below the window. She intended to lower the blinds. This was to give them privacy. As one of her legs was stepping on the chair, he warned her in Hokkien to be careful as the window, which was closed, was not latched. She said `All right`. The accused then said: `So I saw her going up; then one of her hands is reaching the spool of strings; so the whole thing is moving, so I saw her, she already - the left hand side go out first, so the whole body went out`. He then dialled `999` and reported that his girlfriend had fallen down. The police arrived and he told the policeman, PC Hamdan, who had accompanied him to his flat how the deceased accidentally fell to her death. When AIO Tan Hock Hye came, he also told him how the deceased accidentally fell out of the window. At the request of AIO Tan, he collected the jewellery of the deceased to return it to her family.
He telephoned the deceased`s home and told the father of the accidental death. He then went there and recounted how the accident had happened. The family was all upset; the mother asked him to repay the money he borrowed. He told her to give him a few days. The police investigated. He told Insp Bakurdeen how the accident happened. He did not wish to be suspected regarding the insurances. So he told Insp Bakurdeen about it and brought him to the letterbox to collect both the insurance policies. He said he later gave a statement (exh `P29`) to Insp Bakurdeen. Shortly after 7pm, Insp Lim and Insp Akbal arrived with Sgt Tay Tee Tee, PC Richard Yee and Cpl Chng. In this statement he did not tell the real plot which he had planned with the deceased. The police and he went to his flat. In his flat, he demonstrated how the accident had occurred; he stepped on the chair and Insp Lim told him to step down. Insp Lim seized his briefcase which, and the contents of which, were later returned to his wife. Later that night, around 8 to 9pm, they left for the deceased`s flat. He did not go to the flat and remained in the car with Cpl Chng and PC Richard Yee. Inspector Lim and Sgt Tay Tee Tee went up. They came down after 11pm. Sgt Tay Tee Tee scolded him for playing with people`s daughter, taking people`s money and called him a `bastard`. They left for the CID office.
Inspector Lim interviewed the accused. He said every time he told him that it was an accident, the inspector said he did not buy that story and wanted the truth. He was slapped at the back of his head by Sgt Tay Tee Tee and PC Richard Yee. He stuck to his story and Insp Lim then said he could also have him thrown out of the building from the 4th floor and say that he had fallen whilst trying to escape. He then repeated his evidence how the four police officers bodily carried him out and threatened to throw him down. He said he was so scared that he told them that he would tell the truth. He at first told Insp Lim that he had kicked and punched the deceased and had then thrown her down from his flat. Inspector Lim asked him if he knew what he was saying. Then he changed his story and told the inspector that he had asked the deceased to jump out of the window and that she did not fall accidentally.
Inspector Lim then charged him with the offence of murder. He asked him the reason why but the inspector told him that he would give him a chance to explain later. He said that inspector assured him that so long as he was not admitting to murder he had nothing to be afraid of. He was then sent off for the medical examination. He said he told the doctor that he felt pain at the back of his head and that it was caused by his hitting the back of his head against the wall at the deceased`s home. In fact, the pain was due to the slaps from the two officers. He did not dare to tell the doctor because he was handcuffed and PC Richard Yee could have heard if he had complained. On his return to the CID, he gave the `cautioned` statement (exh `P32`) in which he denied any responsibility for the death of the deceased. By the words `due to her own subject of falling`, he explained he meant that the deceased had accidentally fallen off; that it had nothing to do with him. He said he did not use the word `accidentally` because the inspector did not believe him. So he put it the other way round.
After he was brought back to his cell, he did not sleep although he was very tired and hungry. He had to think of a story which the inspector would accept. He was very frightened and desperately wanted to get out of the murder charge. He used the time in his cell to think up the story which he eventually stated in exh P33. He thought he could not reiterate that it was an accident nor could he say that he had assaulted her and thrown her out of the window. So he thought he would admit to having planned the whole thing and had asked the deceased to die. It did not occur to him that the police would use what he had concocted to charge him with the offence of abetment of the deceased`s suicide. He said parts of the story in exh P33 were told by him as a result of suggestions of Insp Lim to make it sound more plausible. The accused went on to identify and explain the parts of his statement in exh P33 which were either not his statements or were words and ideas suggested to him by Insp Lim. The accused also explained that it would be foolish to arrange an accidental death from his flat as everybody would think that he had murdered her. The accused stated that after his release from police custody he renounced all his rights and benefits under the two policies.
The accused said that he was released at about 3am on 20 June 1987 but was immediately detained under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67) until his release on the afternoon of 3 July 1987. Then on 11 December 1987, he was charged with the offence of abetting the suicide. He saw Insp Lim who told him that the charge was based on what he had stated in June 1987 in exh P33 and that if he were to deny that statement he would have to take a new statement from him. Inspector Lim also indicated that probably his superiors would lock him up for up to 131/2 years under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67). So the accused in his `cautioned` statement in exh P40 confessed to abetment, which he elaborated in the further statement the following day, because Insp Lim had assured him that he could challenge those statements later in court. He thought he would take his chances in court.
When cross-examined, the accused denied that he had taken more money from the deceased than she from him. That they had both spent the savings and retrenchment money of the deceased`s mother was not taken into account by him. He admitted that he knew that the deceased had attempted suicide upon learning that he had been married for three to four years. He then tried to retract this admission but later accepted it. He also admitted that for two and a half years, he had kept from the deceased the fact that he was a married man. He denied having explained away his marriage by saying that his wife was really carrying his brother`s child when he married her, suggesting that he did not marry his wife out of love but he did his wife a favour. By his denial, the accused was suggesting that the deceased or her sister had made up the story or the sister was mistaken on this part of her evidence. He denied that the deceased was a simple, naive girl. She was `normal`. When pressed that he was able to conceal his married status from the deceased for two and a half years, he first said that they met only once in a month or two and then he said he did not deceive her because the question of his marital status never came up. He was astute enough to make the fine point that he did not positively utter a falsehood, but even on his version, he was suppressing the truth under circumstances where an honourable man would have been more honest. He said that the deceased was a person given to telling lies.The accused admitted in cross-examination that he had lied to the deceased over the debt of $200,000, which was allegedly incurred by his employers, and for which gangsters were threatening to kill him. The accused was constrained to agree with the DPP that the deceased had given a truthful account of what the accused had told her about the debt and the threat to his life, which was all a tissue of lies. The accused insisted that the deceased was not a simple, naive girl because she would take a share of the proceeds from the fraudulent insurance claim. Questioned about the credulity of the deceased in accepting his bandage as proof that he was beaten up by gangsters, the accused denied that she was naive. He readily came out with the answers that if she had wanted to see the wound and to apply medicine on it, he was prepared to avoid exposure by refusing or to lie that it would be too painful to open up the bandage. When asked if he had told the deceased that he wanted the loan of $5,000 from the deceased`s mother to attend a course, the accused said the deceased knew perfectly well that he was `investing` in horse betting in the Turf Club. However, in fact, in para 19 of exh P33, the accused had said, which he re-affirmed in court as true and accurate, as follows: `I told the deceased that I needed the money (ie the $5,000 from the deceased`s mother) to enrol for a computer course`. When caught out on this piece of his evidence, he brazenly told the court that it was only important that he admitted he borrowed the money and that it was not important if he lied in order to borrow the money.
The upshot of the accused`s evidence was that he and the deceased had planned to defraud the insurance companies, that no death was contemplated and that an accidental death by the disappearance of the deceased would be arranged by them. After they had received the insurance moneys, they would share them. The accidental fatal fall of the deceased from his flat was completely fortuitous. It was pure fate or entirely coincidental.
Not unexpectedly, he was cross-examined about this version of his evidence. He admitted that the first time he mentioned this version was when he gave evidence in his defence. He could not say when exactly this alleged plot was first hatched. He said it was not discussed where the deceased was to hide for the two months after feigning the accidental `death` by drowning at sea. The DPP put to the accused the inherent flaws of the alleged fraudulent scheme; but he said it did not occur to him. He was not afraid if his fraud was discovered because he thought at most he would be fined. He denied the DPP`s suggestion that the alleged fraud was a fabrication on his part.
The accused was also predictably cross-examined about the need to lower the venetian blinds on that fateful afternoon. When it was pointed out to him that they already had privacy because the window was closed, the accused suggested that they wanted fresh air and natural light when making love. He admitted that he had a fan in the flat. He admitted that he did not in his statement to Insp Bakurdeen mention anything about the shaky chair. I should also observe that the accused became, in my judgment, deliberately evasive and incoherent when he met with difficult questions but was very fluent and glib when he thought he had reasonably good answers to offer.
At the end of the submissions made by both counsel for the accused and the DPP, I had therefore before me three versions, broadly speaking. First, it was an accidental death as claimed by the accused in his oral and exculpatory statements to PC Hamdan, AIO Tan, Insp Bakurdeen which was reduced into writing in exh P29, and initially to Insp Lim, coupled with demonstrations by the accused at the flat as to how the accident had occurred. He also denied in writing any complicity when charged with the offence of murder. Secondly, he confessed to the offence of abetment in his long statement in writing taken on 18 June 1987 (exp `P33`) and in two later statements in writing given on 11 and 12 December 1987. Thirdly, the accused in his evidence on oath reiterated that it was an accidental death but he disclosed for the first time that the real plot was to feign an accidental death to defraud the insurance companies in which no death was contemplated. In considering and evaluating the evidence, I had very fresh in my mind the principles which a judge of facts in a criminal trial should adhere to and which were set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Chan Kin Choi v PP 
 .8 Those principles applied equally where `mixed` statements, both exculpatory and inculpatory, were made by an accused person in one statement or in separate statements. The learned DPP also submitted that an accused person could be convicted on his own confession even if it was retracted if the court believed it was both voluntary and true in substance: see 
 Osman & Anor v P 
 
 P 
 6 which was followed by Chua J in 
 PP v Mustari bin Suri 
 .7
I was satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that in truth and in fact (a) the deceased had committed suicide; (b) the accused had instigated her to do so by challenging and encouraging her and by wilfully deceiving her into agreeing to sacrifice herself to save him from his phantom creditors who he dishonestly made the deceased to believe were threatening his life; and (c) the accused planned, as he admitted in exh P33, to make the suicide look like an accidental fall in the way he had described in his statement to Insp Bakurdeen so that he could claim as the sole beneficiary under the two policies. Counsel for the accused submitted that according to the evidence of the relevant prosecution witnesses, the deceased had not given any indication that she was about to commit suicide; that it was indeed strange that the deceased had told the mother that she was moving in to live with the accused. As it was central to the entire plot of the accused and the deceased that the death must appear to be accidental, I did not find it strange at all that the deceased did not leave behind any evidence of a suicide. The deceased was willing to sacrifice her life for him; this was, in effect, what she was telling her best friend, Veronica Tan, in an indirect way when narrating the dream. The accused himself had told Cary Pang that a fortune-teller had predicted that the deceased would meet with a misfortune. These two pieces of evidence portended the death of the deceased and when they were viewed against the confessions of the accused in exh P33 and the insurances, the conclusion was irresistible that both the accused and the deceased had contemplated her death. I therefore rejected the accused`s evidence that his real plot did not contemplate the death of the deceased. I found that this was a piece of evidence fabricated by the accused at his trial in a mendacious attempt to get out of the abetment charge.
I was satisfied beyond any reasonable doubt that the accused voluntarily made a clean breast of the whole tragic episode in exh P33, after he realized that his earlier exculpatory statements that there was an accidental death were incredible, seeing that the two policies were very recently procured by both of them, with the accused as the sole beneficiary, in circumstances of strange haste and in a situation where such insurances were unlikely to be obtained for a person in the station and financial state as the deceased.
Counsel for the accused again in his closing submissions criticized the omissions of Insp Lim in seizing the mattress and in dusting the chair for any possible fingerprints of the deceased. In my view it was not necessary for Insp Lim to have seized the mattress; it was already photographed and the photograph was produced. I did not require a demonstration of the shakiness of the chair on the particular mattress. No dusting of the chair for fingerprints was carried out because the accused had handled the chair many times during the initial stages of police investigation. This court could easily appreciate the fact and degree of any shakiness of the chair on which the deceased had stood and the significance of the presence of her fingerprints on the chair. Even if I assumed the evidence of shakiness of the chair and made the inference that the deceased had carried the chair to the window, they were no more and no less probative on the question whether there was a suicide or an accidental fall. The determination of the crucial question whether it was an accidental death or a suicide depended on all the other much more directly relevant evidence which I had recited in detail in this judgment. I took very great care when assessing the evidence in its entirety to ensure that the absence of the mattress in question and of the deceased`s fingerprints on the chair did not disadvantage the defence of an accidental death in this case.
At the conclusion of the submissions, I told the accused as follows: `For reasons that I will give later in writing, I want to tell you that I am sure in my mind on the evidence and after having heard the submissions from both parties, that Yvonne Lim did commit suicide on 16 June 1987 and that you abetted her in the commission of the suicide by instigating her to jump to her death so that you could attempt to benefit from the insurance policies. You have not created any doubt in my mind which can be reasonably drawn in your favour. I accordingly convict you of the offence as charged`.
I now turn to the sentence of imprisonment of eight years which I had imposed. I was told that the accused was convicted on 4 July 1987 of the offence of attempted theft under s 380 read with s 551 of the Code. He was sentenced to one day`s imprisonment and fined $1,000. Except that the offence was committed in 1986, I was not given any further detail. This offence hardly featured in my assessment of the appropriate sentence. Counsel for the accused made a brief mitigation plea. He asked for leniency. The accused was 27 with a wife and a seven-year-old son. He was reconciled with his wife. He claimed he was remorseful and asked for an opportunity to rehabilitate himself and start life afresh. The offence of abetment of suicide could range from one committed under circumstances where the abettor acted out of altruism or mercy to relieve pain suffered by a terminally-ill principal who he loves to one committed for profit or some evil motive. The case before me was indisputably a very serious case of abetment of suicide at the heart of which was the wanton greed of the accused to profit by fraud on insurance companies and which involved the grievous loss of an innocent life. It was planned over a period of time. The accused manipulated and took heartless advantage of the love and devotion of a naive and simple-minded girl who he knew loved him so much and so deeply that she was even prepared to sacrifice her own life to get him out of the mortal danger from the phantom creditors which he artfully persuaded her were real and imminent. He executed his plan with all deliberation and, with composure, he went on to make the false claim to the police that it was an accidental fatal fall. He confessed only when he thought he had no way out. He claimed trial, instead of pleading guilty which would have counted in his favour and which might have added substance to his claim in mitigation that he was remorseful. In the course of the trial, he was mendacious and told a number of lies. He did not hesitate to speak ill of the deceased; he claimed that the deceased was given to telling lies. He unnecessarily maligned his own wife and again unnecessarily claimed that the deceased was not a virgin when he first knew her. I was also upset that the accused had practised deception on the mother of the deceased who was relieved of nearly all her life`s savings. In his defence, he sought to portray the deceased as an equally culpable, greedy and active accomplice in his alleged scheme to defraud the insurance companies. He also sought to malign the good name of Insp Lim who struck me as a truthful witness and a very competent and fair-minded police investigator. But for his skilful investigative management of this case, the accused might have escaped his just deserts. For all these reasons, I imposed the sentence I did.

This was an appeal against conviction and sentence on a charge of murder. The charge was that the appellant on or about 2 November 1984 at about 2.55pm at Apartment Block 62, Kallang Bahru, Singapore, caused the death of one LHH and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`).
We summarize below the facts as found by the trial judges on the evidence adduced before them, including (a) the oral testimonies of, among other witnesses, (i) the relatives, friends and the employer of LHH; (ii) an independent eye-witness, N; and (iii) three friends of the appellant, R, A and T, and (b) two voluntary written statements made by the appellant and his oral testimony in his own defence.
On 2 November 1984 at 2.29pm the police received a message that a girl had been found lying at the foot of Block 62, Kallang Bahru. The body was about 17ft away from the foot of the block. At the scene, a staff nurse examined her and pronounced her dead at 3.06pm. The cause of death, as later certified by the pathologist, was a ruptured heart caused by the fall. The deceased was later identified as LHH, an interior designer aged 19.
The appellant was 27 years of age and self-employed at the time of the incident. He met the deceased in 1984 at an interior decoration course which they were both attending. He rented and lived in a one-room flat, #10-3369 of Block 62, Kallang Bahru.
On 2 November at about 3pm, N was walking from Block 63 to Block 62, when he looked up at the 11th storey of Block 62 where his girlfriend lived. N saw what he initially thought was someone trying to hang out a pillow or bolster outside a window below the 11th floor. He then realized that what he was seeing was a bare-chested person, whom he later identified as the appellant, trying to put a partially unclothed female body out of the kitchen window. The body, later identified to be that of LHH, was being carried in a horizontal position with her head on top of his left hand and her legs over his right arm. N saw her struggling weakly before the man let go of her. N was then only 50ft from the foot of Block 62. The body landed on the grass verge adjacent to the block. The legs landed first and the body fell sideways towards his left. When he ran near to her, she said, `Help me, help me please` in English. He told her he did not know what to do and she repeated her pleas for help. The pathologist testified that LHH did not die on impact but a minute or so later, and was capable of uttering some words before she died. She was having great difficulty in breathing. N, who was then 15 years old, was crying by then. LHH died soon after. He was dazed with shock and, still crying, walked a little distance away where he retched. He saw a man covering the body with newspapers. N also testified that he had also seen the appellant with LHH at the foot of Block 62 two or three weeks before the incident.
The police recovered from the rubbish chute of Block 62 some items of clothing and accessories which were later identified to belong to LHH. Later that day, the appellant went to a pawnshop in Toa Payoh and pawned certain items of jewellery which were subsequently sold by the pawnbroker. He testified that his register showed that it was the appellant who had pawned the jewellery on the same day shortly after 3.40pm.
At about 8.15pm on the same day, the appellant met a friend, R. On the way to his flat in a taxi, the appellant asked R the best way to go to Malaysia. He stopped the taxi a block or two away from Block 62 and gave the keys to his flat to R so that R could change out of his work clothes and leave some things in the flat before they went out together for a drink. He told R that he owed rent and did not want to meet the landlord. The appellant waited at a coffeeshop. When R arrived at the flat, he was stopped by a police officer before he could open the door. He let the police in to search the flat. During the search, the telephone rang. It was the appellant: he wanted to know why R was taking so long. R replied that he would come soon. When questioned by the police, R told them about the exchange. When the telephone rang a second time, the police instructed R to arrange to meet the appellant downstairs. When they went downstairs, the appellant could not be found. R then gave a statement to the police. The keys to the flat were seized.
Two other friends of the appellant, A and T, testified that after the incident, he had talked to them, separately, about the incident. He gave to both of them substantially the same account, ie that he had slept with a girl who had been a virgin and that she had demanded he marry her, that he had told her he was a Muslim and had another girlfriend; that she had become very upset because her parents were strict and that she had accused him of having deceived her even though he had agreed to marry her; that she had gone to the kitchen to make hot drinks and when he looked up she had disappeared; that he looked out of the window and saw her body on the ground. Both his friends advised him to contact the police and explain to them what had happened. T managed to drive the appellant towards the CID but when T stopped to get a Malaysian car pass, the appellant disappeared. Later, he telephoned T and apologized for having left so suddenly; he said that he was trying to leave Singapore.
The appellant succeeded in leaving Singapore. But he was arrested in Malaysia on 28 February 1987. He had on him an identity card which did not belong to him. He was extradited to Singapore on 14 March 1987. On 17 March 1987, a s 122(6) statement was recorded from him. On 26 March 1987, a s 121 statement was recorded from him.
At the trial, the appellant elected to defend himself although counsel was available to defend him. He did not challenge the voluntariness of the two statements he had given to the police. The s 122(6) statement in whole and the s 121 statement, as to its material parts, were accordingly admitted in evidence.
The appellant gave his account of the incident in these two statements. On 1 November 1984, he met LHH as prearranged at about 7pm near Hoover Theatre, Balestier Road. They had dinner at the stalls nearby. After dinner, they went to his flat at Kallang Bahru at his suggestion to discuss, which they did, his interior design drawings. They also watched television for a while, then they talked about personal matters and eventually the appellant prevailed upon LHH to yield to his advances. They had sexual intercourse, after which they had a bath. As it was late, the appellant persuaded LHH to call home to say that she would not be home for the night. She telephone at about 1am. (Her brother, who took the call, testified that she sounded like she had just cried before and was choking, and that the call was cut off abruptly. The appellant admitted, in his testimony, that it was he who cut short the telephone conversation by pressing the extension button.)
LHH spent the night in the flat during which they made love again and had another bath. They woke up the next morning at about 10am, and had sex again. She then went to wash up and saw love-bites on her neck and chest and was upset because they would be visible. (The account in the s 121 statement was more elaborate, eg they then had a shower together, after which they had a cup of Milo and sat around; she then went to the dressing table and saw the love-bites.) The appellant tried to reassure her by telling her that he would be responsible for what had happened between them and was willing to marry her despite his having a girlfriend whom he loved. He also told her he was a Muslim and she would have to be a Muslim if they were to be married. She accused him of having deceived her by not disclosing these matters to her beforehand. He tried to reassure her again of his intentions. She wanted to dress. She tried to leave the flat. He prevented her and tried to calm her down but a struggle ensued.
The appellant`s s 122(6) statement gave this account of the struggle: 
 
In the heat of the struggle, I punched and kicked her and choked her and stopped her from screaming. Her body went limp. I thought she was dead. I carried her body and pushed it off the window at the spur of the moment to make it look like a suicide. Then I took my things and my passport and left.
 
 
 
His s 121 statement gave a more elaborate account of the struggle, as follows: 
 
... she became hysterical and started to yell and scream. There was a struggle between both of us as I was trying to prevent her from dressing up to leave. I then pushed her onto the mattress and punched and kicked her to prevent her from yelling. I cannot remember as to the parts of the body hit by me during the punching and kicking as I was very furious then. I also covered her mouth with my hands as she continued to struggle and scream. During this struggle, I might have even choked her. At this juncture, she suddenly became unconscious and motionless. I started to panic and thought that she was dead. I waited for about ten minutes in a daze, thinking what to do next. An idea struck my mind then and I thought I could get away if I made it look like a suicide by throwing her down. I then carried her on my shoulders and walked towards the kitchen to the window. She was facing downwards when I was carrying her on my right shoulder. Her head was facing my back whilst her legs were dangling in front of me. When I reached the window, I pushed her legs out the window first whilst the body was still resting on my shoulders. I am unable to say whether she was breathing or not then as I was in a state of panic. However, she was motionless. Once her legs were outside the window, I tossed the body over and out of the window. I did not see it falling as I was in a daze. I then returned back to the hall and sat for a while. I then took her slacks, shoes and hand-bag and threw them into the rubbish chute. When I threw the deceased out of the window, she was wearing her blouse (long-sleeved) and her panties. I am unable to say whether she had her brassiere on or not. I then gathered my passports, both my restricted and international, and some clothings and placed them in a plastic bag. I also took the jewellery belonging to the deceased which were left on the dressing table. It consisted of a gold chain, a gold bracelet and two gold pendants. These items were left by the deceased on the dressing table when she had a bath with me after our first round of sexual intercourse. I then left my flat.
 
 
 
When LHH was found at the foot of Block 62, she was clad only in her brassiere, panties and shirt. There was blood stain outside her nostrils. The post-mortem report listed the following injuries: nine injuries caused by the fall; ten injuries consistent with a fall or a non-fall; and five injuries which were not caused by the fall. One of the injuries (a small laceration on the right upper lip) was caused, according to the pathologist, by either a blow or by someone attempting to cover her mouth. Another injury (brassiere impression marks at the lower margin of both breasts) was caused by someone applying external compression force against her breasts before her fall.
There were also two bruises at the vaginal inlet of LHH. The pathologist was of the view that these bruises were caused by rough handling of the vagina, either through rough sexual intercourse or by some external object. He was of the view that she had lost her virginity well before the incident at the flat. He found no trace of spermatozoa in the vaginal smear taken by him. His explanation was that either ejaculation took place outside the vagina or it could be due to the fact that LHH had washed herself after sexual intercourse. However, when cross-examined by the appellant, the pathologist agreed that there was a trace of spermatozoa on LHH`s panties.
The pathologist also did not find any love-bites on LHH`s neck. He denied the appellant`s suggestion that there were. However, when the DPP put the pathologist`s evidence on this point to the appellant when cross-examining him, the appellant initially refused to answer the question directly. He prevaricated and adopted the stance that if the DPP suggested that he lied, then he must have lied, and that for the sake of the pathologist, he was prepared to be branded a liar. Eventually, when he was asked to given a direct answer, he maintained that there were love-bites on her.
The appellant`s oral testimony on the events that happened at his flat differed from his accounts in the written statements in a number of material particulars. He said that when LHH discovered the love-bites and told him that her parents, being strict, would scold or beat her, he suggested that they feigned a case of kidnapping, to which she agreed but that later he thought otherwise. He said that she tried to leave the flat twice and there had been a struggle each time when he tried to prevent her from doing so, that these struggles were too mild for him to have inflicted upon her the two non-fall injuries mentioned by the pathologist. According to him, both of them sat down and read after the last struggle, and suddenly he saw a shadow and when he rushed to the kitchen LHH was not there nor was she in the toilet. When he looked down the window, he saw that LHH was already on the ground and some people attending to her. He did not think of calling an ambulance. On seeing this, he panicked, threw her belongings down the rubbish chute, collected his own belongings and left the flat without calling for an ambulance. The whole incident happened before lunch. He admitted taking LHH`s jewellery and pawning them at the Toa Payoh pawnshop. He confirmed his encounters with his two friends.
He, however, maintained that he had not brought LHH to the flat at any time before the day of the incident, contrary to what N had testified.
The trial judges accepted the evidence of N that he had see the appellant with LHH at Block 62 before the incident and that he had also seen the appellant throw LHH out of the window on the day of the incident. They did so even though N had not disclosed to the police what he had seen until after the trial had commenced. They were also satisfied that she was alive when she was thrown out.
They did not believe the appellant`s version which suggested that LHH had committed suicide. They found, on the evidence, that LHH was her normal self before the incident and that, before leaving her office that day, she had told her employer on the same day that she would come back the next day to collect her wages. They also found that her dying words did not suggest that she wanted to end her life. The trial judges found that the appellant had given three accounts of how LHH fell and that they differed with one another in a number of very material particulars. The trial judges were satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that the appellant had thrown LHH out of the window. They accordingly convicted the appellant for murder.
In this appeal, counsel for the appellant advanced three grounds of appeal. We deal with each in turn.
The first ground of appeal was that the trial judges misdirected themselves in law and in fact in stating, in their grounds of decision, that 
 
there was only one live issue in this case that was seriously in dispute, that is, did the deceased fall from the accused`s flat by her own or did the accused throw her down whilst she was still alive.
 
 
 
Counsel contended that the trial judges, in so directing themselves, had failed to address and/or ask themselves the crucial question whether the appellant, if he had thrown LHH down while she was still alive, did so in the belief that she was already dead. In other words, the trial judges did not consider whether the appellant had the requisite mens rea for the offence of murder. Counsel contended that the appellant`s s 122(6) and s 121 statements showed that the appellant thought that LHH was dead when he threw her out of the window, and that accordingly, he had no intention to kill LHH or to cause her death. He threw her out to make it look like a suicide.
Counsel contended that the trial judges should have directed themselves whether the appellant had thrown LHH out of the flat, 
 honestly and reasonably believing her to be dead. 
 He argued that it was crucial that the trial judges direct their minds to this defence as the appellant was not represented by counsel at the trial. He submitted that in the light of this misdirection, it was unsafe for this court to affirm the conviction and that the appellant should have been convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
Counsel referred us to a series of local cases which have consistently held that the court has a duty to consider the defence and the evidence adduced by the accused in support of the defence: 
 Mohamed Shariff v PP 
 ,1 
 Chang Lee Swee v PP 
 ,2 
 Mumod Ali v PP 
 .3 In 
 Ong Ah Too v R 
 ,4 the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial judge was wrong in omitting to mention in his summing up the evidence in support of the accused`s alibi, and that as the central issue was the identification of the accused, the omission was fatal to the conviction.
In 
 J Connell v The King 
 ,5 Lord Thankerton, at p 188, said: 
 
Thus there was not a word of the appellant`s denials in the witness box, or of the evidence for his defence, an omission which their Lordships feel bound to characterize as a contravention of the elementary principles of fair trial and the due administration of justice. The appellant was entitled to have the evidence in his favour submitted to the jury, which would be consistent with the opening statement of the learned judge. In the opinion of their Lordships this matter, by itself, involves a substantial miscarriage of justice such as justifies the sustaining of this appeal.
 
 
 
Counsel also referred us to a series of mainly English decisions on the consequences of a non-consideration or improper consideration of a possible legal defence. They were: 
 R v Sheaf

 R v Kachikwu 
 ,7 
 Bullard v R 
 ,8 
 R v Porritt

 R v Cascoe 
 ,10 
 R v Bashir 
 ,11 
 R v Badjan 
 ,12 and 
 R v Baillie-Smith 
 .13 In 
 Bullard 
 ,8 the accused raised the defences of self-defence and provocation to a charge of murder. The jury rejected the defence of self-defence, and the judge had withdrawn the issue of provocation from the jury on the ground that the accused`s evidence had not established it. The Privy Council allowed the appeal. Lord Tucker said, at p 643: 
 
In the present case the fact that the jury rejected the defence of self-defence does not necessarily mean that the evidence for the defence was not of such kind that, even if not accepted in its entirety, it might not have left them in reasonable doubt whether the prosecution had discharged the onus which lay on them of proving that the killing was unprovoked. Their Lordships do not shrink from saying that such a result would have been improbable, but they cannot say it would have been impossible. As was said by Humphreys J in 
 Rex v Roberts
: `As for the question whether it was open to them on the facts, counsel for the prosecution has argued with good reason that no reasonable jury could come to such a conclusion. The court may be disposed to take much the same view, but it cannot delve into the minds of the jury and say what they would have done if the issue had been left open to them.` Every man on trial for murder has the right to have the issue of manslaughter left to the jury if there is any evidence upon which such a verdict can be given. To deprive him of this right must of necessity constitute a grave miscarriage of justice and it is idle to speculate what verdict the jury would have reached.

 where Ashworth J, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, said, at p 356:
 
 
 
As has already been said, the issue of manslaughter was not raised at the trial, but there is ample authority for the view that notwithstanding the fact that a particular issue is not raised by the defence, it is incumbent upon the judge trying the case, 
 if the evidence justifies it
, to leave such issue to the jury. (Emphasis added.)

[1967] 52 Cr App R 538
 where Winn LJ said, at p 543:
 
 
 
It is asking much of judges and other tribunals of trial of criminal charges to require that they should always have in mind possible answers, possible excuses in law which have not been relied upon by defending counsel or even, as has happened in some cases, have been expressly disclaimed by defending counsel. Nevertheless, it is perfectly clear that this court has always regarded it as the duty of the judge of trial to ensure that he himself looks for and sees any such possible answers and refers to them in summing up to the jury and takes care to ensure that the jury`s verdict rests upon their having in fact excluded any of these excusatory circumstances.
 
 
 
In 
 Cascoe 
 ,10 the accused raised the following defences on a charge for murder: firstly, diminished responsibility; secondly, that he was acting in self-defence; and thirdly, that if the actions he took exceeded what could reasonably be done by way of self-defence, the jury would be entitled to find him guilty of manslaughter. The defence of provocation was not raised but the judge directed the jury on it. The accused was convicted. On appeal, the accused took the point that the judge did not direct the jury properly on provocation, even though it was never put forward as a defence. Salmon LJ dealt with this point as follows at pp 405-406: 
 
... it is quite plain that, even although the defence is not put forward at the trial, the judge, 
 if he considers that there is evidence upon which a jury might reasonably, and I repeat the word `might`, find provocation, he has a duty to leave that issue to the jury
. The learned recorder clearly thought that there was some evidence upon which a jury might reasonably find provocation which would reduce the appellant`s crime from murder to manslaughter.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
The complaint that is made of the judge`s direction on provocation is as follows. [Counsel] says that when the judge came to deal with provocation, he explained the law in relation to provocation with complete accuracy except in one important respect. He failed to tell the jury, as he had done when he dealt with self-defence, that from beginning to end the onus lay upon the Crown, that it was not for the appellant to prove provocation, but that if, at the end of the day, the jury were left in any reasonable doubt by the evidence whether he had been provoked, then they should acquit him of murder and find him guilty of manslaughter. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Further, at pp 407-409: 
 
Having left it to the jury, it was essential that they should have been given a correct direction on the law, particularly as to where the burden of proof lay as far as provocation was concerned. In the view of this court it is highly improbable that a jury properly directed would have come to the conclusion that a reasonable man in the circumstances such as those in which the appellant found himself would have done as the defendant did. However, the jury might have come to that conclusion.
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
The only distinction between that case and the present is that in that case the issue of provocation was raised at the trial, whereas in the present case it was not. This, however, does not, in the view of this court, make any material difference. 
 Whether the issue is raised at the trial or not, if there is evidence which might lead the jury to find provocation, then it is the duty of the court to leave that issue to the jury
. The evidence in this case was very thin indeed. The very experienced recorder, however, considered that there was some evidence or he would not have left that issue to the jury. We cannot disagree with him in the view which he took on that point. It follows from what has been said that since there was the unfortunate oversight in the summing-up to which reference has been made, the appeal must be allowed and a verdict of manslaughter substituted for the verdict of murder. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In 
 Bashir 
 ,11 B was acquitted of the charge of having sexual intercourse with the complainant knowing she did not consent, but was convicted on the charge of having sexual intercourse with her, being reckless whether she consented or not. His evidence in the witness box was that he could not remember a thing that had happened, his mind being a complete blank. On appeal, the point was taken that the judge did not direct but should have directed the jury that although B did not lay claim to having a reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting in intercourse, there was evidence from other sources, particularly the testimony of the complainant that she undressed herself, assisted the act of intercourse along its way and kissed her assailant goodnight, which demanded that the judge left the defence of reasonable belief to the jury to determine.
The Court of Appeal agreed. Watkins LJ said (at p 62): 
 
This court has come to the conclusion that [counsel`s] submission upon this ground is irresistible. There can be, and there is, no doubt firstly that a defence can be said to be raised whenever there is evidence, no matter from what source, of a kind which calls upon a judge to conclude that this defence should be left to the jury, and secondly, that his decision as to whether or not that defence should be left to the jury is open to review in this court. If the conclusion here is that he was called upon to leave that defence to the jury and did not, then his failure to do so can amount to such a non-direction will destroy the conviction. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In 
 Badjan 
 ,12 the Court of Criminal Appeal held that where a cardinal line of defence (eg self-defence) had been place before the jury, but had not been referred to at all in the summing-up to the jury, it was in general impossible for the court to apply the proviso to s 4(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act (that there was no miscarriage of justice) and refrain from quashing the conviction.
In 
 Baillie-Smith 
 ,13 B was charged with incest with his daughter C. He made a statement to the police admitting intercourse with C but thought that C was his wife. C had made the complaint against B, but retracted her evidence before committing justices. C was not called as a witness at the trial, but the police officers gave evidence of their account of the interview with B which had the effect of putting in the incriminating parts of C`s complaint. The judge did not invite the jury to apply their minds to the question whether or not B was aware that the woman he had intercourse with was his daughter and not, as he asserted he supposed at that time, his wife. The court held that the verdict of guilty reached in that circumstance only was unsafe and unsatisfactory. The report of the judgment in this case does not disclose whether B gave evidence or what his defence was if he did.
We do not disagree with any of the principles applied in the decisions referred to above. It is the duty of the trial judge or judges to consider the defence of the accused and the evidence that is adduced in support of that defence. That is fundamental. A failure to carry out that duty will inevitably lead to a miscarriage of justice. Where the evidence adduced at a trial, whether it be adduced by the prosecution or the defence, will exonerate the accused of the offence with which he is charged, or reduce it to some lesser offence, it is also the duty of the trial judge or judges to consider such evidence to determine whether it is sufficient to acquit the accused or reduce the charge, even if the accused himself, whether or not he is represented by counsel, has not raised the particular defence which has that effect. The role of the court is to find whether or not the accused is guilty as charged on the evidence placed before it. But there must be some evidence on which the court can act.
Where the case is tried before a jury, it is all the more necessary that the judge should apprise the jury of any possible defences that may be raised by the evidence, even though the judge himself may think that the evidence is unsatisfactory or weak. Thus, where self-defence is pleaded, the rejection of the accused`s evidence on self-defence does not necessarily mean that that evidence may not support the defence of provocation: see 
 Bullard 
 .8
Similarly, in 
 Porritt 
 ,9 the defence that was put to the jury was whether P had shot dead his father-in-law during a `gang fight` in self-defence of the father-in-law or of his home and/or property against the assault of some members of another family. P had intended to shoot two of those members, one of whom was holding a knife to the neck of his father-in-law. The issue of fact put to the jury was one of honest belief or otherwise. Neither the prosecution nor the defence nor the judge referred to the possibility that there might have been sufficient provocation to reduce the charge to manslaughter. P was convicted of murder and sentenced to death. The Court of Criminal Appeal were of the view that there was evidence on which the jury, if directed, could have found that the killing was killing after provocation. They substituted a conviction for manslaughter. 
 Porritt 
 9 was a case in which counsel for the accused disclaimed the defence of provocation. However, it was done, as pointed out by the court, because counsel was concentrating on an out and out acquittal, and was reluctant to introduce further issues which might result in P being found not guilty of murder but nonetheless guilty of manslaughter. The remarks of Winn LJ in 
 Kachikwu 
 7 that judges are required to bear in mind all possible answers and excuses in law should be understood in that context. There must be, in each case, evidence that is fit to go to the jury.
Whilst we agree with and accept the principles as applied in the aforesaid cases, we should like to enter a caveat when applying these principles in Singapore. It is that there is no jury trial in Singapore. Because the judge has no jury to direct, and therefore must direct himself, it does not follow in every case that his silence as to a possible defence means that he has ignored it. In 
 Mohamed Kunjo v PP 
 ,14 Lord Scarman, delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, said at pp 53-54: 
 
Where trial has been by jury and the burden of proof is upon the prosecution to negative the defence, it is settled law that the judge must put to the jury all matters which upon the evidence could entitle the jury to return a lesser verdict than murder. And, if the judge fails to do so, the Board will intervene, even if the matter was not raised below. For otherwise there would be the risk of a failure of justice. In 
 Kwaku Mensah v The King
 
[1946] AC 83
, Lord Goddard, giving the reasons of the Board for allowing the appeal, said, at p 94:
 
 
 
`The principles on which this Board acts in criminal cases are well known and need no repetition, but when there has been an omission to place before the jury for their consideration a matter of such grave importance that they were never led to consider whether in this respect the prosecution had discharged the onus which lay on them of proving murder as distinct from manslaughter, their Lordships think that they can properly entertain the appeal. They would add that it must be seldom that they consider a matter which was not only not mentioned in the courts below, but was not included in the reasons given by the appellant in his case.`
 
 
 
Although different considerations arise where, as here, the burden of proving the defence or exception is upon the defendant and trial is by judge (or judges) alone, [counsel] for the public prosecutor has not contended either that s 105 of the Evidence Act, or the mere fact of trial being by judge alone, precludes the Board from considering a defence not raised below. But he does raise the point that it does not follow from a judge`s silence as to a possible defence that he has ignored it. He may have thought the matter too plain for argument - more especially, if it has not been raised by the defence. Moreover it would not, in our judgment, assist the administration of criminal justice if there were to be cast upon the High Court the duty of reciting in judgment only to reject every defence that might have been raised but was not. Nevertheless there will be cases in which justice requires the Board to consider matters not mentioned in the court below. It is to be noted that in India, where there is also no trial by jury and the burden of proving the exception of `sudden fight` is upon the defendant, the Supreme Court of India has considered and given effect to the exception, substituting a verdict of culpable homicide for one of murder, although the exception had not been relied on at trial: see 
 Budhwa v The State of Madhya Pradesh
 AIR 1954 SC 652. In our judgment a defence based upon an exception which the defendant has to prove may be raised for the first time before the Board, if the Board considers that otherwise there could be a real risk of failure of justice. The test must be whether there is sufficient evidence upon which a reasonable tribunal could find the defence made out. If there be such evidence, the court of trial should have expressly dealt with it in its judgment and the judicial committee will deal with it on appeal, even though it has not been raised below.
 
 
 
In a charge for the offence of murder, it is not uncommon (see 
 Cascoe 
 10) that the accused may adduce in his defence evidence which is capable of coming within one or other of Exceptions 1 (provocation), 2 (private defence), 4 (sudden fight) and 7 (diminished responsibility) even though he may not rely specifically on all of these defences. That is why many of the cases in which the convictions have been quashed for non-direction on a possible defence are those concerned with charges for murder: see 
 Bullard

 Mensah

In this case, it was abundantly clear from a perusal of the grounds of decision that the trial judges had considered the question whether or not the appellant had an honest and reasonable belief that LHH was dead or alive when she was thrown out of the flat. They set out 
 verbatim 
 the s 121 and s 122(6) statements of the appellant. They reviewed the appellant`s account of the events in the flat he gave in the witness box with the account he gave in his written statements and the accounts he gave to his friends. They also considered the evidence of N. Having done all these, the trial judges concluded as follows: 
 
We were satisfied beyond all reasonable doubt that on the totality of the evidence the accused had thrown the deceased out of the kitchen window of his flat deliberately and that the accused was conscious that the deceased was then still alive. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The above finding could not be anything else but a direct and conscious consideration of the appellant`s unsworn and retracted statements that he thought that LHH was dead when he threw her out of the flat.
We do not need to decide the point, which does not arise in this appeal, whether, if the trial judges had in fact omitted to direct their minds to the appellant`s belief that LHH was dead before he threw her out of the flat, it would have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. We make two observations here. Firstly, unlike in the cases we have referred to above, the appellant went into the witness box and retracted both his unsworn written statements. His sworn testimony was that LHH had committed suicide. When he cross-examined the pathologist, he asked him only one question which had any bearing on his belief. He asked the pathologist whether LHH had died of strangulation. The answer was `No`. He did not cross-examine the pathologist on whether there were any marks on LHH`s neck which might suggest a strangulation or force being applied to the neck. In 
 Chan Kin Choi v PP 
 ,16 this court held that a trial court was entitled to reject entirely any exculpatory statements in a confession on the ground that they were unworthy of belief, where the accused had elected not to give evidence in his own defence and relied only on his unsworn and untested exculpatory statements. In this case, the appellant expressly rejected his own exculpatory statements when he testified that LHH committed suicide. Secondly, the appellant`s sworn defence was wholly inconsistent with the defence that he had thrown her out of the flat, whether or not in the belief, honest or otherwise, that she was dead. This was quite a different situation from that in 
 Porritt 
 9 or 
 Baillie-Smith 
 ,13 in both of which, the non-direction related to the mens rea of the accused and not the actus reus. In this case, the appellant raised the issue of actus reus by way of defence.
We accordingly found that there was no merit in the first ground of appeal.
The second ground of appeal was that the trial judges should not have believed the evidence of N as it was unsatisfactory having regard to the following factors: that his statement about having told the whole story to Insp Fauzee was untrue, that five witnesses mentioned by N were not called to give evidence, that N was only 15 years old then, that he ran away from home and could not remember his home address or that of his friend at which he had stayed, that he contradicted himself as to the distance at which he alleged he saw the appellant throwing out LHH, that he was not sure whether he actually saw the appellant with LHH two or three weeks before the incident, that he alleged he saw LHH being thrown out horizontally when the body landed vertically, that the most important aspect of his evidence (that he saw LHH being thrown out of the window) was sketchy and unconvincing, etc. The submission was that (1) N could not have seen the appellant at the window, or (2) if he did, he could not have seen LHH struggling at all, whether weakly or otherwise.
We do not propose to enumerate the other matters which counsel took issue with in regard to N`s evidence. In sum, counsel was merely suggesting that the appellant`s version of how LHH fell to her death was to be preferred to that of N. The trial judges had particular regard to the fact that the appellant defended himself. They also paid particular regard to the fact it was only until after the commencement of the trial that N had disclosed to the police what he had seen on the day of the incident. They, however, accepted his explanation for the omission to do so in that his mother did not want him to get `involved`, but that later the incident began to haunt him even in his dreams. It was an issue of credibility, and on this issue the trial judges, having seen N and the appellant in the witness box and assessed the way they gave their testimonies, believed N and not the appellant, having regard to the totality of the evidence before them. We were of the view that their findings of fact were justified by the evidence before them. Notwithstanding the gravity of the offence for which the appellant was convicted, there was no legal basis on which we could interfere with the findings of fact of the trial judges.
The final ground of appeal was that the trial judges, in arriving at their verdict, misdirected themselves in placing undue emphasis and consideration on a catalogue of evidence concerning the conduct of the appellant after the fall of LHH in arriving at their verdict. This ground was practically abandoned by counsel in his oral address to us. We found nothing in it.
For the above reasons, the appellant`s appeal against conviction was dismissed.

Rape with hurt is one of the more serious offences in the Penal Code (Cap 224). It is for that reason that Parliament provided for a minimum mandatory sentence of imprisonment with caning.
As a matter of sentencing principle, where the appellant is of mature age and understanding, he should be given a custodial sentence. Therefore exceptional circumstances are necessary in order that a custodial sentence be not imposed.
As a general rule, neither probation nor reformative training is suitable in cases of rape. In this case, the learned judge had taken into consideration all the mitigating factors. Before us there is not much scope to mitigate since the minimum mandatory sentence provided by law was given.
The appeal is concerned with a question of principle, ie whether reformative training is an appropriate sentence for the appellant. There are no reasons why the appellant should be sent for reformative training as there were no circumstances to justify that course. The appeal is accordingly dismissed.

This was an appeal against conviction and sentence on a charge of conspiracy and abetment to commit grievous hurt under s 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`). At the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeal and we now give our reasons.
The charge upon which the appellant was convicted was as follows: 
 
That you between December 1984 and 4 July 1985 in Singapore, did engage with one Muhundan a/l K Kumaran, one Pitchay Rasoo, one K Gangadaran (deceased), one Vellusamy s/o Valliyappan, one Shamuganathan @ Shamuganathan a/l S Neelakandan, one Lopez Joseph Benny, one Stephen Raja Ratnam and one Lopez Xavier Legory Benny in a conspiracy to commit grievous hurt to one Ramasamy s/o Packrisamy and in pursuance of that conspiracy and in order to the doing of that thing, an act took place on 4 July 1985 at Taman Permata, Singapore, to wit, a quantity of formic acid was splashed on the said Ramasamy s/o Packrisamy by one or more of you, which act caused severe burns to his person resulting in his death, and you have thereby abetted the commission of an offence under s 326 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) which act was committed in consequence of your abetment and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 109 read with s 326 of the same Code.
 
 
 
He was sentenced to ten years` imprisonment.
The appellant was at the time of the offence a newspaper distributor. The victim was one P Ramasamy, then aged 64, who was the chairman and chief executive officer of the National Co-operative Federation. Due to the injuries sustained the victim died some ten days later. The offence was committed just outside the victim`s residence at No 170, Taman Permata, off Thomson Road.
The evidence of the prosecution showed that the appellant had a brother by the name of Retanasamy, who had died sometime in 1967. The appellant was appointed the co-administrator of the estate of Retanasamy. The wife of Retanasamy, one Kasiammal, was the co-administratrix of the estate. The appellant claimed to be entitled to certain business operations of Retanasamy. This led to civil litigation which resulted in the appellant`s claim being dismissed by the court and the appellant having to pay damages. In the meantime the appellant was removed as a co-administrator of the estate and Ramasamy was appointed in his stead. The appellant felt that it was Ramasamy who instigated the sister-in-law against him. Accordingly, sometime in December 1984 the appellant decided to teach the victim a lesson; he wanted revenge.
At about that time, one Raja Ratnam was supplying labourers for the newspaper distributing business of the appellant. The two of them became close friends. The appellant confided to Raja Ratnam his personal and financial problems. He told Raja Ratnam that his whole life had been made miserable by Ramasamy. Speaking in Tamil, he wanted Raja Ratnam to get people `to break a hand or a leg` of Ramasamy and to send him to hospital. The request was made in December 1984. Raja Ratnam then had an office on the third level of Coronation Plaza, which is at the junction of Bukit Timah Road and Coronation Road.
Raja Ratnam passed the request to his manager, one Lopez Joseph Benny (`Lopez`). Lopez first sought the help of his brother, one Lopez Xavier Legory Benny (`Xavier`) who told Lopez to contact one Pitchay Rasoo (`Rasoo`), who in turn put Lopez onto another person by the name of Muhundan. Muhundan said that he could find the men to do the job. Muhundan then brought in Gangadaran, Shamuganathan and Vellusamy. We would add that the appellant was so anxious about the matter that even before Raja Ratnam could speak to Lopez, the appellant had already contacted Lopez. The appellant told Lopez that he wanted `(Ramasamy`s) one leg or one hand to be broken or one hand to be taken out but whatever (they) do, he must be admitted in hospital`. On one occasion the appellant also took Raja Ratnam and Lopez in his car and showed them where Ramasamy`s residence was. Eventually a sum of $5,000 was mentioned and agreed upon for the `hit` job. In March 1985, on being asked for a deposit, the appellant told Raja Ratnam to deduct a sum of $2,000 from their newspaper account. Raja Ratnam handed the money to Lopez, who in turn passed it on to the other conspirators.
Thereafter the appellant now and again asked Raja Ratnam what had been done with regard to Ramasamy. Occasionally he also enquired from Lopez. Sometime towards the end of June 1985, Vellusamy and Shamuganathan rented a car at Johore Bahru for the purpose of carrying out the job. Muhundan also asked Vellusamy and Shamuganathan to obtain acid. Vellusamy and Shamugadrove to Ulu Tiram, Johore, where Vellusamy bought the acid.
On 2 July 1985 sometime after 12 noon, Gangadaran, Vellusamy, Rasoo and Lopez waited at the corridor outside the office of Raja Ratnam at Coronation Plaza. A little later, the appellant came and all five of them adjourned to a nearby canteen on the same level to discuss the appellant`s problem with Ramasamy. They were at the canteen talking for about an hour. It should be noted that by this time Vellusamy had already bought the acid to be used on Ramasamy.
On 4 July 1985 at about 8am, Gangadaran drove the car to a spot near to where Ramasamy lived, and Vellusamy got down from it. At about 10.07am when Ramasamy came out from his residence, Vellusamy threw the acid at him. Ten days later, Ramasamy died. The senior forensic pathologist, Professor Chao Tzee Cheng certified the cause of death as `septicaemia due to inhalation of acid fumes`. In his opinion, Ramasamy died as a result of the acid thrown on him.
News of the acid attack was reported on the same day in the afternoon English newspaper, 
 The New Nation 
. That same afternoon the appellant saw Lopez and five others (Rasoo, Muhundan, Vellusamy, Gangadaran and Xavier) who were involved in the conspiracy. On the morning of 5 July 1985, Raja Ratnam saw the appellant in the latter`s office on some business matters and also told him that the persons involved would be coming to get payment from him. The appellant asked Raja Ratnam to deduct the remaining $3,000 from their mutual account. But Raja Ratnam refused, saying `Nothing doing. This is something very serious, I don`t want to get involved in this. Don`t involve me. You go and deal with them and pay the money to them.` That same afternoon the appellant came to Raja Ratnam`s office. Also present were Lopez, Xavier, Rasoo and Shamuganathan. The appellant placed two or three bundles of $50 notes on Raja Ratnam`s table in payment of the job done. Raja Ratnam told the appellant to take the money away saying it was evil money. The group then left Raja Ratnam`s office and went to the canteen where the appellant paid those people. Subsequently those people demanded more money and the appellant also paid them.
Of the persons involved in the crime, Gangadaran died while in remand. Vellusamy, Muhundan, Rasoo and Shamuganathan pleaded guilty to a charge of abetment and conspiracy to commit an offence under s 4 of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65) and they were sentenced to eight years` imprisonment and eight strokes of the cane, ten years` and eight strokes, eight years` and eight strokes, and six years` and six strokes respectively. However, in the case of Raja Ratnam, Lopez and Xavier, they were not charged in court but were detained by the authorities under the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (Cap 67).
One of the witnesses for the prosecution was Raja Ratnam. While admitting that he did procure the services of others to injure Ramasamy, he denied that the use of acid was ever mentioned. He said he was shocked when he heard that acid was used on Ramasamy. He also said that the appellant was similarly shocked. But he agreed that the Tamil idiomatic expression `must break his hand or leg` meant to cause hurt. It would be serious hurt. It need not literally mean breaking a hand or a leg. It could also mean some other kind of harm. He also agreed that the expression, however, had nothing to do with the means by which grievous hurt would be caused.
The second witness for the prosecution was Lopez whose evidence differed from that of Raja Ratnam in two material respects. According to Raja Ratnam, the appellant knew of the acid attack only on 5 July 1985. But according to the evidence of Lopez the appellant knew of the acid attack on 4 July 1985. This was because in the afternoon of that very day the appellant met Rasoo, Vellusamy, Shamuganathan, Muhundan, Xavier and Lopez at Coronation Plaza. Xavier, the third prosecution witness, also confirmed that the appellant was there on 4 July 1985.
The second area where Lopez`s evidence differed from that of Raja Ratnam`s related to the reaction of the appellant when the appellant was told of the acid attack on Ramasamy. The evidence of Lopez on this aspect was as follows: 
 
 
Q: What was Sinniah Pillai`s reaction? 
 
A: Because Sinniah Pillai, he is not sad about it, he is not worried about it. Maybe he is a bit happy because the job had been carried out. 
 
Q: Yes, how did you get that impression? 
 
A: Look at his face.
  
 
 
At the close of the prosecution`s case at the trial, counsel for the appellant, Mr Gray, submitted that there was no case to meet on the charge. While Mr Gray conceded that the prosecution had established that the appellant was a party to the conspiracy to commit grievous hurt to Ramasamy, an offence under s 325, he contended that the evidence did not show that the appellant was guilty of a charge under s 326. He submitted that there was no evidence that the appellant wanted acid to be thrown on Ramasamy. He said there was no proof whatsoever that the conspiracy involved the use of acid. The learned trial judge rejected the submission and called upon the appellant to enter upon his defence. He chose to remain silent and was accordingly convicted of the charge and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of ten years.
Section 325 of the Code provides that `whosoever voluntarily causes grievous hurt shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years ...`. Section 326 provides that `whosoever ... voluntarily causes grievous hurt ... by means of any poison or any corrosive substance ... shall be punished with imprisonment for life or with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years and shall also be liable to fine or to caning`.
On the hearing of the appeal, very much the same arguments were canvassed before us. Counsel for the appellant submitted that the distinction between s 325 (which carries a lighter sentence) and s 326 (which carries a heavier sentence) is that the accused must have specific knowledge of the means whereby grievous hurt is caused. Accordingly, he submitted that it was wrong for the trial judge to have convicted the appellant of the charge under s 326 since the appellant was unaware of the method to be employed by those people whom he had engaged to cause grievous hurt and he had no intention of causing grievous hurt to Ramasamy by the use of acid.
In further elaboration, Mr Gray submitted that what the appellant had engaged the people to do was to inflict some traumatic bodily injury to Ramasamy. Splashing of acid on Ramasamy was never contemplated by the appellant. The idiomatic Tamil expression could not be extended to cover the use of acid. Mr Gray relied heavily on the evidence of Raja Ratnam who said that it was not within contemplation that acid should be thrown at the victim; the conspiracy was only to beat the victim up. He contended that the learned trial judge was wrong to have said that it was inconceivable that the assailants would not have told the appellant that grievous hurt was to be caused by acid. He asserted that that statement was not supported by the evidence and accordingly that the conviction was against the weight of the evidence.
Mr Gray also pointed out that it was significant that the appellant was not charged under the same Act as the other persons involved in the conspiracy. This could only mean that the appellant did not realize that acid was to be used.
We will first refer to what the learned trial judge found on the critical question of whether the appellant knew of or connived in the use of acid. This was what he said: 
 
Lastly, at the close of the prosecution case there was, in my view, sufficient evidence which was not inherently incredible that Sinniah Pillai knew or would have known that the assailants would use acid to cause grievous hurt to Ramasamy. There was the evidence that on 2 July Sinniah Pillai was in the canteen with Gangadaran, Vellusamy, Rasoo and Lopez for about an hour. Raja Ratnam said that they were discussing Sinniah Pillai`s problem. On this evidence, it seemed to me inconceivable that the assailants would not have told Sinniah Pillai that grievous hurt was to be caused to Ramasamy by the use of acid. It was all the more so since Vellusamy had already bought the acid in Johore. I was fortified in the view I took because there was the further evidence that after the incident, in the afternoon of 4 July, Sinniah Pillai did nothing to dissociate himself from the deed perpetrated by the assailants. There was no disavowal by him. Instead, on being satisfied that the assailants had caused grievous hurt to Ramasamy, he paid them for it. And, when they wanted more money, he obliged them.
 
 
 
We were unable to accept the submission of Mr Gray that there was no basis for the learned trial judge to have found that the appellant `knew or would have known that the assailants would use acid to cause grievous hurt to Ramasamy`. It was reasonable for the learned trial judge to have drawn the inference that the appellant knew that acid would be used. In addition, we would refer to the evidence of Lopez, which we have quoted above, in which he described the reaction of the appellant when the latter heard that acid was used on Ramasamy; Lopez said that he had the impression that the reaction of the appellant was that of a person who was pleased that the job had been done. In this regard we noted that there was the conflicting evidence of Raja Ratnam who said that when he told the appellant on 5 July 1985 that acid had been thrown on Ramasamy, the appellant was surprised that acid was used and was depressed. But here it must be recalled that the incident was reported in the afternoon newspaper on 4 July 1985. The appellant was also told on the same day. We are of the view that the seriousness of what he had caused to Ramasamy had slowly dawned on him overnight. His behaviour on 5 July 1985 was consistent with his having such knowledge. We would observe that Raja Ratnam was not really concerned with the implementation of the conspiracy. He left that to the people whom Lopez had engaged. Thus he did not even join them at the discussion which the appellant had with those people on 2 July 1985 at the canteen. Considering all the circumstances we were satisfied that the trial judge was not wrong in finding that the appellant had prior knowledge and connived in the use of the acid.
In any case, the evidence clearly pointed to the fact that what the appellant wanted done to Ramasamy was that he was to be injured to such an extent that he would be sent to hospital. As explained by Raja Ratnam, the Tamil idiomatic expression `must break his hand or leg` did not necessarily mean that a hand or leg must, literally, be broken. The expression meant hurt of a serious nature, ie grievous hurt. The appellant had not specified the means to be adopted to cause the grievous hurt. He left it entirely to the discretion of the co-conspirators. What was done by the co-conspirators was within the scope of his instructions to cause grievous hurt to Ramasamy so that he would be sent to hospital.
The fact that the appellant was charged under a different Act from that of the co-conspirators is neither here nor there. It is nothing unusual to find that a given set of facts can give rise to a number of different charges. It is the prerogative of the prosecution to decide which charge it would prefer.
For all these reasons, we are satisfied that the appellant was properly convicted under s 326 of the Code.
Turning to the question of sentence, counsel for the appellant contended that the sentence was manifestly excessive. He made two points in support of his contention: first, the appellant should have been treated as if he had pleaded guilty to the charge, and therefore an appropriate discount on the sentence should have been given to him. He submitted that the appellant had not really challenged the evidence adduced by the prosecution, and that as he was prepared to admit to a charge under s 325, the trial was in effect to determine a point of law as to whether his acts as proved fell within the terms of s 326. Counsel said that he was entitled to rely on any legal defence. Secondly, the trial judge was wrong in not backdating the sentence to the date of the appellant`s remand, with the result that he had to serve almost another three years of imprisonment. Counsel said that the appellant`s age and health should have been taken into account. He further argued that the first reason should also have been taken into account for the purpose of backdating.
We were unable to accept the argument that the appellant ought to have been treated as if he had pleaded guilty. The fact was he pleaded not guilty, as a result of which the prosecution had to prove its case. Even though counsel for the appellant limited his cross-examination to establishing that the appellant had no knowledge that formic acid would be used, the prosecution was in fact put to prove the main ingredients of the offence. Credit is given for a plea of guilty because it tends to show remorse on the part of the accused and also because it saves the court and prosecution time and expense. In putting the prosecution to proof of its case, neither factor could operate in favour of the appellant.
With reference to the second argument, the power of the court to backdate a sentence of imprisonment is a discretionary power. The trial judge decided not to backdate the custodial sentence of the appellant in this case. All the relevant facts were before the trial judge. The maximum sentence for the offence was life imprisonment and caning. The appellant was sentenced to ten years` imprisonment. He escaped caning because he was then 62 years of age. His fellow conspirators had pleaded guilty and were sentenced to between six to ten years` imprisonment and were given six to eight strokes of the cane. Their sentences were not backdated. The offence was a heinous one. Throwing formic acid on a person is a particularly vicious and painful way to injure him. In this case, the victim died.
In the circumstances, it could not be shown that the trial judge had erred in not giving to the appellant a discount on the custodial sentence and not backdating it to the date of his arrest. Nor were we satisfied that the sentence without taking into account the backdating was manifestly excessive, having regard to the circumstances of the case. The appeal against conviction and sentence was accordingly dismissed.

These were applications for writs of habeas corpus made by the respective applicants on the ground that they were being unlawfully detained by the first respondent at Changi Prison pending extradition proceedings against them under the Extradition Act (Cap 103) (`the Act`). At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed all the applications and said I would give my reasons later.
 OM No 32 of 1991
On 2 March 1991 and on the following two days, after the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) received intelligence information, SLL and two others who were all CNB officers kept surveillance on the applicant (`SK`), a Thai national wanted by the United States government for drug offences, and who was then staying in a hotel in Singapore. On 4 March 1991, the US Embassy in Singapore, under cover of a third party note dated 4 March 1991 (TNP 083/91) sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (`MFA`), a certified true copy of each of (a) a Warrant For Arrest 91-0294M issued by a US district court on 1 March 1991 and (b) a Complaint 91-0294M filed in the said US district court relating to SK. On the same day, MM, Head of Enforcement Division of CNB, also received from HF, a US Embassy attache, copies of the said documents. He handed them to RM, another CNB officer, who immediately filed a complaint under s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`) and sought a warrant of apprehension under s 10(1)(b) of the Act for the arrest of SK.
The magistrate, having examined the complainant on oath in accordance with s 133(1) of the CPC, issued a Warrant of Apprehension No 4/91. At about 4.20pm, RM contacted SLL and informed him of the issue of the warrant of apprehension, and 15 minutes later the CNB officers arrested SK at the hotel. He was then brought back to CNB headquarters where RM showed him the warrant of apprehension and also informed him that he had been arrested under the said warrant.
On 5 March 1991, SK was brought before a district judge who, exercising the powers of a magistrate under the Act, remanded him for a week at Queenstown Remand Prison. On 12 March 1991, SK was again remanded for 14 days at Queenstown Remand Prison. On the same day, the Director of Prisons, in exercise of his powers under s 32 of the Prisons Act (Cap 247) and after considering the request in writing of MM, made an order to transfer SK to Changi Prison for the purpose of remand. The transfer was made on 13 March 1991. On 26 March 1991, the district judge again remanded SK until 19 April 1991. SK was again remanded from 19 to 26 April 1991 and from 26 April 1991 until 24 May 1991. However, on 3 May 1991 SK was brought up before the district judge who then varied the remand order by making a fresh remand order for seven days. Thereafter SK was being remanded on periods of seven days each and was detained at Changi Prison for that purpose.
On 24 April 1991, the Minister for Law received from the US Embassy the certified and authenticated depositions filed with the US district court in support of the request for the extradition of SK, SS and PB. On 30 April 1991, the Minister issued notices under s 9(1)(b) of the Act to the district judge in respect of the applicants. The effect of these notices was that the district judge must then proceed, under s 11(6) of the Act, to convene a hearing to determine whether the applicants should be committed to prison to await the warrants of the Minister for their surrender to the United States government.
 OM Nos 33 and 34 of 1991
On or about 20 February 1991, the US Embassy in Singapore, under cover of a third party note (TNP No 057/91), sent to the MFA the following documents relating to the applicant in OM No 33/91 (`SS`) and the applicant in OM No 34/91 (`PB`): (a) a warrant of arrest issued by a US district court on 30 January 1991 and (b) a certified true copy of an indictment containing 11 counts for various drug offences committed in the United States of America; and (c) a summary of the evidence against the said applicants.
Following similar formalities and procedures outlined in respect of OM No 32/91, Warrants of Apprehension Nos 2/91 and 3/91 were issued by the district judge against SS and PB who were arrested at Changi International Airport on 1 March 1991 and informed of the reason for their arrest. They were produced before the same district judge on 2 March 1991 and remanded at `A` Division until 8 March 1991, then subsequently from 8 to 22 March 1991 partly at `A` Division, and partly at Queenstown Remand Prison. On 13 March 1991, they were transferred to Changi Prison on the direction of the Director of Prisons made under s 32 of the Prisons Act (Cap 247). Thereafter, they were remanded from 22 March 1991 to 19 April 1991, 19 to 26 April 1991, and then from 26 April 1991 to 24 May 1991. Similarly, on 3 May 1991, they were brought before the district judge who varied the current remand order by making a fresh remand order for seven days. Like SK, they were subsequently remanded for periods of seven days at a time.
 Case for the applicants
Counsel for the applicants contended that his clients had been and were being deprived of their personal liberty contrary to art 9 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore in that their arrest and subsequent remands in Changi Prison were not in accordance with law, viz the Act. A number of arguments was advanced in support of this submission. Before I consider these arguments, it is convenient to set out below, for present purposes, the provisions of the Act relevant to the present proceedings. 
 
 
(9) (1) Subject to subsection (2), where a requisition for the surrender of a fugitive who is, or is suspected of being, in Singapore is made to the Minister by a foreign State, the Minister may, in his discretion - 
 
(a) if a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive has not been issued under section 10, by notice in writing in accordance with Form 1 in the Second Schedule and directed to a Magistrate, inform the Magistrate that the requisition has been made and authorise him to issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive; or 
 
(b) if a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive has been issued under section 10 and a person has been apprehended under the warrant, by notice in writing in accordance with Form 2 in the Second Schedule and directed to a Magistrate before whom the person may be brought, inform the Magistrate that the requisition has been made. 
 
 (2) If the Minister is of the opinion that the fugitive is not liable to be surrendered to the foreign State, he shall not give a notice under subsection (1) in respect of the fugitive. 
 
(10) (1) Where - 
 
(a) a Magistrate is authorised by the Minister by a notice under section 9(1)(a) to issue a warrant for the apprehension of a fugitive; or 
 
(b) an application is made as prescribed to a Magistrate for the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of a fugitive who is, or is suspected of being, in Singapore, 
 
and there is produced to the Magistrate such evidence as would, in his opinion, according to the law in force in Singapore, justify - 
 
(i) the apprehension of the fugitive by a member of the Singapore Police Force without the issue of a warrant; or 
 
(ii) the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive, 
 
if the act or omission constituting the extradition crime had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of Singapore, the Magistrate shall issue a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive in accordance with Form 3 or 4, as the case may be, in the Second Schedule. 
 
 (2) Where a Magistrate issues a warrant under this section without having been authorised by the Minister by a notice under section 9(1)(a) to issue the warrant, the Magistrate shall forthwith send to the Minister a report stating that he has issued the warrant and the evidence produced to him on the application for the warrant. 
 
(11) (1) A person who is apprehended under a warrant issued in pursuance of section 10 shall, unless he is sooner released, be brought as soon as practicable before a Magistrate. 
 
 (2) The Magistrate may remand a person brought before him under this section, either in custody or on bail, for a period or periods not exceeding 7 days at any one time and, where a Magistrate remands a person for such a period, the person may, at the expiration of the period, be brought before that Magistrate or before any other Magistrate. 
 
 (3) In the application of subsections (4) to (8) in relation to a person who has been apprehended under a warrant issued in pursuance of section 10, ""Magistrate"" means the Magistrate before whom the person is brought after he was apprehended or at the expiration of a period for which he has been remanded under this section, as the case may be. 
 
 (4) If the person was apprehended under a warrant issued otherwise than in pursuance of an authority by the Minister in a notice under section 9(1)(a), the Magistrate shall remand the person in accordance with subsection (2) until the Magistrate receives a notice under section 9(1)(b) from the Minister informing the Magistrate that a requisition for the surrender of the person has been made to the Minister by a foreign State. 
 
 (5) Where the Magistrate does not receive such a notice within such time as is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances, the Magistrate shall - 
 
(a) if the person apprehended is held in custody - order that he be released; or 
 
(b) if he has been admitted to bail - make an order discharging the recognizances upon which he was admitted to bail. 
 
(1) 
 Were the applicants in lawful remand custody? 
  
 
 
As the applicants had been arrested under warrants of apprehension issued under s 10(1)(b), the district judge had no power to remand them in custody for more than seven days at any one time as mandated by s 11(4) read with s 11(2). Accordingly, some of the remand orders made by him were ultra vires. Counsel for the applicants accordingly argued that these unlawful remand orders rendered unlawful all subsequent remand orders even though they complied with s 11(2). He relied on the authority of 
Metropolitan Police Commissioner v Hammond.
 
[1965] AC 810
 In that case, the House of Lords held, in a case concerning the mutual backing of warrants, that the arrest of the respondent could not be ordered in the absence of an endorsement by the inspector general as required by the relevant United Kingdom Act, even though that office had been abolished by the Irish Parliament.
State counsel, on the other hand, contended that, in habeas corpus proceedings, past illegality was irrelevant and the only issue before the court was whether at the date of the return of the writ, the applicants were in lawful custody. The court was not concerned with any prior illegal act unless it vitiated the present cause of detention. He referred to a passage from 
 RJ Sharpe on The Law of Habeas Corpus 
 (2nd Ed) at p 179 and the decision of the Supreme Court of India in 
Narajan Singh v State of Punjab
 
[1952] AIR SC 106
 which followed the decision of the Federal Court of India in 
Basanta Chandra Bose v Emperor
 
[1945] AIR FC 18
 on this point. Both the said decisions concerned preventive detention cases. State counsel accordingly contended that the applicants were in lawful detention at the date of the return of the writs as on that date they were in custody under valid remand orders.
I accepted the submission of state counsel. The principle was too well established. In habeas corpus proceedings, the court is not concerned with past illegality unless such illegality subsists and vitiates the present detention. In 
United States of America v Gaynor
 
[1905] AC 128
 where the US government sought the extradition of the respondents from Canada whose extradition law was the same as that of the United Kingdom, the Privy Council said, at p 134: 
 
Now the only question which the learned judge had to determine was whether the accused were at the time of the issue of the writ in question in lawful custody. If they were, he had no jurisdiction to release them, but was bound to remand them in custody. 
 Hammond
`s case had no application nor was the decision of the House of Lords inconsistent with established principle as the invalidity of the warrant of apprehension in that case was incurable: it was not signed and could not be signed by the officer under the relevant law, the post having been abolished by statute. The arrest and subsequent custody of Hammond were illegal at all times.
 
 
 
I also agreed with state counsel that each remand order was a fresh remand order, and that as the remand orders subsisting at the return of the writs were valid remand orders, the applicants were in lawful custody for the purpose of these proceedings. 
 
 
(2) 
 Was there a valid requisition for the surrender of the applicants? 
  
 
 
It was contended by counsel that there was a failure to comply with s 9(1) of the Act in that the third party notes, TNP 083/91 and TNP 057/91, expressly requested the 
 provisional arrest 
 of the applicants and not, as required by s 9(1), the 
 surrender 
 of the applicants. In my view, this argument was based on a misunderstanding of the scheme of the Act. A warrant of apprehension may be issued by the magistrate under s 10(1) upon the authorization of the Minister acting under s 9(2) or upon the complaint of any person under s 10(2). The latter subsection provides a summary procedure for the issue of a warrant of apprehension to avoid any delay that may be involved in a foreign government proceeding by way of a requisition to the Minister under s 9(1). Any delay may result in the escape of the fugitive. Accordingly, a requisition in terms of s 9(1) is not a condition precedent to the issue of a warrant of apprehension under s 10(1)(b), but only to the issue of a warrant of apprehension issued at the request of the Minister under s 9(1). The warrants of apprehension relating the applicants were issued under s 10(1)(b) of the Act. 
 
 
(3) 
 Were the applicants in lawful remand in Changi Prison? 
  
 
 
Counsel for the applicants also argued that the applicants were unlawfully remanded at Changi Prison as the Director of Prisons transferred them to Changi Prison contrary to orders of the district judge that they be remanded at Queenstown Remand Prison. In my view, there was no substance in this argument. It was true that the district judge had made an order for the remand of SS and PB at Queenstown Remand Prison (but, from the court file, the case of SK was entirely clear). However, under s 32 of the Prisons Act (Cap 247) the Director of Prisons was vested with a discretionary power to transfer any prisoner (which expression, as defined in s 2 thereof, included each of the applicants) to any prison within Singapore. It was a power to transfer as distinct from the court`s power of remand. The court`s power of remand could not validly impinge on the power to transfer. The court could not take away the power of the Director of Prisons by specifying the place of remand.
Counsel also argued that the transfers were made by the Director of Prisons in bad faith with a view to breaking the will of the applicants. I found no evidence whatever to support the allegation of bad faith. The Director of Prisons swore an affidavit that he transferred the applicants to Changi Prison upon an application by the CNB officers based on security grounds. There was no evidence to suggest that he transferred them for any other reason. Short of proof of mala fides, the court could not interfere with the exercise by the Director of Prisons of his discretionary power in this respect: see 
R v Secretary of State for the Home Department, ex p McAvoy
 
[1984] 1 WLR 1408
[1984] 3 All ER 417
 But even if, which was not the case, the applicants` remand in Changi Prison were illegal, they were only entitled not to be held in custody at Changi Prison. The order of the Director of Prisons, if made in breach of the law, would be subject to judicial review for the purpose of quashing it. Its illegality did not render the remand of the applicants illegal per se. This court would simply send them back to Queenstown Remand Prison or an authorized prison for remand. 
 
 
(4) 
 Were the applicants lawfully apprehended? 
  
 
 
It was also submitted by counsel for the applicants that the magistrate had no legal basis for issuing the warrants of apprehension. This submission went to the jurisdiction of the magistrate and, if right, would render their detentions illegal, based as they were on the summary warrants. A number of arguments was made in support of this submission.
The first was that there was no evidence or sufficient evidence before the magistrate to show that the applicants had committed any offence for which their extraditions were being sought. This argument was based on two grounds: (a) that the evidence adduced before the magistrate was hearsay evidence and was therefore not admissible under the Evidence Act (Cap 97), and (b) that, in the cases of SS and PB, the magistrate had looked at evidence which was not referred to in the complaint made by RM.
With respect to (a), counsel contended that in s 10(1), the words `there is produced to the Magistrate such evidence as would, in his opinion, 
 according to the law in force in Singapore 
, justify ... (ii) the issue of a warrant for the apprehension of the fugitive` were referable to evidence as defined in and admissible by virtue of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). He contrasted these words with s 8 of the UK Extradition Act 1870 (`the 1870 Act`) which did not contain them. He submitted that the additional words rendered inapplicable the authorities decided under s 8 of the 1870 Act which state counsel had relied on. The 1870 Act was part of the laws of Singapore until its repeal by the Act. Section 8 provided as follows: 
 
Issue of warrant by police magistrate, justice, etc.
 
 
 
A warrant for the apprehension of a fugitive criminal, whether accused or convicted of crime, who is in or suspected of being in the United Kingdom, may be issued -
 
 
 
 
(1) [not applicable]; and 
 
(2) By a police magistrate or any justice of the peace in any part of the United Kingdom, on such information or complaint and such evidence or after such proceedings as would in the opinion of the person issuing the warrant justify the issue of a warrant if the crime had been committed or the criminal convicted in that part of the United Kingdom in which he exercises jurisdiction.
  
 
 
The decisions cited by state counsel were 
 R v Wei 
 
l
 
[1882] 9 QBD 701
 which was followed by a Singapore court in 
Re Said Mohamed (No 1)
 
[1911] De Mello 587
 In 
R v Weil
 
[1882] 9 QBD 701
 the Court of Appeal decided that hearsay evidence was admissible as the section merely required the magistrate to be satisfied, 
 in his opinion 
, and that it was a judicial discretion. Jessel MR said: `There must be some evidence, but very little will do, for it is merely for the purpose of detaining the man.` In 
Re Said Mohamed (No 1)
 
[1911] De Mello 587
 Fisher J held that it was no objection to a provisional warrant that it was issued on information contained in a telegram from the Governor of the Celebes to the Dutch Consul in Singapore stating that the prisoner had committed embezzlement of a large sum of money and jewellery, and asking for the prisoner`s provisional detention, and stating that the warrant for his arrest would follow.
I rejected counsel`s submission that the additional words in s 10(1) of the Act had imported the hearsay provisions of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). When 
Re Said Mohamed (No 1)
 
[1911] De Mello 587
 was decided, the Evidence Act was also in force and so was the CPC. In relation to the Evidence Act, there was no reason why, if the Evidence Act were applicable at all, it was not applicable to s 8(2) of the 1870 Act when it was part of the laws of Singapore. The absence of the words `according to the law in force` would not have made the hearsay provisions in the Evidence Act any the less applicable as they were in force as law. The Evidence Act was and is a general statute governing the admissibility of evidence in judicial proceedings in or before any court to prove the existence of any fact in issue. I venture to suggest that hearsay evidence is admissible in an application under s 10(2) of the Act because, at that stage, the magistrate is not required to make any finding of fact but simply to consider whether the evidence, assuming it were admissible, is sufficient, in his opinion, to justify the issue of a warrant of apprehension. The magistrate in hearing an application under s 10(2) of the Act is not conducting an extradition hearing but merely initiating the process of bringing the fugitive to his presence for the purpose of conducting such a hearing.
This conclusion was consistent with the position under s 133 of the CPC. It is settled law that hearsay evidence is admissible in a complaint made under s 133 of the CPC: see 
 Mallal`s Criminal Procedure Code 
 (4th Ed) at p 176. The procedure for making an application under s 10(2) has not been prescribed. Accordingly, RM`s applications could only be made by way of complaints under s 133. I had no doubt that the magistrate had jurisdiction in relation to all matters under the Act: see s 8(1)(e) and s 19 of the Act, and s 2(7) of the CPC.
In my view, therefore, the addition of the words `according to the law in force in Singapore` did not effect any change in the law in force when the Act came into force. In the instant cases, the documentary hearsay evidence produced before the magistrate was more than sufficient to justify the issue of the warrants of apprehension against the applicants.
With respect to argument (b), it could not be disputed that the summary of the charges against SS and PB was produced before the magistrate together with the indictment as the magistrate had included a copy thereof in his report to the Minister under s 10(2) of the Act. I was satisfied that the summary formed part of the indictment and therefore need not be certified separately as a true copy. In any event, even without the summary, there was sufficient evidence contained in the indictment itself to justify the issue of the warrants of apprehension against SS and PB. There was no merit in this argument. 
 
 
(5) 
 Were the warrants of apprehension issued or signed? 
  
 
 
Counsel contended that the applicants were not in lawful custody as, firstly, there was a doubt as to whether the magistrate had issued the warrants of apprehension or some other orders, and secondly, if he did issue the warrants, they were unsigned when the applicants were arrested. What had happened here was that the complaints of RM were typed on standard printed forms each of which consisted of two pages. Page 1 was a blank sheet (for the complaint to be entered) and p 2 contained a column with the words: `Issue notice/warrant/summons against [ABC] under section ...` under which was the title `Magistrate`. Depending on the kind of order the magistrate issued, he was supposed to cross out the other two orders he did not issue, so as to specify the order he did issue. He also had to specify the provision of the written law. In the instant cases, the magistrate signed each of the forms to signify he made orders, but did not specify the particular orders. Hence the doubt.
In my view, this argument had no merit. The terms of each complaint itself included an express prayer for a warrant of apprehension to be issued against the relevant applicant under s 10(1)(b) of the Act. In signing the form, the magistrate could not be signifying the making of any order other than the one prayed for. I had no doubt about it.
With respect to the argument that the applicants had been arrested on unsigned warrants of apprehension, none of the applicants made this allegation in their affidavits. They could not do so as they denied having been shown the relevant warrants. The argument was made by counsel solely on the basis that none of the warrants included in the reports to the Minister bore the magistrate`s signature, original or copy. I was asked to infer from this that the original warrants could not have been signed. I was not prepared to do so for the following reasons: firstly, this was a serious allegation of dereliction of duty against the magistrate made by way of a submission where the magistrate was given no opportunity to explain the apparent irregularity. Secondly, the court files, which were produced to me upon my direction, contained copies of signed warrants of apprehension. In my view, the unsigned copies of the warrants of apprehension exhibited in the said reports to the Minister did not necessarily imply that the original warrants under which the applicants were arrested had not been signed. 
 
 
(6) 
 Were the alleged offences extraditable crimes? 
  
 
 
Counsel also submitted that the evidence produced to the magistrate did not disclose that any of the applicants had committed any extraditable crimes.
In the case of SK, no charge or indictment had been made against him. The warrant of arrest issued by the US district court was based on a complaint to the said court that SK, in March 1988 within the Eastern District of New York and elsewhere, and others did knowingly and intentionally distribute more than 1kg of heroin in violation of Title 21 US Code s 842(a)(1) and of Title 18 US Code s 2. SK deposed that he had never been to the United States and therefore could not have committed any offence in that country. The complaint itself did not specifically allege that SK had been in the United States at any time but that SK had arranged for the heroin to be transported from Bangkok to the United States for distribution therein.
In the case of SS and PB, the warrants of arrest issued by the US district court were based on a grand jury indictment charging them with: (1) conspiracy to import heroin into the United States; (2) distribution of heroin in Thailand knowing that the heroin would be imported into the United States; (3) importation of heroin into the United States; and (4) distribution of heroin. These charges were framed under various sections of Title 21 US Code and Title 18 US Code. There was no express allegations in the indictment that SS and PB had committed any drug offences in any place within the United States. In their applications, both SS and PB also deposed that they had never been to the United States and therefore could not have committed any offence in that country.
In support of his submission that an offence, to be extraditable, must be one committed in the territory of the state which was seeking extradition, counsel referred to 
Attorney General of Our Lady the Queen for the Colony of Hong Kong v Kwok-A-Sing
 
[1873] 5 LR PC 179
 In that case, Ordinance No 2 of 1850 of Hong Kong provided that where it appeared to a magistrate that there was probable cause for believing that a Chinese, who had taken refuge in Hong Kong, had committed `any crime or offence against the laws of China` he might be imprisoned with a view to his being surrendered to the Government of China. The respondent was accused of having murdered a French captain on a French ship at sea. The Privy Council held, inter alia, (1) that it could not be assumed without evidence that there was any law in China to punish a Chinese subject for murder committed upon a foreigner within foreign territory, and (2) that even if it could be so assumed, still the offence ought to be treated as an offence against French and not as an offence against Chinese law.
Counsel submitted that no evidence was produced to the magistrate to prove that the offences alleged against the applicants were extraditable and that such fact could not be assumed. In my view, this argument was not relevant at this stage of the proceedings. 
 Kwok-A-Sing 
`s case8 was concerned with 
 committal 
 proceedings. Under s 10(2), the magistrate was not required to decide this issue. Nor was it his duty. His duty was to decide, in accordance with the terms of s 10(1)(b), whether the evidence produced to him would, in his opinion, justify the issue of the warrants of apprehension ` 
 if the act or omission constituting the extradition crime had taken place in, or within the jurisdiction of Singapore 
`. On that criterion, the applicants were undoubtedly subject to apprehension under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). Even conspiracies to commit offences under Cap 185 which take place outside Singapore are within the jurisdiction of Singapore: see s 13.
In the 
United States of America v Gaynor
 
[1905] AC 128
 the appellants sought to extradite the respondents from Canada for conspiracy to defraud the United States government. The judge freed the respondents on the return of the writ of habeas corpus on the ground that they had been wrongfully remanded by the Extradition Commissioner under the Extradition Act (RSC Cap 142). The Privy Council, in allowing the appeal, said (at p 137): 
 
The substance of Caron J`s determination appears to have been that no offence within the meaning of the Extradition Act was shewn upon the document that had been brought before him by a writ of certiorari. Their Lordships are wholly unable to agree with him. There was an accusation of theft, which is an offence in both countries; but the learned judge does not appear to have apprehended that an accusation, on information, of theft was enough for the claim to arrest and detain. Whether the accusation was well founded, or whether there was enough to justify the Extradition Commissioner in committing for surrender, was a question which would have been regularly brought before him and determined at the proper time if the due course of justice had not been interfered with by the interposition of the learned judge. The learned judge accurately points out that a conspiracy is not an offence within the treaty, and because an indictment for conspiracy has been framed in which acts of larceny are charged as overt acts of conspiracy, the learned judge seems to think that the United States government are estopped from treating them as distinct and independent acts of larceny. The whole matter, and, inter alia, how much evidence there was of larceny, would have been duly and properly investigated if the case had been allowed to take its proper course.
 
 
 
 
(7) 
 Were the applicants fugitives? 
  
 
 
Counsel also contended that the applicants were not fugitives as defined by the Act. Section 2(1) defines a fugitive as follows: 
 
a person who is accused of an extradition crime that is alleged to have been committed, or convicted of an extradition crime that was committed 
 at a place within the jurisdiction
 of a declared Commonwealth country or a foreign State or of a part of such country or State and is, or is suspected to be, in Singapore. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
It was argued that since the applicants had never been in the United States, and also that the criminal acts alleged against them had taken place in Singapore, Hong Kong and Bangkok, the extradition crimes were not committed at any place within the jurisdiction of the United States.
In my view, this argument had no merit by reason of s 2(2) of the Act which provides as follows: 
 
A reference in this Act to a fugitive from a foreign State or declared Commonwealth country shall be read as a reference to a fugitive accused of an extradition crime that is alleged to have been committed, or convicted of an extradition crime that was committed, at a place in that foreign State or declared Commonwealth country 
 or within the jurisdiction of, or of a part of, that State or country
. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
Section 2(2) makes it clear that it is sufficient for the purposes of the Act that the fugitive in question is alleged to have committed an extradition crime within the jurisdiction of the state seeking extradition. It is not necessary for such a crime to be committed at a place within the jurisdiction of that state. Conspiracy to commit a crime is extraditable under para B of the First Schedule to the Act which lists, inter alia, the following as a returnable offence: 
 
Aiding and abetting, or counselling or procuring the commission of, or being an accessory before or after the fact to, or attempting or conspiring to commit, any of the offences listed in paragraph A. 
(8) 
 Was oppression, if proved, a ground for release? 
 
 
 
It was argued by counsel that the applicants had been subject to oppressive acts by the prison authorities, firstly by the Director of Prisons in transferring the applicants to Changi Prison, and secondly by the first respondent in putting them in solitary confinement and denying them access to members of their family in order to break their will and physical well-being.
I have already given my reasons for finding that the complaint against the Director of Prisons had no substance whatever. As regards the allegations against the first respondent, the prisons` doctor filed an affidavit stating that he had examined the applicants and found them to be physically well. The first responalso affirmed affidavits that the applicants were not kept in solitary confinement but in separate cells for their own safety and security, that they had frequent access to their relatives on and after 19 April 1991, and that they had been medically examined on five occasions and their medical condition was found satisfactory. The applicants were also given access to their solicitors. In the circumstances, the allegations could not be proved. In fact, the applicants` allegations referred only to the short period before they were given access to their relatives and solicitors. If the prison authorities had acted unlawfully, the applicants were entitled to sue them for the wrongful acts, but they were not entitled to be released: see 
Chng Suan Tze v Minister of Home Affairs & Ors
 
 
[1989] 1 MLJ 69

 Observations 
  
 
 
Counsel for the applicants raised many issues, all of which I have rejected either as unfounded in law or fact. In the 
United States of America v Gaynor
 
[1905] AC 128
 the Privy Council said (at pp 137-138, immediately after the passage I have earlier quoted herein): 
 
Their Lordships do not mean to suggest that the writ of habeas corpus is not applicable when there is a preliminary proceeding. Each case must depend upon its own merits. But where a prisoner is brought before a competent tribunal, and is charged with an extradition offence and remanded for the express purpose of affording the prosecution the opportunity of bringing forward the evidence by which that accusation is to be supported; if, in such a case, upon a writ of habeas corpus, a learned judge treats the remand warrant as a nullity, and proceeds to adjudicate upon the case as though the whole evidence were before him, it would paralyze the administration of justice and render it impossible for the proceedings in extradition to be effective.
 
 
 
The proceedings are very simple: information and arrest; then - either at once or on remand - the judge investigates the case, and either discharges or makes up his mind to commit for extradition, and, if he does the latter, he has to inform the accused person that he will not be surrendered for 15 days, in order to afford him an opportunity of bringing the legality of his surrender before a court of justice.
These observations were apposite to these applications. The applications were misconceived and were accordingly dismissed.

Wang Coo-Kien & Co Pte Ltd (`Wang`), who were the second defendants in this action, had entered into a contract for the construction of part of a marine terminal at Pulau Busing off Jurong. The project involved the jointing and welding of steel pipes. Wang sub-contracted this work to the appellants/first defendants Siew Kong Engineering Works (`Siew Kong`). For the sub-contract work Siew Kong required specialized welding equipment which they did not have. The first respondents/first plaintiffs Lian Yit Engineering Sdn Bhd (`Lian Yit`), a Malaysian company, had the necessary equipment. Siew Kong approached Yoong Wan Hoi (`Yoong`), the second respondent/second plaintiff, who was a director of Lian Yit, for assistance. As a result the required equipment was sent down to Singapore.
The precise nature and terms of the arrangement between the respondents and Siew Kong was a matter of dispute. It was the case of Lian Yit and Yoong that the equipment had been hired by Lian Yit to Yoong for $25,000 per month; that Yoong had entered into an agreement with Siew Kong to do the jointing and welding works as sub-contractor of Siew Kong; that the equipment was sent to Pulau Busing pursuant to this agreement; and that subsequently two of the 35 pieces of equipment were sold by Lian Yit to Yoong.
Yoong alleged that Siew Kong defaulted in payment for work done by him and he commenced an action in the High Court (Suit No 1441 of 1989) for $68,112.20 against Siew Kong and Wang for such work. Siew Kong and Wang denied this claim. As a result of this dispute the respondents wanted to retrieve the equipment from Pulau Busing but encountered difficulties. They therefore commenced these proceedings alleging detinue and conversion against Siew Kong and Wang and sought, inter alia, an order for the delivery of the equipment and $25,000 per month for the wrongful use of the equipment from 11 July 1989 to date of redelivery.
Siew Kong denied that Yoong was their sub-contractor and claimed that they had in fact purchased the equipment for a sum of $68,000 from Lian Yit. Siew Kong therefore claimed a right of ownership and exclusive possession over the equipment.
At the trial two issues arose for consideration by the learned judicial commissioner GP Selvam. These were: (a) whether there had been detinue, conversion or wrongful use of the equipment by Siew Kong and Wang; (b) whether Lian Yit and Yoong were entitled to claim special damages at $25,000 per month as claimed and/or general damages.
The learned trial judge disbelieved Siew Kong`s claim that they had purchased the equipment from Lian Yit. He found that that claim was an afterthought conjured up by Siew Kong when Siew Kong found that the documentation prepared by Lian Yit for the purpose of clearing the equipment through the Malaysian customs lent itself to such a construction. He found that there was no sale of the equipment by either of the respondents to Siew Kong and that there was wrongful use of the equipment by Siew Kong. As for damages the learned trial judge was not satisfied that Yoong had rented the equipment from Lian Yit for $25,000 per month and was of the view that $25,000 per month was an excessive amount. Accordingly, he ordered that special damages for the period 11 July 1989 to 30 April 1990 (when the equipment was returned under an order of court) be assessed and paid by Siew Kong to the respondents. The learned trial judge found no evidence of any liability on the part of Wang (the second defendants) and dismissed the claim against them.
In his grounds of judgment, the learned trial judge stated that for the purpose of determining whether there was detinue, conversion or wrongful use of the equipment by Siew Kong/Wang and for determining whether the respondents were entitled to the claim of special damages at $25,000 per month and/or general damages, it was not necessary for him to decide which of the two plaintiffs Siew Kong had an agreement with. He held that as the claim was in tort he could treat both Lian Yit and Yoong jointly as a single entity.
The above statement by the learned trial judge formed the first ground of appeal canvassed before us. Counsel for Siew Kong submitted that if Yoong did hire the said equipment from Lian Yit, then only Yoong was entitled to maintain an action for conversion. It was submitted that the learned trial judge erred in law in treating both Lian Yit and Yoong jointly as a single entity.
The right to bring an action for conversion or wrongful detention of goods generally lies with the person who, at the time of conversion, either had actual possession of the goods in question, or had the immediate right to possess the goods. This proposition is stated as follows in Vol II 
 Chitty on Contracts 
 (26th Ed) at para 2651: 
 
Where the bailment is for reward and for a period to be determined in accordance with the agreed terms (as in hire or pledge) the bailee enjoys both possession and the immediate right to possession during the period; hence the bailee can, and the bailor cannot, sue a third person for trespass or conversion during that period.
 
 
 
As Lian Yit had hired (and in respect of two items sold) the equipment to Yoong, the above principle would apply and Lian Yit would not have been able to maintain their action against Siew Kong; only Yoong would have been able to do so. We would note, however, that the wrongful joinder of Lian Yit as a plaintiff can make no difference to the finding by the learned trial judge that Siew Kong had wrongfully detained and made use of the said equipment.
 Misjoinder
The effect of misjoinder of parties is dealt with in O 15 r 6(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court (Cap 322, R 5)(1990 Ed). It provides as follows: 
 
No cause or matter shall be defeated by reason of the misjoinder or nonjoinder of any party; and the Court may in any cause or matter determine the issues or questions in dispute so far as they affect the rights and interests of the persons who are parties to the cause or matter.
 
 
 
At or before the hearing of this action, no objection was made by Siew Kong under O 15 r 6(2) to Lian Yit being a party to the action. That being so, the learned trial judge was entitled, as he did in this case, to determine the matter on the basis of the parties in fact present before the court. In our view, the fact that Lian Yit should not have been joined as a party does not, in the circumstances, invalidate the decision of the learned trial judge.
 Damages
The second ground of appeal raised was that the learned trial judge erred in holding that the respondents were entitled to special damages. It was submitted that (a) Yoong had failed to plead particulars of special damages and was therefore not entitled to it; and (b) that as the respondents had not adduced evidence of actual loss suffered as a result of the alleged detention quantified in terms of having to pay hire charges and being unable to use the equipment they would be entitled only to nominal damages.
 Special damage not pleaded
In its generally accepted sense `special damage` or `special damages` relate to past pecuniary loss calculable at the date of trial, whilst `general damage` or `general damages` relates to all other items of damage whether pecuniary or non-pecuniary (see 12 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed) para 1113). As for the way a claim for damages is to be pleaded, the rule, as summarized in 
 Halsbury 
 at para 1197, is as follows: 
 
In his statement of claim the plaintiff must give particulars of his special damage, but he need not give particulars of his general damage unless the damage is of a kind which is not the necessary and immediate consequence of the defendant`s wrongful act. Thus if he proposes to allege that there are special circumstances whereby he has suffered damage which would not ordinarily flow from the defendant`s wrongful act he must plead those circumstances so that the defendant is not taken by surprise.
 
 
 
It is not true to say that the respondents in this case had failed to plead particulars of special damage. They have clearly done so. It was pleaded that the equipment was rented by Yoong from Lian Yit at $25,000 per month and the respondents claimed that sum for the wrongful use of the equipment from 11 July 1989 to the date of redelivery. What happened in this case was that the learned trial judge was not persuaded that Yoong had in fact contracted to pay Lian Yit $25,000 as hire for the equipment. He felt that in view of the somewhat casual attitude of the respondents towards the preparation of documentation and the evidence before him that such equipment could be rented for a lower figure, the claim for $25,000 per month could not be supported and did not represent a fair rental for the equipment. Instead of then going on to assess what the fair rental value of the equipment should be, the learned trial judge adopted the suggestion of the respondents that the damages payable for the wrongful detention/conversion of the equipment be remitted to the registrar for assessment.
 No actual damage
It was submitted that as the learned trial judge had rejected the respondents` claim that Yoong had hired the equipment from Lian Yit for $25,000 per month, and as Yoong had not, as at the date of trial, paid any part of the alleged rental of $25,000 per month to Lian Yit, and as there was no evidence that the respondents had, as a result of the alleged wrongful detention, been unable to carry out any order or had incurred expenses in having to hire similar equipment, no actual damage had been suffered by the respondents and hence damages payable should at best be only nominal.
In 
Strand Electric and Engineering Co Ltd v Brisford Entertainments Ltd
 
[1952] 2 QB 246
[1952] 1 All ER 796
 the Court of Appeal had to consider what the appropriate measure of damages in cases of wrongful detention of goods should be. Denning LJ (at p 253 of the report) stated the position in the following words: 
 
The question in this case is: What is the proper measure of damages for the wrongful detention of goods? Does it fall within the general rule that the plaintiff only recovers for the loss he has suffered or within some other, and if so what, rule? It is strange that there is no authority upon this point in English law; but there is plenty on the analogous case of detention of land. The rule there is that a wrongdoer, who keeps the owner out of his land, must pay a fair rental value for it, even though the owner would not have been able to use it himself or to let it to anyone else. So also a wrongdoer who uses land for his own purposes without the owner`s consent, as, for instance, for a fair ground, or as a wayleave, must pay a reasonable hire for it, even though he has done no damage to the land at all: 
 Whitwham v Westminster Brymbo Coal Co
 [1896] 2 Ch 538. I see no reason why the same principle should not apply to detention of goods.
 
 
 
If a wrongdoer has made use of goods for his own purposes, then he must pay a reasonable hire for them, even though the owner has in fact suffered no loss. It may be that the owner would not have used the goods himself, or that he had a substitute readily available, which he used without extra cost to himself. Nevertheless the owner is entitled to a reasonable hire. If the wrongdoer had asked the owner for permission to use the goods, the owner would be entitled to ask for a reasonable remuneration as the price of his permission. The wrongdoer cannot be better off because he did not ask permission. He cannot be better off by doing wrong than he would be by doing right. He must therefore pay a reasonable hire.
Somervell LJ, in considering this question, was careful to draw a clear distinction between a wrongdoer who merely detains the goods without deriving any benefit from the detention and a wrongdoer who detains the goods with a view to deriving a benefit. At p 250 of the report he states: 
 
There may be a distinction in the measure of damage in detinue between, say, a warehouseman who merely stores and a person who during the period of detention enjoys the beneficial use of the chattels. It is the latter case with which, in my opinion, we are concerned.
 
 
 
and later at p 252 he continues: 
 
It is curious, as I have said, that there is no authority on this point. The nearest analogy is a claim for mesne profits. The measure there is a reasonable sum in the nature of rent for the user during the period of the defendant`s trespass. In other words, the defendant must pay what the plaintiff would have obtained if the defendant had lawfully been in possession. In principle the same measure should, I think, apply where a defendant has detained and used a chattel of the plaintiff which the plaintiff, as part of his business, hires out to users. I have added these latter words because I do not wish in this so far uncharted field to go beyond the facts of the case.
 
 
 
In the present case, the equipment was detained by Siew Kong in order to make commercial use of it. By such detention Siew Kong had denied to the respondents the use of their equipment. Adopting the decision of the Court of Appeal in 
Strand Electric and Engineering Co Ltd v Brisford Entertainments Ltd
 
[1952] 2 QB 246
[1952] 1 All ER 796
 we do not think that a person who has wrongfully detained for his own use property belonging to another should be allowed to profit from this detention on the grounds that the wronged party had not incurred any expenses or had any occasion to use the equipment during the period of the detention.
The learned trial judge had taken the view that the claim of $25,000 per month as the charge for the hire was not supportable and he had ordered that an inquiry be held as to what the reasonable hire charge should be. We can see no reason to upset the decision of the learned trial judge.
We see no merits in this appeal and accordingly we dismiss this appeal with costs.

On 24 February 1993 the petitioner pleaded guilty in the district court to the following charge: 
 
You ... are charged that you, on or about 18 April 1992 at about 11.25pm, along Lorong 40, Geylang, Singapore, which is a public place, did have in your possession an offensive weapon, to wit, a 20 inch wooden pole with an improvised rubber grip, otherwise than with lawful authority or for a lawful purpose, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65).
 
 
 
In mitigation, his counsel made submissions which are recorded in the notes of evidence thus: 
 
Accused is 30 years old with Primary 6 education. Helping mother to run fruit and vegetable stall in Redhill market ... Accused has to work late nights and early mornings to help mother purchase items and help set up stall. Accused had intended to use stick to help in carrying fruit and vegetables in basket ...
 
 
 
The petitioner was convicted and sentenced to three months` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. He now asks this court to exercise its revisionary powers to quash the conviction and set aside the sentence on the ground that his plea of guilt ought to have been rejected by the district judge because his plea in mitigation had constituted an assertion that he was carrying the wooden pole for lawful purposes.
The essential contentions for the prosecution were, first, that the petitioner ought to have given relevant and admissible evidence of his lawful purpose in possessing the wooden pole; secondly, that the lawful purpose asserted by the petitioner was implausible and, in any case, his plea in mitigation was contradictory; and thirdly, the alleged lawful purpose had no relevance to his possession of the wooden pole at the time and place stated in the charge.
All of these arguments may be quickly disposed of by the recollection that evidence is never required for the process of taking a plea. It is the accused person`s right to plead guilty or not guilty, as he chooses. Whatever he elects to say at that stage, it is not for the court to investigate its truth. Either his plea amounts to a guilty plea or it amounts to a plea of not guilty - that is all that the court is to decide. The truth or relevance, even the logic, of the assertions made by the accused in response to the charge against him being read to him is a matter for testing at trial, not at the stage when his plea is taken.
As such, I have had no difficulty in deciding for the petitioner in this case. Accordingly, the conviction is quashed and the sentence is set aside, and the case is remitted back to the district court for trial.

This was an appeal from the decision of judicial commissioner Rubin wherein the appellant was found guilty of murder under s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and given the mandatory death sentence. The appeal was against conviction and sentence. At the end of the hearing, the appeal was unanimously dismissed. We now give our reasons.
 The case for the prosecution
The appellant was charged as follows: 
 
That you, Nadunjalian s/o Rajoo on or about 17 December 1990, at about 9 pm, at the car park beside Block 111, Serangoon North Avenue 1, Singapore, committed murder by causing the death of one Ambalagan s/o Rathanam, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
At the time of the offence the accused was 21 years of age and the deceased was 25. The deceased was a friend of the accused and they would often go for rides together on the deceased`s motorcycle. The three main eye-witnesses to the incident were Selvaraju s/o Sakkarapani (`Selvaraju`), Ravi Chandran s/o Mardum Mutu (`Ravi`) and Kajandran s/o Jeyabalan (`Kajandran`). These three persons were friends of the accused and the deceased and they would meet from time to time at a coffee shop at Block 107 Serangoon North Avenue 1 (`the coffee shop`) and share a few drinks together.
Sometime before the fateful day, the accused heard from one Ramesh that the deceased had called the accused `a fellow without testicles - a coward`. On the night of 17 December 1990, at about 6.30 pm or 7 pm the accused went to the coffee shop for a drink and a meal. The deceased joined him some time later. According to the accused, they chatted for a while before the accused asked the deceased whether he had said something `which is not true and something which is bad` about the accused, referring to what the accused had heard from Ramesh. The accused testified that the deceased replied abusively, saying `Elladah, thayoli` (`No-dah, mother fucker`).
Shortly thereafter, Ravi and Selvaraju joined them. The accused spoke to Ravi and Selvaraju but did not speak again to the deceased. After a short while, Kajandran joined them. When all five were seated at the table, the accused once again calmly asked the deceased about the abusive words the deceased had spoken. The deceased was silent, but a few seconds later he got up and addressed the accused and said, `Yekke I have to talk to you in private; come with me.` (Yekke was the accused`s nickname.) The accused asked, `What has happened to you?`. The deceased replied, `No, you just follow me.`.
The accused rose from the table, turned to the others and said, `Come with me.`. They followed at a distance. The deceased led the way followed by the accused about 12 ft behind. Some 30 to 35 ft behind the accused were the three eye-witnesses.
According to the evidence, the party of five walked from the coffee shop towards a PUB substation a little more than 100 m away. Surrounding the PUB substation were some tall bushes. The deceased and the accused were obscured from the sight of the three eye-witnesses by the tall bushes when they turned into the substation.
 Evidence of the three eye-witnesses
The three eye-witnesses all gave similar accounts of what happened next. They testified that at first they heard nothing. Then the sound of a fight reached them. The three eye-witnesses ran towards the substation. When they arrived, they saw the deceased bleeding from his back. The accused was stabbing him. They held the accused back, one holding his left hand, the other his right hand, and the last his body. The accused tried to free himself from them, hurling abuses at them and telling them to leave him. The deceased walked away in pain. The accused then managed to free himself from the three eye-witnesses and ran after the deceased. He pushed the deceased to the ground, sat on him and continued stabbing him.
The three eye-witnesses then ran to the accused and pulled him away. They left the deceased lying on the ground and went their separate ways home.
 Cause of death
The deceased was found with serious injuries and groaning in pain and was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where he was pronounced dead at 10.25 pm that day. The forensic pathologist, Professor Chao Tzee Cheng, who performed the autopsy, testified that the deceased had suffered some 24 wounds all over his body, head and limbs. The cause of death was haemorrhage from multiple stab wounds. In particular, the fatal wounds were: 
 
 
(1) A 2.5 cm long stab wound on the left chest to a depth of 11 cm. This went in through the second intercostal space and penetrated the lung. It was directed in a downward and medial direction towards the centre of the body. 
 
(2) Three stab wounds 1.5 cm long each and a cut wound 4 cm long on the left side of the abdomen. Two of the stab wounds were penetrating horizontally inwards to a depth of 12 cm cutting into the posterior abdominal wall. These caused extensive internal bleeding.
  
 
 
Professor Chao said that considerable force appeared to have been used in causing the fatal wounds and that they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
 The accused`s s 122(6) statement
In the course of the prosecution`s case, a statement recorded from the accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) was introduced by the DPP. Defence counsel took objection to the admissibility of the statement and a trial-within-a-trial was conducted. The investigating officer, Akbal Ahmad, gave evidence on the procedure he followed in recording the statement. He also testified that the statement was recorded by him without any threat, inducement or promise either by the interpreter or by himself before or during the recording of the statement. However, during the cross examination of this witness, defence counsel withdrew his objection to the admissibility of the statement. The statement was thus duly admitted and read in court.
On the basis of the evidence presented by the prosecution, the trial judge found that a case had been made out against the accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. The accused was accordingly called upon to enter on his defence.
 The defence
The accused testified that he was very close to his mother, particularly after the separation of his parents. He was very protective of her and loved her very much. As a Hindu, he regarded his mother as God. He knew the deceased and, although they were not very close, they had a good relationship. Prior to the incident, he had heard the deceased uttering vulgarity but had kept quiet. Then, there had been no vulgarity directed at the accused`s family.
On the night of the incident, the deceased had joined the accused at the coffee shop although they had not planned to do so. After the exchange of words already described, the deceased got up and asked the accused to follow him. The accused testified that he left the table without any weapons. He was wearing a pair of shorts and a T-shirt tucked into his shorts. As he was following the deceased towards the PUB substation, the accused heard him murmuring, `Fellow without testicles; son of cunt.` The deceased then turned around and glanced at the accused and said, `mayirandi` (`pubic hair fellow`). The accused said that he had not been incensed by all this because the deceased had not looked directly at him when he said those words. The deceased turned into the substation and the accused caught up with him. As they stood facing each other, however, the deceased pointed a finger at the accused and said, `Para punda maganai; para thevadiya magane.` (`Pariah son of a cunt; pariah son of a prostitute.`)
At these words the accused testified that he became incensed and punched the deceased. A fight ensued. The deceased took a few steps back, put his right hand behind his back and said that he had had sex with the accused`s mother. The deceased then said, `I will not leave you without killing you today` and thrust his right hand, which was wielding a knife, towards the chest of the accused. The accused managed to grab the knife from the deceased and started stabbing at the deceased in fury. The accused testified by then that he had lost his senses. He was furious because the deceased had insulted his mother by calling her a prostitute. He was reflecting on whether he was the son of a prostitute and whether the deceased had had sex with his mother. He said that he was feeling `uncomfortable` and demonstrated this on the stand by shaking and flapping his hands and his limbs. He claimed that he had lost his senses and no longer knew what was happening. When he finally regained his senses, the deceased was lying on the floor. He walked away and dropped the knife into a drain.
 The s 122(6) statement and the issue on appeal
The evidence given by the accused at the trial was in some ways opposed to his s 122(6) statement under the CPC which had been admitted during the trial. The text of the statement was as follows: 
 
... On 17 December 1990 which was a Monday, Ambalagan [the deceased] and I were sitting together in a coffee shop. Both of us were drinking beer. Whilst both of us were talking, we had an argument. Whilst we were arguing, I saw three of my friends walking past the coffee shop. I then called them to sit with me and Ambalagan. All of us started talking and the argument between Ambalagan and I developed further. Ambalagan then rose from his seat. I also got up and told my other three friends namely Kajandran, Ravi Chandran and Selvaraju to follow me. Ambalagan had told me to follow him to the area outside the Indian temple nearby to have a further talk about our argument. Ambalagan walked first and I was a few steps behind him whereas my three friends were a few steps behind me. When we reached outside the temple, near to the power station, Ambalagan and I faced each other and talked. We were still quarrelling and my three friends were nearby just watching me and Ambalagan. Suddenly, Ambalagan and I started to fight. My three friends just watched and were not involved. As we were fighting, Ambalagan fell in front of the power station. 
 At this juncture, I took out my knife which I kept in the rear right pocket of my shorts. I then used the knife and stabbed Ambalagan
. As I was slightly tipsy, I cannot remember how many times I stabbed Ambalagan but I knew that I had stabbed him many times all over his body. My three friends on seeing this, rushed towards me and tried to stop me from stabbing him further. They held my right hand in which I was holding the knife. I scolded my three friends and warned them not to get involved. After they released my right hand, I carried on stabbing Ambalagan a few times after which I stopped. Ambalagan was lying on the floor. I then told my three friends to go off from the scene. I then left the place alone and walked home. On my way home, I threw the knife which I was holding into a drain which was beside a pavement. ... (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The admission of this statement was in fact the sole ground of appeal in the appellant`s supplementary petition of appeal tendered at the hearing, the other grounds having been abandoned. This ground of appeal stated in the supplementary petition was as follows: 
 
That the learned trial judge erred in law and deprived your petitioner the full benefit of a fair trial in that there was clear evidence from your petitioner that he had in fact been induced and/or threatened into co-operating with the investigating officer before the recording of the s 122(6) statement (exh P50). In the respects aforesaid, the crucial question of admissibility of the said s 122(6) statement fell to be reconsidered by the learned trial judge as a question of law. In failing to convene a further trial-within-a trial, to redetermine the question of admissibility of the said statement, the learned trial judge gravely erred in law, and which error clearly affected the defence of your petitioner who was consequently deprived of a fair trial.
 
 
 
A review of what happened at the trial is therefore appropriate here.
When the statement was sought to be admitted by the prosecution at the trial, defence counsel had objected to its admissibility. However, during the cross- examination of the investigating officer, Inspector Akbal Ahmad, who was the first witness, defence counsel withdrew his objection to the admissibility of the statement. The relevant portions of the notes of evidence were as follows: 
 
 
MrYogendran: Sir, I have no further questions. I am reserving these areas. Sir, my only objection to the statement is only on one particular line.
  
 
 
 
His Honour: So, that`s all you have ? 
 
Mr Yogendran: Yes, that`s all. 
 
His Honour: All right, Mr Ong ? 
 
DPP: Your Honour, I have no questions. 
 
His Honour: What do you mean no questions ? 
 
DPP: Because he is not objecting to the statement, so there is no allegation of assault. 
 
His Honour: Yes, in that case you still have to prove that the statement is made voluntarily. Don`t you have to tender the statement if he has no further objection to the statement itself? Mr Yogendran, you have no objection to the statement being read ? 
 
Mr Yogendran: No objection.
  
 
 
Nothing more was said at the trial about the admissibility of the statement, either by defence counsel, or by the DPP. The statement was accordingly admitted and read. The defence was then called.
On the stand, the accused admitted that he had made the statement but testified that it was only partly true. Defence counsel proceeded to go through each sentence of the statement with the accused asking which of the sentences were true and which were false. At the end of the accused`s examination-in-chief, defence counsel asked the accused why he had given the statement to Inspector Akbal. The accused`s answer was: 
 
After the incident, I was in a state of shock and I was afraid. I was thinking to myself that I had stabbed a good friend and I stayed at home. ... After I was brought to the CID, I was still very frightened and did not know what to say. ... Inspector Akbal said if I did not co-operate with him, he would lock me up. This further frightened me. This is why I gave a statement in which some is true and some is false.
 
 
 
Before us counsel for the appellant argued that at this point the trial judge ought to have reconvened the voire dire to redetermine the admissibility of the s 122(6) statement, but had failed to do so.
The attempt by the accused to retract the s 122(6) statement was dismissed by the trial judge. He found the manner and nature of the retraction to be extraordinary and he considered that the retracted portions of the statement referred to some significant aspects of the incident, viz: 
 
 
(1) that the accused had carried a knife with him in the rear right pocket of his shorts; 
 
(2) that the accused had used his knife to stab the deceased; 
 
(3) that he repeatedly stabbed the deceased; and 
 
(4) that he then threw the knife away into a drain.
  
 
 
The trial judge went on to consider the authorities where accused persons have been convicted on the basis of retracted confessions. The general principle from these authorities is that, so long as the court is satisfied of the truth of the confessions, irrespective of the retraction of the confessions, the accused person can be convicted. He found that the accused`s account that the deceased had so basedly demeaned and vilified his mother was untrue and, on the basis of the evidence, he found that the s 122(6) statement was true. Having done so, he went on to consider the available defences and found that none were applicable to the facts of the case. The accused was therefore found guilty on the charge and sentenced to death.
 Should a voire dire have been reconvened ?
The only authority cited by the appellant was 
 Ajodha v The State and other 
 
appeals,
 
[1981] 2 All ER 193
 a Privy Council decision on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Trinidad and Tobago. The appellants in that case had been convicted on different charges solely on the basis of their confessions. It was alleged on appeal that while the confessions had been signed by the appellants, their signatures were involuntary in that they had been threatened or induced to sign the documents. It was further argued that the appellants had not been aware of the contents of the documents that they had signed. The Privy Council allowed the appeals and quashed the convictions on the basis that the trial judge should have considered the admissibility of the statements once there was an allegation that the statements were not voluntarily signed.
Before us, Mr Fernando for the appellant argued on the basis of 
Ajodha
 
[1981] 2 All ER 193
 that once it appeared to the court that a confession was tainted, in that it had been induced or threatened out of the accused, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to convene or re-convene a voire dire to determine the voluntariness of the statement. He argued that the instant case fell within the situation described in the judgment of Lord Bridge in 
Ajodha
 
[1981] 2 All ER 193
 at p 201 para h: 
 
... The accused admits making the statement (orally or in writing) but raises the issue that it was not voluntary. This is a simple case where the judge must rule on admissibility, and, if he admits the evidence of the statement, leave to the jury all questions as to its value and weight.
 
 
 
Mr Fernando submitted that defence counsel had made a tactical move described in 
Ajodha
 
[1981] 2 All ER 193
 at p 202 of the judgment para j as follows: 
 
Though the case for the defendant raises an issue as to the voluntariness of a statement ..., defending counsel may for tactical reasons prefer that the evidence bearing on that issue be heard before the jury, with a single cross-examination of the witnesses on both sides, even though this means that the jury may hear the impugned statement whether admissible or not. If the defence adopts this tactic, it will be open to defending counsel to submit at the close of the evidence that, if the judge doubts the voluntariness of the statement, he should direct the jury to disregard it or, if the statement is essential to sustain the prosecution case, direct an acquittal. Even in the absence of such a submission, if the judge himself forms the view that the voluntariness of the statement is in doubt, he should take the like action propio motu.
 
 
 
We could not see any merit in this particular submission regarding a tactical move particularly in the context of our procedure and practice where the trial judge sits without a jury and is both judge of fact and of law.
Mr Fernando further submitted that since the accused had himself raised the issue of voluntariness for the first time when giving evidence, the trial judge should have, in his discretion, required relevant witnesses to be recalled for further cross-examination. The failure to exercise this discretion, it was argued, was a substantial miscarriage of justice such as to have deprived the appellant of a fair trial.
We found ourselves unable to agree with Mr Fernando. First, we were of the opinion that 
Ajodha
 
[1981] 2 All ER 193
 can be easily distinguished on the facts. In that case it was pointed out by Lord Bridge that the counsel for the appellants had presented evidence, both in the cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses and in the examination of the accused persons, that they had not been aware of the contents of the statements and also that they had been compelled to sign the statements. As that had been raised to a sufficient extent in those cases, it was found that the failure of the trial judges to have convened a voire dire was `an injustice of a substantial character`. Nothing of that sort appears in the instant case. There is merely an assertion by the accused, almost as an afterthought, that the statement had been made involuntarily as a result of threats and coercion. The matter was never put to the investigating officer of the case in cross-examination. In fact, defence counsel had begun by objecting to the admissibility of the statement but had inexplicably withdrawn his objection within minutes of cross-examining Inspector Akbal. This puts the instant case outside the scope of the proposition in Ajodha.
Still on the question of the facts, the allegation in Ajodha was that the appellants had been coerced into signing the statements in ignorance of their content. From this arose some confusion based on a fallacious distinction made between a statement that had been made involuntarily by the accused person and a statement that was not that of the accused person. This confusion resulted in the decisions that were ultimately overturned by the Privy Council. In this case, the allegation is not that the statement was not made by the appellant. In fact he admitted authorship of the confession but sought in defence to retract substantial portions of his statement. There was no confusion such as to have caused both defence counsel and the trial judge to have made a mistake which would have caused substantial injustice. The situation was simple and could easily have been dealt with under the standard procedures of a trial-within-a-trial. That opportunity was afforded to the appellant. He took up the opportunity, but, for some inexplicable reason, withdrew his objection.
Secondly, on principle, we were unable to agree with Mr Fernando that 
Ajodha
 
[1981] 2 All ER 193
 should be applied in order to restore to the appellant his right to a fair trial. To do so would be tantamount to allowing him two bites of the apple. The latitude given to the accused persons in Ajodha should not be extended to one such as the appellant. He was properly represented by counsel. Counsel had objected initially to the admissibility of the statement. A trial-within-a-trial was duly conducted. Evidence was given by the investigating officer that the statement was properly recorded in accordance with the procedure prescribed by law and was given by the accused voluntarily. In the midst of his cross-examination, counsel withdrew his objection to the admissibility of the statement. There was no evidence that the appellant had been deprived of a fair opportunity to present his case.
We do not think that 
Ajodha
 
[1981] 2 All ER 193
 was intended to stand for the broad proposition that a trial judge is required to convene a trial-within-a-trial wherever and whenever some mote of doubt is raised by the accused as to the voluntariness of his statement. The consequences would be ludicrous. It would mean that even though no objection was taken to the voluntariness of a confession when the proper opportunity arose, an objection could be taken at a later stage in the trial if the accused happened to say that he had been coerced into making the confession. To convene a voire dire at that stage would be to waste the court`s time in recalling witnesses who could very well have been questioned on the same issues earlier.
Thirdly, even if this were a case where the accused himself raises the issue when giving evidence, and even if the trial judge had erred in not convening a voire dire, in our opinion, there has been no miscarriage of justice in the sense that the trial judge`s decision was in any case not based entirely on the strength of the confession. Unlike 
Ajodha
 
[1981] 2 All ER 193
 there was a great deal of independent evidence in the instant case, in particular the evidence of the three eye witnesses and that of the accused himself given at the trial, upon which the trial judge based his decision to convict the appellant. The only new point raised in the confession was the admission of the accused that he had brought the knife with him. Besides that, the forensic evidence that there were 24 stab wounds, of which the fatal ones were of sufficient brutality to cause the death of the deceased; the accused`s admissions at trial that he had stabbed the deceased, albeit with the knife the deceased had brandished at him; and the evidence of the three eye-witnesses that the accused had not only stabbed the deceased repeatedly but had also run after the deceased to stab him further despite their efforts to restrain him. All this was sufficient to convict the accused without recourse to the confession.
For the reasons stated above, the appeal was dismissed.

 The arresting officer`s evidence
 
He was arrested by senior customs officer Koh Keng Siang at the Changi International Airport on 21 November 1990.
SCO Koh was on duty on that day at the departure level of Terminal 1 of the airport outside Arrival Gate C45 to keep watch for arriving passengers of flight TG-405 from Bangkok and Phuket. At about 2.50pm he spotted the accused walking out of the arrival gate. He noticed unnatural bulges at his legs beneath his jeans. SCO Koh kept observation of him as he cleared through immigration control and proceeded to go through the Customs Green Channel (see notes of evidence at p 173 C). He approached the accused, identified himself and asked for his passport and air ticket, first in English, and then in Cantonese (see notes of evidence p 180 E & F). The accused told SCO Koh in Cantonese that he had come from Phuket on holiday, and that he had a girl friend there (notes of evidence p 181 B).
SCO Koh brought him to the customs surveillance office in the airport and instructed him to sit down on a sofa. SCO Koh then checked the bags he was carrying, but found nothing incriminating. When he asked him if he had anything on his person, the accused kept quiet.
SCO Koh then frisked the accused`s body. He felt slabs strapped to his thighs, calves and waist (notes of evidence p 183 B & D). He asked the accused what he had on his body, and the accused replied that he did not know (notes of evidence p 183 D). SCO Koh then handcuffed the accused. Later, SCO Koh questioned the accused further in Cantonese. The accused told him that he was in debt because of gambling activities and he was recruited by a Hong Kong Chinese whose name he did not know to carry out a simple job for which he could be paid HK$50,000. He was given an air ticket to Bangkok by that person and was told that another male Hongkonger by the name of Ah Weng would meet him in Bangkok, and that he should follow Ah Weng.
On his arrival at Bangkok, he was met by Ah Weng as arranged. After he had stayed for two or three days in Bangkok, Ah Weng gave him a bus ticket to an unknown destination. He left by bus to that place alone and was met there by Ah Weng again. They went to a hotel where Ah Weng showed him how to strap things onto his body and legs. He asked Ah Weng if the things were `pak fun` and `shuet-ko` which in Cantonese meant literally white powder and ice cream (but which SCO Koh understood to refer to heroin and a drug known as `ice` respectively). Ah Weng told him not to worry, and that he was only doing petty smuggling (notes of evidence p 194 E). He stayed at this unknown place for about two days, then Ah Weng told him to go to Phuket and handed him an air ticket for a flight leaving Phuket for Singapore on 21 November. He went to Phuket as instructed and stayed for a day. On the morning of 21 November he strapped the goods onto his body and left for the airport to catch flight TG-405 to Singapore.
SCO Koh recorded these events on the same day as they took place (notes of evidence pp 220 A and 222 A) and transcribed them into his pocket book on the following day (notes of evidence p 218 D). Certified copies of the relevant entries were admitted in evidence (notes of evidence p 47 and P47T).
In cross-examination, counsel for the accused put it to SCO Koh that he had asked the accused three questions in the surveillance office - first, whether he knew what the slabs were, second whether he knew they were heroin, and third, who asked him to bring them (notes of evidence p 213). SCO Koh denied asking the second and third questions and or that he only asked three questions. SCO Koh also denied that when the accused wanted to explain some things he told him to keep quiet (notes of evidence p 214 D).
 The investigating officer`s evidence
The next significant prosecution witness was senior narcotics officer Chew Kai Chow. He was notified of the arrest of the accused and arrived at the Changi International Airport to take over the case at about 5.10pm. At the surveillance office, the accused was given over to his custody. He had photographs taken of the accused showing how the 16 blocks were secured to his waist, thighs and calves (exhs P4-P13). He seized the 16 blocks and the straps, thigh guards and calf guards used for that purpose.
SNO Chew brought the accused and the seized items back to the Central Narcotics Bureau at about 7pm. At about 9.30pm he commenced recording a statement from the accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code, and concluded at about 10.45pm.
The admissibility of the statement was challenged by the accused, and a voir dire ensued. The accused alleged that prior to the recording of the statement, CNB officers told him that for cases like his he would certainly be hanged (notes of evidence pp 322 E, 326 A) and that terrified and confused him.
He also alleged that at the commencement of the recording of the statement, the interpreter said to him in Cantonese that he a Hongkonger, had encroached into Singapore territory, and that frightened him (notes of evidence pp 330 B, 354 A). He went on to say that neither the charge nor the notice of warning was read or explained to him (notes of evidence pp 333 A, 334 B). He also asserted that the statement was taken in a question-and-answer form (notes of evidence p 338 A), that in one part of the statement it was recorded that he was 
 taught 
to do something he had actually said in Cantonese that he was 
 forced 
 to do it, and that he was not given the opportunity to correct the statement after it was recorded (notes of evidence p 342 E).
There were two other matters that the accused referred to in the voir dire which were not disputed by the prosecution. The first was that from the time he had a meal on the plane before it landed at about 2.45pm, he had no meal or drinks, and that he was hungry and thirsty when his statement was recorded (notes of evidence p 328 C). Secondly, he said that within one or two minutes, or immediately after his statement was recorded, he was brought to hospital for his post-statement medical examination (notes of evidence p 343 D).
No explanation was given for the failure to provide the accused with any sustenance other than that he did not ask for it (notes of evidence p 268 E). That was not an acceptable explanation. When a person is placed under arrest, those having control over him should find out for themselves whether he has been fed. It should not be left to the person to ask; the person may be too frightened to ask, or he may not know that he can or need to ask. In the event, the accused was without food for about seven hours between his meal on the plane and the recording of his statement and that was compounded by the anxiety of his arrest and being charged with a capital offence. I accept that by the time his statement was recorded, he was in a condition where his free will was sapped, and his statement made under such conditions is inadmissible - see 
 R v Priestley 
, and
 R v Prager 
.
The concluding time of the statement also presented difficulties. SNO Chew`s evidence was that after the statement was completed at 10.50pm the accused was sent to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for his post-statement medical examination (notes of evidence p 254 D). Under cross-examination, SNO Chew agreed that the escorting officers only brought the accused to Tan Tock Seng Hospital at about 11.20pm (notes of evidence p 265 E). When asked to explain the delay between 10.50pm and 11.20pm, he attributed it to a transport problem in that `the car was taken by someone else and there was no available transport for the officers to use at that time` (notes of evidence p 268 B).
The explanation was contradicted by everyone else. The accused said that he was brought to the hospital immediately after the statement was concluded (notes of evidence p 343 D), and this was not disputed by the prosecutor. Narcotics officer Lim Kay Seng, one of the escorting officers, confirmed that the trip to Tan Tock Seng Hospital started at 11.20pm, that there was no request to take the accused to the hospital earlier, and that he had a vehicle ready for that purpose (notes of evidence p 307 E). The other escorting officer, narcotics officer Tan Lye Huat also confirmed that between 9.20pm and 11.20pm, there was a vehicle available to bring the accused to the hospital (notes of evidence p 317 B).
The prosecutor tried strenuously to reconcile the conflicting evidence, but the contradictions were not resolved. Why did SNO Chew say that there was a transport problem when there was none? Why did he say that the accused was kept waiting between 10.50pm and 11.20pm for transport when the accused and the escorting officers said there was no delay? The recording officer was in full control of the recording process and he had to answer for it. When his account of the recording was contradicted by his fellow officers, the integrity of the process was put in question. In the circumstances, I held the statement was inadmissible because of the apprehensions over the accused`s state of mind and the recording process. It was not necessary for me to consider the other complaints of the accused over the recording of the statement.
 The scientific officer`s evidence
The last significant prosecution witness was Dr Lim Tong Kooi of the Department of Scientific Services who analyzed the 16 blocks seized from the accused. He described the laboratory procedures at length and explained how he came to the conclusion that the 16 blocks contained 3489g of whitish substance with a diamorphine content of not less than 2718g. Defence counsel was apparently satisfied with his evidence as no criticisms were raised against it.
At the close of the prosecution case, I found that the prosecution had proved a prima facie case that the accused was in possession of the diamorphine in accordance with the principles set out in 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
, and 
 Tan Ah Tee & Anor v PP 
, and that he imported the drug into Singapore by bringing it into the territory of Singapore - see 
 Ko Mun Cheung & Anor v PP 
, 
 Ng Kwok Chun & Anor v PP 
, and 
 Tse Po Chung Nathan & Anor v PP. 
, I therefore called on the accused to enter his defence to the charge against him.
 The defence
The accused gave evidence on his own behalf. He was a worker with a transport company. He and his co-colleagues would play mahjong when they were not working. He lost often and by September-October 1990 (notes of evidence p 450 E) he was indebted to a colleague Ah Weng for about HK$10,000 and he was unable to repay it.
In early November 1990 Ah Weng told him that he had won at horse racing, and invited him to a holiday to Thailand. Ah Weng asked him for his passport, and bought him an air ticket to Bangkok, and told him to go there by himself.
When he arrived at Bangkok, Ah Weng was there to meet him. They checked into a hotel and went sightseeing for one or two days. During this time Ah Weng had his passport, saying that he was keeping it so that it would not be damaged.
After their stay in Bangkok, Ah Weng brought the accused to another place which name he did not know. On the second day at this place, Ah Weng went out and returned with a bag which the accused observed to contain some white substances (notes of evidence p 456 B). He asked Ah Weng what it was but was told that it did not concern him. Ah Weng then asked him to undress and put on the straps on his waist, thighs and calves. He complied with Ah Weng`s demands because he was afraid that if he did not, Ah Weng, who was a bad-tempered person, may leave the place and take his passport with him (notes of evidence p 460 B). After he undressed and put on the straps, Ah Weng removed them, and they went sightseeing. Subsequently, they left for Phuket (notes of evidence p 460 E) where they checked into a hotel.
On the morning after their arrival they had breakfast, and returned to their room, where Ah Weng ordered him to undress again. The accused asked him why he had to do that, but was told not to ask any questions and to do as he was told (notes of evidence p 462 A). At this time Ah Weng suddenly turned hostile and threatening, and warned him that he would be stabbed if he resisted (notes of evidence p 463 B). He felt helpless and terrified, and allowed Ah Weng to put the straps on him and insert the blocks between the straps (notes of evidence p 464 B). Ah Weng also warned him not to throw away the blocks or make a police report, and if he tried that, he would kill him and the members of his family (notes of evidence p 465 E). He realized that there was something illegal about the blocks of white substance, and he thought that there were diamonds hidden in them (notes of evidence pp 543 C, 548 E).
After that he was told to dress up, and the two of them took a taxi to Phuket airport. En route to the airport, Ah Weng repeated his threats. At the airport Ah Weng returned his passport and gave him a ticket to Singapore, and warned him that there was someone on the plane who would be keeping a watch on him. He then boarded flight TG-405.
Whilst he was on the plane, he sensed that there was a Chinese observing him, but he was unable to say if it was a man or a woman. Nevertheless, he was frightened by the presence of the person.
The accused said that before he was charged, he did not know what he was carrying, and had thought that he was carrying diamonds (notes of evidence p 477).
Under cross-examination the accused stated that his friendship with Ah Weng was `slightly better than normal` (notes of evidence p 481 A). However, he did not know Ah Weng`s full name, surname, address (notes of evidence p 497 E) or his telephone number (notes of evidence p 498 D) and he did not know where to locate him (notes of evidence p 499 D).
Regarding his encounter with SCO Koh, the accused maintained that SCO Koh did not identify himself (notes of evidence p 559 B) and did not ask him whether he was in Phuket on business or pleasure and if he had friends there (notes of evidence p 577 A). He only realized that SCO Koh was a law enforcement officer when SCO Koh handcuffed him (notes of evidence p 562 A).
The accused denied that after he was handcuffed, he told SCO Koh of his gambling debt, the HK$50,000 offer and his activities in Thailand. He said that SCO Koh had only asked him whether he knew what the things were, and whether they were heroin, and he replied to both questions in the negative (notes of evidence p 580 C). He also denied that he asked Ah Weng if the white substances were `pak fun` or `shuet kou` (notes of evidence p 594 B).
 Evaluation of the defence
In the closing submissions, defence counsel submitted that there were two defences - duress and lack of knowledge. Duress is a defence under s 94 of the Penal Code which reads: 
 
Except murder and offences against the State punishable with death, nothing is an offence which is done by a person who is compelled to do it by threats, which, at the time of doing it, reasonably cause the apprehension that instant death to that person will otherwise be the consequence:
 
 
 
Provided that the person doing the act did not of his own accord, or from a reasonable apprehension of harm to himself short of instant death, place himself in the situation by which he became subject to such constraint.
 
 
 
The reference to the apprehension of instant death is noteworthy. In 
 Tan Seng Ann v PP 
, Williams CJ held that: `It is clear from s 94 ... that duress to be pleaded successfully must be imminent, extreme and persistent`.
On the evidence there was no threat issue that could reasonably cause the apprehension of instant death to the accused. Even if Ah Weng had warned the accused that he would be stabbed if he resisted, there was no evidence that Ah Weng was armed when he made that threat, or that he was in position to carry it out. Any danger that the accused felt subsequently in the airport in Phuket and in the plane was even less immediate because the accused was not being held in the company of anyone. It was noteworthy that the accused did not say that he was at any time in fear of instant death, so the defence of duress would not stand even if I accepted his evidence about Ah Weng`s threats.
However, I had grave reservations over his evidence. Ah Weng was supposed to be a colleague and a better-than-normal friend, yet the accused knew almost nothing about him - his full name, surname, address or telephone number. If this friend had suddenly turned hostile, threatened him with violence and forced him to carry the blocks on his body, it would be natural for the accused to talk about him and what he did, but he did not say anything about this when he spoke with SCO Koh.
On the other hand, SCO Koh had made contemporaneous notes of the interrogation of the accused which he transcribed into his pocket book (exh P47). I accepted his evidence on the interrogation and the pocket book entries to be honest and accurate, if not perfect accounts of the interrogation.
On the defence of ignorance, there has to be more than ignorance that there was diamorphine in the blocks. The accused knew that he had the blocks on him. In 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
, Lord Pearce held that when a person has something in his control `the term ""possession"" is satisfied by a knowledge only of the existence of the thing itself and not its qualities, and the ignorance or mistake as to its qualities is not an excuse`. With regard to things in packages, his Lordship held that there is a strong inference that a person in possession of a package is in possession of its contents. This inference is discharged if he proves (or raises a real doubt in the matter) either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open it and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs; or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of (including a genuine mistake as to) its actual contents or of their illicit nature and that he received them innocently and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package of acquainting himself with its actual contents. For a man takes over a package or suitcase at risk as to its contents being unlawful if he does not immediately examine it (if he is entitled to do so). As soon as may be he should examine it and if he finds the contents suspicious reject possession by either throwing them away or by taking immediate sensible steps for their disposal.
Lord Pearce`s construction of possession was adopted by the Criminal Court of Appeal in 
 Tan Ah Tee & Anor v PP 
. It is therefore applicable to the construction of possession in the context of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
As Lord Pearce had pointed out, ignorance or mistake in respect of the nature of the matter may negate physical possession. When physical possession is established, possession is made out without proof or reliance on the presumption that the person in physical possession knows the nature of the drug he is carrying (see 
 PP v Kong Weng Chong & Ors 
, where this question is examined).
By his own admission, the accused was suspicious of the blocks. He had the right and the opportunity to examine them when he was not in the company of Ah Weng in Phuket airport, on the plane, and in the Singapore airport, but he did nothing. On this evidence, he had not discharged the inference that he was in possession of the blocks.
The charge against the accused was for importing the diamorphine into Singapore. The meaning of `import` was considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Ko Mun Cheung & Anor v PP 
, 
 Ng Kwok Chun & Anor v PP 
, 
 Tse Po Chung Nathan & Anor v PP 
. The court consistently held that `import` in s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act bears the same meaning as it does in the Interpretation Act, that is, `to bring or cause to be brought into Singapore by land, sea or air`.
The prosecution had proved that the accused was in possession of the diamorphine and that he had brought it into Singapore. As neither defence he raised was effectual and did not raise any reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, I found him guilty and convicted him, and imposed the mandatory death sentence on him.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiffs are developers and contractors and at the material time were engaged by the Housing and Development Board (`HDB`) to construct blocks of apartments in various housing estates including the housing estate in Choa Chu Kang New Town. For the purpose of their business, the plaintiffs built a temporary timber building (`the plaintiffs` building`) at a site near Block 2 in Teck Whye Avenue for storing building materials. The defendants are a firm of contractors and at the material time were also engaged by HDB to construct blocks of apartments in the same or adjoining areas. They also constructed at the site next to the plaintiffs` building a temporary three-storey timber building (`the defendants` building`) as living quarters for their workers. Adjoining the defendants` building but on the other side thereof was also constructed a timber building of another contractor, Eng Seng Lee Construction Pte Ltd (`Eng Seng Lee`). In other words, the defendants` building was situated between the plaintiffs` building and Eng Seng Lee`s building.
On 17 July 1988 at about 8.40 pm, a fire broke out which totally destroyed and gutted the defendants` building, substantially damaged Eng Seng Lee`s building, and partially damaged the plaintiffs` building. The plaintiffs` damage was surveyed and assessed by their insurers` adjusters, Toplis And Harding (Singapore) Pte Ltd and a claim therefor was presented to the defendants for payment, but no payment was made.
On 22 May 1990 the plaintiffs instituted this action against the defendants claiming damages for negligence. In their statement of claim, the plaintiffs averred that the fire originated from the defendants` building and was caused by over-heating of food left unattended on a kerosene stove on the top floor of the building, and that the fire was caused by the negligence of the defendants as owners and occupiers of the building and/or their servants or agents. In the alternative, they averred that the defendants had allowed cooking by the use of a kerosene stove to be carried on in the building and allowed fire to escape therefrom and damaged the plaintiffs` building. In their defence, the defendants admitted the fire on 17 July 1988 but denied all the other allegations; their defence was one of bare denial. On 8 July 1991, the defendants took out a third party notice against their insurers (`the insurers`), the third party, claiming an indemnity. In their statement of claim against the insurers, the defendants averred that by the policy of insurance No PCR-87-70037, the insurers agreed, inter alia, to indemnify the defendants in a sum up to $1m against any loss or damage to property belonging to third parties occurring in direct connection with the construction or erection of the building as described in the policy. They claimed against the insurers an indemnity or alternatively damages for breach of contract of insurance. The insurers in their defence (as subsequently amended) raised multiple defences, which I shall set out in detail later.
As between the plaintiffs and the defendants, the issues are simple and straightforward: (i) whether the fire was caused by the negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents, and (ii) whether the defendants, their servants or agents had allowed to be brought to the defendants` building a kerosene stove for cooking and had allowed fire to escape therefrom and to damage the plaintiffs` property. I now turn to the facts that have been established before me. There was no dispute that the fire broke out on the evening of 17 July 1988 at about 8.40 pm. There was no direct evidence on the cause of the fire. The plaintiffs called Choo Beng Khiam, the deputy head of operations of the Civil Defence Force. He produced a report written by him, in which he said, among other things, that the fire was believed to have been caused by the over-heating of food left unattended on a kerosene stove. However, he was not at the scene of the fire at the material time, and he said that his report was based on a field incident report, the material part of which was written by one of the officers, Noordin Hamid. The field incident report was produced and admitted with the consent of all the parties. However, Noordin Hamid was not called by any of the parties for cross-examination or clarification of the matters stated in the field incident report. That report contained, among other things, the following statement: 
 
As the result of this fire, two blocks of three-storey sub-standard timber construction with zinc roofing and their contents such as clothing, wooden formwork, vibrator engine, vibrator hose, television, passports, kerosene stove, etc were totally destroyed.
 
 
 
The site store and Shimizu Construction Co Ltd near the building, their contents were partially damage by the heat.
The plaintiffs then called one Loh Peng Liong who is a site administrator of the plaintiffs. He could not give any direct evidence on the incident of the fire. He went to the site the following morning and found that the plaintiffs` store had been partially damaged. He enquired from the Chinese workers who were working there as to the cause of the fire and he took statements from them on the basis of which he prepared a report. He produced the report. However, this report was purely hearsay in so far as the truth of the content is concerned and I cannot accept it as a true report of what took place on that evening. The other material witness for the plaintiffs was Chua Beng Tong who was the site manager of the plaintiffs. He went to the site on the evening of the fire, arriving there at about 9.45 pm. He saw the fire burning the defendants` building and the plaintiffs` store beginning to burn. After he arrived he directed the firemen to connect the water hose to the fire hydrant. He said that he made enquiry from the workers and was informed that the fire had started from the defendants` building.
Some photographs of the site were taken and were produced. In particular, there was one photograph showing that the whole of the defendants` building was completely destroyed and gutted, that substantially the whole of Eng Seng Lee`s building was damaged and that the plaintiffs` building was partially damaged.
The second defendant, Lim Thiam Seng, gave evidence. He said that on the evening of 17 July 1988 he received a call from one of his workers that there was a fire at his workers` quarters. He rushed to the scene and by the time he arrived, the fire had almost been extinguished by the fire brigade. He was trying to find out the cause of the fire but the workers said that they did not know because when the fire broke out, they rushed for safety. In cross-examination, he admitted that the fire started in his workers` quarters.
That was all the evidence before me on the incident of the fire. There was no investigation conducted by any fire expert as to the probable cause of the fire. Apart from the two reports from the Fire Service Department, the other reports before me were the claim adjusters` reports, which had no probative value in so far as the probable cause of the fire was concerned, and are of no assistance to me in that respect. Counsel for the plaintiffs relied on the report of Choo Beng Khiam which said, among other things, that `the fire was believed to be caused by the over-heating of food left unattended on a kerosene stove` in the defendants` building. In so far as this evidence is concerned, I am unable to accept it as the statement was purely hearsay and cannot be evidence of the truth of the content. Reliance was also placed on the field incident report and in particular that part thereof made by Noordin Hamid which said that the contents of the defendants` building such as kerosene stoves, among other things, were totally destroyed. On the basis of this, it was submitted on behalf of the plaintiffs that kerosene stoves must have been used by the defendants` servants in cooking food and the fire was caused by cooking or over-heating of food in the defendants` building. I accept that this is a possible inference to be drawn, but on the balance of probabilities I cannot properly draw this inference. In my judgment, on the evidence before me the true cause of the fire has not been established.
As to the place of origin of the fire, I think there was evidence before me. There was the evidence of Chua Beng Tong who went to the scene of the fire while the fire was still burning and his evidence was that at that time the defendants` building was on fire and the plaintiffs` stores were beginning to burn. There was also evidence from the photographs which showed the extent of the damage: the whole of the defendants` building was completely destroyed and gutted, while substantially the whole of the adjoining building of Eng Seng Lee was damaged and the plaintiffs` building was partially damaged. The second defendant himself admitted that the fire started in his workers` quarters. On the evidence before me, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the fire originated from the defendants` building.
There was no evidence on the basis of which I can make any finding on the second issue, ie whether the defendants` servants had brought to the building a kerosene stove and used it for cooking and the use of that caused the fire. It has not been established to my satisfaction that a kerosene stove had been brought to the defendants` building and was used in cooking or heating food and that the fire was caused by over-heating of food left unattended on the kerosene stove in the defendants` building. There remains only the first issue, ie whether the fire was caused by the negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents. The burden is on the plaintiffs to prove that it was so caused by the defendants, their servants or agents. However, at all material times, the defendants by their servants or agents had possession and were in occupation of their building and the fire started in the defendants` building and spread to the plaintiffs` building. There was no explanation as to how the fire started. In such circumstances, the inference to be drawn is that the fire could not have started without some lack of care on the part of the defendants` servants or agents in the defendants` building. Therefore, it was for the defendants to show that the fire was accidental and could have occurred without their negligence and that of their servants or agents. Unfortunately, the defendants have not succeeded; they have not displaced the inference that the fire was caused by their negligence or that of their servants or agents.
In 
Bennett v Chemical Construction (GB) Ltd,
 
[1971] 1 WLR 1571
 the plaintiff, a foreman, was supervising the installation of 12 electrical panels. The plaintiff noticed that one of the panels was about to fall and rushed forward to prevent it from falling, and while he was doing so, another heavy panel fell on him and injured him. The defendants called no evidence and the trial judge could not determine how the accident happened and came to the conclusion on the facts that there must have been a lack of care on the part of the defendants` employees and found in favour of the plaintiffs. On appeal, his decision was affirmed. Davies LJ said, at p 1575: 
 
Mr Wood has strenously argued that really there was no evidence on which the judge could make a finding of negligence, since the plaintiff had failed to prove how the accident happened. He went further and said that it would be quite wrong for this court to approach the case on the basis of the well known doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. He pointed out that, although it had been indicated in correspondence before the trial that the plaintiff was going to rely on that doctrine, no amendment to the pleading was made; and the judge never himself referred to res ipsa loquitur.
 
 
 
In my view it is not necessary for that doctrine to be pleaded. If the accident is proved to have happened in such a way that prima facie it could not have happened without negligence on the part of the defendants, then it is for the defendants to explain and show how the accident could have happened without negligence. The defendants made no attempt to do that in this case. In my judgment this is really a classic case of res ipsa loquitur. Here you have the panel being moved by the defendants` men, and it falls. It should not have fallen. The defendants might, as Edmund Davies LJ said in the course of the argument, if it were so, have called evidence to show that one or more of the men had a sudden stroke or something of that kind, which no one could foresee. But here the panel fell, and I entirely agree with the judge that it could not possibly have fallen without some apparent negligence on the part of the defendants.
In my judgment, the plaintiffs` claim against the defendants for damages for negligence succeeds. As regards the quantum, the defendants have accepted the quantum as pleaded in the statement of claim and, therefore, there will be judgment for the plaintiffs against the defendants in the sum of $52,209.71 with interest at 4% pa from 22 May 1990 to the date hereof and costs.
I now turn to the claim by the defendants against the insurers. The claim of the defendants was based on the policy No PCR-87-70037. The material part of the policy as regards the indemnity against damage to third parties` property is contained in section II of the policy and the terms thereof are as follows. 
 
Section II - Third Party Liability
 
 
 
The insurers will indemnify the insured up to but not exceeding the amounts specified in the schedule against such sums which the insured shall become legally liable to pay as damages consequent upon
 
 
 
 
(a) accidental bodily injury to or illness of third parties (whether fatal or not) 
 
(b) accidental loss of or damage to property belonging to [third] parties occurring in direct connection with the construction or erection of the items insured under Section I and happening on or in the immediate vicinity of the site during the period of cover.
  
 
 
In respect of a claim for compensation to which the indemnity provided herein applies, the insurers will in addition indemnify the insured against 
(a) all costs and expenses of litigation recovered by any claimant from the insured, and 
(b) all costs and expenses incurred with the written consent of the insurers,
 
 
 
provided always that the liability of the insurers under this section shall not exceed the limits of indemnity stated in the ichedule.
 
 
 
The items insured under iection I are as follows: 
 
INSURED ITEMS SUM INSURED 
(1) Contract works comprising the permanent and ) 
temporary works forming part of the contract including ) 
materials incorporated or to be incorporated therein ) 
(2) Construction plant and equipment ) $14,575,000 
(3) Construction machinery 
(4) Clearance of debris $14,575,000
 
 
 
EXCESS: 
(a) $5,000 each and every loss for storm tempest flood earthquake subsidence or collapse 
(b) $1,500 each and every loss for any other cause
 
 
 
To the claim of the defendants, the insurers raised no less than six separate defences and I shall deal with them in the following order. The first defence relates to non-joinder of parties. It was submitted on behalf of the insurers that the policy was issued to HDB and the defendants and therefore the defendants in bringing this claim against the insurers must join HDB, and HDB has not been joined as a party. By reason of this omission the claim of the defendants was misconceived. The short answer to this, as submitted on behalf of the defendants, is found in that section of the policy headed `Cross Liability Clause` which, so far as material, provides as follows: 
 
It is agreed and understood that otherwise subject to the terms, exclusions, provisions and conditions contained in the Policy or endorsed thereon the third party liability cover of the policy shall apply to the insured parties named in the schedule [ie HDB and the defendants] as if a separate policy had been issued to each party, provided that the insurers shall not indemnify the insured under this endorsement in respect of liability for:
 
 
 
...
 
 
 
The effect of this provision is that, so far as the third party liability cover is concerned, the policy is to be treated as if a separate policy had been issued to each of them. In my judgment, HDB is not required to be joined in these proceedings. This defence has no merit and fails.
Next, the insurers relied on para (c) in the section of the policy headed `General Exclusions` and the relevant part thereof is as follows: 
 
The insurers will not indemnify the insured in respect of loss, damage or liability directly or indirectly caused by or arising out of or aggravated by ... 
(c) wilful act or wilful negligence of the insured or of his representatives;
 
 
 
Clearly on the evidence before me, there was no basis for this defence. There was no evidence as to the cause of fire and I am in no position to find that the fire was caused by any `wilful` act or `wilful` negligence of the defendants, their servants or agents. Counsel for the third party relied on the report of Choo Beng Khiam that the fire was believed to have been caused by over-heating of food left unattended on a kerosene stove. This part of the report, as I have said, is pure hearsay and is not admissible to prove the truth of the content. There was no evidence that the defendants` employees brought a kerosene stove to the building and used the kerosene to cook or heat up their food there. I therefore reject this defence.
The third defence is based on condition 5 of the general conditions of the policy which, so far as material, provides: 
 
 
(5) In the event of any occurrence which might give rise to a claim under this policy, the insured shall (a) immediately notify the insurers by telephone or telegram as well as in writing, giving an indication as to the nature and extent of loss or damage;

The insurers shall not in any case be liable for loss, damage or liability of which no notice has been received by the insurers within 14 days of its occurrence.
 
 
 
It was submitted on behalf of the insurers that the defendants acted in breach of this condition and failed to notify the insurers of `the nature and extent of loss or damage` within 14 days. I have no hesitation in rejecting the defence. On the day after the fire, 18 July 1988, the defendants` agent, Rego Insurance Agencies Pte Ltd, despatched the following telex to the insurers:

Regret to inform u, insured has reported to us fire has caused damage to the workers quarters for the above project yesterday evening. Pls arrange for a survey.
 
 
 
There was no response to this telex. Nor did the insurers send any adjuster or other expert immediately to the site to investigate the fire. The insurers appeared to be quite lackadaisical in their treatment of this incident. Only on 20 July 1988 did the insurers instruct Allied Adjustment Company Pte Ltd, and a representative of this company visited the site on 21 July and found `the scene flattened and bulldozed`. The insurers responded to the telex from the defendants` agents only on 27 July 1988 when they forwarded a claim form to the defendants which was received by them only on 29 July 1988. The defendants submitted the claim form on 3 August 1988. If there was any delay in submitting the claim it was in part substantially caused by the insurers themselves; it was more the fault of the insurers than the defendants. At any rate, the crucial part of condition 5 provides that the insurers are not liable `for loss, damage or liability of which no notice has been received` by them within 14 days of the occurrence of the fire. The defendants` agents` notice to the insurers was clearly a notice falling within that condition; it was a notice of `loss, damage or liability` to the insurers. The defendants were therefore not precluded by condition 5 of the general conditions from bringing this claim.
The fourth defence raised by the insurers was that there was a material change in the risk insured of which the defendants failed to inform the insurers and in consequence the defendants committed a breach of condition 4(b) of general conditions. Condition 4(b) is in the following terms: 
 
The insured shall immediately notify the insurers by telegram and in writing of any material change in the risk and cause at his own expense such additional precautions to be taken as circumstances may require, and the scope of cover and/or premium shall, if necessary, be adjusted accordingly.
 
 
 
Counsel for the insurers relied on the drawing in DB27, which was a standard drawing of a two-storey building to house the workers of contractors. What the defendants had built was a three-storey building as living quarters for their workers. The insurers said that such construction was carried out without HDB`s approval and that the defendants had not informed the insurers. There was, therefore, a material change in the risk as the addition of one-storey means a larger area to be insured and there is more liability to be covered by the policy. I again have no hesitation in rejecting this defence. First, though the drawing in DB27 is a standard drawing of HDB for workers` quarters, it does not appear from the evidence that construction of workers` quarters which deviates from the plan requires HDB`s prior approval. According to the second defendant, the architect in charge did not regulate the number of storeys for workers` quarters and he had not objected to the construction of the three-storey building. There was no evidence that HDB had prescribed this drawing to the defendants for building their workers` quarters. Secondly, it is not the case of the insurers that they issued the policy on the basis, among others, of the drawing in DB27. On the contrary, their case is that the building as workers` quarters is not covered by the policy. In my judgment, there was no material change in the risk. The change in the risk, if material, has no relation to the incident which had occurred. The incident was the fire which wholly destroyed and gutted the entire workers` quarters and also caused damage to the property of the defendants` neighbours. The fire was certainly not attributable to any such change in the risk.
The fifth defence which the insurers raised is based on cl 8 of the general conditions which, so far as material, provides: 
 
If a claim is ..., or if a claim is made and rejected and no action or suit is commenced within three months after such rejection or, in case of arbitration taking place as provided herein, within three months after the arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire have made their award, all benefit under this policy shall be forfeited.
 
 
 
In connection with this defence it is necessary to refer to the insurers` pleadings to see precisely what they have pleaded. The defence was pleaded in paras 3 and 4 of the amended defence (to the claim by the defendants) which are as follows: 
 
 
(3) By a letter dated 13 April 1989 sent by the third party to Rego Insurance Brokers Pte Ltd who are the agents of the first and second defendants, and/or alternatively by a letter dated 14 April 1989 from Allied Adjustment Company Pte Ltd, (the adjusters and/or agents of the third party) to Toplis and Harding (S) Pte Ltd, (the adjusters and agents of the plaintiff) and/or alternatively by a letter dated 28 April 1989 from the third party`s solicitors to the defendants` solicitors and/or alternatively by a letter dated 4 February 1991 from the third party`s solicitors to the defendants` solicitors, the third party had repudiated liability or disclaimed liability on the first and second (both trading as Chip Eng Seng Construction) claim made on or about 3 August 1988.
  
 
 
Particulars 
(i) The liability of the third party did not arise as the fire was caused by the negligence of the first and second defendants` workers during cooking by overheating the food left unattended at a kerosene stove, which was not within the insurable risks covered by the policy. The insurable risks were construction works or items listed in para 1 herein and not food catering or canteen operations. 
(ii) The fire was caused by the negligence of the first and second defendants` workers not in the course of the construction work for the first and second defendants. The third party will rely on the particulars of negligence pleaded by the plaintiffs in their statement of claim paras 4, 5 and 6. 
(4) Further or in the alternative, it is a condition precedent (Condition 8 of the policy) that if no action or suit is commenced within three (3) months after rejection of the claim, all benefits under the policy shall be forfeited. In breach of this condition precedent, the first and second defendants had not commenced action within three (3) months from 13 April 1989 and the action is now time barred under the policy.
 
 
 
For this defence to succeed, there must be a claim made by the defendants and a rejection of that claim by the insurers. So far as the claim is concerned, the insurers relied on the claim made by the defendants on or about 3 August 1988. That was the claim the defendants made in the claim form which was submitted to the insurers and which stated the estimated amount of direct loss of or damage to the defendants` property, namely: 
 
 
(i) Quarters: $30,000 
 
(ii) Cash and belongings: $14,249 
 
(iii) Canteen loss: $4,159 
 
(iv) Sub-contractors` equipment: $1,000
  
 
 
In so far as third party damage is concerned, the claim form merely indicated that damage had been caused to a third party and that the amount was then unknown. It is abundantly clear that in that form no claim was made by the defendants for the amount which the defendants were called upon to pay to a third party, eg the plaintiffs. There was, therefore, no claim made by the defendants on 3 August 1988 which was relied upon by the insurers for the purpose of condition 8.
In the South African case of 
Boshoff v South British Insurance Co Ltd
 
[1951] 3 SALR 481
 the motor insurance policy contained, among other things, condition 10 which so far as material provided: 
 
... in the event of the company disclaiming liability in respect of any claim and an action or suit be not commenced within three months after such disclaimer or ..., all benefits under this policy in respect of such claim shall be forfeited.
 
 
 
After the accident the attorney of the insured wrote to the insurance company informing them of the accident and forwarding the third party`s claim. The insurance company by their attorney denied liability. The insured settled the third party claim and instituted proceedings after three months from the date of repudiation of liability by the insurance company. The magistrates` court dismissed the claim on the ground that it was time-barred by condition 10. On appeal, the Transvaal Divisional Court held that the insured`s letter was not a claim and accordingly the insurance company`s letter was not a letter disclaiming liability in respect of any claim. Clayden J (with whom Bresler AJ concurred) said, at p 487: 
 
In cl 10 `claim` must mean something in respect of which there can be a repudiation of liability, and by virtue of which there can be benefit under the policy. To that extent there is guidance in the context. Its natural meaning as I have said is `a demand for something as due; an assertion of a right to something`. All that can ever be `due` to the insured under the policy, all that he can ever have a `right to` is an indemnity; an indemnity against loss or damage or an indemnity against sums which he becomes legally liable to pay. He can only be indemnified, compensated, when the extent of his loss is known. He only becomes legally liable to pay a sum when a sum is fixed by a court or by agreement. It does not, therefore, seem to me that he can demand something as due, or assert a right to something, under this policy until he knows what that something is. I agree with Neser J, that before the amount of the indemnity under the policy is fixed he cannot claim it, although he can say that he will claim it.
 
 
 
The meaning which the parties intended the word `claim` to bear in its context in cl 10 was, I consider, its ordinary grammatical meaning. It means a demand for an indemnity in a particular amount.
The decision in 
Boshoff
 
[1951] 3 SALR 481
 was followed by the Court of Appeal here in 
Federal Insurance Co v Nakano Singapore (Pte) Ltd
 
 
[1992] 1 SLR 390
  There, the relevant condition in the policy was condition 8 and the terms thereof were identical with those of condition 8 here. One of the issues before the court was whether there was a claim made under the policy to the insurer for the purpose of condition 8. The Court of Appeal held, inter alia, that no such claim was made. Chan Sek Keong J, delivering the judgment of the court said, at pp 396-397: 
 
... 
 Boshoff
 decided a `claim` must contain the essential ingredient of a demand or an assertion of a particular right. In this case, condition 8 contains the words `if a claim is made`. In our view, the word `made` makes it explicit and reinforces the necessity of a demand for payment. Whether, in this case, the claim is for the respondents` direct loss or indirect loss, as from a third party claim (and here the policy insured against public liability), an essential element in the `making` of a claim is the making of a demand or request, express or implied, for payment. A claim is made when a demand or request for payment is made. It is not made by a mere notification of the happening of the insured event giving rise to a claim.
 
 
 
Reverting to the facts in this case, I find that the insurers relied on several letters, each in the alternative, as rejection of the claim made on 3 August 1988, namely, their letter dated 13 April to Rego Insurance Agencies Pte Ltd as agents for the defendants, the letter dated 14 April 1989 by their agents, Allied Adjustment Company Pte Ltd, to Toplis and Harding (Singapore) Pte Ltd, the letter dated 28 April 1989 from their solicitors to the defendants` solicitors and lastly the letter dated 4 February 1991 from their solicitors to the defendants` solicitors. Each of these letters (except the second letter) was written in reply to a letter from an agent of the defendants. In so far as the claim of the defendants is concerned, the insurers are not relying on any claim in each of these letters from the defendants` agents. Whether each of these letters contained a claim falling within condition 8, I express no opinion as it is not part of the case of the insurers that the defendants` claim for the purpose of these proceedings was founded on any of these letters written on behalf of the defendants subsequent to the claim dated 3 August 1988. Parties are bound by the pleadings and cases must be decided on the issues raised by the pleadings: see 
Blay v Pollard and Morris
 
[1930] 1 KB 534
 
Kiaw Aik Hang Co Ltd v Tan Tien Choy
 
 
[1964] MLJ 99
  and 
Farrell v Secretary of State
 
[1980] 1 WLR 172
 The claim dated 3 August 1988 was not a claim for an indemnity for the amount claimed by the plaintiffs. Accordingly, in my judgment, the defence of the third party based on condition 8 also fails.
I now turn to the last defence of the third party which is that the claim of the defendants was not covered by the policy. The scope of the policy, in so far as third party liability is concerned, is contained in section II of the policy which I have set out in detail. However, it bears repeating that under the terms of that section the insurers are obliged to indemnify the defendants against such sums which the defendants are liable to pay as damages consequent upon accidental loss or damage to property belonging to third parties `occurring in direct connection with the construction or erection of the items insured under section I and happening on or in the immediate vicinity of the site during the cover period`. The insured items in section I were `contract works comprising the permanent and temporary works forming part of the contract including materials incorporated or to be incorporated therein`. The damage to the third party, ie the plaintiffs, was caused by a fire occurring in the defendants` workers` quarters. The defendants` workers` quarters were not an item insured in section I of the policy and the damage caused to the plaintiffs did not occur `in direct connection with the construction or erection of the items insured under section I`. It was submitted by counsel for the defendants that the policy was expressly extended to cover insurance obligations mentioned in the conditions of contract between HDB and the defendants. However, counsel has not been able to show me that the insurance obligations under the conditions of contract included an obligation to take out insurance to cover loss or damage to the defendants` workers` quarters or loss or damage caused to third party by any event or incident occurring in or about the defendants` workers` quarters. Counsel next relied on specification 1.1.9 contained in the contract between HDB and the defendants which required the defendants to submit a site layout plan to the architect of HDB indicating proposed positions of all temporary structures, for example, offices, workers` quarters, canteen, store and other buildings for approval before their construction. But there is nothing in this specification which requires insurance to be taken out to cover all such buildings and in particular workers` quarters. In my judgment, this defence of the insurers succeeds and the claim of the defendants against them is accordingly dismissed.
I now come to the question of costs. The insurers have raised no less than six defences and all except the last one failed. They should bear a substantial part of the costs themselves for raising such defences. It would be highly unjust that the entire costs of the third party proceedings should be borne by the defendants. Accordingly, a fair order as to costs should be that the defendants pay to the insurers only one-third of the costs. I so order. I further direct that in taxation the insurers should not be allowed any getting-up fee in respect of those defences which have failed.

The respondent was originally charged in the district court under s 304A of the Penal Code (Cap 224) with causing the death on 14 February 1989 of a pedestrian by doing a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide by failing to give way to a pedestrian while making a left turn in his bus and colliding into the pedestrian who was crossing on a pedestrian crossing while the green man lights were on, thus causing her death.
At the conclusion of the prosecution`s evidence on 19 March 1992 defence counsel submitted that there was no case to answer and the district judge acquitted the respondent without calling on his defence. The public prosecutor appealed and, at the conclusion of the appeal on 3 September 1992, I sent the case back to the district judge to call on the respondent to enter upon his defence.
The principles on which a court should decide at the closing of the prosecution`s case whether there is a case for the accused to answer have been set out by the Privy Council in 
 Haw Tua Tau v PP 
. Although these principles are not without their problems in implementation, they have been followed by the courts in Singapore ever since. What these principles mean is that if the judge comes to the conclusion after hearing the prosecution`s evidence that there is evidence (not inherently incredible) which constitutes a prima facie case which the accused should be called upon to answer, he must call upon the accused to enter upon his defence. Of course, the accused might choose not to give evidence or call witnesses, and it is then left to the judge to assess the credibility of the witnesses and to decide in a case of conflict which of them he finds to be the more credible, before deciding whether the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt.
However, there is one qualification to this. If, apart from the disputed facts and the credibility of the witnesses, there is hard evidence, whether in the shape of documents or photographs or what are known as `silent facts`, which is itself sufficient to constitute a prima facie case on the charge, the accused cannot choose to remain silent when called upon. If he does remain silent, the unavoidable result is that the case would then have been effectively proved against him beyond reasonable doubt by default.
In the present case, when the respondent was called upon in the district court on 27 October 1992 to enter upon his defence, he elected to remain silent and offered no witnesses. After submissions, which do not appear to me to deal with the real issues, the district judge acquitted him again, and in turn the public prosecutor appealed again to the High Court against the acquittal. This time, the respondent having already been called to enter upon his defence and chosen to remain silent, and the district judge having acquitted him at the conclusion of the case, it is now up to the High Court to decide whether there has been a case proved against him beyond reasonable doubt.
The district judge in citing my judgment in 
 PP v Poh Oh Sim 
, stated that the only material evidence before him was the evidence of two eye-witnesses, namely, the school boy who was standing in the bus beside the bus driver, and facing the front (PW11), and a taxi-driver who was following some distance behind the bus (PW12). He very diligently analysed the conflicting evidence of these two witnesses, focusing attention on discrepancies and contradictions. He also cited some English authorities which, with respect, I do not think are relevant to the facts of this case and do not take it any further.
As with so many cases, where the lapse of time has caused memories to blur and fade, and result in throwing up many discrepancies in evidence, it is vitally important that courts do not lose sight of the wood for the trees. District judges and magistrates especially would be well advised to sit back sometimes, and decide what the essentials of the case are and in fact what the case is all about. In my view, this case is a relatively straightforward one. We have a school girl pedestrian who was hurrying along and crossing the street at a controlled pedestrian crossing. When she was on the crossing itself, the bus driven by the respondent collided with her, and killed her. The district judge has spent some time, rather needlessly I think, over some of the discrepancies in the evidence of the two principal witnesses PW11 and PW12. In my view, in spite of the discrepancies and contradictions, the evidence of both of them point to the deceased crossing the road when the green pedestrian light was still in her favour. Even if there should be any doubt about this fact, and I do not think that there should be, the other critical evidence from which it is not possible to escape is that she was on the pedestrian crossing itself when she was hit and killed.
What is the law in such a situation? The relevant law in Singapore has been adapted from some English legislation which English judges have often criticized as being ill-drafted. But in adapting from the English law we have made some significant changes to suit our circumstances and policies. In particular, we have given a greater protection to pedestrians in Singapore than is the case in England. In England, a pedestrian does not have prior right of way at a pedestrian crossing until he has put a foot on it. In Singapore, a pedestrian not only has a prior right of way when he has entered a pedestrian crossing, but even when he is still on the pavement but is about to enter it. This follows from our Pedestrian Crossing Rules 1982. Rule 5 requires every driver approaching a pedestrian crossing, unless he can see that there is no pedestrian thereon, to proceed at such speed as will enable him to stop his vehicle before reaching such crossing; and, at the crossing, r 7 provides precedence not only for pedestrians who have entered the crossing but also for pedestrians who are about to enter the crossing, and this is notwithstanding the fact that the driver may already have received a signal to proceed into the pedestrian crossing either from the light signals or a police officer. What all this means is that if a vehicle collides with the pedestrian at a pedestrian crossing, there can be no question as to who has the right of way.
In the present case, the body of the deceased pedestrian, who had the right of way, was in the middle of the crossing as she had in fact crossed 3 to 4 ft into it when the bus collided with her. In the circumstances, this simple fact alone is prima facie evidence of the respondent`s negligence, and, if not explained, is sufficient to support the respondent`s conviction upon the charge under s 304A of causing the death of the pedestrian by doing a negligent act not amounting to culpable homicide, by failing to give way to the pedestrian and thereby colliding with her.
Under s 304A the act can be due to either rashness or negligence. If death has been caused by a rash act the proper punishment would be imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years. If death has been caused instead by a negligent act, it would be sufficient in most cases to inflict a fine on the accused. In this case the charge is for causing death by a negligent act, and in my view the appropriate punishment would be a fine. Accordingly I allow the appeal, set aside the order of acquittal, and impose a fine of $6,000 with a sentence of three months` imprisonment in default of payment. The respondent is also disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for five years.

The three appellants were convicted in the High Court of the murder of one Anwar Hossain (`the deceased`) in furtherance of a common intention of all of them between 11.30pm on 9 June 1991 and 1.30am on 10 June 1991 at a track off Woodfield Road, Singapore, and were sentenced to death. They appealed against their convictions and at the end of the hearing we dismissed their appeals. We now give our reasons.
The undisputed facts adduced by the prosecution were these. All three appellants and the deceased were working and living on the Senoko site in Woodfield Road and were occupying quarters provided for by their employers. On the night of 9 June 1991, three fellow workers, namely, Sawat Thapwiset (`Sawat`), Wichian Chumsena @ Ah Thia (`Wichian`), Butsee Wongphutta @ Ah Leh (`Butsee`) and Suphap Thongbai (`Suphap`) were having a singing session in Sawat and Butsee`s room which was next to the deceased`s. They were later joined by the first appellant and one Pramuan Saethaisong (`Pramuan`).
The evidence of Sawat, Butsee, Suphap, Pramuan, and Fakrul Islam (`Fakrul`) was adduced by depositions and the prosecution sought to admit these under s 33 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97) as the attendance of the witnesses could not be secured. Defence counsel did not object to the admission of these statements except for the fact that he wanted the court to infer some merry-making on that night.
There was evidence that alcohol was being consumed on the premises. The combined evidence of Sawat, Butsee and Suphap was that at least five bottles of beer were consumed on the premises among six persons (including the first and third appellant). Suphap, Pramuan, Butsee and Sawat all confirmed that the third appellant came into the room at about 10pm, drank a glass of beer, and asked the first appellant to join him for dinner whereupon both left the room. The first appellant rejoined the singing party at around 11pm without the third appellant.
Sometime past 11pm, the deceased who stayed next door came in and told the merry-makers to lower their volume as he was trying to sleep. He picked up a cigarette lighter to light his cigarette and, when the cigarette lighter could not light, threw it on the floor and left. The third appellant then appeared again and called the first appellant out of the room. After the first appellant left, the party folded up. As Sawat was preparing to sleep, the first appellant knocked on the door and asked him where the deceased stayed. Sawat told him that the deceased was next door and the first appellant then left. Butsee also saw the first appellant and corroborated the evidence of Sawat in this respect.
Fakrul was the deceased`s roommate. He stated that at about 11.45pm he woke up and saw the deceased eating. Later, a male Thai (whom he identified as the first appellant) stood at the door of their room and beckoned the deceased to `come`. The deceased then left the room with the male Thai.
The next morning, 10 June 1991, the body of the deceased was found on a track near his quarters. The investigation officer in charge of the case, S/Sgt Zainuddin Lee, arrived at the scene and seized two pieces of timber, one of which was stained with blood. The first appellant was arrested and at two separate identification parades, the first appellant identified the second and third appellants which led to their arrest. At about 5.30pm that day, IO Lee was led by the third appellant to the recovery of another two pieces of timber, both which were stained with blood. The evidence of scientific officer Tan Wai Fun was that three of the four pieces of timber had been broken from the same piece of timber while the fourth piece was a whole piece by itself. When IO Lee questioned the appellants on 10 June 1991 at about 4.50 pm with the assistance of an interpreter, all three separately made admissions to him that they had each used a piece of wood to attack the deceased.
Dr Chao Tze Cheng was the forensic pathologist who examined the deceased`s body. He found 15 groups of injuries two of which were fatal, each being sufficient on its own in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. The first fatal injury was a group of multiple small bruises on the right side of the head below which there was a depressed fracture of the right parietal bone. The second fatal injury was a group of lacerations on both ears below which there was a fracture of the right ear temporal bone. He opined that both the injuries were consistent as having been caused by a blunt instrument. He also noted that one of the injuries on the shoulder of the deceased was a square-shaped abrasion which was consistent as having been caused by a block of wood. The fatal injuries had been delivered with great force and the 15 injuries were `so diversified, so multiple` that the deceased must have been attacked from all sides by more than one assailant.
Inspector T Maniam was the recording officer who recorded a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) from each of the appellants. Counsel for the first and second appellants had no objection to the admission of the statements. As for the third appellant, a voir dire was held as a result of his counsel`s objection to the voluntariness of the statement at the end of which the trial judge ruled that the statement had been voluntarily made. Mr Isaac for the third appellant did not raise this as a contentious issue on appeal.
The first appellant`s s 122(6) statement was recorded by Insp Maniam at 10.30pm on 10 June 1991 with the help of a Thai interpreter. The entire statement was as follows with relevant parts emphasized: 
 
Last night after I finished my beer my friends and I sang songs at our quarters. The deceased came into the room. He took a cigarette lighter from the room and wanted to light his cigarette but he could not. He got annoyed and threw down the lighter. After that he showed his watch and pointed to it to indicate that it was already late. I was drunk then. After (sic) the deceased left the room. `Pee Sai` (refers to Sai Phanna) came and called me to come out of the room. 
 Pee Sai asked me to lure the accused from his room
. In fact `Pee Sai` asked me to tell the deceased that there was a Thai girl at the nearby quarters. 
 I then went to the deceased room and called him out saying that there was a Thai girl at a nearby quarters
. He followed me there but could not find the Thai girl there. Both of us returned. While on the way back, `Pee Sai` and `Pee Prayoon` (refers to Prayoon Saneha) were waiting at the track. When the accused passed them `Pee Prayoon` hit the deceased with a piece of wood followed by `Pee Sai` who was also armed with a piece of wood. I walked away a few steps about five to six metres. I stood there and looked at both of them hitting the deceased armed with a piece of wood each. 
 I walked back to the spot and I picked a piece of wood and hit the deceased once.
 After that I threw away that stick and walked back to my quarters. The reason why I walked back and hit the deceased because I was afraid that `Pee Prayoon` and `Pee Sai` would be angry with me if I did not join both of them and they might beat me up. In fact I did not know whether there was a Thai girl at the other quarters or not when I called the deceased there.
 
 
 
The second appellant`s s 122(6) statement was recorded by Insp Maniam with the help of the same Thai interpreter on 11 June 1991 at 12.15am. He had this to say with the relevant part emphasized: 
 I hit the deceased with a piece of wood 
. After that I threw away the piece of wood and returned to my work quarters. I hit the deceased because he went to my friend`s room to disturb and make noise at Suradit. Suradet and Sai complained to me about this. At that time I was drunk. That is all.
The third appellant`s s 122(6) statement was recorded by Insp Maniam with the help of the same Thai interpreter on 11 June 1991 at 1.15am. His statement was as follows with the relevant part emphasized: 
 I hit the deceased with a piece of wood, 
 because the deceased went and disturbed my friend Suradet. Actually I don`t intend to the kill the deceased. After I hit the deceased I threw away the piece of wood nearby. I then went back to my quarters. At that time I was drunk. That`s all.
At the end of the prosecution case the trial judge reviewed the prosecution evidence against all three appellants independently in considering whether there existed a common intention. He reviewed the appellants` 122(6) statements and concluded that they were `doubtless confessions within the meaning of s 17(2) of the Evidence Act`. He also found that the prosecution evidence, without attaching any veracity tab to it, suggested that there was a pre-conceived plan to assault the deceased with pieces of wood and the appellants acted in unison on the night in question to give effect to that common intention. He accordingly held that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against all three appellants and called for their defence.
All three appellants chose to remain silent and did not call any witnesses to give evidence on their behalf. The trial judge accordingly applied s 196(2) of the CPC as they `denied themselves the opportunity to vindicate themselves`. Upon reviewing the evidence once more, the trial judge found that the deceased was attacked by all three appellants with the unity of intention to cause grievous bodily injuries to the deceased. He held that a reasonable inference was that the three appellants `did not want the deceased to relate the story of the attack to anyone after the assault`. He found that all three appellants had acted in concert in pursuance of their original plan to deal with the deceased on account of his going to the next room and telling them to reduce the noise of their merriment.
He also applied s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) which reads as follows: 
 
When more persons than one are being tried jointly for the same offence, and a confession made by one of such persons affecting himself and some other persons is proved, the court may take into consideration such confession as against such other person as well as against the person who makes such confession.
 
 
 
The trial judge proceeded to make the following remarks on s 30: 
 
Though a confession of the conviction of the other co-accused cannot be the foundation of the conviction of the other co-accused, the statements of each accused person is evidence against him implicating himself in the offence charged.
 
 
 
This is the `injunction` on s 30 as specified in 
 Sim Ah Cheoh & Ors v PP 
 following Sir John Beaumont`s dicta in the Privy Council in 
 Bhuboni Sahu v The King. 
The trial judge also felt that the excuse of the appellants that they only wanted to deal with him and not kill the deceased was `entirely without substance` and particularly with respect to the first appellant who claimed in his statement that he only hit the deceased in order to appease the other two appellants. The trial judge concluded as follows: 
 
In my view all the three accused had jointly concerted and intended to cause serious bodily injuries to the deceased and carried out their plan accordingly between the time stated in the charge. It was established that those injuries were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the victim. I therefore found them guilty and convicted them accordingly.
 
 
 
 
 Grounds of appeal
 
Before us, Mr Rajah for the first appellant raised the issue of intoxication. He stated that there was clear evidence that the first appellant had been having drinks with his friends. He maintained that there was at least a reasonable doubt as to whether the first appellant had formed any intention to commit the offence, being under the influence of drink.
Mr Tan for the second appellant referred us to the trial judge`s grounds of decision and submitted that there was a danger that he had `lumped all the evidence together` rather than treat the evidence against each separately, thereby breaching the injunction contained in 
 Sim Ah Cheoh 
`s case1 interpreting s 30 of the Evidence Act. He argued that there was no independent evidence against his client to prove common intention as the evidence showed that it was only the first and third appellants and not the second appellant who had met together earlier before the assault. As a result s 30 could not be pressed into action.
Mr Isaac argued that under s 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224) the prosecution had to prove that at least one of the appellants intended to inflict the fatal injuries in order to be guilty of murder. He pointed out that pieces of wood were not to be seen in the same light as deadly weapons like knives and guns. In support of this proposition he referred us to the case of 
 Mana Gendal & Ors v Emperor 
, a decision of the Bombay High Court. The facts there were that the appellants, during an altercation, had struck blows on the deceased`s head with lathis (wooden sticks) and the latter had subsequently died. They were charged with murder but the sessions court convicted them of voluntarily causing grievous hurt instead.
We first considered Mr Rajah`s submission. In our view, apart from the fact that the first appellant had drunk some beer, there was no evidence to show that he was intoxicated. Under s 86(2), the burden lay on the first appellant to show on a balance of probabilities that he had not formed any intention for the offence due to his state of intoxication. In this respect, he has not succeeded in so doing. In 
 Tan Hung Thiam & Anor v PP, 
 we confirmed the principles of common intention under s 34 of the Penal Code as elucidated by this court in 
 Mimi Wong v PP 
, as well as the Privy Council decision of 
 Mahbub Shah v Emperor 
. We need only repeat that the criminal act need not be identical to the common intention so long as it was done in furtherance of it and more often than not common intention has to be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. In our view, the trial judge was perfectly right in disbelieving the first appellant`s explanations that he joined in the assault only after the other appellants had felled the deceased. We had no doubt that his actions were in furtherance of the common intention of all three appellants to cause grievous hurt to the deceased.
Although on the evidence the second appellant only made his appearance at the scene of the assault itself, we were unable to agree with Mr Tan`s submissions that he did not share any common intention with the other two or that his actions could not be said to be in furtherance of the common intention of all three of them. In his s 122(6) statement, the second appellant stated that the reason why he hit the deceased was because the deceased disturbed the first appellant. From this it does not take too much imagination to infer that he had been informed of this fact by either or both appellants beforehand. Coupled with his admission that he hit the deceased with a piece of wood, there was clear evidence that the second appellant shared a common intention to cause grievous hurt with the other two and his participation in the assault was in furtherance of the common intention of all three of them. We were also satisfied that the trial judge considered the evidence against the second appellant separately and had not, as Mr Tan submitted, `lumped together the evidence`.
Mr Isaac submitted that a wooden stick, unlike a knife or gun, is not inherently a deadly weapon. We need only say that it was not the wood per se but the manner in which it was used to attack the victim that made it a deadly weapon. It follows that even though lathis (wooden sticks) were used in 
 Mana Gendal 
`s case3 which resulted in a conviction for grievous hurt, that does not assist the third appellant as that case turned on the application of those lathis. In fact, in that case the Bombay High Court disapproved of the practice of the sessions court in convicting the accused of the lesser offence of grievous hurt and opined that the appellants should have been convicted at the very least of culpable homicide not amounting to murder.
In the present case, the medical evidence pointed to the blows with the pieces of wood having been delivered with great force and from all directions resulting in 15 injuries and two fatal ones to the head of the deceased. Furthermore the deceased was outnumbered in numbers and was unarmed. We had no doubt that the blows which caused the fatal injuries were applied intentionally and that the third appellant participated in the assault in furtherance of the common intention of all three of them to cause grievous hurt to the deceased.
Lastly, we considered whether the three appellants` statements amounted to confessions which is a condition precedent to the application of s 30 of the Evidence Act. The trial judge reviewed the authorities and concluded that the Privy Council decision of 
 Anandagoda v The Queen 
, was the correct interpretation of s 17(2) of the Evidence Act. Section 17(2) defines a confession as follows: 
 
A confession is an admission made at any time by a person accused of an offence, stating or suggesting the inference that he committed that offence.
 
 
 
The Privy Council in 
 Anandagoda 
`s case7 was considering s 17(2) of the Ceylonese Evidence Ordinance which is in pari materia with our s 17(2). The headnote of the case reads as follows: 
 
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts. The appropriate test in deciding whether a particular statement is a confession is whether the words of admission in the context expressly or substantially admit guilt or do they taken together in the context inferentially admit guilt?
 
 
 
We endorse this view and have also done so in the recent decision of 
 Tan Chee Hwee & Anor v PP. 
 The words `suggesting the inference that he committed the offence` clearly demand a wider interpretation than that placed by the Indian Supreme Court in 
 Pakala Narayana Swami v Emperor, 
 on the Indian counterpart legislation which does not have these words.
We accordingly dismissed the appeals of all three appellants.

We have before us two appeals which arise out of interlocutory matters in an action by the respondents against the appellants. Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991 involves an order continuing interlocutory injunctions while Civil Appeal No 9 of 1991 concerns an application by the appellants for further and better particulars of a cause of action in the statement of claim in the main action.
 The joint venture
The dispute between the parties arises out of a joint venture agreement signed on 22 October 1971 between the first respondent Haw Par Brothers International Ltd (`Haw Par`) and Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd, a company incorporated in Hong Kong. The joint venture agreement was subsequently varied by a document entitled `heads of agreement` and dated 29 November 1976. The joint venture agreement and the `heads of agreement` will hereinafter be referred to collectively as `the JVA`. The duration of the JVA was to be 20 years.
The purpose of the JVA was stated to be the improvement of the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of products made under Haw Par`s worldwide Tiger Brand trade mark by tapping the expertise of the first appellant Jack Chiarapurk (`Jack Chia`), who was acknowledged as an expert in pharmaceuticals and their sale and distribution, and the resources of the companies under his control. The JVA`s scope was limited territorially to Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei, Hong Kong, Macau, Thailand, Taiwan, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Philippines, Indonesia, Burma, Japan, Korea, the Pacific Islands and the Middle East (`the JV territories`). The JVA provided for the incorporation of Haw Par Eng Aun Tong Pte Ltd (`HPE`) in Singapore and Haw Par Tiger Balm International Pte Ltd (`HPT`) in Hong Kong (`the JV companies`) and the grant of licences to the two companies by Haw Par for the manufacture of Tiger Brand products as the mode by which the purpose of the joint venture was to be attained. The shareholding in each of the JV companies was divided equally between Haw Par and Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd. Under the JVA, the promotion of the Tiger Brand products would be carried out by the JV companies or companies selected by them and the profits of the JV companies, after deductions for dividends and royalties payable to Haw Par, would be shared between the joint venture partners. Further, Jack Chia would serve as chief executive officer of the JV companies and head Haw Par`s pharmaceutical division. It is important to note that the JVA was not exclusive in character: Haw Par continued to manufacture and sell Tiger Brand products in other parts of the world not covered by the JVA and Jack Chia and his group of companies continued the manufacture of various other pharmaceutical products. By a series of supplemental agreements in 1976, 1985 and 1986, Haw Par transferred its interest in HPE to the second respondent and Chia Holdings (HK) Ltd transferred its interest in HPE and HPT to the second and the third appellants respectively. However, the transferees all agreed to be bound by the JVA.
 Events of 1988-1990
The joint venture was successful between 1972 and 1988, and talks began between the two sides in October 1988 with a view to renewing the JVA before it expired at the end of 1991. It became evident however that Haw Par wished to have the majority control of the JV companies and Jack Chia was not willing to cede the same. By letters dated 7 November 1989, the second respondent gave notice to Jack Chia and to the second and third appellants that the JVA would not be renewed.
In February 1990, Haw Par heard rumours from the market that Jack Chia and his companies were manufacturing a new balm product. This was confirmed by Jack Chia`s representative at a meeting in early March with Haw Par`s new managing director. On 5 March 1990, one of the appellants issued a price list to distributors for a new balm called the Golden Lion Shield balm (`the GLS balm`) which lies at the heart of the dispute between the parties. The new balm was publicly advertised on 1 May 1990. By a letter dated 15 May 1990, written by the respondents` solicitors to Jack Chia and copied to the second and third appellants, the respondents complained that the manufacture and distribution of the GLS balm infringed the JVA and was an attempt to pass off the GLS balm as a balm manufactured under the Tiger Brand trademark as `Tiger Balm`. The appellants replied on 29 May admitting the manufacture and distribution of the GLS balm but denying any infringement or passing off. By a letter dated 13 June, the respondents refuted the appellants` assertions.
 Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991
On 19 June 1990, the respondents began these proceedings, claiming damages and injunctions based on breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of confidence and passing off, and by an ex parte application on 22 June 1990, obtained the injunctions which are under appeal in Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991. The injunctions were subsequently varied to exclude specified products manufactured by the appellants and their associated companies. The injunctions against Jack Chia provided that:
 
 
(1) [Jack Chia] by himself, his servants or agents or otherwise be restrained, and an injunction is hereby granted restraining him until further order from doing or from causing, procuring or permitting the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th [appellants] to do any of the following acts: 
 
(i) manufacturing, packaging, exporting, distributing, offering for sale, selling, supplying, disposing, promoting by advertisement or otherwise or dealing in any way in the Golden Lion Shield Balm Products; 
 
(ii) passing off or attempting to pass off or causing, enabling or assisting others to pass off Golden Lion Shield Balm Products as or as connected with the Tiger Balm Products; 
 
(iii) acting in breach of fiduciary duty or the fiduciary or contractual obligations pursuant to [the JVA] competing with, or causing or allowing or participating in the manufacture, sale or distribution of products competing with those manufactured, sold or distributed by the [JV companies] and in particular the manufacture, sale or distribution of the Golden Lion Shield Balm Products; and 
 
(iv) making unlawful use of confidential or other information acquired by or entrusted to [Jack Chia] as the Managing Director and Chief Executive of the [JV companies] relating to the business and production of Tiger Balm Products.
  
 
 
The injunctions against the other appellants were in similar terms.
We pause for a moment to state our disapproval of the step taken by the respondents to obtain the injunctions at an ex parte hearing without any notification to the appellants. The solicitors for both sides were in correspondence at the time and there was clearly disagreement on the issue of whether the manufacture and distribution of the GLS balm was in any way wrongful. In 
 Castle Fitness Consultancy Pte Ltd v Manz, 
 Coomaraswamy J expressed the view that the practice in Singapore should follow that in England as set out in 
 Pickwick International Inc (GB) Ltd v Multiple Sound Distributors Ltd 
, and in a Practice Direction of the Queen`s Bench Division dated 30 March 1983. The learned judge said at p 143: 
 
In my humble view, the opponent should be given notice of the ex parte application and invited to attend. Alternatively, in appropriate and justifiable instances, adequate reason for not giving such notice should be given to the court on affidavit. In some cases, eg Marevas, an applicant`s purpose can be defeated by his opponent having advance knowledge of an ex parte application for an injunction. Possible defeat of an applicant`s purpose if the adversary had knowledge of the intended application will be an appropriate and justifiable instance where notice need not be given.
 
 
 
We are in agreement with the view of the learned judge. The present case was not one in which there was any reason for not informing the appellants of the application for the injunctions, nor did the respondents give any reason for not doing so.
The appellants, by summonses in chambers dated 28 June 1990 and 31 October 1990, applied to discharge the injunctions. The application was dismissed by Chao Hick Tin J on 1 March 1991 with the costs of the application in the cause. The appellants now appeal against the dismissal of the application and the respondents by their notice seek to have the order for costs varied to one that gives them the costs of the hearing below or in any event.
 Civil Appeal No 9 of 1991
Civil Appeal No 9 of 1991 arises out of the claim for breach of confidence in the main action which is pleaded as follows:
 
 
(12) Further or in the further alternative, in and about the development, manufacture, distribution and marketing of the said Golden Lion Shield Balm products the [appellants] have made use and/or caused, procured or permitted each other to make use of confidential information the property of the [respondents], alternatively have made use of information entrusted in confidence to the [appellants] pursuant to the JVA and/or for the purpose of carrying out their obligations thereunder and/or their obligations towards the [JV companies].

On appeal to the learned judge, no order was made.
 Appeals against exercises of discretion
As these appeals concern exercises of discretion by the learned judges below, we bear in mind this court`s approval in 
 Federal Computer Services Sdn Bhd v Ang Jee Hai Eric 
 of the following statement of principle by Lord Diplock in 
 Hadmor Productions Ltd & Ors v Hamilton & Ors 
 at p 220: 
 
An interlocutory injunction is a discretionary relief and the discretion whether or not to grant it is vested in the High Court judge by whom the application for it is heard. Upon an appeal from the judge`s grant or refusal of an interlocutory injunction the function of an appellate court, whether it be the Court of Appeal or your Lordships` House, is not to exercise an independent discretion of its own. It must defer to the judge`s exercise of his discretion and must not interfere with it merely upon the ground that the members of the appellate court would have exercised the discretion differently. The function of the appellate court is initially one of review only. It may set aside the judge`s exercise of his discretion on the ground that it was based upon a misunderstanding of the law or of the evidence before him or upon an inference that particular facts existed or did not exist, which, although it was one that might legitimately have been drawn upon the evidence that was before the judge, can be demonstrated to be wrong by further evidence that has become available by the time of the appeal; or upon the ground that there has been a change of circumstances after the judge made his order that would have justified his acceding to an application to vary it. Since reasons given by judges for granting or refusing interlocutory injunctions may sometimes be sketchy, there may also be occasional cases where even though no erroneous assumption of law or fact can be identified the judge`s decision to grant or refuse the injunction is so aberrant that it must be set aside upon the ground that no reasonable judge regardful of his duty to act judicially could have reached it. It is only if and after the appellate court has reached the conclusion that the judge`s exercise of his discretion must be set aside for one or other of these reasons, that it becomes entitled to exercise an original discretion of its own.
 
 
 
The same principle applies to applications for particulars: 
 Norman Wright & Anor v Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd. 
 Expiry of the JVA
Since the hearing of the application below to discharge the interlocutory injunctions, the JVA has, on 31 December 1991, expired. Accordingly, the injunctions based on restraining the breaches of contract and/or fiduciary duty arising out of the joint venture cannot be sustained and counsel for the respondents did not seek to support their continuation. However, he stressed that the lapsing of that ground for the injunctions did not affect the findings of the learned judge that there were serious issues to be tried on those grounds, and, in particular, that there was a real issue as to breach of fiduciary duty by Jack Chia. We do not question that there may indeed be serious issues to be tried on those matters but, with the expiry of the JVA, the respondents` remedy for those wrongs lies in damages and not by way of injunction. It is not correct to seek to justify a restraint on the appellants by reference to a broad sense of wrong doing. There must be specific continuing wrongs that are issues to be tried and the balance of convenience must be in favour of restraining the allegedly wrongful acts until trial or further order: 
 American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd 
. We therefore turn to consider if the interlocutory injunctions can be justified under either breach of confidence or passing off or both. The application for particulars will be considered with the consideration of the breach of confidence ground.
 Breach of confidence - Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991
The learned judge in deciding to continue the injunctions restraining breach of confidence reasoned: 
 
In the light of the brief facts set out above it is quite clear that the plaintiffs and the first three defendants are in a joint venture, a venture to manufacture, promote, sell and develop the Tiger Brand products, including the Tiger Balm products, for mutual advantage and profit. The confidential information which would be furnished by the plaintiffs to the joint companies should only be used for the purpose of manufacturing the Tiger Brand products by the joint companies and not for any other purpose. Looking at the terms of the JVA, I am inclined to think that there is a fiduciary relationship between the participants to the joint venture arrangements or there is at least an arguable case for it. ...
 
 
 
In any event where information provided is to be considered as confidential, its use and disclosure under general law is to be limited to the purpose for which the information is given: see 
 Torrington Manufacturing v Smith & Sons Ltd 
 (1966) RPC 285 at 301.
It is next argued by the defendants that the plaintiffs have not shown that they have imparted confidential information to the first three defendants or the joint companies. The defendants say that the plaintiffs have not been able to identify with necessary precision any information which is confidential.
In further elaboration, the defendants aver that there is nothing confidential about the `manufacturing process` which they identified to consist of the following five stages:
 
 
(i) mixing active ingredients to form a concentrate; 
 
(ii) mixing the base materials or excipient; 
 
(iii) mixing the concentrate with the base materials; 
 
(iv) filling the mixture into appropriate containers; 
 
(v) packaging the product.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs answer that that is not all. Those are the basic steps. What are confidential are the details relating to each step, eg at what temperature the equipment used should be set; at which stage should each of the ingredients be added; and the duration the ingredients are to be kept in that state (see para 43 of the affidavit of Tan Hee Chai affirmed on 16 November 1990).
 
 
 
In so far as the ingredients that are needed to manufacture the Tiger Balm products, the defendants submitted that there is nothing confidential about that because the ingredients are shown and printed on the product itself; they are matters of public knowledge. While that is true, it seems to me that is not all. The ingredients that go into making a product is one thing; the process another. ... The fact that the ingredients that go into the making of the product are disclosed on the packaging of the product does not mean that all the technical information/ know-how needed to manufacture the product has become public knowledge.
In any event having regard to the express provisions in the JVA and the licence agreements which specifically refer to confidential information being imparted by the plaintiffs to the joint companies, I do not think it is possible for the court at this interlocutory stage, without hearing oral evidence, to rule that the first plaintiff has not imparted any confidential information. Putting it at the lowest, it is an issue to be tried.
Before moving to the second ground, I should say this for completeness. Another aspect of confidential information referred to by the plaintiffs relates to pricing formula. I do not think there is anything very much in this aspect. I note that this information is made known to all sub-distributors and retailers.
The respondents have not cross-appealed against the finding that the pricing formula for Tiger balm is not confidential. We are accordingly only concerned with whether the injunctions are justifiable on the basis of the confidentiality of the manufacturing process of Tiger Balm.
Mr Fysh for the appellants conceded that the JVA imposed an obligation of confidence upon the appellants. He contended however that this fact on its own was not sufficient to found an action for breach of confidence as such a cause of action is made up of three cumulative elements which counsel, basing himself on 
 Saltman Engineering Co Ltd v Campbell Engineering Co Ltd 
, and 
 Gurry on Breach of Confidence 
 (1984) at p 4, formulated as follows:
 
 
(a) that the information must inherently possess the quality of confidence; in other words, it must not be in the public domain, and 
 
(b) that the foregoing information must have been imparted under circumstances importing an obligation of confidence, and 
 
(c) that its recipient has thereafter misused that information.
  
 
 
Counsel contended that the application for the interlocutory injunctions failed in limine as the respondents had not shown that there were serious issues to be tried in respect of (a) and (c) since they had failed to particularize the confidential information which they seek to protect. In support of that submission, counsel stressed the changes of position by the respondents on the general particulars of the confidential information. In the affidavit of Tan Hee Chai filed on 19 June 1990 in support of the ex parte application for the injunctions, the respondents relied on the ingredients making up Tiger balm as constituting the confidential information. However, in their statement of claim filed on 3 August 1990, the confidential information was stated to be `the manufacturing process` of the balm. No more specific information was forthcoming despite the application for particulars in which the appellants suggested in an affidavit of Stephen Leow, the person then responsible for their manufacture of Tiger balm, filed on 13 September 1990, that there were the five steps in the manufacturing process which the learned judge set out in his judgment. The respondents, shortly before the hearing below, filed on 16 November 1990 a further affidavit affirmed by Tan Hee Chai that commented on the five steps as follows: 
 
The plaintiffs say that the above description is a very basic and general description. It does not address in detail the manufacturing process and the confidential and/or other information connected thereto. For instance, Mr Leow has not indicated amongst others, at what temperature the equipment used should be set at; at which stage should each of the ingredients be added and the duration the ingredients are to be kept in that state before the actual manufacturing process can be said to be completed. The plaintiffs will produce to the judge at the hearing of this action, information relating to the manufacturing process of the Tiger Balm product to show the misuse by the defendants of confidential and/or other information relating thereto.
 
 
 
Mr Burton, on the other hand, stressed that the appellants had manufactured Tiger balm under the JVA arrangements. It was therefore obvious, he contended, that they knew what was confidential and it was moreover inequitable or unjust that they should obtain a `springboard` in the commencement of their business by their wrongdoing.
We have difficulty accepting Mr Burton`s argument for the reason that it is necessary, in our view, that a party seeking to injunct another from utilizing allegedly confidential information has to be specific about what he seeks to restrain. This requirement of specificity flows from the need to show that there is a serious issue to be tried in respect of each element of the cause of action and also from the need for certainty as to what act is being sought to be restrained.
This requirement was discussed in 
 Diamond Stylus Co Ltd v Bauden Precision Diamonds Ltd & Ors 
. In that case, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had wrongfully used their secret process for the manufacture of diamond styli. They did not, however, specify what the secret process was. In refusing to grant an interlocutory injunction, Graham J said at p 676: 
 
If a plaintiff is alleging that he is in possession of a secret process or possesses confidential information and that the defendant has wronged him by using or disclosing that secret process or confidential information, he is necessarily in any trial in a difficult position unless he is prepared to state clearly what is the nature of the process or information in which he claims proprietary rights and which he claims has been used by the defendant. His difficulty is that if he does disclose in detail what his process is, he thereby gives away secrets, which is the one thing he does not want to do, though he may in such a case be able to make out his prima facie case by showing that the defendant has used part or the whole of that process. If, on the other hand, he is not prepared to disclose his secret then he is in an obvious difficulty in showing that what the defendant has done is to take that secret, because there is not ex hypothesi sufficient identification of the latter to enable a satisfactory conclusion to be drawn.
 
 
 
Here in the present case the plaintiffs, the Diamond Stylus Co Ltd, are unwilling to disclose and have not in fact disclosed what their process is in detail at all. They say that their process involves the use of tumbling apparatus and a tumbling process which they obtained the right to use under licence from a Swiss company, Raymond & Cie. They go on to say that the evidence shows, or at any rate that the proper inference from the evidence is that the defendants are using this process and that they could only have got the idea of using it from the plaintiffs.
Although, Mr Stanley put the matter as forcibly and clearly as it could be put on behalf of his clients, I am not satisfied that the plaintiffs have here made out a prima facie case which is sufficiently strong or clear on this branch of the case to justify the grant of an interlocutory injunction. No details of the Raymond & Cie process are specified by the plaintiffs, that is to say, they do not specify whether they use any particular grinding material, lubricant, nor what other details are involved in the process, and also it is not clear whether the defendants are in fact using the same apparatus as that used by the plaintiffs, nor as already stated, if they are, what are the details of the process involved in such use.
A similar point was made in a different way by Brightman J in 
 Amway Corporation & Anor v Eurway International Ltd & Ors 
, where the plaintiffs sought to injunct the defendants from making use of information contained in their business literature. The learned judge said at pp 86-87: 
 
I asked the plaintiffs` counsel if he could point in his literature to some particular piece of information which he said was confidential and which he claimed the defendants were wrongly using. He told me that he pointed to nothing in issue here but to the entirety of the plaintiffs` documentary material which is in evidence.
 
 
 
It seems to me that a claim for abuse of confidential information cannot really be dealt with in that way. If I made an order restraining the defendants from using for their own purposes any of the documentary material contained in the plaintiffs` business literature, but did not identify the particular information that the defendants are not to impart, they would be placed in a most embarrassing situation. I do not know how they could decide what business methods, literature and paperwork to avoid using in order to keep clear of contempt of court; and I think that that is an insuperable difficulty in the plaintiffs` claim under this head.
The above statement of law was quoted with approval by the High Court of Australia in 
 O`Brien v Komesaroff 
 at p 327.
In 
 Hytrac Conveyors Ltd v Conveyors International Ltd & Ors, 
 the plaintiffs` writ sought injunctions restraining the defendants from infringing the plaintiffs` copyright in drawings relating to materials handling systems and using unspecified confidential information. After issue of the writ, the plaintiffs first obtained Anton Piller orders and then subsequently sought interlocutory injunctions. Despite reminders by the defendants, the plaintiffs failed to serve their statement of claim and the defendants eventually, while the motions for the interlocutory injunctions were pending, took out a summons to strike out the proceedings under O 19 r 1. The application succeeded before Whitford J who stated at p 67: 
 
It is not right in my judgment, that the plaintiffs should start an action apparently not in a position even to know what form of statement of claim they should make until possibly after an Anton Piller order has been secured and the evidence upon an application for an interlocutory injunction has been taken through to the end. It is in my judgment particularly important where questions of infringement of copyright are concerned and where questions of confidence are concerned that in the clearest possible terms the exact ambit of the plaintiffs` claim in these regards should be made known.
 
 
 
This approach was approved on appeal and Lawton LJ who delivered the main judgment stated at p 70: 
 
It has to be remembered by all concerned that we do not have in this country an inquisitorial procedure for civil litigation. Our procedure is accusatorial. Those who make charges must state right at the beginning what they are and what facts they are based upon.
 
 
 
A most instructive case is 
 Lock v Beswick 
, in which the plaintiff sought, inter alia, an injunction against several former employees restraining them from using supposedly confidential information described in a schedule which the plaintiff alleged the defendants were using to gain an advantage or `springboard` in their competing business. Hoffman J said in a passage worthy of extensive quotation at p 1274: 
 
Before the `springboard` doctrine can be invoked, however, it must be shown that the information which constituted the springboard was information which the defendants could not lawfully use. It would not, for example, be sufficient to say in general terms that they were extremely familiar with the way Metalcheck detectors worked - with, as the plaintiff`s witnesses repeatedly say, their `strengths and weaknesses.` There may have been some particular strength or weakness which was indeed a trade secret, but general familiarity is pre-eminently the kind of skill and knowledge which the honest employee cannot help taking away with him.
 
 
 
It is of course tempting in an action such as this, concerned with the technicalities of electronics, to say that the questions at issue can only be investigated at the trial and that for 
 American Cyanamid 
 purposes (
 American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd 
 
[1975] AC 396
) the plaintiff must be treated as having an arguable case. It would however be unjust to the defendants simply to allow the plaintiff to blind the court with scientific banalities.
We do not overlook the decision in 
 Underwater Welders and Repairers Ltd v Street and Longthorn 
. There the plaintiffs sought an interim injunction restraining their ex-employees from using a process for the cleaning of ship hulls. The plaintiffs did not give particulars as to which aspects of the process they claimed were confidential. Nonetheless, Buckley J granted the interlocutory injunction, taking the view that more could not be expected in interlocutory proceedings. That decision, however, stands alone against the weight of authority. Moreover, it was confined to its facts by Graham J in the 
 Diamond Stylus 
case.8 With respect, we also do not agree with it in principle. A plaintiff should be prepared to make out his case and not expect the court to speculate even at the interlocutory stage, even if only an arguable issue has to be made out. The court has means of ensuring that the confidential information is not seen by anyone other than the Bench or, if necessary, an expert witness: see generally 
 Gurry on Breach of Confidence 
 at pp 460-466.
When we turn to the present appeal, we do not find any particularization of the respondents` claim but merely a statement that the details of the manufacturing process are confidential. It must be borne in mind not only that the first appellant was brought into the JVA for his expertise as an acknowledged expert in pharmaceuticals but also that the respondents themselves manufacture Tiger balm in areas other than the JV territories. Yet, they have offered no evidence by anyone familiar with the manufacture of the balm. Instead, the affidavits on their behalf have been affirmed by Tan Hee Chai, the group general manager of Haw Par and the company secretary of the second respondent. In his affidavit filed on 19 June 1990 in support of the ex parte application, he states that he was `advised` that the ingredients of the GLS balm are substantially the same as those of Tiger balm. He does not go on to state the identity and qualifications of those advising him. Similarly, in his later affidavit filed on 16 November 1990, he simply states that it is the respondents` view that the details of the manufacturing process and the `confidential and/or other information connected thereto` are confidential without stating the source of such belief. There is thus a double failing. There is not sufficient particularization and what little information there is emanates from a source that claims no familiarity with the manufacture of the product.
Mr Burton relied on the case of 
 Proctor Industries Ltd v Norris Brothers Ltd. 
 In that case, the plaintiffs had employed the defendants as consulting design engineers for the purpose of designing and developing on their behalf a prototype locking device for an automatic safety belt. The defendants subsequently produced a rival device and the plaintiffs alleged, inter alia, in their statement of claim that in designing and developing the rival device, the defendants wrongfully and in breach of confidence `... used for their own ends the confidential information supplied to them by the plaintiffs...`. It was not in dispute that the plaintiffs had given the defendants confidential information although the extent of the information given to the defendants was disputed. The confidential information allegedly supplied was pleaded in para 5 of the statement of claim and particulars were sought under that paragraph and were supplied. Particulars were also sought under para 8 of the statement of claim of `... the manner the defendants have used ...` the information stated in para 5 Plowman J refused to order the particulars sought, stating at p 181: 
 
In regard to the question of the manner in which the confidential information is said to have been used, for myself I do not see how the plaintiffs can say more than that in designing and developing the rival device the defendants used confidential information.
 
 
 
As I say, the plaintiffs are saying, in effect, here is your device; this is the confidential information we gave you; the inference must be that in producing your device you used it. In those circumstances, I do not think the plaintiffs can be asked to be more specific.
In our view, the decision is of little assistance to the respondents. There was no dispute in that case that confidential information had been given by the plaintiffs to the defendants. Indeed, particulars had been given of the information supplied. What was in issue there was the manner the information was used; a matter within the knowledge of the defendants alone. The plaintiffs were entitled to rely on an inference that the information had been used because of the admitted similarity of purpose between the two devices. Thus Harman J said in 
 Speed Seal Products Ltd v Paddington & Anor 
 at p 79: 
 
I entirely agree and accept from the decision which Mr Hobbs cited to me in 
 Proctor Industries Ltd v Norris Brothers
[supra] ... that ... one can perfectly properly allege by way of inference from pleaded facts that such a thing as 
 use of
 confidential information must be inferred, and there is no necessity in such a case to give particulars of the taking of the confidential information. (Our emphasis.)
 
 
 
The position in the present appeal is quite different. It is clearly disputed that the information the appellants have used is confidential and, in the absence of particularization, the respondents` cause of action simply is not made out.
In our view therefore, the discretion of the learned judge in continuing theinjunctions was exercised on a wrong principle of law. It was for the respondents to show that they had imparted confidential information to the appellants which the appellants were wrongfully using to gain an advantage in their competing business. It was not sufficient for the respondents merely to allege, and by an officer who was not personally conversant with the details, that there was a manufacturing process, the detailed particulars of which were confidential, and not disclose them. It was incumbent on them to be specific before injunctions could be justified on the basis of the confidentiality of the manufacturing process. In the absence of any attempt at further elaboration by the respondents before us of what they say is confidential, we discharge the injunctions based on breach of confidence.
 Confidential information - Civil Appeal No 9 of 1991
We now turn to the appeal in respect of the application for particulars of the statement of claim. There are two aspects to this. First, the learned judge in refusing particulars of request 3(b) under paras 12(1) and 12(2) held that they were attempts to elicit the respondent`s evidence. Mr Fysh contended that this was to misconceive the requests which were in fact directed at the respondents` allegation that the appellants had jointly acted in breach of confidence. We agree with counsel`s submission. The particulars sought go to the manner in which it is said that the appellants have jointly committed the breach of confidence. It is essential that the appellants know what is alleged against them.
Secondly, in refusing to vary the assistant registrar`s order for best particulars of the other requests to be delivered 30 days after discovery, the learned judge reasoned that since the first three appellants have been involved with the manufacture and distribution of Tiger balm for some time, they had better knowledge of the matters sought under the particulars than the respondents did. He then held that the respondents could not provide particulars without laborious research or exhaustive enquiry, and further that the parties were in a fiduciary relationship. He accordingly applied paras 18/12/45 and 18/12/43 of the Supreme Court Practice 1991.
No mention was made in the grounds of decision of the learned judge of the non-exclusive character of the JVA. This characteristic of the JVA allowed the respondents to manufacture and distribute Tiger balm in areas of the world apart from the JV territories. It is a misconception of the facts to say that the respondents have no knowledge of the manufacturing process and the sales information relating to Tiger balm. Moreover, they are also shareholders in the JV companies. We do not think that it would be right to limit the appellants to best particulars and only after discovery. It would cause hardship as they too are manufacturers of balm and need to know just what information they are being attacked for using. All the considerations stated above in the discussion on the need for particularisation for the interlocutory injunctions apply equally to this appeal. In 
 John Zink Co Ltd v Wilkinson & Anor, 
 the defendants to a breach of confidence action sought particulars of the information alleged to be confidential. The application was made before the filing of their defence. In ordering particulars, Russell LJ said at p 724: 
 
Now it may be said (as said the judge) that the defendants can plead to this claim as it stands. In one sense this is true. They can produce a series of denials which would do little to define the field of dispute. But I think that in any event there are here special reasons for now ordering the particulars sought. The scope of the claim as it stands at present is said in evidence, and the statements are uncontradicted, to cover the whole field of this particular manufacture as a forbidden field. It is indicated in evidence, and the indication is not contradicted, that this cannot be possible. It is suggested in evidence, and the suggestion is not answered, that the generality of the claims and accusations are typical of an unacceptable attitude previously demonstrated by the plaintiffs and their associated US company. Some particularization of the details of the complaints has been sought since July 1969, and none has been forthcoming. In those circumstances, and of course every case must be considered in the light of its own particular circumstances, I cannot but conclude that the interests of justice between the parties require some condescension to details on the part of the plaintiffs before the defendants are required to apply themselves and their legal and expert advisers to the question of defence. It will then be known what are the matters which are said to be trade secrets or confidential matter, and not simply the areas in which or the matters in respect of which it is said that the plaintiffs are or were so to speak proprietors of trade secrets or information that was confidential. All this must now be known to the plaintiffs. In so far as the plaintiffs` rights have been breached or infringed by the first defendants, or by procurement by the second defendant, presumably the plaintiffs have at present some ground for their assertions in those regards, and can add to particulars if later other such grounds emerge on discovery.
 
 
 
Stamp LJ agreed and stated at p 727: 
 
Where one finds a statement of claim averring a whole list of trade secrets, averring a duty of confidence in a defendant not to disclose them one is, until particulars are given, entitled to view the action as one designed to fish out a case. And where this appears to be the case it is a special reason for ordering particulars at the earliest stage.
 
 
 
Edmund Davies LJ put the matter on a higher plane by comparing the allegation of breach of confidence to an allegation of criminal conspiracy. The learned Lord Justice was of the view at p 726 that such a grave allegation of improper conduct required `clear particularization`.
There is therefore more reason where a defence has been delivered, albeit necessarily in general terms, that the respondents here give particulars of what they say is confidential information and how it has been misused by the appellants. Accordingly, we allow the appeal in respect of the application for particulars and order that the respondents serve them on the appellants within 14 days of this judgment.
 Passing off - Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991
We now return to Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991 and consider the interlocutory injunctions based on passing off.
The elements of the tort of passing off have been identified, and there is no dispute between counsel on this point. In 
 Erven Warnink BV v J Townend & Sons (Hull) Ltd, 
 Lord Diplock said, at p 742, that it was possible to: 
 
... identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing off: (1) a misrepresentation, (2) made by a trader in the course of trade, (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of the goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence), and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so.
 
 
 
Lord Fraser, at p 755, expressed the relevant principles thus: 
 
It is essential for the plaintiff in a passing off action to show at least the following facts: (1) that his business consists of, or includes, selling [in England] a class of goods to which the particular trade name applies; (2) that the class of goods is clearly defined, and that in the minds of the public, or a section of the public, [in England,] the trade name distinguishes that class from other similar goods; (3) that because of the reputation of the goods, there is goodwill attached to the name; (4) that he, the plaintiff, as a member of the class of those who sell the goods, is the owner of goodwill [in England] which is of substantial value; (5) that he has suffered, or is really likely to suffer, substantial damage to his property in the goodwill by reason of the defendants selling goods which are falsely described by the trade name to which the goodwill is attached.
 
 
 
At the hearing below, the appellants had challenged the locus standi of the respondents to bring an action in passing off but the point was not pursued before us and we make no comment on it. The learned judge found that there was a serious issue to be tried on passing off by get up. He reasoned: 
 
The main complaint of the plaintiffs here is that the get-up of the Lion Balm is too similar to that of the Tiger Balm products. The plaintiffs allege that the get-up of Lion Balm products copies the get-up of the Tiger Balm products in the following respects:
(i) the glass container of the Lion Balm is hexagonal in shape and similar in size, with its logo at the bottom of the container; 
(ii) the packaging of the container of the Lion Balm is similar in style, colour and design. The label and the top-seal are of a jagged-edge tooth format. The whole packaging is then sealed by two circular seals containing the logo; 
(iii) the colour of the `screw-on` cover of the hexagonal container of the Lion Balm is of the shade of bronze; 
(iv) the `screw-on` cover is similarly embossed, albeit with its different logo.
 
 
 
I note that there are some differences in detail in the two get-ups. But I do not think that those differences are sufficient to avoid confusion or deception. The defendants have not explained why the get-up of the Lion Balm products has to be in so many ways similar to those of the Tiger Balm products.
 
 
 
It is not necessary for passing-off that every part of the get-up should be imitated. In the present case the adoption of a phonetically similar Chinese name for the Lion Balm further aggravates the situation. It is common usage to refer to the Tiger Balm products by asking for them in retail outlets as `Wan Jin You` and not their full titles in Mandarin. Of all possibilities, the defendants chose to call their Lion Balm products `Wan Yin You`. I think our case here is very close to 
 Reckitt & Colman Ltd v Borden Inc 
 
[1990] 1 WLR 491
 which concerned lemon juice sold in yellow plastic squeeze packs resembled in size, shape and colour of a natural lemon. There the court granted the plaintiff an injunction to restrain the defendant from producing lemon-shaped containers for selling lemon juice. ...
I accept that a careful purchaser would be able to differentiate between the Tiger Balm products and the Lion Balm products. But I do not think that is an answer to an action for passing-off if people are deceived or are likely to be deceived. The obligation is on the defendant to show that he has taken steps to ensure that there will be no confusion. ...
Considering the get up and the shape and size of the two jars, and the phonetic similarity in the Chinese names of the two products, I cannot help but feel that the defendants have deliberately tried to take advantage of the goodwill of the Tiger Balm products and what was done was calculated to enable a passing-off to take place. This is really a case of `cashing-in` now that the JVA is due to expire. This is all the more so when we bear in mind that a fairly substantial proportion of the population in Singapore are Chinese-educated and quite a proportion of the elderly people in Singapore are illiterate. For these people I think the get-up is all that matters. Having seen the jars in which the two products are sold to the public, I have no doubt that the similarity is likely to cause confusion or, to adopt the words of Warrington J in 
 Schweppes Ltd 
 [(1905) 22 RPC 113], to cause the retail vendor to deceive the ultimate purchaser. In short the get-up of the Lion Balm products is deceptively similar to that of the Tiger Balm products. All the more so when it is noted that the two products are manufactured, distributed and sold by the first defendant`s group of companies. There is no need to prove actual deception: see 
 White Hudson v Asian Organization 
 
 
 
[1965] MLJ 186
 . It is sufficient if the evidence shows that there is such similarity as to be calculated to cause confusion in the mind of the public.
In a case where passing off by get up is alleged, the relevant point of reference is the point of sale. It must be borne in mind that at the point of sale the purchaser of the balm sees only the outer packaging of the balm. At this point, it is said that the appellants have deliberately copied the packaging of Tiger balm, and the similarities alleged have been set out in the above passage from the judgment. On viewing the outer packaging of the two balms, we find ourselves in broad agreement with the view of the learned judge. Apart from our disagreement with the learned judge`s observations on the relevance of illiteracy, which this court has held to be an evaporating consideration in the Singapore of today (see 
 Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuffs Pte Ltd 
 at p 367) it is clear that the learned judge was entitled to come to his finding of an arguable case that the get up of the Lion Balm products is deceptively similar to that of the Tiger Balm products.
However, there are further points of criticism made by Mr Fysh which we should deal with. The first relates to the form of the order below. The breadth of the order restraining the appellants from dealing in GLS balm products did not indicate any appreciation of the fact that dealing in such products was only objectionable if their get-up would confuse or deceive the consumer into thinking that they were Tiger balm products. In 
 White Hudson & Co v Asian Organization, 
 a case on passing off by get-up, the perpetual injunction granted restrained 
 
the defendants, their servants and agents from offering for sale, selling or otherwise dealing in medicated cough sweets not manufactured by the plaintiffs and wrapped with the defendants` `Pecto` wrapper 
 without clearly distinguishing such wrapper from the plaintiffs` `Hacks` wrapper
. (Our emphasis.)
 
 
 
We agree with counsel that words such as the italicized words are a necessary part of any injunction, whether perpetual or interlocutory, granted in a case of passing off by get up. The absence of those words in the present appeal have the effect of preventing the appellants from manufacturing and distributing balm under the GLS label, which the respondents have not objected to, and this is much too wide and undesirable in the interests of competition.
A second and more important point made by Mr Fysh was that the learned judge erred in holding that damages would not be an adequate remedy in this case. He cited the decision in 
 The Boots Company Ltd v Approved Prescription Services Ltd 
, in support. The plaintiffs in that case had for some time sold the drug ibuprofen under the name `Brufen` in the form of magenta coloured pills of a particular shape. After the plaintiffs` patent expired, the defendants wished to market a generic version of the drug in the same shape and colour. The plaintiffs sought an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from doing so. It was held by Whitford J at first instance that the plaintiffs had an arguable case of passing off but that the balance of convenience was against the grant of the injunction. The learned judge held that the plaintiffs would be adequately compensated by damages if they succeeded in obtaining a permanent injunction. There was no question of the defendants being unable to meet any damages awarded and the quantification of the damages would be based on the defendants` records of the sales of their pills. On the other hand, the grant of the interlocutory injunction would force the defendants to give up the particular drug or to change to another colour. In the former situation, the damages would be difficult to quantify and in the latter, they would be in extreme difficulty whether to go back to the original colour or to stay with the new colour. The Court of Appeal agreed with Whitford J. In the present appeal, the learned judge below distinguished the 
 Boots 
 case20 on the following grounds:
 
 
(1) the quality of the pills produced by the two companies in that case were the same,
  
 
 
 
(2) the pills were only obtainable on prescription, and 
 
(3) as the pills were a controlled drug, there was no possibility of the refusal of the injunction encouraging other competitors from entering the market before the trial.
  
 
 
We would respectfully disagree. Where the dispute is between two parties of repute and there is no question that either side would be unable to meet any subsequent award of damages, it is not in the public interest to prevent competition between two products which the respondents themselves have stated are of comparable quality: see para 11 of the affidavit of Tan Hee Chai filed on 19 June 1990. There is no evidence before us which indicates that the appellants would not be able to keep accurate records of their sales of GLS balm. Indeed, in the absence of any evidence on the keeping of records, a fair inference would be that they are capable of keeping accurate records. There would be no difficulty with the quantification of damages and accordingly we also discharge the injunctions based on passing off.
 Costs
We now come to the question of costs. The respondents have, by their notice in Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991, appealed against the order of the learned judge that the costs of the hearings on the injunctions be in the cause. The learned judge gave no grounds for the order presumably because such an order is the normal practice of the High Court. Mr Burton contended that such a practice is wrong and that the normal rule as to costs should apply, ie costs should follow the event and, since the respondents succeeded after a contested hearing, they should get costs or at least an order that their costs be in the cause. That form of order is said to be the normal order in the Chancery Division of the English High Court and we were referred to para 29/1/10 of the Supreme Court Practice 1993.
We are not inclined to interfere with the decision of the learned judge. The question of costs is plainly one of discretion and the learned judge has followed the regular practice of the courts of Singapore. An interlocutory application does not purport to decide a matter on its merits. The decision of the trial judge will determine whether the interim relief ought to have been granted. In principle, if a plaintiff succeeds at trial then he should have obtained interim relief. Similarly, if a defendant succeeds at trial, then interim relief, if obtained, should not have been granted against him. Moreover, the practice of the Chancery Division is not an invariable one: see 
 Steepleglade Ltd v Stratford Investments Ltd. 
 The respondents` cross-appeal in Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991 therefore fails.
In the result, the appellants succeed in both appeals and are to have the costs of their appeals and the respondents` unsuccessful cross-appeal in the Civil Appeal No 57 of 1991. The security deposits for both appeals are to be released to the appellants` solicitors. The costs of the proceedings below in both appeals remain in the cause.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant, Juma`at bin Samad, was convicted on his plea of guilty to a charge of housebreaking in order to commit theft under s 454 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and was sentenced to the mandatory minimum of 18 months` imprisonment.
The appellant admitted that on 1 May 1990 at about 9pm he was in the house of one Zulkifli bin Jantan (`Zulkifli`) and he agreed to accompany Zulkifli to break into the nearby Jagoh Primary School (`the school`) and commit theft. At about 10.15pm they proceeded to the school. Upon reaching the school, they cut a hole in the fence surrounding the school`s perimeter with a pair of pliers which Zulkifli had brought along and they entered the school`s premises through this hole. They then forced open the offices of the principal, vice-principal and staff and stole various items including a computer, a printer, diskettes, printer ribbons, a vacuum cleaner, six cassette recorders and six wrist watches. The total value of the items came up to $5,660.
The appellant and Zulkifli were spotted on the school compound by a passer-by who informed the police. The police arrived at the school and arrested the appellant and Zulkifli inside the school building at 12.44 am. The stolen items were recovered at the scene.
Before the senior district judge, counsel for the appellant in mitigation urged the court to make a probation order instead of ordering a custodial sentence. Counsel pointed out that the appellant had a stable and promising career as the founder of a profitable and expanding electronics company and that he was a prominent and highly-respected young Malay entrepreneur. There was also a brief reference to the appellant having committed the offence under the influence of alcohol. The senior district judge considered these submissions as well as the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty and was a first offender. He noted that the appellant had committed the offence while he was still working with his electronics company and that Zulkifli on the other hand had been sentenced to the mandatory two years` imprisonment under s 457 of the Penal Code for the same offence. Furthermore, the mandatory sentence provided reflected clear legislative policy as to what public interest demanded and the courts should take a parallel course. The relevant cases also took the common view that housebreaking offences should be dealt with by deterrent custodial sentences. Considering all these factors, the senior district judge was of the view that placing the appellant on probation was inappropriate and decided to impose the punishment of 18 months` imprisonment.
Notwithstanding his plea of guilty in the district court, the appellant has filed a criminal motion asking this court to exercise its revisionary powers under s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) to inquire into the conviction. In order to show that the conviction was unsatisfactory, the appellant has applied for the leave of the court to introduce additional evidence to show that he was in fact entitled to the defence of intoxication under s 86(2) of the Penal Code. Alternatively, the appellant appeals against the sentence of 18 months` imprisonment.
 The application for criminal revision
In support of the application for criminal revision, the appellant sought the leave of the court to introduce fresh evidence that he was entitled to the defence of intoxication under s 86(2) of the Penal Code. Four affidavits were filed which purportedly showed that the appellant was addicted to alcohol, that he was heavily intoxicated at the time he committed the offence, that the appellant could not have intended to steal the items as he would have known that they were almost worthless and that what the appellant did was completely out of character with his achievements and station in life.
The first affidavit was that of one Murad bin Abdullah (`Murad`), a friend of the appellant. He stated that at about 8.05 pm on the night in question he was at a coffee shop drinking beer with three of his friends when the appellant and Zulkifli also arrived. The appellant appeared to be drunk. The appellant and Zulkifli then sat down and the appellant treated everyone to drinks. All in all, 30 big bottles of Carlsberg Special Brew were consumed. The appellant was seen to be drinking continuously. At about 10.30pm, the appellant left for Zulkifli`s flat with another five big bottles of Carlsberg Special Brew. The appellant was observed to be intoxicated; he walked unsteadily and his speech was slurred.
The second affidavit was that of Leong Keng Kheong (`Leong`) who was the appellant`s counsel in the district court. He stated that the appellant had during certain interviews told him that he had been drunk at the time he committed the offence and that he had consumed 30 bottles of Carlsberg Special Brew before he committed the offence. However, since the appellant could not confirm whether he had subjected himself to a medical examination to ascertain his blood alcohol level at the material time, the defence of intoxication was not pursued at the trial.
The third affidavit was that of the appellant himself in which he stated that he had informed Leong that immediately before he committed the offence he had consumed 30 bottles of Carlsberg Special Brew and that he could not remember the events after 9.30pm that night. He had not informed Leong that he was an alcoholic as he was ashamed of it and did not know of its legal significance. The appellant was finally admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital to receive medical treatment for his addiction from 8 February 1993 to 17 April 1993. A medical report from the hospital dated 31 March 1993 was adduced which confirmed that he received such treatment from 8 February 1993. It was stated in the report that the appellant was in the withdrawal phase and that his craving for alcohol was still strong. He was said to suffer withdrawal symptoms including amnesic blackouts.
The appellant also stated in his affidavit that he is a successful Malay entrepreneur in a relatively new field of computer technology and that he is the sales director of an electronics company. Information on the company obtained by a search at the Registry of Companies and certain income tax returns of the appellant were also filed. The appellant further pointed out that as he is in the computer business he would have been aware that the stolen items were virtually worthless as they were not new products. He claimed that he was so intoxicated that he could not have had the necessary mens rea to commit the offence and that this was supported by the fact that he jumped from the second storey of the school building at the time of the arrest.
A fourth affidavit filed was that of one Durairaj Mahendran (`Durairaj`), who holds directorships in two computer companies, including being managing director of one of them. Durairaj inspected photographs of the stolen computer and printer and came to the view that the computer was not a commercially re-saleable item and that a purchaser could be found only with the greatest difficulty. Even so, such a purchaser would pay only a fraction of the purchase price of the computer. Also, the resale value of the printer would be less than 50% of its original cost.
 The principles in deciding if additional evidence should be taken
Section 268(1) of the CPC makes it clear that the revisionary powers of this court include the power to order the taking of additional evidence in accordance with s 257(1) which provides as follows: 
 
In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by a District Court or Magistrate`s Court.
 
 
 
The question is whether the above evidence is `necessary`. Certain principles are to be applied in determining this question and these were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Rajendra Prasad v PP. 
 The court held that in applying s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (`SCJA`), which is materially similar to s 257(1) of the CPC, the principles encapsulated in the following statement from Denning LJ`s judgment in 
 Ladd v Marshall 
 should be observed: 
 
In order to justify the reception of fresh evidence for a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled : first it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; second, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.
 
 
 
These three conditions - non-availability, relevance and reliability - are, of course, similar to those enunciated by Lord Parker CJ in 
 R v Parks 
, and which have been time and again affirmed in the Singapore and Malaysian courts: 
 Mohamed bin Jamal v PP, 
 
 Lo Fat Thjan v PP, 
 
 Khamis v PP, 
 
 Che Din bin Ahmad v PP, 
 
 Dol bin Lasim v PP. 
In short, the circumstances in which an application to introduce fresh evidence will be allowed are extremely limited. Edmund Davies LJ in 
 R v Stafford 
, explained: 
 
... public mischief would ensue and legal process could become indefinitely prolonged were it the case that evidence produced at any time will generally be admitted by this court when verdicts are being reviewed.
 
 
 
This statement was approved by the Court of Appeal in 
 R v Lattimore. 
 In the earlier case of 
 R v Jordan, 
 Hallet J summed up the attitude that the courts should adopt: 
 
It is only in the most exceptional circumstances, and subject to what may be described as exceptional conditions, that the court is ever willing to listen to additional evidence.
 
 
 
Hallet J`s statement was approved by the local courts in 
 Mohamed bin Jamal v PP 
, and 
 Che Din bin Ahmad v PP. 
 In 
 Lo Fat Thjan v PP 
, the Federal Court stated : 
 
... we would deprecate generally the admission of additional evidence on appeal except in clearly exceptional circumstances. The adversary system in our trials is hardly compatible with allowing lacunae in the case of any party to be filled in by afterthoughts or countenancing reconstruction of any case after it has failed at the trial.
 
 
 
It was held in 
 Khamis v PP 
 that the necessity for additional evidence should be apparent from the record itself and should not be sought from outside information, that is, there should be some prima facie evidence bearing upon the guilt or innocence of the accused to be found on the record itself. With respect to the learned judge, I doubt that that is the law in Singapore. Such a rule is hard to justify and would impose an unwarranted restriction on the already very narrow scope of s 257 of the CPC. It is not inconceivable that there could be a situation where wholly unexpected evidence would be unearthed after the trial which brings into contention a new aspect which was not addressed at all in the trial.
 The defence of intoxication in s 86(2)
Section 86(2) of the Penal Code states : 
 
Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he would not be guilty of that offence.
 
 
 
Where the effect of intoxication is that the accused person did not form the requisite intention, s 86(2) may, of course, provide a complete defence. Alternatively, s 86(2) can be a mitigating circumstance which may render an accused to be guilty of a lesser offence due to the fact that he did not by reason of intoxication form the requisite intention for the graver offence: see for example 
 Suba Singh v PP 
, 
 Tan Hung Song v PP 
, and 
 PP v Teo Heng Chye. 
It is to be noted that an anomalous consequence of the drafting in s 86(2) is that it applies only where the mens rea for an offence is intention, in contradistinction to offences requiring other forms of mens rea specified in the Penal Code, for example, knowledge or rashness. The result is somewhat disturbing; for example, s 86(2) would apply to a charge of murder under s 300(a), (b) or (c) but not to a charge of murder under s 300(d). However, the words of the provision are clear and the consequences though discomfiting are not of such degree of absurdity as would justify the court departing from a literal interpretation.
Another aspect of s 86(2) on which there is some controversy is whether the burden of proof falls on the accused person to prove on a balance of probabilities that he was so intoxicated that he did not form the necessary intention, or whether the burden remains on the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that, in spite of the intoxication, the accused person did form the requisite intention. I am inclined to favour the former view. Sections 85 and 86 are found in Ch 4 of the Penal Code which deals with general exceptions, for which the burden of proof falls on the accused persons by virtue of s 107 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). Furthermore, s 85(1) expressly refers to s 86 as dealing with the `defence` of intoxication. Therefore, any evidence of intoxication does not affect the prosecution`s case; in proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had the necessary mens rea the prosecution is entitled to treat the accused as if he were sober. The court may no doubt have to answer some rather hypothetical and artificial questions in the process, but this is preferable to a solution which is completely out of accord with the general scheme of the Penal Code and the Evidence Act. Furthermore, the scope of s 86(2) generously extends to voluntary intoxication, a legal excuse which, in my view, can never put an accused in a more favourable position than another accused who pleads any of the other defences.
In the present case, the appellant was convicted of the offence of housebreaking in order to commit theft. According to ss 441 and 442 of the Penal Code, the mens rea of `housebreaking` is the same as the mens rea of house-trespass and criminal trespass, that is, an intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy. The mens rea of housebreaking in order to commit theft must therefore be an intent to commit theft and accordingly, the defence of intoxication in s 86(2) is potentially applicable (the word `intent` being in this context synonymous with `intention`). The appellant would thus have a complete defence if he can show on a balance of probabilities that he was so intoxicated that he did not housebreak with the intention to commit any offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy. Alternatively, his conviction may be reduced to one for a lesser form of housebreaking if he can show that, in spite of housebreaking with the intention to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy, he did not housebreak with the intention to commit the specific offence of theft.
With the above principles in mind, I turn to consider if the conditions for the taking of the additional evidence in this case have been satisfied.
 Relevance and credibility of the additional evidence
The relevance and credibility of the additional evidence are related aspects and are best considered together. The appellant has to satisfy the court that the additional evidence is apparently credible and if believed establishes on a balance of probabilities that he was entitled to the defence of intoxication. However, having regard to the facts of the case and the fresh evidence in the affidavits, I am of the view that the additional evidence does not achieve this.
Several inconsistencies are apparent from a perusal of the affidavits. First, the assertion of the appellant that he had drunk 30 bottles of Carlsberg Special Brew is inconsistent with Murad`s evidence that the 30 bottles were in fact shared between six people including the appellant. Secondly, the appellant stated that he did not remember the events after 9.30pm on the night in question but Murad on the other hand stated that at about 10.30pm, the appellant got up and said he was going to Zulkifli`s flat and the appellant then paid for all the drinks. It would thus appear from this conduct that the appellant was far more coherent than a man who was so drunk as to be incapable of forming any intention to commit a crime. Furthermore, the appellant claimed that he had also told Leong about his inability to recollect the events after 9.30pm but Leong`s affidavit makes no reference to this. Thirdly, the statement of facts which the appellant pleaded guilty to is inconsistent with the version of the facts that emerges from the affidavits of the appellant and Murad. According to the statement of facts, the appellant was with Zulkifli at the latter`s house at 9pm and the two of them left the house for the school at 10.15pm. No explanation was tendered as to the discrepancy.
The medical report contains a host of hearsay assertions which must be excluded, for example, the statements that the appellant had been drinking since he was 13 years old, that he had got into fights without reason and that he could not give any reasons for breaking into the school except that he was under the influence of alcohol. The only significant evidence contained in the report is that the appellant was admitted to Tan Tock Seng Hospital for treatment for his addiction to alcohol, which was observed to be quite serious. However, the report relates to the treatment given to the appellant and his condition from February 1993 onwards, almost three years after the offence. The report provides no independent evidence that he was in such a critical state of addiction or that he was heavily intoxicated at the time of the offence. Moreover, an addiction to alcohol is only marginally relevant to the issue, which is whether at the time he committed the offence he had the necessary mens rea.
The evidence that the appellant was a successful entrepreneur in the computer industry was also somewhat unsatisfactory. The appellant`s counsel at the trial had told the court that the appellant founded his computer company in July 1989 and that he held 20% of the company`s shares. However, the business profile record from the Registry of Companies and Businesses shows that the appellant`s computer company was registered only in February 1991, some nine months after the date of the offence, and that he held only 7,000 shares out of the 250,000 shares issued. There is again no independent evidence that the appellant was in the computer business or familiar with computers before that date or at the date of the offence. Correspondingly, the evidence as to the low value of the computer items stolen by the appellant loses much of its significance.
The only other independent evidence in the appellant`s affidavit is that his notice of assessment of income tax for the year of assessment 1990 indicated that he had earned a fairly high income, and that he had leaped from the second storey of the school building when the police arrived. It is hardly necessary to add that both pieces of evidence are of very limited probative value in relation to the facts they were intended to prove.
The deficiencies in the additional evidence become even more apparent when the factual matrix is considered. The appellant followed Zulkifli from the latter`s house to the school. A hole was cut in the school fence with a pair of pliers which one of them had brought along and the appellant entered the school premises through the hole. Various offices in the school were forced open and a number of items were stolen, before the police arrived and they were arrested. The whole course of events spanned more than two hours and entailed an extensive sequence of apparently conscious and purposeful acts. Such a protracted criminal venture negates any serious possibility of one of the two participants being so inebriated as not to have intended to embark on the unlawful endeavour at all.
Taking all the above considerations into account, I have come to the conclusion that the additional evidence is not apparently credible and does not establish on a balance of probabilities that the appellant was entitled to the defence of intoxication. Considering all the circumstances, there is no plausible evidence, direct or inferential, that the appellant was so intoxicated at the time of the commission of the offence that he did not form the requisite intention for the offence for which he was convicted other than the assertions of the appellant himself.
 Availability of the evidence at the time of trial
The remaining condition for the introduction of fresh evidence in an appellate court is also not satisfied. The evidence of the appellant`s inebriation at the time of the commission of the offence, his addiction to alcohol and the real value of the stolen items was clearly available at the time of the trial.
While it is true that the evidence of the treatment the appellant received for his addiction to alcohol and the accompanying medical report was not strictly available at the time of the trial, this is simply because a medical person had not been consulted until after the trial when he or somebody equally competent could have been consulted before it (see 
 Mohamed bin Jamal v PP 
,). The appellant`s reason why he did not inform his counsel at the trial that he was addicted to alcohol was similarly not a viable explanation for the failure to adduce evidence at the trial. Counsel at the trial, having been informed by the appellant that he was drunk at the time he committed the offence after consuming a large quantity of beer, should have at the very least advised the appellant that intoxication could be a defence in law and attempted to elicit more evidence concerning the matter instead of being contented with what he was told. That is the very purpose for which a person accused of an offence engages legal counsel. In my view, the additional evidence now sought to be introduced was available for production if reasonable diligence had been exercised.
It is true that there are situations where the court would allow additional evidence to be called even though it could not be strictly said that the evidence was not available at the time of the trial, if it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. The core principle in s 257 of the CPC, after all, is that additional evidence may be taken if it is necessary, which must mean necessary in the interests of justice. That said, it must be emphasized in no uncertain terms that such a situation will arise only in the most extraordinary circumstances.
The existence of this narrow exception has always been accepted by the English courts. In England an appellate court, in accordance with s 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 or the corresponding provisions in its predecessor Acts, may allow the introduction of fresh evidence if it thinks it `necessary or expedient in the interests of justice`. In 
 R v Gatt 
, the Court of Appeal, which included Lord Parker CJ who had delivered the judgment of the court in 
 R v Parks 
, stated that although the principles on which the court allows evidence to be called are as set out in 
 R v Parks 
, the court has power to give leave to call evidence which was available at the trial if it feels that there might have been a miscarriage of justice. The court relied on a line of earlier English decisions including 
 R v Gray, 
 
 R v Warren, 
 
 R v Knox. 
 More recently, this overriding power to do justice was exercised again in 
 R v Lattimore, 
 
 R v Lee 
, and 
 R v Ahluwalia. 
However, it is equally clear that the court will not allow the introduction of the additional evidence if it was actually considered by counsel at the trial but rejected because it was thought to be unnecessary or inappropriate or of doubtful assistance to the defence (see for example 
 R v Perry and Harvey 
, and 
 R v Gatt 
 15). As recently proclaimed by the Privy Council in 
 Rodolpho de los Santos v R, 
 if defending counsel in the course of a case made a decision or took a course which later appeared to have been a mistake or unwise, that, generally speaking, has never been regarded as a proper ground of appeal. A conscious decision not to adduce evidence, unless it amounted to flagrantly incompetent advocacy, did not provide a reasonable explanation for the failure to call at the trial the evidence which is sought to be introduced at the appeal. In the present case, as is quite apparent from Leong`s affidavit, the possibility of raising the defence of intoxication was considered but later rejected due to a perceived lack of evidence. It is also quite apparent that in adopting this course there was no professional conduct which could be termed `flagrantly incompetent advocacy`.
Admittedly, there have been isolated instances where in an effort to correct glaring injustice, evidence which was in fact considered at the trial has been allowed to be introduced in an appeal. But this is warranted only by the most extenuating circumstances, which may include the fact that the offence is a serious one attracting grave consequences and the fact that the additional evidence sought to be adduced was highly cogent and pertinent and the strength of which rendered the conviction unsafe (see for example 
 Mohamed bin Jamal v PP 
, and 
 R v Lattimore 
,). The circumstances in the present case fall far short of that mark.
In my opinion, therefore, the application to allow the fresh evidence should not be allowed and this is not an occasion for this court to exercise its powers of criminal revision, and accordingly the motion is dismissed.
 The appeal against sentence
In respect of the appeal against sentence, counsel for the appellant urged this court to exercise its discretion to set aside the sentence of 18 months` imprisonment imposed by the district court and to make a probation order instead.
The purported source of this discretion is s 5(1) of the Probation of Offenders Act (Cap 252), the relevant part of which states : 
 
Where a court by or before which a person is convicted of an offence (
 not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law
) is of the opinion that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may, instead of sentencing him, make a probation order ... (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In 
 R v Goh Boon Kwan, 
 Murray-Aynsley CJ in a brief three-paragraph judgment interpreted the words `fixed by law` in the Probation of Offenders Ordinance 1951 to refer to a sentence fixed both in quantum and kind. The offence in question was one of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code which provided that an offender `shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 7 years`. The learned Chief Justice held that the sentence for that offence was not `fixed by law`. Despite its brevity the decision in 
 Goh Boon Kwan, 
 has been followed apparently without question by courts in Singapore for the last 38 years, and applied not only to offences for which no minimum sentence was prescribed, as in 
 Goh Boon Kwan. 
 In practice the case has been used to render probation under the Probation of Offenders Act available to the majority of the offences under the Penal Code and other criminal statutes, the exceptions being those offences for which a death sentence or life imprisonment has been mandatorily prescribed. The result has been that counsel for accused persons almost invariably and as a matter of course plead for a probation order as an alternative to any sentence of imprisonment which may appear to be under consideration. There is obvious need for a general review outside the court system of the scope of probation and its application by the courts.
So far as the present case is concerned, however, the appellant was convicted under s 454 of the Penal Code which prescribes a penalty of imprisonment which `shall be for a term of not less than 18 months and not more than 10 years`. In my opinion, the offence in s 454, unlike the one under consideration in 
 Goh Boon Kwan, 
 is an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law to be a minimum of 18 months. The existence of judicial discretion to impose a sentence of imprisonment of a greater duration is immaterial for these purposes; the vital element is the clear statutory prohibition on the court from giving sentences of imprisonment of less than the minimum period expressly stated.
In my opinion the insertion of the phrase `an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law` clearly indicates that the court`s discretion to make a probation order is subordinated to the power of the legislature to provide that certain offenders be made to suffer certain forms of punishment. The provision of a mandatory minimum sentence is a clear instance of the exercise of this power by the legislature and the court ought not to usurp this power by an unjustifiably wide reading of an unambiguous provision. Therefore the expression `an offence (not being an offence the sentence for which is fixed by law)` cannot and should not be given the excessively broad meaning of any offence other than one which attracts a single inflexible sentence for which the exact quantum and kind of punishment are expressly provided in the statutory provision concerned. Also, there does not seem to be any viable distinction between the intention of the legislature as expressed by a sentence fixed strictly in quantum and kind and a sentence fixed in kind but the quantum of which is allowed to fluctuate between certain minimum and maximum levels. It would be ludicrous if Parliament had either to make express provision, or constrain itself to sentences that do not give any judicial discretion as to quantum, whenever it creates an offence the punishment for which is not intended to include probation.
In my opinion, for the reasons stated, this court has no power to make a probation order in the present case. The appellant having been sentenced to the minimum of 18 months` imprisonment by the district court, any appeal against the sentence is entirely misconceived. Accordingly, the appeal against sentence is dismissed.

The appellant, a Hong Kong citizen, was charged with importing into Singapore on 21 November 1990 2,718g of diamorphine, an offence under s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). At trial he was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to death. He appealed against his conviction. Following a hearing we dismissed the appeal and we now give our reasons.
The salient facts of the case are as follows. On 21 November 1990, the appellant was arrested at Changi International Airport at about 3pm, by one Koh Keng Siang (`Koh`), then a Higher Customs Officer. Koh, who had been on duty at the relevant time and who had been watching the arrival of the passengers on a flight from Bangkok and Phuket, had noticed the appellant because he had unnatural bulges at his legs beneath his jeans. Koh approached the appellant and after identifying himself, asked for the appellant`s passport and air ticket. The appellant told Koh that he had just come from Phuket on holiday and that he had a girlfriend there.
The appellant was brought to the customs surveillance room where he was asked if he had anything on his person. He kept silent. Koh then frisked the appellant`s body and discovered slabs strapped to his thighs, calves and waist. There were altogether 16 such slabs or blocks. When asked what the slabs were, the appellant replied that he did not know. He was handcuffed and later Koh questioned him again. Koh noted down his answers as they were given and transcribed them into his pocket book the next day. At the trial of the appellant in the court below, certified copies of Koh`s pocket book entries were admitted in evidence and we will refer to their contents in some detail, as counsel for the appellant based his appeal on the question of whether it had been fair to the appellant to admit these entries.
Following the arrest of the appellant by Koh, Senior Narcotics Officer Chew Kai Chow (`Chew`) was notified and he arrived at the airport at about 5.10pm to take over custody of the appellant. Photographs were taken of the appellant showing him with the blocks strapped to his thighs, calves and waist, after which Chew seized the blocks as well as the thigh guards and calf guards which had been used. The appellant was taken back to the Central Narcotics Bureau where Chew recorded a statement from him under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The process of recording this statement lasted from about 9.30pm to 10.50pm.
At trial, the learned judicial commissioner held that the above statement of the appellant`s had been made in circumstances in which `his free will was sapped` and the integrity of the recording process `was put in question`; hence the statement was inadmissible.
 Defence of duress
The appellant for his part chose to testify in the court below. He relied on two defences, duress and lack of knowledge. As for the defence of duress, the appellant gave evidence that he had been coerced into carrying the blocks of diamorphine by a friend he knew only as `Ah Weng`, with whom he had been holidaying in Thailand. Apparently Ah Weng had turned `nasty` in the course of their trip and had demanded that he carry the blocks on his person after showing him how to strap the blocks onto his body. The appellant alleged that he had done as Ah Weng ordered because he had been frightened by Ah Weng`s threats to kill him as well as his family should he attempt to alert the authorities or to throw away the blocks. Ah Weng had taken him to Phuket Airport on 21 November 1990 where he had given him an air ticket to Singapore while at the same time repeating his threats to kill him and his family if he should attempt to escape. The appellant had further been warned that there would be someone on the plane who would be watching him. Consequently he had been `terrified` during the flight and he claimed to have felt someone watching him all the time during the flight, although he admitted that he never saw this mysterious watcher clearly and could not even be sure whether it was a man or a woman. Nevertheless, he insisted that the mysterious watcher had followed him down from the plane and into Changi International Airport when the plane landed in Singapore.
The above evidence differed from the version of events which the appellant related to Koh while being questioned after his arrest. He told Koh that he had been recruited by a Hong Kong Chinese (whose name he did not know) to carry out a simple job for which he was to be paid HK$50,000. He had gone to Thailand where he had been met by Ah Weng, who had shown him how to strap things onto his body and legs. In reply to a query from the appellant as to whether the things were `Pak Fun` or `Shuet Ko` (colloquial terms for heroin and a drug known as `ice` respectively), Ah Weng had told the appellant not to worry as he would only be engaging in `petty smuggling`. Ah Weng had then given him an air ticket for a flight leaving Phuket for Singapore and had instructed him to proceed to Phuket. The appellant, acting accordingly, had on 21 November 1990 strapped the goods onto his body himself before leaving for the airport.
Having reviewed the evidence before him, the learned judicial commissioner held that there was `no threat issued that could reasonably cause the apprehension of instant death` to the appellant, as required by s 94 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The appellant claimed that Ah Weng had threatened to kill him but there was no evidence to show that Ah Weng had been armed or had otherwise possessed the means to carry out his threats with immediacy. Despite his claims as to the terror he felt while on the plane and in the airport, he failed similarly to show that he had indeed been in any immediate danger during that period of time, particularly in view of the fact that there had been no one holding him hostage during that time. Furthermore he did not state that he had at any time been in fear of instant death. Therefore, even if his evidence about Ah Weng`s threats were to be accepted, the defence of duress would not stand. As it was, the learned judicial commissioner expressed grave reservations about the appellant`s evidence. The appellant described Ah Weng as a `colleague` and a `better-than-normal friend`; yet, when asked, he said he did not know Ah Weng`s telephone number, his address or even his full name. Also, in spite of his professed terror at the threats of violence allegedly made by Ah Weng, he had said nothing at all about these threats when speaking to Koh. The learned judicial commissioner went on to state that, on the other hand, he had found Koh`s evidence as regards the interrogation and the pocket book entries to be `honest and accurate, if not perfect accounts of the interrogation`. The appellant`s defence of duress was consequently rejected.
 Defence of lack of knowledge
As for the defence of lack of knowledge, the judicial commissioner applied the principles enunciated by Lord Pearce in 
 Warner v Metropolitan Police Commissioner 
 and adopted by our Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Tan Ah Tee and Anor v PP, 
 viz that there is a strong inference that a person in possession of a package is in possession of its contents; further, that it is for the accused person to rebut this inference by proving either (a) that he was a servant or bailee who had no right to open the package and no reason to suspect that its contents were illicit or were drugs, or (b) that although he was the owner he had no knowledge of its actual contents and also that he had had no reasonable opportunity since receiving the package to acquaint himself with its actual contents.
In the court below, the appellant admitted his own suspicion of the blocks of substance he had been carrying. He had had the right and the opportunity to examine these blocks after Ah Weng left him at Phuket Airport and while on the plane, yet he had not done anything. The learned judicial commissioner held therefore that the appellant had failed to discharge the inference of his having been in `possession` of the said blocks.
Since neither defence raised by the appellant was sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution case, the appellant was convicted of the charge against him.
On appeal, counsel for the appellant informed us that he would not be making any submissions on the learned judicial commissioner`s findings as regards the defences of duress and of lack of knowledge. The sole ground of appeal which he relied on related to the admission of certified copies of Koh`s pocket book entries as evidence. Counsel`s objections appeared to be based on the argument that since the pocket book entries were transcribed from notes made by Koh on a piece of paper during his questioning of the appellant and since this transcribing was done only on the day after the questioning session, the original piece of paper should have been produced in court. Counsel contended that the omission to produce them was so grave as to deprive the appellant of a fair trial.
Having heard his submissions, however, we were of the considered opinion that there was no basis to the contention. There was no real purpose which the production of the original piece of paper could have served. That piece of paper was never shown to the appellant, nor was it signed by him. Koh was the only person who ever saw that piece of paper. He was the person who made the original notes and who then transcribed them into the pocket book: and he was present in court to testify to this. We did not see how the omission to produce the original piece of paper could have prejudiced the appellant in any way, while Koh was available for cross-examination especially since the appellant himself took the stand to give evidence as to the whole interrogation which contradicted that of Koh`s. Indeed, counsel for the appellant in the court below cross-examined Koh as to his questioning of the appellant and the making of the pocket book entries. At the close of the rather detailed cross-examination, counsel put it to Koh that in fact the questioning session (or `interrogation`) had not taken place as described in the pocket book entries; that in fact Koh had only asked the appellant three questions and that the appellant had not at any stage related to Koh the version of events set down in Koh`s pocket book. All this was denied by Koh and it is clear that the learned judicial commissioner, having had the opportunity to observe both Koh and the appellant in the witness stand, was satisfied as to the veracity and credibility of Koh`s testimony, for (as we noted earlier) he stated: `I accepted his evidence on the interrogation and the pocket book entries to be honest and accurate, if not perfect accounts of the interrogation.`
We were also of the view that in any case the learned judicial commissioner did not actually rely on the evidence of Koh`s pocket book entries in coming to his decision. Although he set out the contents of the pocket book entries in his judgment, this was done as part of the process of setting out the relevant background to the case. He referred to Koh`s evidence again when rejecting the appellant`s defence of duress but this reference was made after he had examined the evidence given by the appellant in court and found that on the basis of the appellant`s own evidence, the defence of duress was not made out. Indeed, the reference to Koh`s pocket book entries was somewhat perfunctory since by that stage it was eminently clear that, in dismissing the defence of duress, it would be unnecessary to rely on the evidence of the pocket book entries. We were of the view therefore that the admission of Koh`s pocket book entries as evidence did not occasion the appellant such prejudice as to deprive him of a fair trial.
Having regard to the reasons given above we dismissed the appeal.
Having perused the record of appeal, however, we feel it necessary at the same time to add our observations as regards the decision in the court below to disallow the admission of the appellant`s s 122(6) statement recorded by Senior Narcotics Officer Chew. Two reasons were given for this decision. First, the fact that the appellant had not been given any food or drink after his arrest and up to the time the s 122(6) statement was being recorded (a period of about seven hours) was held to have `sapped` his free will. Secondly, there was apparently some confusion as to whether the appellant had been taken to hospital for his post-statement medical examination immediately after his statement was recorded (as the appellant claimed) or whether there had been a delay of about half an hour (as Chew claimed); and this confusion was held to have thrown the integrity of the recording process into question.
As to the first factor, while it is basically a question of fact as to whether failure to offer an accused food and drink constitutes a `threat` or an `inducement` which might render any statement he made involuntary within the terms of s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code, there will be varying degrees of seriousness as far as such failures are concerned. An accused might be continually grilled for days on end without being given food and drink or he might go without such sustenance for a few hours. The failure to offer sustenance might be a deliberate ploy to weaken the accused`s will or it might be a genuine oversight amidst the flurry of investigative activity. The point is, it does not appear to us to be realistic to take the sweeping stand that every failure to offer an accused sustenance constitutes a `threat` or an `inducement` of such gravity as to automatically render any statement he makes involuntary. There are numerous factors to be taken into account. In the present case, the appellant was without food and drink for seven hours within the same day, ie 21 November 1990. Prior to his arrest at the airport at about 3pm, he had eaten a meal on board the plane. At no point during the interrogation by Chew did he ask for a meal or complain of hunger pangs. He was medically examined twice on 21 November 1990, once at 8.21pm by Dr Chin Wen Chiang and again at 11.40pm by Dr Jenny Lim Tang Wah: neither medical report made any mention of his having been in a state of collapse or even in a physically weakened state due to hunger and thirst. With the greatest respect to the learned judicial commissioner therefore, it did not appear to us that the omission to offer the appellant sustenance in the present case was so serious and engendered such grave consequences that the appellant`s will might have been completely overborne.
As for the latter factor of when the appellant had been conveyed to hospital, we would point out that although Chew`s claim that there was a delay of half an hour contradicted the evidence of the appellant and that of Chew`s two colleagues, there was no suggestion that Chew`s evidence in itself was a fabrication of some sort designed to cover up some impropriety on his part. In any case there was never any dispute that the recording of the statement itself had been completed by 10.50pm. With the greatest respect, we did not see how the alleged confusion over whether the appellant had been conveyed to hospital at 10.50pm or half an hour afterwards could be said to have tainted the integrity of the recording process.
Whilst it is true that judges must be vigilant at all times as to any irregularity or impropriety committed in the recording of statements from accused persons which might render such statements involuntary, it should also be noted that not every instance of conflicting evidence points ineluctably to an irregularity suggesting involuntariness. In this we found ourselves in respectful agreement with the judgment of Lord Hailsham in 
 Director of Public Prosecutions v Ping Lin 
, in which his Lordship expressed the view that an overly legalistic attitude on the part of the courts would ultimately form `a clog on the proper exercise by the police of their investigatory function, and indeed on the administration of justice itself`. Our concern is that our courts should be mindful of the pitfalls of such an attitude and that is why we have dealt at some length with the above matters.

ss 441 & 447 Penal Code (Cap 224)
 
The respondent in the present appeal was charged with criminal trespass by entering into the room of the complainant with intent to annoy, an offence punishable under s 447 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The salient facts of the case are as follows.
The complainant was one Tee Huey Jiun (`Tee`), a student at the National University of Singapore (`NUS`). On 9 May 1992, she happened to be moving into a room at Kent Ridge Hall, a students` hostel, for the varsity holidays. This room was on the third floor, an all-female floor. Tee, who had gone to visit a friend in the building, had left the door to her room open and the lights on.
She was away for only a few minutes. At about 2.45am, on returning to her room, she saw a man standing inside her room by the window. He came out when he saw her and said he was looking for someone named `Michele`. She spoke to him for about five minutes, to `play his game` as she put it, whilst hoping that a friend would come by. At that point, the corridor was lit up, as was her room. When no one passed by, Tee asked the man to go downstairs with her to a room where her male friends were. However, before they reached the ground floor, he ran away. The following day she made a police report. On 23 May 1992 the respondent was arrested and charged with criminal trespass with intent to annoy Tee after having been identified by Tee at Clementi Police Station.
At trial, the respondent`s defence was that he was not the man seen by Tee. He claimed that he had never met Tee before; that he did not know anyone named `Michele`; and that at the material time on 9 May 1992, he had been on an outing with four friends, Quah Chee Lam (`Quah`), Chiang Hoe Yee (`Chiang`), Teo Choon Kian (`Teo`) and Loi Oi Ming (`Loi`). All four were called to substantiate the respondent`s alibi. They confirmed that sometime after 11pm on 8 May 1992, they accompanied the respondent to Chinatown where they bought durians. They took these to West Coast Park to eat. From there they proceeded to a hawker centre at Pasir Panjang for more food and drinks. At all times the respondent was driving.
After leaving the hawker centre, the respondent gave Teo and Loi a lift to Tanglin Halt. He then drove back with Quah and Chiang to Holland Drive where they lived. It may be noted that Quah and Chiang lived in a block next to the respondent`s block. The respondent dropped them off at the roadside near their block and drove off. He claimed that he returned home sometime before 3am. However, none of his four witnesses were able to testify to this because none of them could confirm the time when they had parted from the respondent and no one was prepared to confirm that the respondent had actually gone home immediately after leaving them. Quah and Chiang, who were the last to see the respondent, conceded that they might well have left him before 2.30am, perhaps even at 2am. Both also testified that NUS was not far from Holland Drive and that taking into account traffic conditions at 2am, it would take five to ten minutes to drive there.
Having heard the evidence, the magistrate pronounced herself satisfied with Tee`s identification of the respondent as the trespasser in her room. She held that the evidence of his four friends added nothing to the respondent`s defence, since none of them could be certain what time it was that they had parted ways with him. However, she was also of the view that the prosecution had failed to prove an intent to annoy on the respondent`s part and for that reason she acquitted the respondent.
The prosecution appealed against the acquittal. Having examined the evidence and having had regard to the submissions of the deputy public prosecutor and of counsel for the respondent, I came to the view that the appeal must be allowed.
Section 447 of the Penal Code reads as follows: 
 
Whoever commits criminal trespass shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 3 months, or with fine which may extend to $500, or with both.
 
 
 
Criminal trespass is defined in s 441 as follows: 
 
Whoever enters into or upon property in the possession of another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence, is said to commit `criminal trespass`.
 
 
 
In 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
, I held that the requisite intent to annoy under s 441 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) must usually be inferred from the surrounding circumstances of the alleged offence and need not be the accused`s primary or proximate intent. I would reiterate that now, because it would seem that there continues to be a tendency in some quarters to insist dogmatically that even though there exist circumstances from which the requisite intent can be satisfactorily inferred, nevertheless the prosecution must adduce yet more evidence to prove such intent.
Proving criminal intent can never be an easy thing, since people who harbour criminal intentions are hardly likely to publicize these intentions. The court will not lightly attribute criminal intent to an accused person, but when such intent may clearly be inferred from the surrounding circumstances of the alleged offence, there is no reason why the prosecution should be required to produce further evidence. Take, for example, an accused who was banned from a club by its management and who persisted in entering the club in knowing violation of the ban. The circumstances of his entry are such that one can infer an intent to annoy the management who banned him. It is difficult to imagine what further evidence the prosecution might be called on to produce in such a situation.
In the present case, the respondent was found in Tee`s hostel room at what one might call the rather unsociable hour of 2.45am. He did not know who the room belonged to. On his own admission, he did not know Tee, nor did he know anyone named `Michele`. When he found himself being led to meet Tee`s friends, he bolted without any explanation or apology to her. I am of the opinion that these circumstances constituted ample evidence from which a court could clearly infer under s 441 that he entered Tee`s room with intent to annoy her.
Counsel for the respondent submitted that Tee did not seem to have been intimidated by the respondent`s presence in her room and that she acted calmly throughout. I do not see how this might be relevant. Tee may well have acted with commendable presence of mind but there is no reason why the respondent should benefit from her fortitude of character. The prosecution`s task is to prove that the respondent entered with intent to annoy, not that the complainant was actually annoyed: see 
 Ong Eng Guan v PP 
.
Counsel further submitted that the NUS hostel was a public place, that anyone could have come and gone, and that activities were still ongoing in the hostel even at 2.45am. I would point out that the evidence shows that `no trespassing` signs were posted at the entry points to the hostel and that these signs were 1ft by 2ft large. In any case, I do not think it is at all usual for members of the public to take it into their heads to visit a university hostel at 2.45am and to further wander into a room belonging to someone they do not know and then to stand idly by the window.
It was also suggested that it was `highly probable` that the respondent was a lost visitor looking for directions. Apart from the fact that there was no sense in his straying into an empty room where there was no one from whom he could seek directions, I need only say that if this had been the genuine explanation for the respondent`s presence, then it should have been proffered for whatever it was worth in the court below.
Counsel also cited to me several cases such as 
 Ong Eng Guan 
, and 
 Tan Ah Chee & Anor v PP 
. In fact, these cases go to illustrate how a court goes about inferring intent to annoy from the circumstances of an alleged trespass; but while each decision is justifiable on its own particular facts, none of them proved of any real help to the respondent`s case. In 
 Tan Ah Chee 
, for example, where the appellants had been found sleeping on a ship, all that the evidence revealed was that they had been employed to carry goods onto the ship and that upon completing this job, they had fallen asleep on board whilst waiting for their sampan to pick them up. It will be obvious that these circumstances were not enough evidence from which one could clearly infer an intent to cause annoyance to the shipowners. It will be equally obvious that the case is quite different from the present.
I found therefore that the circumstances of the present case were such as to give rise to an inference of an entry with intent to annoy on the respondent`s part and that the respondent failed to adduce any evidence to induce a doubt in the mind of the court. Accordingly the respondent was guilty of criminal trespass having entered the complainant`s room with intent to annoy. I allowed the public prosecutor`s appeal, convicted the respondent and, having been informed then that he had been convicted only a few months earlier of a similar offence, sentenced him to the maximum punishment under s 447 of three months` imprisonment and a fine of $500 or in default to another one month`s imprisonment.

The respondent was charged with an offence in November 1991. His trial upon this charge was fixed before the district court on 28 April 1993. On that date the prosecution was unable to proceed with the case and sought an adjournment. The reason given was that the prosecution had confused the hearing date for this case with that of another, and by the time this had been realized it was already too late to prepare for the hearing as the necessary witnesses had not been subpoenaed. The district judge granted the respondent a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. I allowed the prosecution`s appeal against this decision, set aside the district judge`s order, and ordered the charge to be reinstated, and I now give my reasons for doing so.
It was accepted that the district judge had acted under s 184 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which provides as follows:
 
 
(1) At any stage of any summary trial before judgment has been delivered, the Public Prosecutor may, if he thinks fit, inform the court that he will not further prosecute the defendant upon the charge and thereupon all proceedings on the charge against the defendant shall be stayed and he shall be discharged from and of the same. 
 
(2) Such discharge shall not amount to an acquittal unless the court so directs except in cases coming under section 177.
  
 
 
It is quite clear that the staying of proceedings and the discharging of the defendant under this section are contingent upon the public prosecutor informing the court that he will not further prosecute the defendant upon the charge. In other words, the court has no jurisdiction to stay proceedings and discharge the defendant under this section in the absence of such information.
In the present case, not only was such information absent but quite the contrary: the court was informed that the prosecution had every intention of prosecuting the respondent upon the charge, only not on that date. Therefore the district court had no jurisdiction to stay the proceedings or to grant a discharge not amounting to an acquittal.
Counsel for the respondent contended that the reason given by the prosecution for being unable to proceed on 28 April 1993 was not a valid reason for an adjournment. He further argued that, if the prosecution had succeeded in obtaining the adjournment which had been sought that day, the respondent through no fault on his part might have been prejudiced by the new trial dates, which might even have necessitated his instructing fresh counsel at short notice if his counsel had been unable to accommodate those new dates. While the point of these arguments cannot be denied, they cannot possibly answer a lack of jurisdiction on the part of the district court to grant the order appealed against.
It was further suggested, and other defendants who have been faced with similar situations might have suggested the same with some bitterness, that if the inability to proceed had been on the part of the respondent or his counsel, no adjournment would have been granted; it would not have been granted if the reason given were the same as that which had been tendered in this case by the prosecution on 28 April 1993.
To this, the same response may be made: it is no answer to lack of jurisdiction. Moreover this argument is misconceived from inception. It ignores the fact that art 35 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and s 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code confer on the Attorney General, who is also the Public Prosecutor, a status which is denied to all other parties appearing before a court. He is specifically given power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence; and in him is vested the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under the Code. In the performance of his duties, he has the right of audience in, and takes precedence over any other person appearing before, any court or tribunal in Singapore. Thus it is unsound to contend generally that, ceteris paribus, an argument which avails the public prosecutor in any case ought also to avail the defence in the same case - it is unsound simply because all other things are not in fact equal.
For these reasons I allowed the appeal, set aside the district judge`s order and reinstated the charge.

 The plaintiff`s pleaded case 
 
 
 
The plaintiff in this action claims damages for personal injuries suffered by him. He alleged breach of statutory duty and negligence against his employers, the defendants.
The plaintiff was a qualified diver. His pleaded case was that while he was not on a diving assignment he worked in the defendants` workshop store maintaining diving equipment and performing such other duties that the company allocated to him. The original pleading contained these allegations: On the day of the accident he was instructed by the defendants` supervisor, servant or agent to move a large steel cabinet, 8 ft by 10 ft in size, from the workshop to the area outside with three co-workers. There was no supervision as to how to move the cabinet. The only equipment which was available to the plaintiff and his co-workers to move the cabinet were two small wooden trolleys. The plaintiff and his co-workers managed to place the cabinet onto the two small trolleys in a vertical position and then, with each of them holding on to one corner of the said cabinet, proceeded to wheel the cabinet from the workshop to the area outside as instructed. The ground outside the workshop was uneven. In the course of wheeling the cabinet, a wheel of one of the two trolleys entered a hole rendering further movement of the cabinet impossible. The plaintiff released his hold on the cabinet to check what was restricting its movement. He stopped to look and saw the wheel caught in a hole. The weight of the cabinet was too much for the three co-workers. So the cabinet toppled and fell on to the plaintiff. In consequence he suffered injury.
The legal basis of the claim was that the injury was occasioned by reason of the breach on the part of the defendants of their statutory duty in that the floor of the premises was not properly maintained as required by s 33(1) of the Factories Act (Cap 104).
The plaintiff also based his claim on negligence and/or breach of duty on the part of the defendants, their servants or agents. Particulars of negligence and/or breach of duty alleged were:
Failing to take any or any adequate precautions for the safety of the plaintiff while he was engaged upon the work.
Exposing the plaintiff to a risk of damage or injury of which they knew or ought to have known.
Requiring the plaintiff to move a weighty cabinet, without providing adequate lifting equipment such as a crane or a forklift.
Suffering the plaintiff and his co-workers to move the said cabinet without providing adequate supervision of how to move the said load.
The defendants failed to provide and maintain a safe system of work in the said premises.
The principal injury alleged was a wedge-shaped compression fracture on the twelfth thoracic vertebra. The plaintiff said that the fracture he sustained predisposed him to increased risk of dysbaric osteonecrosis as well as decompression sickness of the spine. In consequence he was disabled from continuing his occupation as a diver.
 Application to amend the statement of claim
At the trial an application was made to amend the statement of claim by changing the allegation that `The plaintiff released his hold on the said cabinet` to `One of the other workers, namely, See Ah Bah released his hold on the said cabinet`.
The defendants objected to the amendment on the ground that it introduced for the first time a fresh cause of action. The facts, it was said, were changed substantially. I rejected the objection and allowed the amendment with liberty to amend the defence. The material part of the court`s power to allow the plaintiff`s application is contained in O 20 r 5 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970. It reads as follows: 
 
 
(5) (1) Subject to Order 15, Rules 6, 7 and 8, and this Rule, the Court may at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amend his writ, or any party to amend his pleading, on such terms as to costs or otherwise as may be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct. 
 
(2) Where an application to the Court for leave to make the amendment mentioned in paragraph (3), (4) or (5) is made after any relevant period of limitation current at the date of issue of the writ has expired, the Court may nevertheless grant such leave in the circumstances mentioned in that paragraph if it thinks it just to do so. 
 
(5) An amendment may be allowed under paragraph (2) notwithstanding that the effect of the amendment will be to add or substitute a new cause of action if the new cause of action arises out of the same facts or substantially the same facts as a cause of action in respect of which relief has already been claimed in the action by the party applying for leave to make the amendment.
  
 
 
The change which the plaintiff sought to effect was negligence by a co-worker. But it was not a substantial change. It played a small part in a broader factual matrix. The facts remained substantially the same. And it was just to allow the amendment because the defendants had had sufficient opportunity to investigate the accident and had they done so they would have known how it had occurred. No real prejudice arose by reason of the amendment.
 Claim based on Factories Act
The material part of s 33 of the Factories Act on which the plaintiff relied reads as follows :
 
 
(1) All places of work, floors, steps, stairs, passages, gangways and means of access shall - 
 
(a) be of sound construction and properly maintained.
  
 
 
This provision is applicable only if the place where the accident occurred is a factory as defined by the Factories Act. What is the same thing, the place of work or floor must be within the statutory meaning of these expressions.
The general definition of `factory` appears in s 6(1) of the Act. According to this `factory` means : 
 
any premises in which, or within the close or curtilage or precincts of which, persons are employed in manual labour in any process for or incidental to any of the following purposes:
 
 
 
the making of any article or of part of any article;
the altering, repairing, ornamenting, finishing, cleaning, or washing, or the breaking up or demolition of any article; or
the adapting for sale of any article, 
 
being premises in which, or within the close or curtilage or precincts of which, the work is carried on by way of trade or for purposes of gain and to or over which the employer of the persons employed therein has the right of access or control.
 
 
 
Subsection (2) provides that whether or not premises are factories by reason of the general definition, a number of specified instances is included in the term `factories`. The specified instance we are concerned with is s 6(2)(j) : 
 
any premises in which mechanical power is used in connection with the making or repair of any article incidentally to any business carried on by way of trade or for purposes of gain.
 
 
 
The essence of the definition provisions is that the work or manual labour must be in connection with the activity specified (making, repairing etc of an article) and it must be carried on by way of trade or business of the occupier of the premises. So repairing an article does not render the premises a factory unless repairing an article is the business of the occupier as stated in s 6(1) or is incidental to the business carried on by way of trade or purposes of gain stated in s 6(2)(j). The activity contemplated by s 6(1) is repairing articles belonging to others such as repair of motor vehicles or ships. On the other hand, the repairing activity contemplated by s 6(2)(j) is making or repairing an article for their own purpose but in connection with the business of the occupiers of the premises such as a road or water transport business of a company which repairs its own vehicles or boats.
In the present case, the business of the defendants was not making or repairing any article by way of trade or for gain. Their business was that of providing a service - that is diving services in connection with prospecting and mining for petroleum. Making or repairing articles for others not being their business, the defendants are not within the general definition contained in s 6(1). The fabrication and repair of diving equipment was, however, incidental to their business of providing diving services and it was for gain. Accordingly the premises constituted a factory under s 6(2)(j). The mechanical power used was that of the cutting machine used in the premises in connection with the work carried on. Further, the fact that there were mechanics working in the premises indicates that mechanical power was used.
This conclusion that the premises constituted a factory does not mean that every part of the premises was part of the factory as defined. The plaintiff must go further and show that the accident happened in a place of work or floor which was part of and in the factory as conceived by the Act.
In my judgment, the words `places of work` in the context of the Factories Act means places where the work as defined by the Act is carried on. In this case the work contemplated is the making or repairing of the diving equipment incidental to the business of providing diving service. The shed which was a guard room, the yard outside the workshop and the administration office therefore were not places of work because they were not, on the facts of the case, used for making or repairing diving equipment.
By the same reasoning `floors, steps, stairs, garages, gangways and means of access` would be confined to where the repairing activity is carried on. A construction which would constitute the shed and area outside the workshop as part of the factory irrespective of the purpose they were used for would defeat the legislative purpose. It is inconceivable that the legislature intended to include the garbage disposal and garden areas within the concept of `places of work or floor` merely because they are within the factory premises. This construction is made clear by s 6(6) of the Act which reads as follows: 
 
Where a place situated within the close, curtilage or precincts forming a factory is solely used for some purpose other than the processes carried on in the factory, that place shall not be deemed to form part of the factory for the purposes of this Act, but shall, if otherwise it would be a factory, be deemed to be a separate factory.
 
 
 
Courts in the United Kingdom, applying a commonsense approach in construing the term `floor` as it appears in their Factories Act, have come to the same conclusion as I have. In 
 Thornton v Fisher & Ludlow, Ltd 
, a cleaner employed by the defendants, occupiers of factory premises, was on her way to work in the premises. She was walking on a roadway, 30 ft wide. She was not on the pavement, because the pavement was usually obstructed. She tripped over a coil of wire, one end of which had been forced into the tarmac of the roadway. She fell and was injured. The cleaner sued the occupiers of the premises (her employers) for breach of statutory duty under s 28 of the Factories Act 1961 which provided as follows : 
 
All floors, steps, stairs, passages and gangways shall be of sound construction and properly maintained and shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, be kept free from any obstruction and from any substance likely to cause persons to slip.
 
 
 
Although the plaintiff succeeded on her claim based on common law she failed in her claim for statutory breach of duty because the ordinary meaning of the word `floors, passages or gangway` did not include the roadway.
In 
 Sullivan v Hall Russell & Co Ltd 
,2 the claimant sought damages from the defendants in respect of injuries sustained by him in an accident. He alleged that he was employed by the defendants as a plumber`s mate and was assisting three other employees of the defendants to move a length of piping from their woodyard to the plumber`s shop. The woodyard was an open air yard with an earth surface and there was, on one side of it, a compartment where pipes of many sizes were stacked. The method of removing the said length of piping was that short lengths of piping were placed beneath it to act as rollers by two of the squad of four workmen, while the other two workmen pulled on the length of piping. The claimant was one of the two latter workmen. The cause of the accident, as alleged by him, was that, as he was walking backwards and pulling at this length of piping, he fell over a piece of loose piping lying in the yard behind him. The defendants admitted most of the claimant`s allegation but said that the earth surface was hard and that some short grass grew at the edges of the yard. The legal basis of the claimant`s case was that the accident was caused by a breach of s 25 of the Factories Act 1937, as amended by s 4 of the Factories Act 1959. That section, as amended, provided that `all floors, steps, stairs, passages and gangways shall be of sound construction and properly maintained and shall, so far as is reasonably practicable, be kept free from any obstruction and from any substance likely to cause persons to slip`. The claimant`s case was that the length of piping over which he fell was an obstruction and that the defendants did not keep the floor of the yard free from such obstructions, although it was reasonably practicable to do so. It was held that the unmade earthen surface of the open-air woodyard was not a floor and accordingly the action was dismissed.
Lord Kissen in his judgment said, at p 193: 
 
It is clear that the question of the application of the statutory provisions in s 25 of the Factories Act 1937, as amended by s 4 of the Factories Act 1959 to the present case, can be decided on the pleadings. The crucial question is whether the unmade earthen surface of the open air yard can be a `floor` for the purpose of the said statutory provisions. There is no definition of floor in the Acts but the meaning of the word, as used in the said Acts, has been considered in several English cases. None of these cases, except one, is directly in point but there are useful observations and criteria in the opinions in the other cases. Some assistance can also be obtained from the relevant provisions of the said Factories Acts which detail the duties to be observed in regard to floors.
 
 
 
I think that the normal and ordinary meaning of a floor is the lower surface of an enclosed space, such as a room or similar place. It can, in ordinary usage of language, also be used to describe certain surfaces on which people walk or stand or on which objects are placed and which are designed or constructed or adapted for people to walk or stand on or to have objects placed thereon. Before there can be a `floor`, which is not in an enclosed space, I think that its surface must be constructed or adapted for people to walk or stand on or to hold objects. A natural cave may have a floor, although no work of construction or adaptation has been done to its lower surface. A floor can be constructed in the open air, but it will depend on the whole circumstances whether floor is an apt word to describe a constructed surface in the open air. I do not think that, in its ordinary meaning, the unmade earthen surface of an open yard can be a floor. It is not in an enclosed space within walls and is not specially constructed for any purpose. It was argued for the pursuer, however, that the Factories Act made it clear that all such surfaces inside a factory were floors for the purpose of the said Acts. Reliance was placed on s 151(7) of the Act of 1937 which provides that premises shall not be excluded from the definition of a factory by reason only that they are open air premises. There is no dispute that the whole premises of which the woodyard formed part was a factory. I do not think, however, that this subsection assists the pursuer. It seems to me that more assistance, in ascertaining the meaning of floor for the purposes of the Acts, is to be obtained from s 25 of the Act of 1937. The other words used in conjunction with `floors` in s 25(1) of the Act of 1937 all refer to something made or constructed or designed for a particular use. The duties imposed by the first part of s 25(1), that is, that the floors and other places mentioned there are to be `of sound construction and properly maintained`, are only apt if the floors and other places mentioned are constructed or, in some way, specially adapted for a specific purpose. `Sound construction` is an unusual phrase to apply to an earthen surface on which no work had been done to adapt it for a particular use.
`Properly maintained` is an equally incongruous phrase, especially as `maintained` is defined in s 152 of the 1937 Act as meaning `maintained in an efficient state, in efficient working order, and in good repair`. On that reasoning I do not think that the unmade earthen surface of the woodyard which, on the pleadings, had nothing done to it to adapt it for any specific use, can be said to be a `floor` for the purpose of the Acts. If it were a floor, any field or waste ground, which was inside a factory, would be a floor for the purpose of the Factories Act.
I therefore conclude that the place where the accident occurred in the present case was not a place of work or floor because no evidence was adduced to show that it was used for making or repairing an article incidental to the business carried on by the defendants.
 Claim based on negligence
I now turn to the claim based on common law. The obligation an employer owes his employee was stated by Lord Wright in 
 Wilsons & Clyde Coal Co v English 
 to be threefold - that is the provision of a competent staff of men, adequate material, and a proper system and effective supervision. Furthermore, the law has always been that the master shall take due care not to expose his servant to unreasonable risks and this applies to every facet of the obligation.
Before 1948 in England, and 1954 in Singapore, there was a common law doctrine known as common employment. It was that an employer was not liable to his employee for the negligence of another employee if they both were engaged in the performance of the same work and exposed to the same risk of negligence. That common law rule no longer obtains in both territories. See the Law Reform (Personal Injuries) Act 1948 (UK) and s 5 Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Singapore). The present rule is that the employer is liable for the negligence of a servant so long as it is committed by that servant in the course of his employment.
As regards the accident in the present case, I make the following findings of fact. The plaintiff was asked to demolish a shed situate on the left of the premises as one enters the premises from the main road and before one enters the workshop. It was built as a guardroom. Between the workshop and the shed there was a passage. According to the plaintiff there was a steel cabinet weighing some 500kg placed in the shed parallel to the wall which formed the passage between the shed and the workshop. According to another witness called by the plaintiff the cabinet was outside the shed and in the passage. A witness called by the defendants said that the cabinet was outside the shed but behind the shed. I reject this evidence and find that the cabinet was alongside the wall as described by the plaintiff or his witness, probably in the passage. It does not matter whose version is correct. The plaintiff decided to shift the cabinet towards the main entrance to the premises. If the cabinet had been behind the shed it would have been practically impossible to shift it towards the entrance of the premises. Further, if the cabinet was to be demolished, there would be practicable difficulties in demolishing it in the shed or in the passage. Accordingly, it was reasonable and necessary to so shift the cabinet as there was no clear instruction as to what should be done with it.
The plaintiff used two trolleys to place the cabinet on and secured the assistance of three fellow workers. As the cabinet was being pushed, one of the back wheels at the rear got stuck in a hole in the ground and upset the balance. One or more of the other workers withdrew support to the cabinet leading to its collapse on to the plaintiff. My conclusion is that the withdrawal of support without regard to the safety of the plaintiff was a negligent act which caused injury to the plaintiff. I hold the defendants solely liable to the plaintiff.
The statement of claim alleged the steel cabinet was moved from the workshop to outside the workshop. The evidence on the location of the steel cabinet before the accident was that it was outside the workshop and next to a wall of the shed. This departure from the pleading by three witnesses was not observed, objected to or commented upon during the trial. But in his submission counsel for the defendants relied on 
 Waghorn v George Wimpey & Co Ltd 
, and submitted that where the court finds that the place of the accident is different from that as pleaded by the plaintiff and his evidence, the claim will be dismissed. I found no substance in the submission because there was no discrepancy in the place of the accident. The evidence of all the witnesses of fact was that the accident happened outside the workshop and in front of the place where the shed had stood before its demolition. That there was a hole in the place of the accident was an undisputed fact. Thus the discrepancy was in relation to the spot where the cabinet had been located before the accident and not the place where it occurred. Neither the plaintiff`s pleading nor his own evidence was at variance with the place where I have found the accident happened. The facts therefore do not fit the principle stated by counsel. Nonetheless, I shall now discuss the principle.
The plaintiff in the 
 Waghorn 
 case4 was employed by the defendants, George Wimpey & Co Ltd, who were sub-contractors on an oil refinery owned by British Petroleum Ltd. The defendants were engaged in installing and maintaining the pipework on an oil refinery site where there were oil tanks grouped in blocks of four. Each group was surrounded by a primitive earthwork bank called a `bund-wall`. These were some four and a half feet high with sides sloping at angles of around 30 degrees. The defendants had supplied mobile caravans for the use and convenience of their workmen. One of these caravans was situated 20 or 25 ft distant from one of the bund-walls just off a metalled or semi-metalled road. The plaintiff alleged in his pleadings that he slipped and fell to the ground whilst crossing the bund-wall and thereby sustained personal injury. All the particulars of negligence related to the bund-wall consisting of sloping earth.
At the trial he called evidence to show that the alleged negligence caused the accident while he was crossing over the bund-wall and the slope which he alleged was slippery. The judge, however, found that the accident happened some distance away by the side of the caravan and nowhere near the bund-wall. The judge dismissed the claim on the ground that at the trial there had been a radical departure from the pleadings. The test that was applied was what had been formulated by Lord Justice Clerk Thomson in 
 Burns v Dixon`s Iron Works Ltd 
, at pp 107-4 and approved by the House of Lords in 
 John G Stein & Co Ltd v O`Hanlon 
, at p 909: 
 
The court is often charitable to records and is slow to overturn verdicts on technical grounds. But when a pursuer fails completely to substantiate the only grounds of fault averred, and seeks to justify his verdict on a ground which is not just a variation, modification or development of what is averred but is something which is new, separate and distinct, we are not in the realm of technicality.
 
 
 
Geoffrey Lane J in the 
 Waghorn 
 case4 appreciated the difference between radical departure and matters of technicality for he said at p 479 that `if matters emerge, particularly matters of technicality, which perhaps could not be foreseen by those responsible for pleading cases, if those things emerge during a case it would be quite wrong to dismiss a plaintiff`s claim because his pleadings have not measured up to the technical facts which have emerged. One often listens sympathetically to applications to amend in those circumstances.`
In this connection it would be beneficial to note the statement of Lord Normand in 
 The Geo W McKnight 
:7 
 
The court is not bound by the pleadings of parties and must proceed upon the evidence which it deems to be most accurate and trustworthy.
 
 
 
The court must of course be careful to apply this statement only when it is legitimate to do so. In my judgment, having regard to the fact that there was no departure from the pleading as regards the place of accident, the discrepancy in relation to the location of the cabinet is not a radical departure from the pleadings so as to disentitle the plaintiff to succeed.
 The disability
The next question for determination is whether the plaintiff was as a result of the accident disabled from continuing to be a commercial diver. This issue must be determined by expert medical evidence. First the medical facts. X-ray pictures showed that the plaintiff had suffered a wedge compression fracture of the T12 vertebra with a little more than 50% of loss of the anterior height of the vertebra with no neurological deficit. Dr VK Pillay submitted a specialist medical report and oral evidence. In his report he said: 
 
I note that this patient works as a diver. I am of the opinion that he should not go back to diving. Dr Lim Hong Liang had expressed an opinion that this fracture would predispose him to dysbaric osteonecrosis as well as decompression sickness of the spine and I would agree with his opinion. The patient is only capable of doing light work at ground level. There is a possibility that his backache will get worse over the years and that he could need a spinal fusion in the future.
 
 
 
He reiterated his conclusion in his oral evidence. Dr Robert G Don who had given a medical report on the plaintiff at the behest of the defendants said this `patient is not fit to continue to work as a diver because this will aggravate his chronic low backache. He may however continue any other form of work that does not require undue bending or lifting of heavy objects`. Dr Pillay further said that there was a high risk of the plaintiff being paralysed if he dived and that the injury he suffered was permanent and there was no way of reversing it. I am moved by all this evidence to conclude that the plaintiff in consequence of the accident was disabled from continuing as a commercial diver.
I make no findings on the matters relating to quantum of damages. All quantum relating to damages shall be referred to the registrar for determination at the hearing of assessment of damages.
The plaintiff is to have 70% of costs of the action up to trial. Costs of assessment of damages to be decided by the registrar assessing damages.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal from the decision of Lim Teong Qwee JC in which he allowed the claim by the respondents for arrears of instalments of hire and interest under a hire purchase agreement dated 25 February 1985 made between them and the appellant relating to the hire of a motor vehicle, a Mercedes Benz 450 SLC. Also in that decision, the learned judicial commissioner disallowed a claim by the respondents for $7,234 being road tax for the vehicle which they had paid for the period from 30 March 1988 to 15 December 1988 while the vehicle was in their possession. There was no respondent`s notice filed against this part of his decision.
The material facts that led to this appeal are not seriously in dispute and are as follows. One Lee Tian Meng (`Lee`) offered to sell to the appellant a Mercedes Benz 280 SE for the sum of $90,000. The offer was accepted and the appellant paid to Lee a total sum amounting to $40,000 in three instalments. However, Lee did not deliver the Mercedes Benz 280 SE to the appellant as agreed and instead offered to the appellant another car, a Mercedes Benz 450 SLC, for the sum of $95,000 in place of the Mercedes Benz 280 SE. The appellant agreed to take the Mercedes Benz 450 SLC at that price, but as he did not have the means to pay the balance of $55,000, both he and Lee approached the respondents seeking finance for this amount. In consequence, the respondents agreed to purchase the vehicle from Lee and to let it to the appellant on hire purchase terms. On or about 25 February 1985, Lee made out an invoice to the respondents in respect of the sale of the vehicle to them and on the same day, the appellant signed a hire purchase agreement (`the agreement`) with the respondents whereby he acknowledged that he had requested the respondents to purchase the Mercedes Benz 450 SLC (`the vehicle`) and let it to him on hire on terms and conditions contained in the agreement. Under the agreement, the hiring commenced on 25 February 1985 and the appellant agreed to pay the hire instalments at the rate of $2,795.83 per month commencing from 25 March 1985 for 24 months and upon full payment of all the hire instalments and due compliance with all the terms and conditions of the agreement, he would be entitled to exercise the option to become the owner of the vehicle.
After the agreement was signed, Lee was permitted to attend to the registration of the transfer of the vehicle to the appellant with the Registry of Vehicles (`ROV`). There was a dispute as to the circumstances in which Lee was so permitted to attend to the registration. According to the respondents, one Heng Jee Pang (`Heng`), the managing director of the respondents, told the appellant and Lee that the respondents themselves would effect registration of the transfer of the car with the ROV. Lee then told Heng that he needed the money urgently and offered to attend to the registration personally, but Heng did not agree. At that point, the appellant also offered to go with Lee to the ROV to effect the registration. Heng agreed to that and the appellant and Lee left the respondents` office ostensibly for the ROV. They returned later with the log book on which the registration of the transfer of the vehicle to the appellant was shown to have been effected. The respondents then paid the sum of $55,000 to Lee and the appellant took possession of the vehicle. However, the appellant`s version of the events was markedly different. He said that he was attended to at the respondents` office not by Heng but by one Tay, another employee of the respondents. It was Tay who agreed to provide finance for the sum of $55,000 and who told him that it would take at least one week to effect registration of the transfer as it was the Chinese New Year period at that time. The appellant stated that he told Tay that he needed the car urgently, and that Lee offered to attend to the registration so as to facilitate the hand over of the vehicle. Tay refused but finally gave in after some persuasion by Lee. The appellant denied that he accompanied Lee to the ROV. However, nothing turns on the question as to which of the two versions was to be accepted. The court below made no finding of fact on this point.
On 23 March 1985, two days before the first instalment of hire was due under the agreement, the Registrar of Vehicles (`the registrar`) seized the vehicle for failure to pay (i) the additional registration fee of $41,811, (ii) the registration fee of $1,000 and (iii) the arrears of road tax for the period from January to June 1985 amounting to $2,938. It transpired that Lee, prior to the date on which he was supposed to have effected registration of the transfer, had given to the ROV a cheque for the total amount which was subsequently dishonoured. In addition, it was discovered that the registration of the transfer to the appellant appearing in the log book which was supposedly to have been effected at the ROV was forged by Lee. Lee was subsequently charged with, and convicted of, cheating on 22 September 1986.
In the meanwhile, on 10 July 1985, the respondents, not having received from the appellant any instalments of hire under the agreement, took out a writ against him claiming all the arrears of instalments of hire that had fallen due and further arrears as would be falling due plus interest. The claim was resisted, and the defence filed at that time was that the respondents were not the owners of the vehicle as it was never registered under s 10(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) (`the Act`) and it was impounded by the registrar. Accordingly, it was averred that the respondents had no rights over the vehicle and the agreement was void. After the defence was filed, for about two years, no further step was taken by either party in the proceedings.
Not surprisingly, the action was overtaken by events. The vehicle remained with the ROV until 30 April 1987 when a disposal inquiry was held and the vehicle was ordered to be released to the appellant, and it was so released to him. However, subsequently, the vehicle was again seized by the registrar for non-payment of registration fees and road tax. Finally, on 15 September 1987, the appellant paid to the ROV the registration fees and road tax totalling $44,280 and the vehicle was released to the appellant. He was eventually registered with the ROV as the owner of the vehicle.
In March 1988, however, the respondents invoked their rights under the agreement and repossessed the vehicle for failure to pay the instalments of hire, and soon thereafter the necessary notice was taken out for continuation of the proceedings. The appellant made an application to court for release of the vehicle, and on 10 November 1988 an order was made for the release on the appellant furnishing a banker`s guarantee for the amount of $70,000. The vehicle was released to the appellant on 15 December 1988. However, the respondents, in the meanwhile, had paid road tax in respect of the vehicle amounting to $7,234 for the period in which the car was in their possession.
Before the action came on for trial, the parties amended their pleadings. The respondents included a claim of $7,234 which they had paid to the ROV as road tax for the period when they had possession of the car. The appellant amended substantially his defence and raised several defences. However, when the action came on for trial, only two defences were pursued and they were as follows: 
 
 
(a) that he was entitled to set off a sum of $44,280 paid to the registrar for registration fees and road tax, and 
 
(b) that the only amount due to the respondents was $10,720 being the difference between the sum of $55,000 due under the agreement and $44,280 paid to the registrar.
  
 
 
In effect, there was only one defence and that was the right of set-off against part of the claim. The respondents filed a reply which was subsequently amended. By para 16 of the amended reply, the respondents raised the following obligations of the appellant under the agreement. It was averred that: 
 
 
(a) under cl 4(n) of the agreement, it was the appellant`s obligation to take delivery of the vehicle and there was an implied warranty that it was the appellant`s duty to effect registration of the transfer of the vehicle so that he could lawfully use the vehicle, and 
 
(b) under cl 4(m) of the agreement, the appellant undertook to comply with all proper obligations relating to the vehicle or its possession or use and not to do or suffer to be done anything with regard to the vehicle which would in any way prejudice the respondents` rights.
  
 
 
The respondents further averred that the appellant, in breach of these obligations, failed to ensure that the vehicle had been duly registered and transferred to him.
The action was heard before Lim Teong Qwee JC. He held that there was an implied warranty that during the currency of the agreement the appellant was entitled to quiet possession of the vehicle and that this warranty would be broken if the appellant`s enjoyment of the possession was interfered with either by the owner himself or by any lawful act of a third party. He then considered the question whether the registrar was entitled to seize the vehicle on 23 March 1985, and having examined ss 11 and 30 of the Act he came to the conclusion that the registrar was not entitled to seize the vehicle on 23 March 1985 under s 30(1). He therefore held that the seizure was `not a lawful act and the seizure was accordingly not a breach of the implied warranty of quiet possession`; and as there was no breach of the implied warranty, the appellant was not entitled to set off the amount paid to the registrar. The learned judicial commissioner further held that apart from the argument on the breach of warranty of quiet possession, nothing more was pleaded to show that the appellant was entitled to set off the amount claimed. He found that there was no reasonable grounds for the defence and the appellant was not entitled to set off the amount as averred by him. In the result, he gave judgment to the respondents for the arrears of instalments of hire with interests at the rate stipulated in the agreement. However, as the vehicle was repossessed by the respondents and was in their possession for the period from 30 March 1988 to 15 December 1988, he excluded this period in the computation of interest. Finally, on the claim by the respondents for $7,234 being the road tax for the period when the vehicle was in their possession, the learned judicial commissioner was of the view that the agreement was suspended during this period, and held that it was not open to the respondents to rely on the terms of the agreement and that the respondents were therefore not entitled to recover this sum from the appellant.
Before us, it was argued by counsel for the appellant that the learned judicial commissioner was in error in holding that the registrar has no power to seize the vehicle. Counsel relied on s 95 of the Act which, so far as material, provides as follows: 
 
When any person is found ... to be using a vehicle in contravention of any provision of this Act ... the Registrar or any officer authorised in writing in that behalf by the Registrar on production of his authority may, whenever it appears ... that such action is necessary to cause a discontinuance of the offence, take or cause to be taken, ... the vehicle ... to a place of safety there to be kept until released by order of ... the Registrar, ...
 
 
 
This section was not brought to the attention of the learned judicial commissioner. We agree with the submission made on behalf of the appellant that this section gives to the registrar the power to seize the vehicle if it was used in contravention of the Act. The registration and additional registration fees were tax chargeable under s 11(1)(a) of the Act and the rates were prescribed under rr 5 and 6 of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Registration and Licensing) Rules (`Rules`), and the road tax was chargeable under s 11(1)(b) of the Act and was prescribed as a fee payable for a licence under r 33 of the Rules. The use of the vehicle by the appellant at the material time without payment of the outstanding registration fees and road tax was clearly in contravention of the Act. On this point, we need to refer only to ss 15 and 17 which, so far as relevant, provide: 
 
 
(15) Any person who uses or keeps on any road any vehicle for which a licence is not in force, ... shall be guilty of an offence ... 
 
(17) Subject to this section, a person who for any period keeps a vehicle in respect of which tax under this Act has at any time become chargeable shall, ... be liable to pay tax under this Act in respect of the vehicle for that period.
  
 
 
Having regard to these provisions of the Act, we are of the opinion that the seizure of the vehicle by the registrar was not an unlawful act. It is not necessary for us to go further and express any view on the construction of s 30(1) of the Act as determined by the learned judicial commissioner.
We now turn to the main issue in this appeal which is this: on whom lies the obligation to pay the outstanding registration fees and road tax which were payable in respect of the vehicle as at the date on which the agreement was made? This issue may be resolved by considering first the positions of the respective parties at common law and secondly the extent to which such positions have been varied by any provision of the Act and the agreement. It is common ground that the Hire-Purchase Act (Cap 125) does not apply to the transaction made between the parties.
We revert to the basic facts before us. Prior to 25 February 1985, Lee was the owner of the vehicle. At the request of the appellant, the respondents purchased the vehicle from Lee. At the time of purchase, the registration fees and road tax were chargeable in respect of the vehicle and were not paid. The person responsible for paying these outstanding sums was undoubtedly Lee, but he had not paid them and had sold the vehicle to the respondents. Immediately after the purchase, the respondents and the appellant entered into the agreement, and what was made between them was basically an agreement for the hire of the vehicle by the appellant from the respondents at a monthly charge or rent with an option to the appellant to acquire the vehicle on the expiry of the agreement. Until he exercised the option, the appellant was only the hirer of the vehicle. In these circumstances, unless the agreement otherwise provides, he has no responsibility for paying the outstanding registration fees and road tax. What then is the position of the respondents? They had not agreed with Lee to assume the obligation of paying the outstanding sums. Nonetheless they purchased a vehicle burdened with these sums and so long as the sums remained unpaid, they continued to be `chargeable` in respect of the vehicle.
The next question is: what is the nature of these payments? On this, we turn to s 11 of the Act which, in so far as material, provides: 
 
 
(1) Subject to the provisions of this Act and the rules, 
 a tax shall be charged 
 in respect of 
 
(a) the first registration of every vehicle under this Act; and 
 
(b) every vehicle used or kept on any road in Singapore,
  
 
 
and the tax shall be paid upon a licence to be taken out by the person keeping the vehicle.
... 
(5) For the purposes of the tax, in so far as it is 
 chargeable 
 in respect of the use or keeping of a vehicle on a road, a vehicle shall be deemed 
(a) to be 
 chargeable 
 with the like tax as on the occasion of the issue of the vehicle licence or last vehicle licence issued for the vehicle under this Act, and to be so chargeable by reference to the prescribed rate as applicable to the vehicle on that occasion; or 
(b) if no vehicle licence has been issued for the vehicle under this Act, to be 
 chargeable 
 by reference to the prescribed rate applicable to the vehicle. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It is significant that throughout the section, the words used in relation to the levy or imposition of tax on a vehicle are `charged` and `chargeable`. Further, to enforce payment of the tax chargeable under s 11, the Act by s 30(1) empowers the registrar to issue a warrant directing a seizure of the vehicle where tax in respect thereof is unpaid and to recover the tax from the proceeds of sale of the vehicle. It is implicit in that subsection that the registrar has power to sell the vehicle seized. Section 95 empowers, among others, the registrar to take any vehicle used in contravention of the Act and place it in a safe place, and also confers on the registrar the power to sell the vehicle and apply the proceeds from the sale `in payment of any licence fees` which may be due. Having regard to these provisions of the Act, it seems to us that the tax `chargeable` in respect of a vehicle under s 11 of the Act is effectively in the nature of a charge or encumbrance on the vehicle. Until such tax is paid or discharged, it continues to be attached to the vehicle. That being the position, it follows that in this case the respondents having purchased the vehicle without having the `encumbrance` thereon discharged by the previous owner became liable to pay the tax then outstanding and unpaid, and that liability remained with them when they hired out the vehicle to the appellant under the agreement.
There is another reason why, as between the appellant and the respondents, it was the obligation of the latter to pay the outstanding registration fees and road tax. Arising from the agreement, there was an implied warranty that the appellant as the hirer would have quiet possession of the vehicle during the currency of the agreement. This implied warranty was accepted by the respondents: see para 15 of their amended reply. In view of this implied warranty, the respondents were under an obligation to ensure that the outstanding registration fees and road tax were duly paid by Lee (who was the owner at the material time) and in default of payment by him they themselves would have to pay the same.
We next turn to consider the obligations of the parties under the Act. It was argued by counsel for the respondents that the registration fees and road tax chargeable in respect of the vehicle relate to the maintenance and use of the vehicle and the appellant was the person liable to pay them. She relied on s 17 of the Act. We do not think that s 17 supports her argument. Under s 17, the appellant was only liable to pay any tax under the Act in respect of the vehicle for the period in which he kept the vehicle. He did not keep the vehicle until 25 February 1985 or immediately thereafter. Hence, even under the Act, he was under no obligation to pay the outstanding registration fees and road tax payable as at the date of the agreement.
We next turn to consider whether such obligation of the respondents has been varied by the terms of the agreement. As pleaded by the respondents in their amended reply, there are only two provisions thereof on which they relied, namely, cl 4(m) and (n).
We propose to consider the provisions in their inverse order. Clause 4(n) provides as follows: 
 
 
(4) The hirer agrees: 
 
... 
 
(n) that it is the hirer`s obligation to obtain delivery of the goods.
  
 
 
This clause only imposes on the appellant the obligation `to obtain delivery` of the vehicle. But the payment of outstanding registration fees and road tax of the vehicle is not a necessary incidence of obtaining delivery of the vehicle and clearly does not fall within the ambit of this provision. It was, however, pleaded that there was an implied warranty arising from this provision that it was the appellant`s duty to effect registration of the transfer of the vehicle so that he could lawfully use the vehicle. In our opinion, the obligation under this clause does not give rise to such an implied warranty. Even if there is such an implied warranty, it does not extend to assuming an obligation to pay all outstanding registration fees and road tax then payable. At most, it extends to cover expenses, if any, incurred in obtaining delivery of the vehicle. In our opinion, no such warranty as that pleaded by the respondents can be implied from this provision.
Counsel relied on the case of 
 Bentworth Finance Ltd v Lubert & Anor 
 .1 There, by a hire-purchase agreement, the plaintiffs let a second-hand motor car to the first defendant and the second defendant agreed to indemnify the plaintiffs against all loss and damage which they might suffer arising from the agreement. The first defendant obtained the car from dealers who had since disappeared. The car was delivered to the first defendant but was left outside her house and no log book was given to her with the result that she could not use the car. After some months, the plaintiffs repossessed the car. It was held that there was an implied condition of the hire-purchase agreement that the log book should be supplied, that until it was supplied the car could not be used as the first defendant could not get it licensed or pay tax, and that as the log book was not delivered the hire-purchase agreement did not come into operation. We do not find that case of any assistance here. It certainly does not support the contention made on behalf of the respondents. It is one thing to say that under the agreement there was an obligation on the part of the appellant to obtain delivery of the vehicle and also to obtain the log book from Lee, but it is another thing to say that it was the appellant`s obligation in obtaining delivery of the vehicle to pay up all the arrears of registration fees and road tax.
We now turn to cl 4(m) which provides as follows: 
 
 
(4) The hirer agrees: 
 
... 
 
(m) To comply with all proper obligations relating to the goods or their possession or use and not to do or suffer to be done anything with regard to the goods which would in any way prejudice the owner`s rights hereunder and to repay to the owner any moneys it may properly expend to make good any failure by the hirer to comply with any such obligation.
  
 
 
Counsel for the respondents relied heavily on this provision and, in particular, the words `all proper obligations relating to the goods or their possession or use` and contended that by reason of this paragraph, the appellant had become liable to pay the outstanding registration fees and road tax. We disagree. These words, in our opinion, cover payment of any fees or taxes payable for the maintenance and use of the vehicle from the commencement of the hiring. They do not cover the registration fees and road tax accrued and payable prior to the commencement, as before that date the appellant did not have possession and use of the vehicle. This paragraph therefore does not shift to the appellant the obligation to pay the outstanding registration fees and road tax.
Hence, there is nothing in the agreement which imposes on the appellant the obligation to pay the registration fees and road tax for the period prior to 25 February 1985. It is not disputed that the appellant in obtaining the release of the vehicle had paid to the ROV the following: 
 
 
(a) registration fee $42,811 
 
(b) arrears of road tax (23 January 1985 to 31 March 1985) $ 1,469 
 
$44,280
  
 
 
Since the hiring commenced on 25 February 1985, the appellant was liable under cl 4(m) to pay the road tax as from that date and hence a proportionate portion of the road tax of $1,469 would be payable by him and this proportionate amount is $756.10. This amount should be deducted from $44,280 resulting in a net amount of $43,523.90 which is payable by the respondents. As this amount had been paid by the appellant, he is entitled to set off this sum against part of the claim of the respondents. Accordingly, the amount due and payable to the respondents should be computed as follows: 
 
 
Total amount of instalments due under the agreement $67,099.92 
 
Less amount paid by the appellant to ROV and 
 
payable by the respondents $43,523.90 
 
Add the interest payable on overdue instalments under the agreement 
 
(after the above deduction) $ 9,894.20 
 
Net total amount $33,470.22
  
 
 
In the result, the judgment given below is varied, and there will be judgment for the respondents in the sum of $33,470.22. To this extent, the appeal is allowed.
We now come to the question of costs. As regards the costs below, the order made below as to costs should stand, as the respondents had succeeded partially. However, in view of the amount in which the respondents are entitled to judgment, the costs awarded would be on the subordinate courts scales. As for the costs of the appeal, we do not think that the appellant is entitled to any, although he has succeeded in this appeal. The points which we have dealt with here were not raised and argued below. We therefore make no order as to the costs of the appeal. The appellant is entitled to repayment of the deposit in court as security for costs, and we so order.
Before we conclude, we would like to say a word on the cases filed by both parties pursuant to O 57 r 9A. This is another instance where the cases filed on behalf of the parties do not comply with the provisions of that rule. The appellant`s case is wholly inadequate and falls far short of the standard required. It is more like a petition of appeal than a case. The case filed on behalf of the respondents is even more deplorable. It set out six questions or issues but does not set out the case of the respondents. It is completely devoid of any substance. We deprecate the filing of such phantom cases. If counsel or solicitors engaged in an appeal have no idea whatsoever as to the form and content of the case they should file on behalf of their clients, they should consult some precedents and may also seek guidance from the precedents appearing on pp 228 et seq in 5

The appellant, Oh Teh Hwa (`the accused`), was charged with trafficking in 99 packets containing not less than 37.26g of diamorphine in his possession at Apt Blk 633, Veerasamy Road #01-120, Singapore on 31 July 1991. He was tried before the High Court and was found guilty of the charge and was convicted. Against his conviction, this appeal was brought, and at the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
The material facts which were not in dispute were these. Acting on information, a team of narcotics officers led by SNO Krishnan went to Bian Huat Coffeeshop at 365 Serangoon Road to look for a suspected drug trafficker. At the coffeeshop, they saw the accused whose appearance fitted the description given to them, and they arrested him. From his identity card, the officers ascertained that his address was Blk 633, Veerasamy Road, #04-120. They seized from him a bunch of keys and took him to the flat. They gained access to the flat using the keys, and on entering the flat they saw one Madam Yep with her mute son; both she and the accused confirmed that the master bedroom was occupied by the accused. The master bedroom has a toilet attached to it and the toilet door was locked. The officers opened a wardrobe (which had a key to its door) and recovered two keys from the pocket of a Jockey T-shirt in the wardrobe. With one of the keys, they opened that door to the bedroom toilet and, inside the toilet, drugs were recovered from a red plastic pail suspended from the ceiling by raffia, and also from the bathroom cabinet. Under the bed in the master bedroom were found a daching and several empty plastic sachets. The drugs on analysis were found to contain not less than 37.26g of diamorphine.
Madam Yep was the registered lessee of the flat at the time. She acquired the flat in 1984 and she moved in with her mute son only in 1988. Prior to that, her other son, Richard Wong, was staying there. Madam Yep testified that she was in the flat from Monday to Friday to cook for her mute son and on weekends she would be at her daughter-in-law`s place. The master bedroom was first rented to a female Chinese called Mimi at $300 per month and Mimi brought along the accused who moved in with her. Mimi paid the rent until 1988 when she left, and after that, the accused continued to occupy the flat and pay the rent. He would be at the flat at least three to four days a week. She also testified that there were two visitors to the accused`s room and they were his younger brother and his cousin. She could not remember whether the accused let them in or they had a set of keys to the flat and the master bedroom. Madam Yep further testified that she had a spare key to the master bedroom but there was no key to the toilet. Her evidence was corroborated by her son, Richard Wong. Evidence was also adduced from the house and maintenance officer of the Housing and Development Board to show that the lock to the master bedroom toilet had been replaced with the new lock.
The defence of the accused was that there were other persons having access to the flat and he had no knowledge whatsoever that the drugs were in the toilet. In particular, he stated that the flat was used by a man called Lim Soh Chew, and further there were other persons, Ah Ho and Ngeow Chi, who had been to the flat. These persons were not called by the accused to testify. The trial judge rejected his evidence and held that Lim Soh Chew was a mere visitor and had no role to play in the matter. The trial judge also placed no weight on the accused`s evidence of Ah Ho and Ngeow Chi visiting the flat. The trial judge came to the conclusion that the accused knew of and had control of the keys to the toilet and that he had exclusive possession of the drugs found in the toilet by virtue of the fact that the toilet door was locked and that the keys were hidden in his T-shirt, and these were the only keys to the toilet. He disbelieved the evidence of the accused that he never went to the flat after the end of 1990 except to collect letters from the letter box downstairs. The trial judge held that his finding that the accused was in possession of the keys to the toilet would also be sufficient to raise a presumption of possession and knowledge of the drugs under ss 18(1) and (2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. This then raised the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Act which, on the facts, had not been rebutted. The trial judge therefore convicted the accused as charged.
Before us, counsel for the appellant challenged the trial judge`s finding of possession. He submitted that there were other persons having access to the flat and to the toilet. For instance, the landlady, Madam Yep, had keys to the flat and to the master bedroom and the landlady testified that relatives of the accused such as his cousin and his brother also came to the flat and used the toilet. There was no evidence that the Jockey T-shirt in which the keys were found belonged to the accused. The wardrobe was not locked and the key to the wardrobe was left at the door. The evidence showed therefore that the accused did not have exclusive possession of the drugs. In support, he relied on the Malaysian case of 
 Pang Chee Meng v PP 
 .1 We rejected his submission. The master bedroom to the flat was rented by the accused from Madam Yep and he had the keys to the flat and the master bedroom. It was Madam Yep`s evidence that she never went into the master bedroom and this evidence was undisputed by the accused. As for other persons having access to and using the room and the extent of their use, no evidence was adduced apart from the bare statements of the accused. The drugs were found in the master bedroom toilet and the keys to the toilet were in the T-shirt hung in the wardrobe. The trial judge found that the appellant had knowledge of, and control over, the keys to the toilet and that he had exclusive possession of the drugs in the toilet. In our judgment, the trial judge was justified in coming to this conclusion. By reason of the accused having possession of the drugs, a presumption of trafficking in the drugs arose under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), and on the evidence the presumption had not been rebutted. The trial judge was therefore right in finding that the charge of trafficking in the quantity of drugs had been proved.
The Malaysian case of 
 Pang Chee Meng v PP 
 1 was of no assistance to the accused although, as the trial judge said, that case bore `some isolated similarities with those in the present case`. There, the accused upon arrest allegedly gave information to the police which led to the discovery of the drugs in a room where he was known to be living. It was in evidence that he did not have exclusive possession of the room where the drugs were found. There were three other persons sharing the room with him. He was convicted, and on appeal his conviction was set aside. In setting aside the conviction, the Supreme Court found that the trial judge had erroneously directed himself as to the principles of law to be applied in determining various issues of fact and law and had adopted the wrong approach and further that the trial judge was manifestly wrong in finding that the accused had exclusive possession of the room where there was evidence that there were three others sharing the accommodation with him.
However, nothing of that kind occurred in the instant case.
As we have held, there was no credible evidence before the trial judge of any persons named by the accused sharing the accommodation with him. The evidence given by him of Lim Soh Chew, Ah Ho and Ngeow Chi was rejected or given no weight by the trial judge. He was justified in so doing. The trial judge found and, in our opinion rightly, that the accused had exclusive possession of the master bedroom and the keys to the toilet. There was no misdirection by the trial judge on such finding.
The second contention made by counsel for the appellant was that the trial judge amended the charge at the end of the trial by including the words `sell or distribute` as particulars of trafficking. This amendment was made because of the recent decision of this court in 
 Lee Ngin Kiat v PP 
 .2 Counsel submitted that this amendment of the charge at a late stage in the trial had prejudiced the accused. We disagreed. The amended charge had been read and explained to the accused and the accused had been invited to recall witnesses or to call any new witness. He did not do so. More fundamentally, the amendment did not involve the prosecution adducing evidence of any new facts. In our judgment, no prejudice had been caused to the accused.
There was no merit in the appeal and we dismissed it.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was charged with two counts of murder. The charge for which he was convicted in the court below was for the murder of one Foo Chin Chin (`Ah Chun`) on 24 March 1990 at about 10pm at East Coast Park between Bedok Jetty and car park No F1, Singapore. The other charge for the murder of one Ng Lee Kheng (`Ah May`) on the same day but earlier at 7.40pm at Blk 37, Circuit Road, Singapore was stood down. Upon the conviction of the appellant in the court below for the murder of Ah Chun, the charge of murder of Ah May was withdrawn by the prosecution. The appellant now appeals against his conviction for the murder of Ah Chun.
From the outset of the trial in the court below counsel for the defence made it clear that the defence was not challenging the prosecution case as the defence was one of diminished responsibility. To run this defence, counsel wanted evidence relating to the death of Ah May to be led and this was done.
The prosecution case is that on 24 March 1990 at about 10pm the appellant was seen by four prosecution witnesses dragging Ah Chun into some bushes at the East Coast Park bird sanctuary. Ah Chun was heard pleading with the appellant to let her go. The appellant subsequently emerged from the bushes and fled, pursued by these witnesses. Ah Chun`s body was later discovered near some bushes inside the bird sanctuary.
Prof Chao Tzee Cheng, the senior forensic pathologist who arrived at about midnight on 24 March 1990, examined Ah Chun`s body at the scene. He estimated the time of her death to be around 10.30pm. He found 14 stab wounds, seven were penetrating wounds. There were two defensive wounds on her left arm consistent with that sustained during a struggle when she raised her arm to shield herself from the assailant. Two of the penetrating wounds were fatal wounds. The deepest wound was 15cm. These two stab wounds had entered the chest and penetrated the lobe of the right lung. Both lungs had collapsed. Cause of death was haemorrhage due to stab wounds in the right lung. In Prof Chao Tzee Cheng`s view the fatal wounds were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.
Following police investigation, the appellant was arrested on 26 March 1990. In a statement made by the appellant on 26 March 1990 between 6.43pm and 7.23pm under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), the appellant stated: 
 
I do not know what to say. What is there to say? Since I have killed the person I must expect retribution. If I am to be sentenced to death, then let it be soon. That`s all.
 
 
 
He then added: 
 
Previously I had trusted her too much. In the end she deceived me. That is all.
 
 
 
In an earlier statement made by him under s 121(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code on the same day between 8.10am and 1.35pm, he had given an account of how Ah May had fallen from the 15th floor of Blk 37, Circuit Road, that he brought Ah Chun to Marine Parade but instead got off at East Coast Park. Whilst they were walking in the Park, Ah Chun`s pager started beeping. He then said: 
 
The next instant I brought her to a bridge that leads out to the sea. Actually this is a jetty. Whilst there, I picked up a knife about nine inches long (inclusive of the handle) ... I slipped this knife into the left pocket of my baggy pants. This was done without Ah Chun detecting it. Soon after this, we retraced our steps back along the jetty and I brought her to a field after some distance. I killed her with a knife. I threw away the knife whilst making good my escape. I went directly home after that. After that I went to sleep ...
 
 
 
When asked why he killed Ah Chun, the appellant said: `I could not stand her because she was heartless.` 
 
 
Q: What do you mean by she was heartless? 
 
A: Now that I had killed her, what is the use of talking about this? 
 
Q: I am asking you what do you mean by `she was heartless`? 
 
A: Rather than saying that she was heartless, I might as well say I have too much feelings for her. 
 
Q: What was/were the actual reason/s of you killing Chun Chun? 
 
A: I just could not stand the way she behaved when I talked to her. 
 
Q: When was it that you found her behaviour intolerable? 
 
A: It was during the time I talked to her at Marine Parade. There I was on tenterhooks and yet she could go to make a telephone call when her pager rang. I told her that I urgently wanted to talk to her about Ah May`s matter and that her outing was only of secondary importance. She did not heed me and instead went on to telephone her friend. Whilst she was making the phone call, I paced up and down anxiously. Yet, she did not cut her phone call short and kept talking away on the telephone. It was then that it crossed my mind that I had always been a gentleman with her and yet she behaved like that towards me. I had always treated her well since our acquaintance more than a year ago. I had never bullied her. On one occasion when I went to her house, she had lied to her mother that she had known me for a month. Her mother spoke to me rudely and I could not tolerate Ah Chun for lying like that. All thoughts went through my mind whilst she was busy on the telephone. In fact I had told her not to fool around with my feelings. I told her that I was not the person to fool with and that she could find some other guys to fool around with if that was what she wanted. I overheard her discussing with the other party on the phone as to where they should go for their outing. Ah Chun mentioned that she wanted to go to the Expo or something. Subsequently when she hung up, my heart was hardened. That was why I stole the knife on the jetty. After taking the knife, I still didn`t have the guts to kill her. I did not attack her immediately with the knife. We walked for some distance. As I was walking, I thought to myself. I tried to calm myself and in my mind I was prepared to give ourselves a chance to talk. After walking for a good distance, we turned around and walked back. In that frame of mind I knew that I spoke to her incoherently. She was insensitive to my feelings and raised her voice at me. I pointed out to her that when I adopted the soft approach, she was hard with me. By right, I told her that she should meet me half-way. I told her that every time I gave her an inch she took a foot. At the same time I told her that when she was in my company she should not mention about other men in front of me. But it was as if I was talking to a ghost. One moment she was smiling and the next she was cool and unresponsive. At times during our talk, she even muttered to herself. Somehow, we continued walking and I do not know when we came to this field, ie the place where she died. When we walked into the field I saw three men already there. I was not bothered by it and continued walking further in. Later, I told her that I wanted to ease myself and she was to wait there for me. I walked away with thoughts running through my mind. The incident concerning her telephone call with the other party, a man, recurred in my mind. Subsequently, I joined her again and we walked deeper in. Then I told her not to blame me. I stabbed her on the abdomen. It was very dark at that time. It was only then that she started pleading with me but, to me, it was too late because I had already produced the weapon. In Mandarin she pleaded with me to let her go. In my heart I told myself that there was no way I could stop since I had already rained a blow with a knife. It occurred to me to kill her quickly and thereafter to take my own life within a week. I wanted to settle her off fast to end her agony. I plunged the knife into her a few times with my face turned away. After the first stab, she had fallen onto the ground. Having stabbed her a few times, I squat and held her hand. She had not died yet and I could not bear to walk away. I waited until she had left the world. I called her name four or five times before she departed. My mind was a blank at that time. I walked out and saw the three men I had seen earlier. I told them to mind their own business and one of them remarked that I was still arrogant after beating up the female. I walked away from them silently. The three of them were shouting away and asking one another to catch hold of me. I heard them mentioning about arming themselves. I took to my heels and fled by way of the tunnel. I dashed up the steps and ran for another distance before getting into a taxi. From there I went home. At home, I actually wanted to telephone my elder brother to inform him about the incident. Eventually I decided against it as it was already past 10pm and both of us had to report for work the next day. Later I went downstairs to buy two bottles of `Guinness` stout and I consumed it all upstairs. I made another trip downstairs to buy one more big bottle and a small bottle of `Guinness` stout. I felt frustrated. Whilst I was drinking, my mother returned home. She rebuked me for drinking again. By then my mood had softened and I simply maintained silence. I did not pay attention to her words and was also not in the mood to tell her about the earlier incident although I was prepared to do so initially. I reclined on the sofa and recalled the earlier events of that night. I felt guilty. My mind also dwelled on our relationship in the past year and I could not understand why it came to such a stage. I had a wish on my mind; I hoped that I would not be arrested by the police so soon. I only wanted a week`s time for myself to do what I had to do. At first I thought of staying out somewhere for the week. Then again I thought: my purpose was to spend time with my family for this week so why should I go out and stay away from my family? I had the inkling that I would be arrested that night and yet I chose to stay at home.
  
 
 
On 27 March 1992, at about 1.15pm, the appellant led a party of police officers to the scene. There he pointed to an area in the bird sanctuary where he had thrown the knife which he had used to stab Ah Chun. A search was made in the area and a knife was found under a tree. When shown the knife found at the scene, Prof Chao Tzee Cheng confirmed that it could be the weapon used to inflict the injuries.
On the evidence enumerated, the trial judge found that a prima facie case had been made out against the appellant which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. He therefore called upon the appellant to enter his defence. The defence was one of diminished responsibility under exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code.
Exception 7 to s 300 of the Penal Code reads: 
 
Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender was suffering from such abnormality of mind (whether arising from a condition of arrested or retarded development of mind or any inherent causes induced by disease or injury) as substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts and omissions in causing the death or being a party to causing the death.
 
 
 
On the burden of proof in a defence of diminished responsibility, FA Chua J, in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Chia Chee Yeen v PP 
, at p 399, said: 
 
In law, the burden of proving diminished responsibility, which is on a balance of probabilities, rested on the appellant. This is a question of fact which must be decided in the light of all the evidence before the court, including medical opinion.
 
 
 
To run his defence of diminished responsibility, the appellant gave evidence in the witness box for seven days, giving his life history and the events leading to the death of Ah May and Ah Chun.
Stated briefly, the appellant, born on 29 July 1970, was at the material time 19 years and 8 months of age. He was the youngest and the pet in the family with two brothers and six sisters. His father, who had been a side-walk barber in Syed Alwi Road, had recently died on 15 November 1989. Dr Chan Khim Yew, in his rebuttal evidence for the prosecution, was of the view that at the time of the commission of the offence the appellant was still suffering from bereavement over his father`s death.
The appellant attended Mattar Primary School in Circuit Road, and when his family moved to Bedok, he went to Hong San Primary School. He was not interested in studies. He left school in primary six because he was caught fighting in school. He gave evidence of two incidents: a fight with his physical education teacher one day; and on the following day, a fight with a classmate and that boy`s mother.
Because of these incidents, he stayed away from school and played truant. His family members did not know of this for some time as he would put on his school uniform and leave home everyday. After a time, he did not return home; he would stay in the void decks of Housing & Development Board (`HDB`) estates. The members of his family would have to go and look for him and bring him home. Not without reason he was punished by his father, and one of his elder brothers. He had even been chained. He, however, claimed that he had a normal father-and-son relationship. He also bore no ill-will against his brother for disciplining him.
The appellant had been a glue-sniffer. He started sniffing glue whilst at school. After he left school, he regularly sniffed glue. He said that he became addicted to it. He also swallowed Roche pills. During this period, he extorted money from students, shoplifted, and stole money from locked cars and stole birds from HDB flats for sale.
In September 1983, when he was 13 years old, he was arrested for theft of a motorcycle. He was sent by the juvenile court to the Boys` Home for three years. After his release in June or July 1985, he worked for a while as an air-condition apprentice. In December 1986 he was arrested and charged in court for housebreaking and theft by night. This time he was sent to the young offenders` section of Changi Prison and subsequently transferred to the reformative training centre from where he was released in May 1988.
The appellant claimed that he never held a steady job. In early 1990, he was working as a waiter in a karaoke lounge. During his leisure hours he socialized, playing billiards, mahjong and gambling in billiard saloons. He took to drinking and visited karaoke lounges. For all these activities he borrowed money from friends and family members.
The appellant said that after drinks, he would become `high` or `steamed`. When he was in this condition he did not like people disturbing him, for if they did he would get into a rage. There were times when he had fights after drinks. Once, in 1989 after drinks, he had a quarrel with his mother and beat her. There were other occasions when, after drinks, he destroyed things in the house.
The appellant also testified that he came to know Ah Chun and Ah May on 2 January 1990. This evidence is different from what he had said in his s 121(1) statement where he said more than once that he had known Ah Chun for more than a year. In his evidence, he said late that night he visited a friend, Ah Kwee, who introduced Ah Chun and Ah May to him. All of them went out for a drinking session, first in a karaoke lounge in Golden Mile Shopping Centre, and when that closed, they continued drinking at the Marine Parade hawker centre. After that, he met Ah Chun several times, often after midnight, around 1am or 2am. On a few occasions, he took her back to his flat after they had been drinking together. They even slept together but he did not have sex with her.
In the course of his evidence-in-chief, the appellant narrated some bizarre incidents allegedly having taken place on two occasions when Ah Chun was in the flat. He then admitted in cross-examination that he had fabricated them. He also said in cross-examination that his earlier evidence that Ah Chun and Ah May had put a `charm` on him which had adversely affected his mental and physical health was untrue.
As to what happened on 24 March 1990, the appellant said that at about 7am, when he left his flat to look for Ah Chun in Hougang, he had already decided to kill her. He went by taxi to Hougang. He got off at the car park at the foot of Blk 155 where Ah Chun lived. He waited for her there till past 4pm. At that time, Ah Chun came down with her younger brother and sister. He followed behind them, unobserved, as they walked to Hougang Shopping Centre.
At the shopping centre, Ah Chun met Ah May at the second floor. Only then did he approach them. He asked Ah Chun to go with him to his flat as he had something important to tell her. She declined, saying that she had to go out. In order to persuade her, he lied to her that he had killed someone the previous night. She was shocked. Because he was persistent, she finally relented. She went to make a phone call. When she returned, she told Ah May to take her brother and sister home. After they had left, whilst he and Ah Chun were waiting in the canteen on the first floor for Ah May to return, Ah Chun answered a telephone call. When Ah May came back, they had a conversation between themselves. Ah Chun would only come to the flat if Ah May came along. The appellant took them both to his flat.
They got to the flat at about 5pm. No one was at home. In the flat, the appellant broke his piggy bank and gave Ah May some money to go and buy Guinness stout and a packet of cigarettes. Ah Chun made a phone call. When Ah May got back, the appellant said Ah May kept interrupting his conversation with Ah Chun. So he wanted Ah May out of the way. On the pretext that he had to collect a passport for a friend, he was able to get Ah May to go with him to Aljunied. Ah Chun agreed to wait in the flat.
He and Ah May went to the Bedok Bus Interchange. There they went up to the Emporium where he bought a knife. Ah May saw him buy the knife. His counsel asked him: 
 
 
Q: Why did you want to buy the knife? 
 
A: I bought the knife with the intention of killing both of them.
  
 
 
He and Ah May then left for Aljunied by taxi. The appellant then gave evidence of the events that led to the death of Ah May on the 15th floor of Blk 37 in Circuit Road. He then said: 
 
When I got home it was about 7 something. Ah Chun was waiting in the flat. She was alone. Ah Chun asked me about Ah May. I went straight into my bedroom and washed my hands. She again asked where Ah May was. I said she was in Aljunied. I told her that Ah May would be back very soon.
 
 
 
When I went back to the flat I had the knife at my waist under my trousers and my shirt over it. In the flat, I put the knife into a drawer of a cupboard in the bedroom.
I sat on the sofa and drank Guinness stout. I felt very much better. I continued my drinking and she continued asking about Ah May. I ignored her. I finished a big bottle of Guinness stout. It took about five minutes. I then went into the kitchen and then to the bedroom. I took the knife out and removed the plastic bag. I placed the knife in my waist. I went out of the bedroom. I wanted to kill her. We sat on the sofa. I wanted to stab her but I did not dare do it. She kept asking about Ah May.
As the knife was long, I did not sit on the sofa for long; I went back into the bedroom. I placed the knife back in the cupboard. I went back to the sitting room.
After Ah Chun kept asking as to the whereabouts of Ah May, I told her that Ah May was in Marine Parade. She wanted me to bring her down to Marine Parade. I agreed. I wanted to take her out of the house.
Before we went down, I took the knife and wrapped it in paper and tucked it in my waist. When we got to the ground floor Ah Chun was paged. She rang up her house.
We then took a taxi and went to Marine Parade. Ah Chun did not know I had a knife with me. I told the taxi to go to the hawker centre in Marine Parade.
We alighted in Marine Parade, not at the market, near the sea. I alighted at a car park.
We then walked to the jetty. It was around 9 something. As we walked, Ah Chun asked where Ah May was waiting. I told her that she was at the jetty. Her pager beeped. After we reached the jetty, Ah Chun went to make a telephone call at a public telephone. After the call, she said that she had called a male friend. She again asked me why Ah May was not there yet. Ah Chun kept on asking where Ah May was and what we did in Aljunied. I told her that Ah May was with a friend. After the phone call we together went to the place where she died.
Initially she did not want to go to that spot. I let go off her hand and walked forward and she followed me. We went into the bushes. I went in first. I then took out my knife. Ah Chun called out. I asked her to come in. When she came in, I went towards her with the knife. I forced her to say something.
When I approached her she saw the knife in my left hand. She was taken aback. She went to hold the back of my left hand. Whilst grabbing my hand, she apologized to me. I scolded her. She screamed. There was a short struggle. I then stabbed her. I stabbed her until she fell. I stabbed her until I was panting. So, I stopped and squatted there.
I squatted there for a short while. Then I noticed someone else squatting nearby. I stood up and that person also stood up. I asked him what he was looking at. He said that we could talk things over. He went out to the grass verge. I followed him. He said something to his friends. His friends came to catch me. I ran towards the underpass. Somewhere along I threw the knife. I went home ...
After the appellant had given his evidence, his mother, brother, three sisters and two friends testified on his behalf, not on the offence but on the appellant and his lifestyle. Their evidence was riddled with irreconcilable discrepancies and contradictions. But the learned trial judge accepted that the sum total of their evidence is that the appellant grew up in a low socio-economic family, that he was a spoilt child, difficult as a boy and a delinquent young adult; he had been brought up under the surrogate care of his older siblings because his mother aged 56, a dish washer, had always had to work to help support the nine children as her husband`s income was insufficient for the family. After his release from the reformative training centre he never held a steady job, he was a sociable person but after drinks could become violent and difficult to manage and at the material time he was much infatuated with Ah Chun who did not reciprocate his feelings for her.
The defence then called Dr Wong Yip Chong (`Dr Wong`), a consultant psychiatrist. Dr Wong had altogether interviewed the appellant on five occasions. He was in court for most of the time during the prosecution case and when the appellant and his other witnesses testified. He also had the s 121(1) statement made by the appellant. From all these sources, Dr Wong said he was of the opinion that the appellant, at the time of the commission of the offence, was suffering from one or other or all of the following mental disorders: 
 
 
(1) borderline personality disorder (`BPD`); 
 
(2) brief reactive psychosis (`BRP`); 
 
(3) acute idiosyncratic intoxication (`AII`).
  
 
 
Dr Wong was also of the opinion that the appellant was suffering from such an abnormality of mind that it had substantially impaired his mental responsibility when he killed Ah May and Ah Chun.
For rebuttal evidence, the prosecution called Dr Chan Khim Yew (`Dr Chan`), the senior consultant psychiatrist from Changi Prison Hospital who had interviewed the appellant on 13 occasions with duration of each interview ranging from 20 minutes to two hours. He was also present when the appellant testified. He was of the view that there was no evidence that the appellant was suffering from any mental illness or personality disorder. He was of the opinion that the appellant was in bereavement over his father`s death and that it was in a fit of jealousy and from a passion of unrequited love that he brutally stabbed the deceased to death.
Both Dr Wong and Dr Chan agreed that for the appellant to be diagnosed as having BPD he must satisfy at least five of the following eight diagnostic criteria set out in the 
 Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 
(3rd Ed, Revised) (DSM-111-R). They are: 
 
 
(1) a pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternation between extremes of over-idealization and devaluation; 
 
(2) impulsiveness in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (eg spending, sex, substance use, shoplifting, reckless driving, binge eating)[does not include suicidal or self-mutilating behaviour covered in (5)]; 
 
(3) affective instability: marked shifts from baseline mood to depression, irritability, or anxiety, usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days; 
 
(4) inappropriate, intense anger or lack of control of anger (eg frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights); 
 
(5) recurrent suicidal threats, gestures, or behaviour, or self-mutilating behaviour; 
 
(6) marked and persistent identity disturbance manifested by uncertainty about at least two of the following: self-image, sexual orientation, long-term goals or career choice, type of friends desired, preferred values; 
 
(7) chronic feelings of emptiness or boredom; 
 
(8) frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment [does not include suicidal or self-mutilating behaviour covered in (5)].
  
 
 
On extremes of over-idealization and devaluation, Dr Wong was of the view that the appellant fitted into this category because he was love-struck and alternatively was angry and hated Ah Chun. But he agreed that this was common in any courting couple. Dr Chan disagreed. He said a person in love will over-idealize to the point of worship and then devalue the loved one. He said to qualify for idealization in this context there must be evidence of reaching out for close bonding with the subject and one would not be able to discover this unless one studies the basic sub-phase of the appellant as a child between 16-36 months. The idealization and devaluation is the reliving of the developmental arrest that had occurred to a person at that time as the child would be unable to tolerate ambivalence of the primary object. Dr Chan also disagreed that the appellant had a pattern of unstable relationships as required by DSM-III-R. He said that the relationship of the appellant with others, not only with Ah Chun, was not unstable; in any event he found no evidence of it.
On impulsiveness, Dr Wong said that impulsiveness is a reflex action or behaviour without much thought or afterthought. An example of the appellant`s impulsiveness was glue sniffing; another was his evidence that early that morning on 24 March 1990 he decided to look for Ah Chun.
Dr Chan accepted that impulsiveness carries a connotation of acting immediately or almost immediately. But, in the specific instance, the fact that the appellant had sniffed glue two weeks before the incident was not an act of impulsive behaviour. The explanation was that at that time he was still affected by his father`s death and when Ah Chun wanted to leave him he resorted to glue sniffing.
As for the appellant`s sniffing glue in the Boys` Home, Dr Chan said that while this might have been a violation of the rules, it did not necessarily indicate impulsiveness. It was the result of bad influence. Again, Dr Chan said there was simply no evidence that the appellant`s acts relied upon by Dr Wong were impulsive acts.
On affective instability with marked shifts from baseline mood to depression, Dr Wong attached a special meaning to affective instability. He said that the appellant had repeated periods of depressive episodes. His irritability was out of disagreements with others; he had anxiety waiting for Ah Chun, he got up early on the morning of 24 March to look for her.
Dr Chan, however, was of the view that the appellant, suffering from bereavement reaction, would show depressive features, but this was not mental disorder. He drew support from an incident: some three months after his father`s death, a week before the tragedy, the appellant, on returning home after a drinking session in Amara Hotel, had knelt in front of his father`s altar after he had smashed the glass panel of the altar. Dr Chan quoted authorities to support his view that bereavement periods extend to six months, and could extend to one to two years. He said that the bereavement reaction coupled with Ah Chun`s rejection of him was a severe blow to the appellant.
On repeated inappropriate intense anger, Dr Wong said the appellant had a pervasive pattern of bad temper and he relied on: (a) the appellant`s evidence of involvement in fights; and (b) the appellant`s self-destruction which indicated anger internalized.
Dr Chan disagreed. He gave evidence of the behaviour and conduct of the appellant when the latter was in his care in Changi Prison Hospital for three months in 1990. He said that the appellant had never exhibited inappropriate intense anger. He was a peaceful prisoner. Dr Chan also referred to the evidence when the appellant went to Ah Chun`s house on one occasion at about 1am and was told by her mother that she was not at home, he had bit his lower lip to control himself. The appellant said that her father wanted to beat him but he did not retaliate. There was also evidence that when he was kept waiting by Ah Chun for about six hours, the appellant said he was not angry and could have waited longer for her. He said that he was very patient with her. Dr Chan explained that if the appellant was a BPD case, there would not be an absence of inappropriate intense anger in these situations. This is because in BPD, a reaction to such anger would be pervasive across the board in almost all situations.
Dr Chan said that there was no evidence that the appellant had, aside from his drunken tantrums, displayed any anger of the nature required by this criterion. Moreover, this anger was not pervasive as the appellant only got angry after drinks.
On recurrent suicidal attempts, Dr Wong would not agree that there was only one suicide attempt. His view of `recurrent` is `more than once`. He referred to an incident on 18 March when the appellant cut his wrist and said that that was a clear case of a suicide attempt. He also considered another piece of evidence of the appellant, of self-mutilation by him, as a suicide attempt for, in his view, self-mutilation is also a form of suicide.
Dr Chan, however, relied on the meaning of `recurrent`, defined in 
 Butterworths Medical Dictionary 
 , as `the reappearance of disease returning, or showing a tendency to return, from time to time and not just once`. He said that there was no such evidence of attempted suicide.
Of the episode of 18 March, Dr Chan said that the cuts on the wrist of the appellant were merely on the surface of the skin, the tendons were not severed, and they were only done on one wrist and not both. The medical report of the doctor who examined the appellant after his arrest confirmed merely two healed lacerations. Even the appellant`s sisters, who found him after this incident, did not think that the cuts were serious enough as they had merely bandaged it and did not seek medical attention. There was also no evidence that the appellant did it to get the attention of Ah Chun. Dr Chan would not accept this incident as a suicide attempt.
On identity disturbance in self-image, long-term goals and career choice, Dr Wong referred to the evidence that the appellant did not hold a steady job and was always changing jobs. Dr Chan`s view of the evidence was that this never bothered the appellant. He said the appellant himself was not disturbed by his lack of career choice. The appellant never agonized over the fact that he did not hold a steady job.
On chronic feelings of emptiness and boredom (boredom has been deleted in the working papers of DSM-IV), Dr Wong said this was verbally expressed as well as by inference, in that the appellant would either watch television or go out with friends who were actually strangers. In other words, he had a compulsive need to be with somebody yet at the lounges he drank alone and did not interact except for a game of billiard. Dr Chan, however, said there was no evidence that the appellant had any chronic feelings of emptiness. On the contrary he was constantly in the company of friends, he went to karaoke lounges and billiard saloons. He only told his sister Keh Lain that life was `meaningless` because he was unhappy with his relationship with Ah Chun and because he missed his late father.
On frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment, Dr Wong said the appellant made frantic efforts to avoid real or imagined abandonment by Ah Chun; Dr Chan rhetorically asked whether there was any evidence of this kind of behaviour of sufficient weight to satisfy this criterion under the DSM-III-R. He said that it was quite normal for one to go rushing around to look for a loved one.
Dr Wong also said that the appellant`s delinquent behaviour is consistent with psychopathic and antisocial features. He was of the view that 25% of such behaviour resulted in psychopathic behaviour.
Dr Chan said that this is not one of the criteria in DSM-III-R. He said that psychopathic refers to absence of conscience, callousness and lack of loyalty which were all inferential entities whereas antisocial features are specific items of behaviour. As for the appellant, Dr Chan said he had a conscience and he was loyal to the family. The appellant had visited his mother everyday when she was hospitalized in December 1989 and he took care of his late father during his illness. Dr Chan was of the view that this was strong loyalty. When asked whether the killing of Ah May and Ah Chun was antisocial behaviour, Dr Chan said that the killing was such a serious occurrence that he did not think that the word `antisocial` captured the seriousness of it.
On BRP, Dr Wong relied on the diagnostic criteria for BRP in DSM-III-R and they are these: 
 
 
(A) presence of at least one of the following symptoms indicating impaired reality testing (not culturally sanctioned): 
 
(1) incoherence or marked loosening of associations, 
 
(2) delusions, 
 
(3) hallucinations, 
 
(4) catatonic or disorganized behaviour; 
 
(B) emotional turmoil, ie rapid shifts from one intense affect to another, or overwhelming perplexity or confusion; 
 
(C) appearance of the symptoms in criteria A and B shortly after, and apparently in response to, one or more events that, singly or together, would be markedly stressful to almost anyone in similar circumstances in the person`s culture; 
 
(D) absence of the prodromal symptoms of schizophrenia, and failure to meet the criteria for schizotypal personality disorder before onset of the disturbance; 
 
(E) duration of an episode of the disturbance of from a few hours to one month, with eventual full return to pre-morbid level of functioning(When the diagnosis must be made without waiting for the expected recovery, it should be qualified as `provisional`.); 
 
(F) not due to a psychotic mood disorder (ie no full mood syndrome is present), and it cannot be established that an organic factor initiated and maintained the disturbance.
  
 
 
Dr Wong relied on that part of the s 121(1) statement of the appellant where he said: `In that frame of mind I knew that I spoke to her incoherently.` According to him this reflected that the appellant suffered from incoherence and loosening of associations at the time of the killing. Dr Chan, however, said that this statement only showed the slightest degree of incoherence which did not amount to pathology as required under the criteria in DSM-III-R. He considered the above sentence in the context of the passage as a whole to conclude that there was no incoherence for there was a unifying theme. What is more important, he said, is that had the appellant been speaking incoherently that night, he would not know that he was in that frame of mind and the fact that the appellant was able to recount the events that took place at that time showed that he could not have been incoherent or that there was any loosening of associations. He said that in a classic case, there would be other symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions. There was no such evidence in this case.
Dr Wong referred to para 33 of his report where he dealt with the killing of Ah Chun and to a portion in the appellant`s s 121(1) statement to show that the details of the killing itself had bizarre features. Paragraph 33 reads: 
 
I have considered prosecution`s case that he killed Ah Chun because of jealousy including destroying her as he could not have her. This conjures up a viciousness uncharacteristic of him. The circumstances of the killing appear inconsistent with a vicious intent. There was no proper planning. There was no gleeful satisfaction to accompany viciousness. The details of the killing itself had bizarre features. He was `incoherent` and `in a semi-conscious state` and was without concern of the presence of some people nearby. He did it almost with apology, with depressive feelings (with thoughts of taking his own life), with tenderness `to put her out of her misery` - `to settle her off fast to end her agony`. Thereafter he `could not bear to walk away` but `remained squatting and watching her gasping away` and `waited until she had left the world` ... and called `her name four or five times before she departed` with a mind `blank at that time` and `stood up` only after she had `stopped breathing`.
 
 
 
Dr Chan, on the other hand, gave examples of bizarre behaviour: outlandish dress, peculiar posture, muteness or screaming. In this case he said there was no evidence of any such behaviour. He regarded this as an ordinary boyfriend-girlfriend killing. He said that the `Achilles heel` in this case was the loss of pride and injured feelings. This was the basis for the appellant`s motive in killing Ah Chun.
Dr Wong referred to the appellant`s lengthy account in his s 121(1) statement of what happened in the East Coast Park in support of his opinion that the appellant showed rapid shifts from one intense emotion to another with puzzlement, perplexity and confusion. Dr Chan disagreed and maintained that there was nothing in that statement which qualified for the ingredients in this criterion. In his assessment, there was insufficient quantity of this ingredient to satisfy the criterion laid down in DSM-III-R.
Dr Wong said that the appellant returned to his pre-morbid level of functioning once the `stressor`, Ah Chun, was removed. He said that this return was rapid as he was calm in behaviour when he reached home.
Dr Chan said that if the appellant had suffered from BRP, the psychosis would last for a few hours to a few days. Assuming also that the appellant was a borderline, his reaction after the killing would not be that of calmness. His fragile personality would cause him to be distraught and it would be a situation where the appellant needed to be reassured and comforted. Dr Chan said the appellant would be eager to tell someone about the killing. But that was not the situation after he had killed Ah Chun. The appellant had remained calm. Moreover, if the appellant was a borderline, having a fragile and poorly integrated personality, suicide would not be inconsistent, bearing in mind that the appellant had made such an attempt a week earlier for less traumatic reasons; there was no such attempt.
Dr Wong said the appellant was under emotional stress of rejection and fear of being controlled. He admitted that he drew inferences on the evidence for this ingredient. Dr Chan disagreed. He said that there simply was no evidence that Ah Chun was trying to control the appellant. Dr Chan accepted that Ah Chun`s rejection of him would have caused the appellant some stress, but he was of the view that the stress was not of the level as required under this criterion. The `stressor`, he said, must be so traumatic that anybody in the same situation would react in the same way.
On AII, notwithstanding that the EEG and CT scans were negative, Dr Wong was of the view that the appellant suffered brain damage as a result of long-term exposure to glue-sniffing. Dr Chan, however, was of the view that the diagnosis of BRP was incompatible with a finding of intoxication. The diagnosis of BRP was also incompatible where there was brain damage. Therefore, any ill-effects from drinking or brain damage suffered by the appellant had to be excluded.
The appellant had taken to glue-sniffing when he was in school; in the Boys` Home, he was caught glue-sniffing twice and reprimanded; thereafter, he did not sniff glue until about 15 or 16 March 1990. On these facts, Dr Chan was of the view that it could not be said that the appellant was exposed to the long-term ill-effects of glue-sniffing.
Dr Chan had done a clinical examination of the appellant when he had him under observation at the Changi Prison Hospital. He said that the appellant did not suffer from any brain damage. In his clinical findings, Dr Chan did not detect any unsteadiness of gait, or tremors in the appellant`s hands, nor did the appellant have any difficulty in articulation of speech. These clinical signs confirmed that the appellant had not suffered any brain damage.
Dr Chan gave evidence that AII would cause a person to immediately fall asleep after a violent outburst after an ingestion of a small amount of alcohol. There was no evidence that the appellant reacted in that way on that day after killing Ah Chun. There was also no evidence of poor memory recall as the appellant could recount events of the two killings shortly after his arrest and even months later when he was under observation by Dr Chan at Changi Prison Hospital.
After a careful review of all the evidence including that of Drs Wong and Chan, the learned trial judge concluded as follows: 
 
In this case, on a review of the medical evidence, I found that Dr Chan`s opinions were to be preferred to those of Dr Wong. Dr Wong sought very hard to look for evidence to support his opinions, but there was, in my view, scarce evidence that the accused had suffered from any of the mental illnesses he opined. It may be that the killing of Ah May and then of Ah Chun later that day would suggest to some laymen on a cursory view that there was something wrong with the accused, but on a careful review of the facts, I found that he certainly did not suffer from any of the mental illnesses attributed to him by Dr Wong. In any event, I was satisfied that the accused was not suffering from any abnormality of mind, substantial or otherwise, which had impaired his mental responsibility for the killing of Ah Chun.
 
 
 
At the conclusion of the case, I was satisfied that the accused killed Ah Chun out of jealousy because she rejected him for someone else and would not reconcile with him. It was a case of unrequited love. This is clear from his letter to Ah Chun (D1) dated 14 March 1990. In it he had said: 
 
`... I hope we can still get in touch with each other frequently, so that I can shoulder the responsibility of caring for you. Please give me another chance, okay? Do you know that I am present at every nook and corner of this world, caring and thinking about you all the time. Hope you can successfully settle your problem at an early date and return to meet me again, so that we can rekindle our passionate love once again. Please use your tender heart to fulfil our pledge.`
 
 
 
Finally, it must be said that the accused, in the witness box, admitted that he killed Ah Chun because he was jealous and he could not stand the idea that she was with some other men.
 
 
 
This is a finding of fact by the learned trial judge arrived at after a careful review of all the evidence before him. `An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence an appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges` findings and their reasons therefor`: per FA Chua J in delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Lim Ah Poh v PP 
 at p 719.
We have not been persuaded that this finding of the learned trial judge was reached against the weight of the evidence. On the contrary we agree with his finding. Accordingly we dismiss the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
In the magistrate court, two charges were brought against the respondent, namely: (i) a charge that on 11 April 1987 he did use the motor car No QEJ 7371X (`the vehicle`) for which a vehicle licence was not in force, and (ii) a charge that he did use the vehicle whilst there was not in force in relation to the use thereof a policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) (`the Act`). He pleaded guilty to the first charge and was accordingly convicted; he was fined $500. However, he claimed trial on the second charge.
At the trial, the prosecution adduced evidence that on 11 April 1987, Toh Sew Lan, W/Cpl 3919, attached to the Registry of Vehicles (`ROV`), checked the vehicle which was then being driven by the respondent. She found an expired road tax disc being displayed. She filed her report for the offence of `Non-Display of Valid Road Tax Disc`. No evidence was given by her that she requested the respondent to produce the certificate of insurance relating to the use of the vehicle.
Najir Ahmad, the investigator at the ROV, testified that upon receipt of the report he investigated who was the registered owner of the vehicle and found that Seng Lee Impex Pte Ltd became the registered owner of the vehicle on 30 March 1987 and that it had been declared by its previous registered owner to be a non-user for the period from 28 February 1987 to 31 January 1988. He said that there was no insurance in force but that was based on his own assumption because the vehicle had been declared a non-user. He sent two letters to the respondent asking the latter to see him regarding the failure to display a valid vehicle licence but these letters did not make any request for a certificate of insurance or refer to an insurance policy. The respondents did not reply to these letters. The investigator admitted that he would not be aware if a cover note had been issued for the vehicle.
Evidence was also adduced that on 11 April 1987, the registered owner went to the ROV to apply to renew the road tax for the vehicle for the period 11 April 1987 to 30 September 1987. The person paid the road tax by a cheque which was dishonoured.
The defence was called and the respondent gave evidence. He testified that in April 1987 he was employed by Accent Properties Pte Ltd and had his own car. Seng Lee Impex Pte Ltd, which was managed by his brother, was the owner of the vehicle. On 11 April 1987 he was driving the vehicle on an errand for his brother. That was the first time he drove the vehicle and he did not know whether it had a valid road tax disc or a valid policy of insurance. He did not receive the two letters sent to him by the ROV investigator as he had sold his house to which the two letters had been sent. He told his brother of the invalid road tax disc. His brother went to the ROV and paid the road tax. He gave a cheque for it and upon being notified that it was dishonoured, he paid cash. The vehicle was subsequently sold. If the road tax was paid, he thought that the insurance must also have been paid. In cross-examination, he said he could show that the car was covered by insurance but he needed time. He confirmed that he had the cover note, but no cover note was produced.
At the conclusion of the trial, the learned magistrate found that the essential ingredients of the charge had not been proved, and he discharged and acquitted the respondent. In his grounds of judgment, he said that with the benefit of hindsight, he should not have called for the defence. Against his decision, the public prosecutor appealed. The appeal was heard before KS Rajah JC.
The learned judicial commissioner examined the English cases, 
 R v Oliver, 
 1 
 John v Humphreys 
 2 and 
 R v Edwards 
 ,3 the Malaysian cases of 
 PP v Koh Chin Mong 
 ,4 
 PP v Chin Yoke 
 ,5 
 Khoo Teck Yam v PP 
 6 and two Irish cases of 
 McGowan v Carville 
 7 and 
 Buchanan v Moore 
 .8 He then referred to the Indian case of 
 Shambhu Nath Mehra v The State of Ajmer 
 9 where the Supreme Court of India opined that s 108 of the Evidence Act did not generally relieve the prosecution of the burden of proof in a criminal case but is designed to meet exceptional cases where it would be impossible or disproportionately difficult for the prosecution to establish facts which are especially within the knowledge of the accused and which he could prove without difficulty or inconvenience. The learned judicial commissioner next looked at s 16 of the Act which requires the person using a vehicle to produce a certificate of insurance on being requested to do so by a police officer and he observed that in the present case the respondent had not been asked to produce a certificate at any time. The learned judicial commissioner finally referred to the Malaysian case of 
 Re Tan Kheng Cheng 
 .10 Having reviewed and considered these authorities, the learned judicial commissioner concluded thus: 
 
The prosecution had not made out a prima facie case because the prosecution did not require the respondent to produce his certificate which he thereafter failed to do. Mere proof of driving is not enough to shift the burden of proof. The driver must be asked to produce his certificate as required under s 16 of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189). Section 108 of the Evidence Act is not intended to relieve the prosecution of its duty to require the respondent to produce his certificate.
 
 
 
The failure of the prosecution to produce the evidence of facts especially within the knowledge of its officials which rested upon it under s 108 of the Evidence Act taken together with the failure to require the production of the insurance certificate resulted in a failure to establish a prima facie case.
In the result, he dismissed the appeal.
The public prosecutor then applied by way of motion under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) to reserve for decision of the Court of Appeal a question of law of public interest which had arisen in the course of the appeal and the determination of which by the judge affected the event of the appeal. The application was allowed by KS Rajah JC and the following question was reserved for the decision of this court: 
 
In a prosecution for an offence under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) does the prosecution have to prove a prima facie case against the accused by adducing some evidence that the accused had used, or caused or permitted to be used, a motor vehicle without there being in force a policy of insurance in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements of the Act, or is it sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the accused had used, or caused or permitted to be used, the motor vehicle, without more, and leave it to the accused to prove that there was in force such a policy of insurance?
 
 
 
The question turns on the construction of s 3(1) of the Act under which the respondent was charged and involves a determination of the burden of proof: does the burden rest on the prosecution to prove that there was not in force at the material time in relation to the use of the vehicle a policy of insurance which complies with the requirements of the Act or does the burden rest on the respondent to prove that there was in force at the material time such a policy of insurance? It is convenient at this stage to set out the provision of this subsection which is as follows: 
 
Subject to the provisions of this Act, it shall not be lawful for any person to use or to cause or permit any other person to use a motor vehicle unless there is in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle by that person or that other person, as the case may be, such a policy of insurance or such a security in respect of third-party risks as complies with the requirements of this Act.
 
 
 
In considering this issue, it is helpful to start with the established proposition at common law that in a criminal prosecution the burden of proving the guilt of an accused person lies with the prosecution. In 
 Woolmington v Director of Public Prosecutions 
, at p 481, Viscount Sankey LC said: 
 
Throughout the web of the English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner`s guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception.
 
 
 
In 
 Tan Ah Tee & Anor v PP 
 at p 51, Wee Chong Jin CJ in delivering the judgment of this court said: 
 
It is a fundamental rule of our criminal law that the prosecution must prove every element of the offence charged. This is a common law rule which is not embodied in any legislative enactment but is English in origin. In England the Court of Appeal in 
 R v Edwards
 
[1975] 1 QB 27
 held that if an enactment under which a charge is laid, on its true construction, prohibits the doing of acts, subject to provisoes, exemptions and the like, then the prosecution can rely upon the exception to the fundamental rule of the common law of England that the prosecution must prove every element of the offence charged. The Court of Appeal so held after a thorough analysis of a long line of authorities beginning from 
 R v Stone
 (1801) 1 Eust 639.
 
 
 
In that case, this court was dealing with the construction of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1973 and it was argued that the prosecution had failed to prove an essential element of the charge, ie that the accused were persons who were not authorized by the Act or the regulations to traffic in heroin. This was rejected by the court. The learned Chief Justice said, at p 51: 
 
In our opinion the law here is the same as the law in England as to when the prosecution can rely on the exception. It is limited to offences arising under enactments which on their true construction, prohibit the doing of an act save in specified circumstances or by persons of specified classes or with special qualifications or with the licence or permission of specified authorities.
 
 
 
What then is the true construction of s 3 of the Act? In our opinion the section prohibits trafficking in a controlled drug save in the circumstances specified therein, ie save as authorized by the Act itself or the regulations made thereunder. Consequently, the prosecution was under no necessity to prove a prima facie case of lack of authorization and it was for each appellant to prove that he or she was authorized to do the prohibited act.
We do not think that it is in issue that in a prosecution of an offence under s 3(1) of the Act, the fact that the accused has, at the material time in force in relation to the use of the motor vehicle in question, a policy of insurance against third-party risks as complies with the Act is one especially within his knowledge, and on the basis of s 108 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) the burden of proving this fact is on him. What is in issue is whether, before the defence is called upon to prove this fact, it is necessary for the prosecution to adduce prima facie evidence that the accused did not have such insurance, for example, by showing that he has failed to produce the certificate of insurance upon request. It is this narrow issue we have to consider, and it is this issue on which there has been a difference of judicial opinion.
We start with the case of 
 R v Oliver 
 .1 There, the accused was convicted of the charge of selling sugar as a wholesaler on various dates otherwise than under the terms of a licence or permit or other authority granted by the Minister of Food contrary to reg 55 of the Defence (General) Regulations 1939. The material statutory provision under which the accused was charged was: 
 
Subject to any directions given or except under and in accordance with the terms of a licence, permit or other authority granted by or on behalf of the Ministry no ... wholesaler shall by way of trade ... supply ... any sugar.
 
 
 
At the trial the prosecution tendered no evidence that the accused did not have a licence to supply sugar by the wholesaler and the accused did not give any evidence. He was convicted, and against his conviction, he appealed. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal. It was contended on behalf of the accused that the prosecution must, at least, give enough evidence to prove a prima facie case. This was rejected by the court. Viscount Caldecote CJ in delivering the judgment of the court said, at p 75: 
 
In the circumstances of the present case we are of opinion that the prosecution was under no necessity of giving prima facie evidence of the non-existence of a licence.
 
 
 
This case was followed in 
 John v Humphreys 
 where the accused was charged with driving a motor vehicle without a licence under s 4(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1930. The accused did not appear in answer to the charge but wrote a letter admitting the offence. Before the Bedfordshire justices, no evidence was adduced that the accused did not have the licence. The only evidence was that the accused drove the motor vehicle along the road at the material time. The justices dismissed the case on the ground that the prosecution had not established a prima facie case. On appeal, the Divisional Court allowed the appeal. Lord Goddard CJ in upholding the argument of counsel for the prosecution said, at p 327: 
 
Mr Lewis` point is that s 4(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1930, says that a person shall not drive a motor vehicle on a road unless he is the holder of a licence; and that when an Act of Parliament provides that a person shall not do a certain thing unless he has a licence, the onus is always on that person to prove that he has a licence because it is a fact peculiarly within his own knowledge. 
 R v Oliver
, to which our attention has been called, after an elaborate review of the authorities, lays that down. Therefore, in theory, I suppose, a police officer who sees a car being driven in the street can always summon the driver of the car and leave it to the driver to prove that he had a licence. Of course, it is not to be contemplated for a moment that police officers would act in such a way; if they did, not only would they have costs given against them, but I should think that very severe steps would be taken. In the present case nothing of that sort happened.
 
 
 
The court followed 
 R v Oliver 
 and in effect decided that the burden of proving the holding of a licence lay with the defendant and there was no need for the prosecution to adduce any prima facie evidence.
There are two other road traffic cases which should be mentioned here, although the reports of such cases are far from satisfactory. In both cases, the accused were charged under the provision of the Road Traffic Act for using the vehicles without having in force the requisite policies of insurance. The first is 
 Philcox v Carberry 
 13 where the accused was charged with the offence of using a motor-cycle without there being in force a policy of insurance in respect of the use thereof under s 5(3) of the Road Traffic Act 1930. No evidence was given by the accused, nor was any question asked by the prosecutor, in relation to a policy of insurance. The Divisional Court following 
 R v Oliver 
 1 and 
 John v Humphreys 
 2 held that the onus of proving that there was in force a policy of insurance was on the accused as it was a fact peculiarly within his knowledge. The second case is 
 Leathley v Drummond. 
 14 There, the accused was charged with using a motor vehicle without any insurance under s 201(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1960. Section 201(1) was in pari materia with s 3(1) of our Act and provided as follows: 
 
... it shall not be lawful for a person to use ... a motor vehicle on a road unless there is in force in relation to the user of the vehicle by that person ... such a policy of insurance ... as complies with the requirements of this Part of this Act.
 
 
 
It was held that the onus was on the accused to satisfy the court that he was covered by such insurance when driving and the prosecutor did not have to prove that there was no valid insurance.
We next turn to another leading case touching on the same question but the facts were entirely different, namely, 
 R v Edwards 
 .3 There, the accused was convicted of selling intoxicating liquor without a justices` licence contrary to s 160(1)(a) of the Licensing Act 1964. He was unrepresented at the trial and did not give evidence, but made an unsworn statement. On appeal, it was contended that the prosecution should have called evidence to prove that there was no justices` licence. The Court of Appeal rejected the argument and dismissed the appeal. Lawton LJ delivering the judgment of the court said, at pp 39-40: 
 
In our judgment this line of authority establishes that over the centuries the common law, as a result of experience and the need to ensure that justice is done both to the community and to defendants, has evolved an 
 exception to the fundamental rule of our criminal law that the prosecution must prove every element of the offence charged.
 This exception, like so much else in the common law, was hammered out on the anvil of pleading. 
 It is limited to offences arising under enactments which prohibit the doing of an act save in specified circumstances or by persons of specified classes or with specified qualifications or with the licence or permission of specified authorities. Whenever the prosecution seeks to rely on this exception, the court must construe the enactment under which the charge is laid. If the true construction is that the enactment prohibits the doing of acts, subject to provisoes, exemptions and the like, then the prosecution can rely upon the exception
.
 
 
 
In our judgment its application does not depend upon either the fact, or the presumption, that the defendant has peculiar knowledge enabling him to prove the positive of any negative averment. As Wigmore pointed out in his great 
 Treatise on Evidence 
 (1905), Vol 4, p 3525, this concept of peculiar knowledge furnishes no working rule. If it did, defendants would have to prove lack of intent. What does provide a working rule is what the common law evolved from a rule of pleading. We have striven to identify it in this judgment. Like nearly all rules it could be applied oppressively; but the courts have ample powers to curb and discourage oppressive prosecutors and do not hesitate to use them. (Emphasis added.)
The learned judge then identified two consequences that flow from the application of the exception to the fundamental rule of criminal law. He said, at p 40: 
 
Two consequences follow from the view we have taken as to the evolution and nature of this exception. First, as it comes into operation upon an enactment being construed in a particular way, 
 there is no need for the prosecution to prove a prima facie case of lack of excuse, qualification or the like; and secondly, what shifts is the onus: it is for the defendant to prove that he was entitled to do the prohibited act. What rests on him is the legal or, as it is sometimes called, the persuasive burden of proof. It is not the evidential burd
 en.
 (Emphasis is added.)
 
 
 
These two consequences are of great relevance to the issue before us. 
 R v Edwards 
 3 was considered by the House of Lords in 
 R v Hunt (Richard) 
 15 and subject to one qualification was held to be rightly decided. The qualification is this: in that part of his judgment (which we have quoted) Lawton LJ said that the exception to the fundamental rule of criminal law that the prosecution must prove every element of the offence charged is limited to offences arising under enactments which prohibit the doing of an act save in specified circumstances or by persons of specified classes or with specified qualifications or with the licence or permission of specified authorities. Lord Griffith, who delivered the main speech of the House, preferred to adopt the formula stated by Lawton LJ as `an excellent guide to construction` rather than as an exception to the common law rule. As we have shown, 
 R v Edwards 
 3 was adopted by this court in 
 Tan Ah Tee v PP 
 .12
The result of these authorities is this. Where an enactment prohibits the doing of an act save in specified circumstances or by persons of specified class or with specified qualifications or with licence or permission of specified authorities, it is a matter of construction whether the burden of proving the circumstances, qualification, licence or the like shifts to the defendant, and if on the true construction of the enactment, the burden shifts to the defendant it is for him to show that he is entitled to do the prohibited act and that burden is not an evidential burden but a legal burden. It follows therefore that in such case there is no necessity for the prosecution to establish prima facie evidence of the specified circumstances, qualification or licence or the like as provided in the enactment entitling the defendant to do the prohibited act.
In Malaysia, there are conflicting authorities on the point. In 
 PP v Hambali & Anor 
 ,16 one of the accused was charged with, inter alia, the offence of using a motor-cycle without a valid policy of insurance against third-party risks. The magistrate acquitted him as he found that there was no proof that the police had demanded the policy of insurance. On appeal, Chang Min Tat J following the English cases held that the onus of proof was on the accused and there was no necessity for the prosecution to adduce prima facie evidence of the non-existence of the policy. In addition to the English cases, the learned judge also relied on 
 Khoo Teck Yam v PP 
 6 (to which we shall advert in a moment) and said that in that case Buhagiar J held `in words that admit of no misunderstanding` that the burden of proving the existence of a policy was on the accused by virtue of s 106 of the Evidence Ordinance (which is in pari materia with s 108 of our Evidence Act). Chang Min Tat J`s decision has since been reinforced by 
 R v Edwards 
 .3
To the contrary are two Malaysian cases, namely, 
 Re Tan Kheng Cheng 
 18 and 
 Chng Kok Tow v PP 
 ,19 both of which were decided before Hambali but were not cited to Chang Min Tat J. In 
 Re Tan Kheng Cheng, 
 10 the accused was charged with two offences relating to the use of his employer`s motor car, one of which was driving the vehicle without there being in force a valid certificate of insurance contrary to s 74 of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1958. He was convicted of both the charges. Upon revision, Adams J held that the second charge could not stand and set aside the conviction. He said, at p 310: 
 
But from the record, the conviction on the second charge cannot stand. At no place in the evidence do the prosecution aver that the vehicle was not insured or that there was not in force a valid certificate of insurance as required by s 74. Although the fact that the vehicle is insured is in the knowledge of the defendant or his employer and therefore s 106 of the Evidence Ordinance applies and, once a prima facie case has been made out, it is for the defence to show that he was properly insured, the prosecution must make out a case which, if unrebutted would entitle the court to convict before it can call on the defence. The police must adduce evidence to say that they asked the defendant for his certificate of insurance and that he was unable to produce it or that having asked him for it and inspected it, they found that it did not cover the use for which the vehicle was being put at the time that it was stopped. This, I may say, is most important.
 
 
 
In deciding this case, Adams J was exercising his revisionary power and no argument was invited from the prosecution and the defence, and the English cases (discussed above) were not referred to and considered by him. However, in an earlier case, 
 PP v Koh Chin Mong 
, the learned judge referred to the cases of 
 R v Oliver 
 and 
 John v Humphreys 
. In that case, the accused was charged with having committed two offences, one of which was using the motor vehicle without there being in force in relation to the use thereof a policy of insurance against third-party risks contrary to s 74(2) of the Road Traffic Ordinance. There was evidence that the police constable stopped the motor vehicle and found that there was no current motor vehicle licence and that the accused was unable to produce any certificate of insurance in respect of the vehicle. The magistrate discharged the accused without calling upon the defence. The prosecution appealed and the appeal came before Adams J who allowed it and set aside the order of the magistrate. The learned judge in his oral judgment peremptorily said, at p 104: 
 
I was under the impression that this matter had been settled once and for all by the case of 
 PP v Chin Yoke
 which was followed in 
 Khoo Teck Yam v PP
. If any more support were needed for the proposition that in a prosecution for an offence of doing something for which a licence is required under the Road Traffic Ordinance, it is unnecessary to call a licensing officer to prove the non-issue of the licence and that the burden is on the accused to negative the averment of being unlicensed by producing in this case (a) the vehicle licence, and (b) the certificate of insurance, there are the two further cases of 
 Rex v Oliver
 and 
 John v Humphreys
.
 
 
 
The decision in 
 Re Tan Kheng Cheng 
 was followed by Ali J in 
 Chng Kok Tow v PP 
. There, the accused was charged with two offences, one of which was using a motor car without there being in force, in relation to such use, a third-party insurance contrary to s 74 of the Road Traffic Ordinance 1958. He was convicted of both the charges and on appeal, the convictions were set aside. With regard to the second charge, Ali J following 
 Khoo Teck Yam v PP 
 and 
 Re Tan Kheng Cheng 
 held that although the subject matter of the charge was something within the knowledge of the accused so as to bring into operation the provision of s 106 of the Evidence Ordinance 1950, it was necessary for the prosecution to adduce prima facie evidence before the onus of proof would shift to the accused. In that case, he found that the record disclosed no prima facie evidence to show that any attempt had been made to examine the policy of insurance so as to satisfy the trial court that the case had been made out against the accused on that charge. It is unfortunate that neither 
 R v Oliver 
 nor 
 John v Humphreys 
 was brought to the attention of Ali J.
Both Ali J in 
 Chng Kok Tow 
 17 and Chang Min Tat J in 
 Hambali 
 16 relied on 
 Khoo Teck Yam v PP 
 6 in arriving at their respective decisions. With respect, that case was of no assistance to either of them. In that case, the accused was charged with two offences, one of which was that he permitted the vehicle to be used without there being in force in relation to the use of the vehicle the requisite policy of insurance in accordance with the statutory provision then in force. There was evidence adduced at the trial that a third-party insurance policy in respect of the vehicle was produced but it was found that the policy did not cover the carriage of goods in connection with any trade or business. Buhagiar J held that with regard to this charge, there was prima facie evidence adduced by the prosecution that the policy did not cover the carriage of goods for commercial purposes, although the burden of proving the existence of a policy to cover the use of the vehicle for the carriage of goods in connection with any trade or business was on the accused by virtue of s 106 of the Evidence Ordinance 1950. He said, at p 113: 
 
With regard to the second charge there is prima facie evidence adduced by the prosecution that the policy does not cover the carriage of goods for commercial purposes, although the burden of proving the existence of a policy to cover the use of the vehicle for the carriage of goods in connection with any trade or business was in my opinion on the appellant by virtue of s 106 of the Evidence Ordinance 1950. (See also 
 Williams v Russell
, per Talbert J). But the appellant offered no defence.
 
 
 
Hence, Buhagiar J did not decide whether or not prima facie evidence was necessary before the burden of proof shifted to the accused.
Very much the same problem arose and was considered by the High Court and the Supreme Court in Eire in the case of 
 McGowan v Carville 
 .7 In that case, the defendant while driving a motor van was stopped by the complainant and requested to produce the driving licence. He failed to do so, but stated that he would do so at a named GÃ¡rda Station. The defendant was subsequently charged with driving the vehicle without having a driving licence contrary to s 22(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1933. He did not attend to answer the charge, nor was he represented and the complaint was heard in his absence. Evidence was given of the fact that he did not produce the licence when asked but no evidence was given whether or not he did produce the licence at the GÃ¡rda Station as he had earlier promised to do. The district judge dismissed the complaint, being of the opinion that the onus was on the complainant to prove that the defendant had no driving licence and that he had failed to discharge the burden. A case was stated for an opinion of the High Court and it was held that the district judge was correct in law in dismissing the summons. On further appeal to the Supreme Court, it was held (by a majority with Maguire CJ dissenting) that the decision of High Court was correct. It seems to us that the High Court`s decision was based mainly on the construction of the Road Traffic Act 1933. Davitt P, with whom the Supreme Court concurred, said at p 343: 
 
In this case the Road Traffic Act does not cast upon the defendant any onus of proving that he possessed a driving licence. If he had been asked to produce a certificate of insurance and had failed to do so such failure would, under the provisions of s 56, sub- s 4, have afforded prima facie evidence that he was not insured. The fact that the Act makes no similar provision in regard to driving licences is some indication that it was not the legislature`s intention to place any onus on him. It provided that failure to produce his driving licence should be an offence. It provided that when he did produce it at a GÃ¡rda Station he could be required to sign his name in a book there. Its attention was directed to the necessity of providing machinery for the proof of production or non-production. If it had intended to place the onus of proof with regard to the possession of a licence upon the defendant I think it would have said so. The legislature was, I think, content to leave the question of onus to be decided by the trial judge according to the ordinary law of evidence.
 
 
 
In the Supreme Court, Maguire CJ took a contrary view and held that the onus of proving the licence is cast upon the person driving a vehicle for which licence is required by the Act. He followed the English cases of 
 R v Oliver 
 1 and 
 John v Humphreys 
 .2
On very much the same facts as those in the instant case was the case in Northern Ireland, 
 Buchanan v Moore 
 .8 There, evidence was given by a constable that he saw a motor vehicle parked at the side of the road with no tax disc displayed. He spoke to the defendant who admitted that he was the owner of the car and had not paid tax. When asked for his driver`s licence and certificate of insurance, he replied that he had not got them and that he would produce them at the police station in five days. He failed to produce them. At the trial before the magistrate, it was held that the complainant must prove that the defendant was not covered by insurance. Accordingly, the magistrate dismissed the charge. Arising from the dismissal, a case was stated for the opinion of the Court of Appeal. The appeal was allowed. Lord MacDermott LCJ said at the commencement of his judgment, at p 196: 
 
It appears to me to be a well established rule that where one of the elements of a criminal charge consists of an averment of a negative nature, and where the averment relates to a fact which is peculiarly within the knowledge of the defendant, then the burden of disproving that averment falls upon the defendant.
 
 
 
On the authorities it would seem that the burden may either rest upon the defendant ab initio, or may shift to him after the prosecution has proved a prima facie case. The decision in 
 John v Humphreys 
, which related to a driving licence, seems to indicate that in such a case the rule would apply, as it were, ab initio.
He referred to the doubts entertained by Ormerod J in
 John v Humphreys 
and then said: 
 
The other view is that the prosecution has to do something to establish a prima facie case before the rule can be applied. For my own part, I have considerable sympathy with the doubts expressed by Ormerod J in 
 John v Humphreys
, and it may be that in some cases this other view is the right view.
 
 
 
In this case, however, I do not think it necessary to come to a definite conclusion as to which view should prevail on the facts here, for I find in the case stated that the prosecution clearly proved a sufficient prima facie case to shift the burden to the respondent.
The learned Chief Justice thus entertained some doubts on the proposition that with a charge of the kind before him there was no necessity to establish a prima facie case.
Having considered all these authorities, we now revert to s 3(1) of the Act. The material part thereof bears repeating: 
 
... it shall not be lawful for any person to use or to cause or permit ... to use a motor vehicle unless there is in force in relation to the use such policy of insurance ...
 
 
 
This section expressly declares it unlawful for any person to use or permit or cause any other person to use a motor vehicle (such person being hereinafter called the `user`) unless there is in force in relation to such use a policy of insurance against third-party risks as complies with the Act. The subsection does not expressly place on the user of the motor vehicle the burden of proving the existence of such policy of insurance. But, nonetheless, such a result may still arise by implication on the true construction of the provision. A statute can, on its true construction, place a burden of proof on the accused although it does not do so expressly: per Lord Griffith in 
 R v Hunt (Richard) 
 15 at p 374. In that case, the House of Lords held, inter alia, that the burden of proving the guilt of an accused rests with the prosecution save in the case of the defence of insanity and subject to any statutory exception; that such exception may be expressed or implied, and that where a linguistic construction does not indicate clearly on whom the burden of proof lies, the court may look to other considerations to determine the intention of Parliament, such as the mischief at which the Act was aimed and practical considerations affecting the burden of proof, and, in particular, the ease or difficulty that the respective parties would encounter in discharging the burden. Lord Griffith in his speech said, at p 374: 
 
... if the linguistic construction of the statute did not clearly indicate upon whom the burden should lie the court should look to other considerations to determine the intention of Parliament such as the mischief at which the Act was aimed and practical considerations affecting the burden of proof and, in particular, the ease or difficulty that the respective parties would encounter in discharging the burden. I regard this last consideration as one of great importance for surely Parliament can never lightly be taken to have intended to impose an onerous duty on a defendant to prove his innocence in a criminal case, and a court should be very slow to draw any such inference from the language of a statute.
 
 
 
On a true and proper construction, s 3(1) of the Act, in our opinion, in effect prohibits any person using a motor vehicle save in a specified circumstance, namely: where there is in force in relation to the use thereof a policy of insurance against third-party risks as complies with the Act. The question that arises is on whom the burden lies to prove that there is in force such policy of insurance. The section does not expressly make provision pertaining to this question. Following the approach laid down in 
 R v Hunt 
, it seems to us that the mischief at which the Act is directed is the risks of injury or damage to third parties arising from the use of motor vehicles and the purpose of the Act is undoubtedly to make mandatory the necessary insurance to be taken out to cover such risks. Under the Act, the obligation is placed absolutely and squarely on users of motor vehicles to take out such policies of insurance. As we have said earlier, in a prosecution under s 3(1) of the Act, the fact that there was in force at the material time in relation to the use of the motor vehicle a policy of insurance as complies with the Act is one fully within the knowledge of the user of a motor vehicle, and he can with ease prove the existence of such policy simply by producing it. On the other hand, it would be impossible or disproportionately difficult for the prosecution to prove that he did not have in force at the material time such policy of insurance. We are therefore of the opinion that the terms of s 3(1) shifts the burden to the user of a motor vehicle to show that there is in force in relation to the use thereof such policy of insurance. What shifts is the onus: it is for the accused to prove that he has the policy of insurance at the material time. It is a legal burden and not an evidential burden, and there is no necessity for the prosecution to adduce any prima facie evidence of the absence or lack of the requisite policy of insurance: 
 R v Edwards 
.
We now turn to s 16 of the Act which was referred to in the court below. The learned judicial commissioner appeared to take the view that the prosecution had not made out a prima facie case because the officer involved in the investigation did not ask the respondent to produce the certificate of insurance and he (the respondent) must be asked to produce the certificate under s 16(1). With respect, we are unable to agree with this view. Section 16(1) creates a separate and independent offence. It provides (in so far as material): 
 
Any person driving a motor vehicle on a road shall on being so required by a police officer give his name and address and the name and address of the owner of the motor vehicle and produce his certificate and if he fails to do so he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $500 and in the case of a second or subsequent offence to a fine not exceeding $1,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months:
 
 
 
Provided that ...
A person may commit an offence under s 16(1) without committing one under s 3(1). The requirement by a police officer for the person driving the car to produce, and the failure of the person (so required) to produce, the certificate of insurance (issued under s 4(5) of the Act) are the essential elements which the prosecution must prove in order to sustain a charge under s 16(1). These, however, are not the essential elements of the charge under s 3(1). A person may have in relation to the use of a motor vehicle the requisite policy of insurance against third-party risks and may nonetheless commit an offence under s 16(1). A failure to produce the certificate within the prescribed time (after having been required to do so) is an offence, irrespective of whether the motor vehicle in relation to its use is insured against third-party risks in compliance with the Act.
In our judgment, the answer to the question reserved to this court is as follows. In a prosecution of an offence under s 3(1) of the Act there is no necessity for the prosecution to prove a prima facie case against the accused by adducing some evidence that there was not in force at the material time in relation to the use of the motor vehicle in question a policy of insurance against Third-Party risks as complies with the Act and it is sufficient for the prosecution to prove that the accused has used or caused or permitted to be used the motor vehicle and the prosecution may leave it to the accused to prove that there was in force such policy of insurance.
Having dealt with the question, we would make two observations. First, as Lord Goddard CJ said in 
 John v Humphreys 
 2 with reference to a slightly different charge before him, in theory the police can summon and charge anyone found driving a car in the street for committing an offence under s 3(1) of the Act and leave it to him to prove that he has the requisite policy of insurance. But, it is not contemplated that the police would act so irresponsibly and irrationally. Before bringing such a charge, one would of course expect the police to make the necessary investigation, such as making enquiry with the driver whether there is any policy of insurance in force in relation to the use of the car he is driving at the time and, if there is, asking him to give particulars of such policy and the production of such policy or the insurance certificate. In this case, however, the police, and in particular the investigator in ROV, did not make any enquiry at all before bringing the second charge against the respondent. An investigation was conducted only in respect of the first charge, ie the absence of the road licence for the use of the vehicle, and having made such investigation the police brought the two charges against the respondent. In respect of the first charge, there was clearly evidence that there was no licence issued at the time the vehicle was used but in respect of the second charge, the police did not make any enquiry and merely assumed that the respondent at the time did not have in relation to the use of the vehicle a policy of insurance in respect of Third-Party risks. That assumption could or might well be incorrect, for if they had made the inquiry with the respondent, he might well have produced evidence of such insurance policy.
This leads us to our next observation. A policy of insurance required under the Act is one in relation to the use of a motor vehicle, ie the policy insures the driver in respect of any liability which may be incurred by him for death or bodily injury to other person caused by or arising out of the use of a motor vehicle. It is not really an insurance of the motor vehicle as such. It is common knowledge - and we hope we are not making an assumption of such common knowledge - that where a person owns a car and has taken out an insurance policy against third-party risks as complies with the Act, such policy normally - indeed we would say invariably - insures him in respect of liability for death or bodily injury caused by his use of that motor vehicle and also by his use of a motor vehicle not belonging to him provided that such motor vehicle is not hired to him or his employer or partner. A specimen of such indemnity provision in a policy of insurance against third-party risks is as follows: 
 
1 
 Indemnity to the insured
 
 
 
The company will indemnify the insured against all sums including claimant`s costs and expenses which the insured shall become legally liable to pay in respect of
 
 
 
 
(a) death of or bodily injury to any person an unlimited amount in respect of any one claim or series of claims arising out of one event 
 
(b) damage to property an unlimited amount in respect of any one claim or series of claims arising out of one event where such death or injury or damage arises out of an accident caused by or arising out of 
 
(i) the use of the motor vehicle 
 
(ii) the driving by the insured of any private motor car other than those hired (under a hire purchase agreement or otherwise) to him or his employer or his partner.
  
 
 
Most, if not all, policies of insurance against third-party risks issued by insurers in Singapore do have a provision similar to or identical with this specimen.
Reverting to the facts in this case, we note that the respondent in evidence said he had his own car, and if he had his own car he would have taken out, and indeed he should have taken out, a policy of insurance to cover third-party risks in relation to the use of that car, and that policy (if he had taken out) would, as in a normal case, cover his use of that car and also a car not belonging to him provided that the latter car was not hired to him or his employer or partner. In other words, that policy, if he had taken out, would cover the use of the vehicle in question. This point was not addressed by counsel for the respondent at the trial before the learned magistrate, and appeared to have escaped her attention.
Having regard to these matters, it would be unfair and unjust to the respondent if we exercise our power under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and convict him on the second charge and impose the severe punishment under s 3(2) of the Act. We therefore refrain from so doing. In any case, the learned deputy public prosecutor has indicated to us that he is not pressing for a reversal of the order of acquittal made by the learned magistrate but is seeking an answer to the question which we have now given.

This is an appeal against the decision of S Rajendran J convicting the appellant of importing not less than 4,320g of diamorphine into Singapore under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`the Act`). After hearing arguments, we dismissed the appeal and indicated that we would give our reasons later, which we now do.
 The facts
The appellant arrived at Changi International Airport on 27 September 1991 on board 
 Tradewinds 
 flight MI 851 from Phuket. It was not disputed that the appellant checked a suitcase with a combination lock into the plane direct to Athens via Swissair flight SR 183 from Singapore. It was also not disputed that the appellant was coming to Singapore to catch the same Swissair flight SR 183 to Athens which was scheduled to leave Singapore at 9.05pm that evening. The suitcase was retrieved by narcotics officers from the baggage area. Upon removing the interior cloth lining of one side of the suitcase, Narcotics Officer Seah Shyr Dong (`NO Seah`) found another shell implanted on to the original shell. After removing this shell, NO Seah found a light brown plastic bag containing a whitish substance. Another implanted shell was also discovered on the other side of the suitcase. NO Seah found another similar plastic bag containing a whitish substance under this shell. Dr Lee Tong Kooi, principal scientific officer from the department of scientific services, subsequently analyzed the two bags containing the whitish substance and certified that they contained in total not less than 4,320g of diamorphine.
The appellant was charged under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) for importing two packets of substance containing not less than 4,320g of diamorphine into Singapore. The appellant`s defence at the trial was that he did not know that diamorphine was concealed in the suitcase. He claimed that he was an innocent custodian of the suitcase and that he was carrying the bag from Bangkok to Athens as a favour for one John U Obiefuna (`Obiefuna`) who said it contained children`s clothes and clothes for his wife. The learned trial judge rejected the appellant`s defence that he did not know that diamorphine was concealed in the suitcase. Accordingly, he convicted the appellant. Against the conviction, this appeal was brought.
 Motion to admit additional evidence
Together with the appeal, the appellant filed a criminal motion to adduce additional evidence in the form of four business cards, a jeweller`s brochure, three certificates of guarantees from jewellers, a Nigerian residence permit, the certificate of incorporation and the memorandum and articles of association of the company set up by the appellant`s wife in Nigeria.
The relevant principles governing the grant of leave to adduce additional evidence were set out very recently in 
 Juma`at bin Samad v PP 
 1 at p 343(E-I): 
 
The question is whether the above evidence is `necessary`. Certain principles are to be applied in determining this question and these were considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Rajendra Prasad v PP
. The court held that in applying s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (`SCJA`), which is materially similar to s 257(1) of the CPC, the principle encapsulated in the following statement from Denning LJ`s judgment in 
 Ladd v Marshall
 should be observed:
 
 
 
`In order to justify the reception of fresh evidence for a new trial, three conditions must be fulfilled: first it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; second, the evidence must be such that if given it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; third, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed or in other words, it must be apparently credible, although it need not be incontrovertible.`
 
 
 
These three conditions - non-availability, relevance and reliability - are of course, similar to those enunciated by Lord Parker CJ in 
 R v Parks
 and which have been time and again affirmed in Singapore and Malaysia courts: 
 Mohamed bin Jamal v PP
, 
 Lo Fat Thjan v PP
, 
 Khamis v PP
, 
 Che Din bin Ahmad v PP
, 
 Dol bin Lasim v PP
.
 
 
 
In short, the circumstances in which an application to introduce fresh evidence will be allowed are extremely limited.
The appellant`s reason for adducing additional evidence at this stage of the proceedings was that these documents were retained by the prison authorities despite his instructions that they be handed to his lawyer. Without expressing any opinion as regards the first condition of `non-availability`, we are of the view that the second and third conditions of `relevance` and `reliability` have not been met. Counsel for the appellant conceded that the additional evidence sought to be admitted had no bearing on the question of guilt or innocence of the appellant. The additional evidence was instead adduced for the rather tenuous reason that, had they been available at the trial, the trial judge`s impression of the appellant would have been different. The test of relevance is more stringent than that. We reiterate that the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case. As for the condition of `reliability`, we note that one of the certificates of guarantee was actually made out to `Mrs E Van Damme` and more significantly, was dated `26 September 1991`. Nowhere in the appellant`s testimony regarding his movements on 26 September 1991 did he mention visiting the jewellers. As for the business cards, there was absolutely no evidence as to when they might have been procured by the appellant. Accordingly, we found that there was no merit in the application and we dismissed the motion.
 Grounds of appeal
Before this court, counsel for the appellant raised two grounds of appeal. First, that the presumptions raised by s 18 of the Act did not apply as the appellant did not have in his possession or custody or under his control the suitcase containing the controlled drug. Secondly, that the trial judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the appellant had not, on a balance of probabilities, proved that he did not know that there was a controlled drug concealed in the suitcase.
On the first ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant referred to the testimony of Punniyamoorthy s/o Muthusamy, a baggage supervisor with Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS), that luggage in the in-flight spur area cannot ordinarily be retrieved by the passenger except with permission from the Lost and Found staff. This, it was argued, meant that the appellant did not have `in his possession, control or under his custody` the suitcase containing the controlled drug within s 18(1) so as to trigger the operation of the presumptions. We did not agree with the technical position taken by counsel for the appellant, a position which counsel admitted was not supported by any authority. The language used in the section clearly draws a distinction between `possession` in s 18(1) and `physical possession` in s 18(3). We agree that whilst the appellant may not have had physical possession or physical control of the suitcase, such possession and control having been ceded to SATS for the purposes of moving and checking the luggage, the appellant had possession of the suitcase. He had the baggage tag to the suitcase and could obtain access to it, albeit only with permission from the Lost and Found staff. Counsel for the prosecution raised the interesting point that the appellant had with him the baggage tag to the suitcase and the baggage tag constituted `any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug` so as to satisfy s 18(1)(d). We would prefer to base our decision, however, on s 18(1)(a), that is, that the appellant was proved to have had in his possession the suitcase containing the controlled drug.
Still on the first ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted that a person cannot be in possession of something if he did not know or have knowledge of its contents. This argument clearly involves a misreading of s 18. `Possession` and `knowledge` are distinct and dealt with separately under s 18(1) and s 18(2) respectively. The initial onus was on the prosecution to prove possession of anything containing a controlled drug (in this case, the suitcase), after which the appellant was presumed (i) to have the drug in his possession and (ii) to know the nature of the controlled drug. The onus was then on the appellant to rebut the two presumptions on a balance of probabilities and this argument should rightly have been dealt with under the second ground of appeal to which we now turn.
By s 18 of the Act, rebuttable presumptions arose that the appellant had the drug in his possession and that he knew the nature of the drug he was carrying. Once the presumptions arose, the onus of discharging them was on the appellant. Having heard the appellant`s defence, the learned trial judge was satisfied that he had not discharged this onus. On reviewing the record we are of the view that the trial judge`s finding was clearly ineluctable.
 Appellant`s defence
The appellant`s evidence was as follows. He worked as project director for a company set up in Nigeria by his wife. He first came to Singapore in July 1991 to look for suppliers of computers and computer software for his wife`s company. On or about 20 July 1991, the appellant met Obiefuna at the lobby of the Imperial Hotel during the hotel`s happy hour. The two of them engaged in what the appellant called a `social conversation`. The appellant could not remember whether he told Obiefuna that he was in the computer business, neither could he recall whether Obiefuna told him precisely what he was doing. Obiefuna did, however, give him the name of a hotel (Lloyds Inn) with lower room rates and after that he checked into this hotel. The appellant then left Singapore for Phuket and eventually returned to Holland.
The appellant returned to Singapore on 21 August 1991 and stayed at Lloyds Inn. He met up with Obiefuna on at least two occasions. Obiefuna also introduced the appellant to another Nigerian, Alfonso. The appellant, however, never engaged in any conversation with the latter. The appellant left for Phuket on 27 August 1991 and his itinerary was as follows: 
 
 
(27) August 1991: Singapore to Phuket 
 
(27) August 1991: Phuket to Bangkok 
 
(29) August 1991: Bangkok to Phuket 
 
(30) August 1991: Phuket to Singapore (transit) 
 
(30) August 1991: Singapore to Vienna and back to Holland
  
 
 
The appellant came to Singapore for the third time on 16 September 1991. His evidence was that he had an appointment with one Cyril Rodrigues (`Rodrigues`), alleged to be the manager of a computer company in Singapore. The appointment never materialized as Rodrigues was supposed to be busy. The appellant did, however, meet Obiefuna who actually contacted the appellant at Lloyds Inn where he was staying. Apparently, the appellant had told Obiefuna that he was setting up a branch of his wife`s Nigerian company in Holland and Obiefuna was very interested in the venture; in particular he wanted to be on the board of directors. Obiefuna even offered US$20,000 to be a director and US$5,000 as contribution for expenses to be incurred in setting up a company in Holland. The appellant also informed Obiefuna that his daughter in Holland was about to get married and that he was going to Bangkok to buy materials for her wedding dress. Obiefuna then said he had a suitcase in Bangkok with clothes for his wife and children and requested the appellant to carry it for him to Athens. Obiefuna explained to the appellant that he had no time and opportunity to go to Bangkok. The appellant eventually agreed to carry the suitcase because of their `social meetings and also discussions of setting up the new company` and their `good understanding`. Obiefuna told the appellant to collect the suitcase in Bangkok from Alfonso who would then inform the appellant as to whom to pass the suitcase to in Athens. The appellant left for Phuket on 22 September 1991 and arrived in Bangkok on 23 September 1991.
The appellant said that in Bangkok he did his shopping for wedding dress materials and it was only on 25 September 1991 after several tries that he managed to contact Alfonso on the telephone. They arranged to meet at Juldin Towers on 26 September 1991. At the meeting Alfonso said he did not have the suitcase as he `did not meet the people who were supposed to bring it to his own apartment`. Alfonso then sent the appellant to another place, Room 203, Royal Garden Hotel, to collect the suitcase. When the appellant finally managed to get through to the occupant of Room 203, this was what the appellant said transpired: 
 
So I came up to the room. I knocked, the door opened. One person who never identified himself to me, he was already prepared. I did not even enter the room because he said he would collect the suitcase. So he brought a suitcase and dropped it in front of the door, outside in the corridor. Then I told him that I was in a hurry because I was supposed to be already, by now, on my way to the airport. I asked him if he could tell me the lock number so I could open it. He told me it was `000`.
 
 
 
The appellant`s evidence was that he never carried or lifted the suitcase at all. The suitcase was either on the floor, on some stand or it was carried by taxi drivers or hotel staff or airport staff for him. The appellant did however open the suitcase to discover it was empty. He tried contacting Room 203 and Obiefuna but got no reply from either. He then put some of his own clothes into the suitcase. On the same day, 26 September 1991, the appellant left Bangkok for Phuket. On 27 September 1991, he took 
 Tradewinds 
 flight MI 851 to Singapore, in transit, for flights to Zurich and Athens and finally, Holland.
 Analysis and findings
The appellant`s story is incredible to say the least. For some one who testified that he had always declined to carry `packets` for Nigerians, the appellant was extremely willing on this occasion to do so. His explanation that Obiefuna was different as they had social conversations and business discussions is difficult to believe. From his evidence, he hardly knew Obiefuna and he was not really interested in Obiefuna`s participation in the proposed branch company. Despite this the appellant (i) informed Obiefuna, when the latter contacted him in Holland, that he was returning to Singapore on 16 September 1991 and (ii) went to see Obiefuna at Oxley Garden after arriving in Singapore on 16 September 1991.
The appellant also received about US$4,300 from Obiefuna. He explained that this was Obiefuna`s contribution towards the expenses of setting up the branch company in Holland. If one were to accept the appellant`s explanation, the payment of the not inconsiderable sum of money would have been made in very unlikely circumstances. As the learned trial judge pointed out, there had been no agreement on the terms of Obiefuna`s participation in the proposed branch company. The appellant himself had given indications that his wife was not keen on outside participation and Obiefuna himself was not keen on working with a woman. We were totally unable to accept the appellant`s explanation for this and were of the view that there must have been other reasons for the payment.
The appellant agreed to deliver the suitcase to Athens even though he had no intention of going there. The appellant`s evidence on this point was extremely difficult to accept. He returned to Singapore on 16 September 1991 with a return ticket to Nigeria. Yet on 20 September 1991, after receiving the US$4,300, he booked himself two air tickets. First, a ticket to Phuket and secondly, a ticket from Singapore direct to Zurich and then to Athens. It was incredible that the appellant should take such a circuitous route back to Holland even if he was doing Obiefuna a favour. Indeed the appellant expected Obiefuna to contribute half the fare to Athens because he was carrying the suitcase.
The appellant`s efforts in procuring the suitcase in Bangkok was amazing considering the runaround he was made to endure. Business meetings and social conversations with Obiefuna notwithstanding, the appellant surely expended more energy than what any ordinary person would have done for what was supposed to be only a suitcase full of children`s clothes. The appellant`s determination to get hold of the suitcase is all the stranger when he was supposed to be in such a hurry and had to check out of his hotel room to catch a flight to Phuket. The trial judge said that the trouble which the appellant went through in Bangkok just to get the suitcase (which eventually turned out to be empty) suggested that the appellant was doing more than a favour for Obiefuna. This was reinforced by the appellant`s unquestioning willingness to carry out Obiefuna`s instructions despite being, according to the appellant, in the dark as to whom to actually hand the suitcase to in Athens.
The appellant`s testimony that he never carried or lifted the suitcase borders on the ludicrous. He maintained this stand despite clear evidence that he travelled with the suitcase from Bangkok to Phuket and then to Singapore. In our view the appellant took this position to explain why he never found that an empty suitcase could weigh a hefty 4.3kg, at the minimum. In any event, the weight of the suitcase when the appellant opened it in Bangkok would surely have put him on notice that something was amiss.
The appellant said he only had one thought when he discovered that the suitcase was empty: that he had been given the wrong suitcase. The appellant`s explanation that he thought he could then use the empty suitcase for himself was rightly rejected by the learned trial judge. It would be inconceivable, if his explanation was accepted, for the appellant then to check in the suitcase direct to Athens since he never planned to go there save at Obiefuna`s behest. The learned trial judge aptly said as follows: 
 
The inference I drew from the fact that you checked an empty bag to Athens and were yourself proceeding to Athens is that you intended to keep your bargain with Obiefuna and intended to deliver the bag in Athens even though it was empty.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant referred the court to 
 Sarkar on Evidence 
 (14th Ed, 1993) and submitted that the onus of proving guilt beyond reasonable doubt was always on the prosecution. Suspicion, it was argued, cannot take the place of legal proof. This argument was premised on a misunderstanding of s 18 of the Act. It is accepted that the onus is always on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt but, in the context of the Act, the law has provided the prosecution with presumptions and the court must have regard to them. Once the presumptions were triggered in this case the onus was on the accused to discharge the presumptions. It would then be up to the court to decide whether or not to believe him; to assess his credibility and veracity; to observe his demeanour; to listen to what he had to say; to go through the evidence and determine whether his story was consistent; and finally to make a judicial decision. By his counsel`s own concession, the appellant`s conduct was suspect and indeed that he might have suspected that something was amiss. Given this scenario, the appellant`s task of rebutting the presumptions on a balance of probabilities must surely have been rendered extremely difficult from the outset. We are therefore of the view that it was impossible to fault the trial judge`s decision. Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal.

This appeal first came for hearing before the Court of Appeal on 11 October 1993. At the hearing, counsel for the appellant applied to adjourn the matter to the next available sitting of the Court of Appeal to enable him to file a supplementary petition to raise the issue of whether the appellant`s trial for the capital offence of drug trafficking before a single judge of the High Court pursuant to recent amendments to the Criminal Procedure Code (`CPC`) was a nullity. The court granted leave to file a supplementary petition and the matter was accordingly adjourned. The question of the validity of the trial was then argued before us on 8 November 1993. After hearing counsel for the appellant, we dismissed the appeal without calling on the deputy public prosecutor to reply. We set out herein our reasons for the dismissal.
In November 1989, during an undercover operation mounted by the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`), the appellant agreed and arranged to sell five pounds of heroin to one Narcotics Officer Lee Kiong Lock (`NO Lee`). The sale price was agreed at $7,000 a pound and the transaction was agreed to take place on 24 November 1989 at the Plaza Hotel. NO Lee testified that on 24 November 1989, he met the appellant and went with him to the Cafe Plaza at the Plaza Hotel to await delivery of the drugs. At about 3.45pm, the appellant left their table and came back shortly afterwards with a black bag. NO Lee inspected the contents of the bag and found two loose packages among some clothing and a pink plastic bag containing three additional packages. NO Lee testified that he attempted to check the contents of one of the loose packages but had difficulty removing the packaging. The appellant helped him and tore open one corner of the packaging using a fork. Having satisfied himself that the package contained heroin, NO Lee then proceeded with the next stage of the operation, namely, the arrangements for payment. It was agreed that NO Lee would take the appellant to an undisclosed location to make the payment and upon receipt of the $35,000 for the transaction, the appellant would send a coded message by pager to one Lai Yoke Keong, a friend of the appellant, who was seated at another table in the same Cafe Plaza with one Gan Ching Huat, one Ng Hock Chuan and one Ey Hock Chin who was actually a narcotics officer (`NO Ey`). Upon receipt of the coded message, Lai Yoke Keong would transfer the black bag containing the drugs to NO Ey, thereby concluding the transaction. Shortly after these arrangements were made, the appellant was arrested by NO Lee and other CNB officers outside Plaza Hotel. Lai Yoke Keong, Ng Hock Chuan and Gan Ching Huat were also arrested soon thereafter. A black bag containing five packages; three of which were in a pink plastic bag and two were loose packages, one of which was torn at one corner; was recovered from the table occupied by Lai Yoke Keong, Ng Hock Chuan and Gan Ching Huat. A subsequent analysis of these five packages showed that they contained a total of 395g of diamorphine.
On 25 November 1989, the appellant was charged in the subordinate courts with trafficking 395g of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) and punishable with death under s 33 of the same Act. Lai Yoke Keong, Ng Hock Chuan and Gan Ching Huat were charged with abetment in the said trafficking. The preliminary inquiry commenced on 25 September 1990. At the end of the preliminary inquiry, the prosecution dropped the abetment charges against Lai Yoke Keong and proceeded with a lesser charge of possession of 395g of diamorphine under s 8 (a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. Lai Yoke Keong was charged before a district court on 14 September 1991. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to four years` imprisonment which was backdated to the date of his arrest on 24 November 1989. On 14 September 1991, the appellant, Ng Hock Chuan and Gan Ching Huat were committed to stand trial in the High Court. Before the trial commenced, the prosecution opted not to proceed against Ng Hock Chuan as there was clear evidence that on 24 November 1989 he was merely an innocent companion of Gan Ching Huat on a social visit to Singapore. The appellant and Gan Ching Huat were tried before Justice Lai Kew Chai on 11 January 1993. At the conclusion of the trial on 15 February 1993, Lai Kew Chai J acquitted Gan Ching Huat of the capital offence of abetting the appellant in the trafficking but found the appellant guilty as charged and sentenced him to death.
Before us, it was contended by counsel for the appellant that the appellant`s trial for a capital offence before a single judge of the High Court was a nullity. This ground of appeal was stated in the following terms in the supplementary petition of appeal: 
 
That the petitioner`s trial before the High Court which was heard and determined by a single judge of the High Court was a nullity in that your petitioner, who was charged in court on 25 November 1989 for the capital offence of trafficking in heroin, was deprived of a substantive right in law, which accrued from the time he was first charged in court, to have the trial heard and determined by two judges of the High Court in accordance with s 194 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68).
 
 
 
This was the only ground of appeal which was taken up before us. The other grounds of appeal raised in the original petition were not pursued by counsel for the appellant.
At the time when the appellant was first charged in court on 25 November 1989 and at the time he was committed to stand trial in the High Court on 14 September 1991, s 194 of the CPC provided for accused persons charged with capital offences to be tried before two judges of the High Court, whose verdict had to be unanimous for the accused person to be convicted. The provisions of s 194 of the CPC which were then in force provided as follows: 
 
 
(1) In all cases where the accused is charged with an offence in respect of which punishment of death is authorised by law, the accused shall be tried by a court consisting of two Judges of the High Court, one of whom shall be the presiding Judge. 
 
(2) The decision of the court as to the guilt of the accused in respect of such a charge shall be arrived at unanimously and where the decision is that the accused is guilty, judgment shall be entered accordingly and the court shall proceed to pass sentence on the convicted person according to law. 
 
(3) Where the two Judges fail to reach a unanimous decision as to the guilt of an accused charged with an offence in respect of which punishment of death is authorised by law, he shall not be convicted of that offence but may, if the two Judges agree, be convicted of any lesser offence of which he could have been charged based on the same facts: 
 
Provided that where the failure to reach a unanimous decision as to the guilt of the accused rests on the ground that one of the two Judges has acquitted him by reason of section 314, then the accused shall not be convicted of the offence with which he has been charged but shall be dealt with in accordance with section 315. 
 
(4) Except as provided in this section, upon all questions relating to procedure and the admission or rejection of evidence in the course of a trial under this section the presiding Judge shall have a casting vote in the event of disagreement between the two Judges.
  
 
 
However, before the appellant`s trial on 11 January 1993, Parliament passed Act No 13 of 1992, the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1992 (`CPC (Amendment) Act 1992`), which came into operation on 18 April 1992. That Act abolished trials of capital offences before two judges of the High Court and provided for such trials to be conducted before a single judge of the High Court. The CPC (Amendment) Act 1992 reads as follows: 
 
An Act to amend the Criminal Procedure Code (Chapter 68 of the 1985 Revised Edition).
 
 
 
Be it enacted by the President with the advice and consent of the Parliament of Singapore, as follows:
 
 
 
 
(1) This Act may be cited as the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act 1992 and shall come into operation on such date as the Minister may, by notification in the 
 Gazette 
, appoint. 
 
(2) Section 194 of the Criminal Procedure Code is repealed and the following section substituted therefor: 
 
(194) Every trial before the High Court under this Chapter shall be heard and disposed of before a single Judge of the High Court. 
 
(3) Notwithstanding section 2 of this Act, section 194 of the Criminal Procedure Code which was in force immediately before the date of commencement of this Act shall continue to apply to any trial before a court comprising of two Judges of the High Court which has commenced before that date.
  
 
 
On 16 April 1992 the Criminal Procedure Code (Amendment) Act (Commencement) Notification 1992 was published in the Gazette. By it the Minister gave notice that the CPC (Amendment) Act 1992 would come into operation on 18 April 1992.
Counsel for the appellant drew our attention to s 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1) and contended that the CPC (Amendment) Act 1992 ought not to have been applied retrospectively to the appellant, who had been charged and committed to stand trial before 18 April 1992. Section 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act provides as follows: 
 
Where a written law repeals in whole or in part any other written law, then, unless the contrary intention appears, the repeal shall not affect any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired, accrued or incurred under any written law so repealed.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant had a right, which was a substantive right, to be tried before two judges of the High Court and this right accrued to him from the time he was first charged in court, ie 25 November 1989, or, at the very latest, when he was committed to stand trial in the High Court, ie 14 September 1991. For reasons which will become clear shortly, we are of the view that we need not decide whether the right to be tried before two judges of the High Court was a substantive as opposed to a procedural right and, if it was a substantive right, when the substantive right accrued to the appellant.
We are of the opinion that s 16(1)(c) of the Interpretation Act does not assist the appellant in our case. This is a provision which is declaratory of the common law rule of construction that all statutes, other than those which are merely declaratory, or which relate only to matters of procedure or of evidence, are prima facie prospective, and retrospective effect is not to be given to them 
 unless, by express words or by necessary implication, it appears that this was the intention of the legisla 
 ture 
 : 4 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4th Ed), para 922.
The rule contained in s 16(1)(c) against construing a statute retrospectively to affect vested rights is expressly subject to a contrary intention in the CPC (Amendment) Act 1992. Hence, even if the appellant had a substantive right to be tried before two judges of the High Court and this right accrued to him before 18 April 1992, it was perfectly within the power of Parliament to abolish such a substantive right by express words or by necessary implication, if such was the intention of Parliament. Thus, the issue we ought to concern ourselves with is whether, in passing the CPC (Amendment) Act 1992, Parliament manifested the intention, either by express words or by necessary implication, that the amendment would apply to accused persons who, although charged and committed to stand trial before 18 April 1992, were tried after that date. We are of the view that such an intention is clearly manifested in the transitional provision contained in s 3 of the CPC (Amendment) Act 1992.
Section 3 of the CPC (Amendment) Act 1992 provides that notwithstanding the abolishment of trials of capital offences before two judges of the High Court, `section 194 of the Criminal Procedure Code which was in force immediately before the date of commencement of this Act shall continue to apply to any trial before a court comprising of two judges of the High Court 
 which has commenced before that date` 
 . The necessary implication of s 3 is that trials of capital offences which have not commenced before 18 April 1992 are to take place before a single judge of the High Court. We are unable to see how such an implication can be avoided on the wording of s 3. The whole tenor of s 3 suggests that Parliament intended to override any substantive right that accused persons may have had to be tried before two judges of the High Court if their trials had not commenced before 18 April 1992. That being so, unless the appellant`s trial commenced before 18 April 1992, he would no longer have the right to be tried before two judges of the High Court.
Counsel for the appellant then submitted that a trial can be said to have properly commenced when an accused person is charged and committed to stand trial in the High Court. We disagree. Section 187 of the CPC, the marginal note of which reads `Commencement of trial`, provides: 
 
Chapter XXI - Trials Before High Court 
(187) (1) When the court is ready to commence the trial, the accused shall appear or be brought before it and the charge shall be read and explained to him and he shall be asked whether he is guilty of the offence charged or claims to be tried. 
(2) If the accused pleads guilty the plea shall be recorded, and he may be convicted on it. 
(3) If the accused refuses to plead or does not plead, or if he claims to be tried, the court shall - 
(a) proceed to try the case; or 
(b) if the accused was committed for trial under section 139, order him to be brought before an examining Magistrate for a preliminary inquiry.
 
 
 
The application of the Indian equivalent of the predecessor of s 187 in connection with the question of when a trial can be said to have commenced was considered in the Indian High Court decision of 
 Chari v The State 
. In that case, the accused were charged and committed to stand trial on 1 March 1952. The relevant provisions of the Indian Code of Criminal Procedure then in force provided for the trial to be before a court of sessions with the aid of a jury. However, before the trial, Act No 46 of 1952, the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, was passed and came into force on 28 July 1952. Under that Act, the forum for the trial of certain offences, including the offences for which the accused were charged, was altered so as to make such offences triable by a special judge only, appointed by the state governor. Notwithstanding this legislative amendment, the trial of the accused on 4 May 1953 took place before a sessions judge with the aid of a jury. On appeal, counsel for the accused contended for the first time that Act 46 of 1952 having been passed and a special judge appointed thereunder, the trial of the accused in a sessions court with a jury was a nullity. This argument was not sustained. It was held that where proceedings had begun before a tribunal, there was a vested right created in favour of the accused to continue the proceedings in accordance with the procedure in force at the commencement of the trial.
In the course of his judgment, Chowdhry J made the following observations at pp 153-154 on the issue of when a trial can be said to have commenced: 
 
The crucial question therefore is whether the trial of the appellants had already commenced before a sessions judge. Before taking up that question of fact, I would like to express, respectfully and in all humility, my disagreement with the view taken in some cases, eg in the 
 State v PK Swamy
, AIR 1953 Mad 451 (G), that `the case can be said to have well commenced when the order of commitment is made.` The Code of Criminal Procedure prescribed in ss 190 to 199B certain conditions requisite for initiation of various proceedings. Such a pre-requisite for a magistrate taking cognizance of an offence is, under s 190, receipt of a complaint or a police report or information from any person other than a police officer or the magistrate`s own knowledge or suspicion. Likewise, the pre-requisite for a court of session taking cognizance of an offence as a court of original jurisdiction is, under s 193, the committal of the accused to that court by a magistrate duly empowered in that behalf.
 
 
 
That being so, to say that a trial in the court of session commences when the order of commitment is made is to confuse the cause with the effect. An order of commitment passed by the inquiring magistrate under s 213 of the Code can no more be tantamount to commencement of proceedings before a court of session than can the filing of complaint or the making of a report by a police officer or the furnishing of information by a person other than a police officer or the knowledge or suspicion of the magistrate himself under s 190 be tantamount to commencement of trial before the magistrate.
The thing to see, therefore, in order to find out whether the trial of the appellants had already commenced in a court of session before the coming into force of the said Act and the appointment of a special judge thereunder is not if an order of commitment had already been made but if anything had been done which could legally be interpreted as amounting to a commencement of trial. Chapter XXIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with trials before High Courts and courts of sessions and it is sub-divided into many parts. One such part is headed Commencement of Proceedings and comprises three sections, 271, 272 and 273. Of these only the first two sections apply to trials before a court of session, the last one being confined in its application to trials before the High Court. And in the first two sections also, sub-s (1) of s 271 is the only provision dealing specifically with the subject of commencement of trial, sub-s (2) of that section and s 272 dealing with what is to be done if the accused pleads guilty or if he refuses to or does not plead or if he claims to be tried. Strictly speaking, therefore, the provisions of sub-s (1) of s 271 are the only relevant provisions to be looked into in order to find out whether a particular trial had commenced. The subsection runs as follows: 
 
`271 Commencement of trial 
(1) When the Court is ready to commence the trial, the accused shall appear or be brought before it, and the charge shall be read out in Court and explained to him, and he shall be asked whether he is guilty of the offence charged, or claims to be tried.`
 
 
 
Analyzed, the subsection is composed of the following ingredients: (1) the court being ready to commence the trial, (2) the accused appearing or being brought before it, (3) the charge being read out in court and explained to the accused, and (4) the accused being asked whether he is guilty of the offence charged, or claims to be tried.
 
 
 
Chowdhry J then applied the above analysis to the facts of the case before him: 
 
The above examination of the record, however, shows that certain important proceedings had already been had in the sessions court prior to the appointment of the special judge.
 
 
 
Not only was the sessions court ready to commence the trial but the accused had appeared before it and witnesses for the prosecution and defence, the latter at the instance of the accused themselves, and jurors had been summoned. Of the aforementioned ingredients of s 271 of the Code the first two therefore stood satisfied and, although there had yet been no compliance with the remaining two ingredients, a deep penetration into the heart of the trial, as it were, had been made by defence witnesses having been summoned at the instance of the accused, as provided by s 289 of the Code.
The decision of Chowdhry J was approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Singapore in 
 Teo Cheng Leong v PP 
. The court indicated its preference for the decision of Chowdhry J in 
 Chari v The State 
 over the decision of Somasundaram J in 
 State v PK Swamy & Anor 
 3 in which it was held that a case can be said to have commenced when the order of committal is made. In 
 Teo Cheng Leong 
, the appellant had been arrested and charged in the magistrate`s court with using a firearm. Following the preliminary inquiry he was committed for trial in the High Court. Before the dates fixed for the trial, amending legislation came into operation, which repealed the previous law providing for trials with a jury and provided, instead, for trials before two judges of the High Court. On his conviction by a two-judge court, he appealed. One of his grounds was that he already had an acquired right to be tried by a jury at the time when the amending legislation came into operation. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that in enacting the amending legislation, the legislature had clearly manifested its intention to take away any right which the appellant had acquired to a trial by jury when the repealing enactment came into operation. In delivering judgment Wee Chong Jin CJ said, at p 282: 
 
It is to be observed that Chapter XXIII of the Code of Criminal Procedure of India is in all respects identical with Chapter XXI of our Criminal Procedure Code before its repeal by the 1969 amending Act, except for those sections in the Indian Code which deal with the procedure where the trial is before a sessions court and which refer to assessors. In particular, the Indian ss 271 and 272 are identical with our former ss 181 and 182.
 
 
 
With respect, we prefer the views expressed by Chowdhry J to those of Somasundaram J and in our case, the thing to see, in order to find out whether the trial of the appellant had already commenced in the High Court before the coming into force of the 1969 amending Act, is not if an order of committal had already been made but if anything had been done under the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Code which could legally be interpreted as amounting to a commencement of trial. The facts which are material to be considered have already been set out earlier. They show that the first appearance by the appellant before the High Court was on 17 February 1970 and never before.
It is also to be observed that the Indian Code has no provisions similar to our Chapter XXXIV consisting of ss 391 to 404 of the CPC. In our opinion the provisions of the whole of Chapter XXXIV support our view that the commencement of the proceedings against the appellant before the High Court had not yet taken place before the coming into force of the 1969 amending Act and that the High Court, in so far as criminal proceedings are concerned, is not seised of a case until the accused is brought before it and charged before it.
It is to be noted that ss 181 and 182 of the CPC referred to above are the predecessor sections of the present s 187.
We are in agreement with the conclusion of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Teo Cheng Leong 
 .2 A trial does not commence at the time an accused person is charged and committed to stand trial. Rather, it commences when the provisions of s 187 of the CPC are satisfied. In our case, the provisions of s 187 were not satisfied until the time when the appellant was brought before Lai Kew Chai J on 11 January 1993. It was then that the charge was read and explained to the appellant and he was asked whether he was guilty or claimed to be tried. The appellant claimed trial and the court proceeded to try the case pursuant to s 187(3). Hence, the appellant`s trial did not commence until 11 January 1993. As such, his trial was governed by the new provisions introduced by the CPC (Amendment) Act 1992 and not the provisions in force before 18 April 1992. The appellant was thus properly tried before a single judge of the High Court and his trial was not a nullity.
For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal.

s 18 Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185)
 
(delivering the grounds of judgment of the court): This was an appeal against conviction by the High Court upon a charge of trafficking in 2.7kg of diamorphine, contrary to s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). At the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed the appeal. We now give the reasons.
The appellant was originally charged jointly with two others for the offence. At the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, the learned judicial commissioner found that the other two accused had no case to answer. He acquitted and discharged them. The appellant was called upon to enter his defence, at the conclusion of which he was convicted.
The prosecution case against the appellant was as follows. On 6 June 1991, Narcotics Officers Anpualagan, Azhar Bin Zainal and Hansen Sebastian were keeping surveillance at the Lion City Hotel in Tanjong Katong Road. At about 6.25pm they saw the appellant and two other Africans coming out of the hotel with a porter. The porter was pushing a trolley with some bags on it. He hailed a taxi for the appellant, and assisted in loading a colourful nylon bag (`exh P31`) into the boot of the taxi with the help of the taxi driver. Another colourful nylon bag (`exh P30`) was placed on the front passenger seat. The appellant was carrying an attache case and a sling bag. He got on the taxi and it proceeded to Changi Airport. The three officers trailed the taxi all the way to the airport.
On arrival at the airport, the three officers saw the taxi driver helping the appellant to unload exh P31 and other baggage onto a trolley. The appellant pushed the loaded trolley into the departure hall. He took a seat at the end of a row of seats facing a KLM check-in counter, which was then not yet open to receive passengers. He had the loaded trolley with him. When the check-in started, the appellant went up to the counter with the trolley. He was the first person in the queue.
At about this time, the airport team of narcotics officers joined the first team of three officers in the departure hall. Narcotics Officer Xavier Dawes was instructed to place the appellant under arrest. At that time, the two nylon bags were on the weighing platform on the side of the counter, and the attache case and sling bag were on the trolley. It was Dawes` evidence that the appellant identified the two nylon bags on the weighing platform as his. Azhar and Dawes then helped the appellant to load the nylon bags onto the trolley. They instructed him to push the trolley to the customs office in the departure hall for a search to be conducted, which was done. Anpualagan gave evidence that exh P31 was padlocked from the outside. He asked the appellant to unlock it. The appellant took out a bunch of keys which he had with him and, using one of the keys, the appellant unlocked the padlock.
Anpualagan, Azhar and Lim (another narcotics officer) testified that inside exh P31, there were 37 talcum powder containers. Anpualagan took two containers and shook them. One sounded differently from the other. He decided to cut the container open at the base. The appellant protested, saying, `You cut open, I cannot sell it in Lagos.` The appellant suggested that instead of cutting open the container, Anpualagan should uncap the container to look at the contents. Anpualagan ignored the appellant`s suggestion and instructed Azhar to cut open the base of the container. At that juncture, the appellant snatched the container away from him. It was retrieved and the base was cut open. Inside was found a plastic bag containing a powdery substance. Eventually, all the 37 containers were cut open. A total of 13 plastic bags containing a powdery substance were found concealed inside 12 of the containers.
The contents of 11 of the 13 plastic bags were analyzed by Dr Lee Tong Kooi, a scientific officer from the department of scientific services. He found them to contain not less than 2,703g of diamorphine. This evidence was not challenged.
 The defence
The appellant`s defence was one of complete denial. He denied that he was at the Lion City Hotel with the other two Africans. He denied that he took a taxi from the Lion City Hotel to the airport and maintained that he took one from the South Seas Hotel to the airport. He denied that he had the two nylon bags with him on the taxi, and that he put them on the weighing platform at the check-in counter. He denied that he was asked to unlock the padlock on exh P31 and that he unlocked it. He denied that he had the key to the padlock. The learned judicial commissioner described all these as a litany of denials and lies. He obviously did not believe a word of what the appellant said in respect of these and other material matters.
 The appellant`s statements
The appellant had given two statements to the investigating officer on 7 and 8 July 1991 while in custody. They were consistent with his defence in court. In these statements, the appellant said that on 6 June, at about 6pm, he left the South Seas Hotel by taxi for the airport. He had only a handbag and a suitcase, and a walking stick. When he reached the airport, check-in had not started yet. He went up to the counter to ask when the check-in would start. He was told it would be at 7.15pm. It was then 7.05pm but there were already a lot of bags left by other people near the check-in counter. Just then a CNB officer came up to him and said that a nylon bag on the counter belonged to the appellant. The appellant denied this, but the CNB officer insisted that he should put it on a trolley. Another nylon bag, which was on the floor, was also picked up by other officers and placed on the trolley. He was told to put his handbag and suitcase on the trolley as well. He was told to push the trolley to an office, where all the luggage was searched. After that, he overheard the officers saying that there were drugs inside the cans of talcum powder. He was then arrested.
 Grounds of appeal
The first ground of appeal concerned the manner in which the learned judicial commissioner dealt with the two statements given to the investigating officer. Counsel said that the learned judicial commissioner was wrong in ruling that the statements were not evidence of the facts stated in them because they were purely exculpatory. He said that while this might be correct where the accused does not give evidence, it is otherwise when the accused gives evidence. The contents of his statement can be tested by cross-examination, and the truth of them can therefore be evaluated by the court. Counsel referred to s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed).
The learned judicial commissioner said of the police statements that : 
 
They were purely exculpatory. Exculpatory statements are not evidence of the facts stated in them. In my opinion, [the statements] were self-serving and like the evidence of the accused in court, they flew in the face of reason. I placed no weight on them.
 
 
 
The [appellant`s] defence, both in his statements and in court, was a total denial of the incidents in the face of direct evidence of his being under surveillance and observation from Lion City Hotel to the airport and at its departure hall. Not knowing that he had been observed all along from Lion City Hotel to the airport, I was satisfied that he fabricated the account in his statements and his evidence in court in a similar vein ...
Section 159 of the Evidence Act provides : 
 
In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved.
 
 
 
It is clear that a statement made to the police, being a statement relating to facts in issue at trial, is admissible in evidence. The court will consider it together with other evidence adduced at trial, bearing in mind, however, the possibility that a person placed in a situation where he might be charged for an offence may have a sufficient interest in making a false statement exculpating himself.
It is clear that in the instant case the learned judicial commissioner did precisely this. He referred to other evidence adduced, and came to the view that he could attach no weight at all to the two statements.
On a review of the evidence, we are clearly of the view that the learned judicial commissioner was entitled to come to this view and was correct in doing so.
The second ground of appeal is that the learned judicial commissioner applied a wrong standard of proof when he found that the appellant had not proved his defence on a balance of probabilities.
The learned judicial commissioner said: 
 
I was completely satisfied on a review of the whole evidence that the prosecution witnesses were truthful witnesses and the accuracy and veracity of their evidence had not been anyway affected by the defence evidence. The defence had been one of complete denial of the act of possession. I disbelieved the evidence of the [appellant]. His story was indubitably a lie.
 
 
 
The [appellant] in the circumstances, had not proved his defence on a balance of probabilities. I therefore found him guilty ...
The appellant`s counsel submitted that the learned judicial commissioner in referring to the balance of probabilities was applying a wrong standard of proof. The correct standard was whether the appellant had raised a reasonable doubt about the prosecution case.
It is trite law that, in a criminal case, the burden on the accused is generally no more than to cast a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case. It is for the prosecution to discharge the legal burden of proving its case beyond reasonable doubt. However, where, as in s 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, a statute provides for presumptions of fact, the burden, an evidentiary one, is on the accused to rebut, on a balance of probabilities, the statutory presumptions raised against him. This is also well established.
Section 18 of the Act (so far as relevant) provides as follows:
 
 
(1) Any person who is proved to have had in his possession or custody or under his control - 
 
(a) anything containing a controlled drug; 
 
(b) the keys of anything containing a controlled drug; 
 
(c) the keys of any place or premises or any part thereof in which a controlled drug is found; or 
 
(d) a document of title relating to a controlled drug or any other document intended for the delivery of a controlled drug, 
 
shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. 
 
(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. 
 
(3) The presumptions provided for in this section shall not be rebutted by proof that the accused never had physical possession of the controlled drug. 
 
(4) Where one of two or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.
  
 
 
We agree with defence counsel that, under s 18, the prosecution has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had in his possession or custody or under his control the things stated in (a), (b), (c) or (d) of sub-s (1) before the presumptions provided for in that subsection can arise. Once a presumption under that subsection arises, however, the burden is on the accused to rebut it on a balance of probabilities.
Appellant`s counsel submitted that there were a number of unsatisfactory aspects in the prosecution case tending to show that the prosecution had not established the issue of possession beyond reasonable doubt. Firstly, he pointed to the unsatisfactory evidence as to the hotel register. The appellant said that he checked out of the Four Seas Hotel and not the Lion City Hotel, on the day in question. The Lion City Hotel did not have the appellant`s name, and the Four Seas Hotel register had amendments, raising doubts as to the date on which he had checked out of that hotel. Secondly, counsel refers to the list of articles seized from the appellant by the CNB officers. The incriminating colourful bag, exh P31, and the key said to have been produced by the appellant were not on the list.
Thirdly, counsel said that there was doubt about the veracity of the evidence of the porter at the Lion City Hotel. He asked how this witness could possibly remember which piece of luggage belonged to which guest, especially as the appellant was not even a guest of the hotel.
Fourthly, counsel pointed out that the two colourful bags together weighed 60kg, far in excess of the applicable 40kg baggage allowance, but the appellant had only $12 on him, only enough to pay the airport tax and not any charge for the excess baggage. Counsel asked : 
 
Would any drug trafficker have logically expected to get away with not having to pay for so much excess luggage? And would a drug trafficker have risked this when he was carrying illicit drugs worth at least half a million dollars?
 
 
 
Finally, counsel said the CNB officers could not have arrested the appellant at a worse time. He asked : 
 
Why did the CNB officers not arrest him when he alighted from the taxi? Why not at the time he was pushing the trolley to the check-in row?
 
 
 
Why did the CNB officers not wait to arrest the appellant as he was checking in the luggage (when the luggage would have been tagged identifying that it belonged to the appellant)?
Counsel submitted that if the judge had properly directed himself he might well have found that the appellant had raised a reasonable doubt on the prosecution case.
 Our views
There was ample, if not overwhelming, evidence before the learned judicial commissioner of the appellant having the two colourful bags with him from the moment he boarded the taxi at the Lion City Hotel to the moment he was arrested at the airport. There was also the evidence that it was with the help of a key produced by the appellant that the incriminating bag was opened. The bags were of conspicuously vivid colours, and the appellant was also dressed in a conspicuous manner. Both the porter and the taxi driver testified that he had a walking stick, and a dismantled walking stick was recovered from the appellant`s luggage after his arrest. The evidence of the appellant`s possession of the two nylon bags, coming from a number of witnesses independently of each other (the porter, the taxi driver and the CNB officers), was accepted by the learned judicial commissioner.
As stated earlier, the appellant`s defence consisted entirely of denials. The learned judicial commissioner did not believe the appellant`s evidence on any material aspect. He preferred the evidence of the prosecution witnesses. The matters mentioned by appellant counsel as tending to cast doubt on the prosecution case were all considered by the learned judicial commissioner. It is clear from the judgment that he did not think that they made any dent on the prosecution case at all. There was no doubt at all in his mind as to `the act of possession`, as he called it in the paragraph quoted above. It seems to us that when he referred to `balance of probabilities` in the next and concluding paragraph of his judgment quoted above, he was referring not to the issue of the possession of the bags as bags, but the question of rebutting the presumptions arising under s 18(1), ie the presumption of possession of the controlled drug in the bag and knowledge that it was a controlled drug. We therefore do not think that there is any substance in the submission that he was applying a wrong standard of proof.
For these reasons, we dismissed the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
By this action, the plaintiffs seek to restrain the defendants from passing off the defendants` goods as the plaintiffs` by the use of a get-up similar to that of the plaintiffs.
The goods in question are 
 beehoon 
, which, for those who do not know, is a vermicelli made of rice. The get-up which the plaintiffs seek to protect consists of a packaging in transparent polythene with a red and green wreathlike design and other words and features arranged in the manner shown in exh AB-1.
The plaintiffs manufacture 
 beehoon 
 and other products. They started manufacturing 
 beehoon 
 in 1980. They had used in succession two forms of packaging before settling down to using AB-1 in 1985. In that year, they embarked on a marketing campaign for all their products, including 
 beehoon 
. This helped to boost sales. They sell to wholesalers and retailers like provision shops. They also sell to the armed forces, hospitals, prisons and schools. Hawkers and canteen operators are important end-users of the plaintiffs` 
 beehoon 
. The plaintiffs` 
 beehoon 
 enjoys a dominant market share in Singapore.
The defendants were incorporated in 1981. They are also in the business of manufacturing and marketing 
 beehoon 
. The family business started in the 1960s by the grandfather. There are two entities which are related to them in the sense that they are controlled by some or other of the members of the Soh family. These are People Bee Hoon Factory Pte Ltd (People) and Soh`s Foodstuff Agency, a partnership. The defendants and these related concerns have used a succession of packagings for the 
 beehoon 
 marketed by them.
In 1991, when it was found that the `Golden Axe Brand` which they had been using was not doing well, the defendants decided to use the packaging AB-2, which is the packaging the plaintiffs complain of in these proceedings. The plaintiffs discovered this in late October 1991. They issued the writ in this action on 27 November 1991. They applied for an interim injunction, and this was granted on 5 December 1991 after an inter partes hearing by LP Thean J (as he then was).
There are two main issues in this case. First, the plaintiffs` goodwill in AB-1 and, secondly, the likelihood of confusion between AB-1 and AB-2.
 Market survey report: admissibility
Before I deal with these issues, I have to deal with the question of the admissibility of the market survey report which the plaintiffs seek to rely upon. Both parties had in fact agreed to the admission in evidence of the market survey reports which they had each commissioned, and there was a note in the agreed bundle of documents that the agreement was to the extent of the authenticity of the reports, which I understood to mean that the parties had agreed to the admission of the reports but subject to challenge as to their contents. On the first day of the trial, however, defendants` counsel applied to exclude the evidence. He himself offered to exclude the defendants` report. He contended that the reports were hearsay upon hearsay, and that they were in any event not admissible without a representative sample of the respondents in the survey being called. He also submitted that there was nothing in the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) that allowed such evidence to be admitted.
I told counsel that I was not prepared to rule on the admissibility question right away, without having a full grasp of the contents of the evidence. I made a pragmatic but perhaps unorthodox ruling that the evidence should be adduced, and that I would decide the question of admissibility after the trial.
In brief, the market survey was conducted by the use of a questionnaire and colour photographs of the mark in AB-1 and AB-2 and of the `Chilli Pineapple Brand` (AB-7) and the `Golden Axe Brand` (AB-4). The survey covered 207 provision shop owners and cooked food hawkers at 20 pre-selected HDB estates. The questions were designed or intended to establish, among other things, the level of awareness of AB-1 and its association with the product 
 beehoon 
, the degree of confusion between AB-1 and AB-2, the importance of the `chilli` element in the mark and with whom or whose product the `chilli` is associated. The answers of the respondents were recorded by the interviewers on the questionnaires, and these were processed after the field survey and the results analyzed.
The hearsay element which defence counsel says exists, as I understand it, lies in the fact that the respondents gave their answers to the questions out of court. They were not called, nor were the interviewers. Hence, defence counsel says, the double hearsay.
I should therefore start by saying a word about the rule of hearsay and in what circumstances it may be said to be offended. It is simply this. When evidence is sought to be given of what someone said to the testifying witness, whether such evidence offends the rule against hearsay depends on the purpose for which the evidence is sought to be tendered. If it is sought to be tendered for the purpose of establishing the truth of what was said to the testifying witness, its introduction will offend the rule. On the other hand, if the purpose of tendering the evidence is merely to show that such a statement was made, and not that the statement is true, then the rule is not offended. Prof Peter Murphy, in his excellent book 
 Practical Approach to Evidence, 
 has this to say: 
 
[T]he rule against hearsay does not exclude statements made by others on prior occasions for all purposes, but only when tendered for the purpose of proving that some fact so stated is true. For any other relevant purpose, for example to prove that the statement was in fact made, was made on a given occasion or in a certain way, or had a certain legal effect, such evidence may be freely admitted, if necessary with a limited admissibility direction to the jury.
 
 
 
In , it fell upon Mahon J in the Supreme Court of New Zealand to consider this very question in the context of a market survey report. After analyzing English and American authorities, including , (Graham J, CA and HL), , as well as US academic writers, the learned judge held as follows: 
 
A properly drawn market research questionnaire, carefully framed so as to elicit opinions or beliefs held by persons adequately informed, can only reveal, in my opinion, the existence or otherwise, in a defined proportion of the persons interviewed, of the relevant opinion or belief, and I do not think it can be right in cases involving trade mark infringement or passing off where evidence of reputation is relevant, and especially in a passing off action where affidavit evidence is not receivable, to compel a party to produce in the courtroom an interminable parade of witnesses to depose individually as to their knowledge and understanding of the trade association involved in a particular trade mark or design, so long as there are followed the cautionary procedures recommended in the article in the New York University Law Review above cited. The evidence obtained by research survey is in my view legitimate proof of the fact the opinions obtained had in fact existed, whether rightly held or not, and on that view of the matter it is my opinion that such evidence is not hearsay at all and that, even if it did fall within the technical concept of hearsay or representing a collation of individual statements made out of court, then the evidence would still be admissible by way of exception to the hearsay rule because it exhibits the existence of a state of mind shared in common by a designated class of persons.
 
 
 
The article in the which the learned judge referred to suggested as a condition of its admissibility that the evidence must have been obtained by research scientifically conducted `under circumstances where a sincere and accurate statement naturally would be uttered so that there exists at least a circumstantial probability of the reliability of such evidence.`
The learned judge himself suggested the following requirements: 
 
There must be a formulation of questions cast in such a way as to preclude a weighted or conditioned response, there must be clear proof that the answers were faithfully and accurately recorded, and there must be evidence that the answers were drawn from a true cross-section of that class of the public or trade whose impression or opinion is relevant to the matter in issue.
 
 
 
In , Falconer J accepted the primary view of Mahon J that such evidence is not hearsay but is evidence proving an external fact, namely, that a particular opinion is held by the public or a section of the public.
I respectfully agree with this view. It seems to me that evidence of the results of a market survey research of the kind in question in this suit is evidence of the existence of the belief or opinion held by the respondents to the survey. The purpose of tendering such evidence is to show that such belief or opinion exists; there is no question of tendering it for the purpose of proving the truth or merits of the belief or opinion so held. In my view, evidence as to whether and the extent to which a certain belief or opinion is held by a person or a group of persons, when that is in issue, is evidence of a fact in issue, and its admission falls within the general provision of s 5 of the Evidence Act for the reception of evidence of the existence or non-existence of every fact in issue.
 Section 32(h) of Evidence Act
Plaintiffs` counsel contends that the report may be admitted under s 32(h) of the Evidence Act, which provides as follows: 
 
32 Statements, written or verbal, of relevant facts made by a person who is dead or who cannot be found, or who has become incapable of giving evidence, or whose attendance cannot be procured without an amount of delay or expense which under the circumstances of the case appears to the court unreasonable, are themselves relevant facts in the following cases: 
(h) when the statement was made by a number of persons and expressed feelings or impressions on their part relevant to the matter in question.
 
 
 
It seems to me that s 32(h) is probably an attempt at codifying a common law exception to the hearsay rule, under the general concept or res gestae. The formulation of the rule appears to have been inspired by the case of , captured in illustration (n) of the section as follows: 
 
sues for a libel expressed in a printed caricature exposed in a shop-window. The question is as to the similarity of the caricature and its libellous character.
 
 
 
The remarks of a crowd of spectators on these points may be proved.
The purpose of the rule is to allow the admission of evidence of what persons who are not called as witnesses said in reaction to an event or thing as it presented itself to them in circumstances which exclude the opportunity of reasoned reflection and possibility of concoction and distortion. Such statements may be admitted to prove the truth of what was stated. They may also be admitted to explain the nature of an act, as in , where evidence of what the deceased said to the telephone operator (`Please call the police!`) at about the time of the deceased being shot was held to be admissible to negative the accused`s assertion that the shooting of the deceased was a pure accident.
In the case of a market opinion survey, the results of the survey are sought to be admitted to show the extent to which certain views, opinions and perceptions are held by the respondents or sections of them. As stated before, the truth or validity of these views, opinions and perceptions is not in question. This being the case, s 32(h) does not seem to me to be capable of forming the basis for the admission of such evidence.
Before leaving the general question of market research surveys, I would make two observations. In the first place, the reliability of a survey is always subject to proof. The requirements mentioned by Mahon J in the case were directed to this need for ensuring reliability. Secondly, the evidence of such surveys should be considered as part of the totality of the evidence and not be given unduly decisive weight. Thus, in regard to the issue of similarity in a passing off action, it is essentially a judgment based on the visual impression of the court, and the evidence should be used to assist in that task, but not to conclude the matter. It is possible, and I am sure this often happens, that two surveys done by two equally reputable organisations following the same generally acceptable methodology, can yield quite different results, just as two perfectly honest witnesses or sets of witnesses in the witness box presented with the same questions as would be presented in a survey could honestly give two quite different views. The court at the end of the day has to make up its own mind.
 Goodwill
Turning now to the question whether the plaintiffs enjoy goodwill in their get-up, the plaintiffs` evidence is that they have been using the form of packaging AB-1 since 1985. They have spent a lot of money in promoting their products and the mark with the wreathlike device. This takes the form of advertisements on television, in the Chinese newspaper 
 Lian He Zao Bao 
, and magazines like 
 Tradelink 
. In all these advertisements the mark as well as the name `Tai Sun` appear. It is accepted by the defendants that the amount spent by the plaintiffs on advertisements and other forms of promotion prior to the institution of the suit had been quite substantial.
The defendants, however, contend that the most prominent element of the plaintiffs` packaging for their 
 beehoon 
 is the words `Tai Sun`, rather than the mark. They point out that the Chinese words for `Tai Sun Bee Hoon` appear in very large blocks on the side of the plaintiff`s lorries. They also point out that there were occasions, during promotions of the plaintiffs` 
 beehoon 
 at the IMM Mega Mart and at the NTUC outlets, when the plaintiffs` 
 beehoon 
 was described in the shelf display cards as Tai Sun Bee Hoon. The defendants also point out that at one time when there was some confusion among customers between the plaintiffs` 
 beehoon 
 and People`s pineapple chilli brand 
 beehoon 
, the plaintiffs themselves told their customers to identify their 
 beehoon 
 as the Tai Sun 
 beehoon 
.
The defendants submit, therefore, that as of the date of the writ the plaintiffs did not enjoy a reputation and goodwill in their 
 beehoon 
 sold in the get-up AB-1.
In view of the considerable efforts which the plaintiffs had put into the promotion of their products, the fact that they had enjoyed a predominant market share for their products, and the fact that their 3kg 
 beehoon 
 had always been packaged in that get-up, I do not have the slightest doubt in my mind that the plaintiffs enjoyed at the date of the writ a considerable goodwill in that packaging in relation to the 
 beehoon 
 marketed by them in Singapore. This conclusion is fortified by the findings of the market research conducted by Frank Small & Associates. About 72% of the respondents claimed to have seen the Tai Sun mark, and 71% of them associated the mark with the product 
 beehoon 
.
I do not accept the defendants` contention that the predominant part of the packaging is the Chinese words `Tai Sun Bee Hoon` rather than the mark. It is obvious, visually, that if anything is predominant, the mark is more prominent than the words. I also do not accept the suggestion that the occasional description of the plaintiffs` 
 beehoon 
 as the Tai Sun 
 beehoon 
 would detract from the association of the mark and the packaging with the plaintiffs` 
 beehoon 
.
I now turn to the question of possible deception, specifically whether the defendants` get-up may be said to be a colourable imitation of the plaintiffs`.
The learned editors of 
 Kerly`s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names 
(12th Ed) para 16/67, taking examples from decided cases, make the following helpful statement of what is meant by get-up: 
 
What is compendiously called the get-up of goods - the dress in which they are presented to the buyer - comprises, in particular, the size and shape of the packages; where the goods have no definite outline, or none which is shown to the buyer, the material, colour and decoration of their wrappers, and the lettering and arrangement of their labels. Where what the buyer sees are the goods themselves, not the packaging, get-up may consist in some capricious or fanciful addition to the goods themselves: paintwork, for instance, or colouring or fanciful shaping of the goods.
 
 
 
 
 The principles applicable
 
The question of resemblance is to be judged by the overall impression given to the eye, and, as stated above, this impression is entirely a matter for the judgment of the court, not the witnesses. It is impossible to define as a matter of law the degree of resemblance which is necessary to give rise to a right of action. All that can be done is to ascertain in every case as it occurs, whether there is such a resemblance as to deceive a purchaser using ordinary caution. In , Lord Denning stated the principle in the following terms: 
 
The test is whether the ordinary, sensible members of the public would be confused. It is not sufficient that the only confusion would be to a very small, unobservant section of society: or, as Foster J put it recently, if the only person who would be misled would be a `moron in a hurry`.
 
 
 
In , Solomon J said: 
 
I take it that the ordinary purchaser is a man who knows more or less the peculiar characteristics of the article he wants; he has in his mind`s eye a general idea of the appearance of the article, and he looks at the article not closely, but sufficiently to take in its general appearance.
 
 
 
In , a trade mark case, Lord Radcliffe said: 
 
The likelihood of confusion or deception in such cases is not disproved by placing the two marks side by side and demonstrating how small is the chance of error in any customer who places his order for goods with both the marks clearly before him, for orders are not placed, or are often not placed, under such conditions. It is more useful to observe that in most persons the eye is not an accurate recorder of visual detail, and that marks are remembered rather by general impressions or by some significant detail than by any photographic recollection of the whole.
 
 
 
 
 AB-1 v AB-2
 
The plaintiffs` and defendants` packagings are reproduced, unfortunately in black and white and not in colour, in the attachment to this judgment. The main part of both labels which need to be considered is from the top down to the words `Tai Sun Bee Hoon` in the plaintiffs` case and down to the words `Ben Heng Bee Hoon` in the defendants` case.
Approaching the matter in the manner indicated by the authorities, I think the following features of AB-1 and AB-2 are relevant when considering the question of possible confusion. There are certain similarities. First, there is the use of colour. The Chinese characters at the top, showing the name of the plaintiffs and the defendants, are in red in both cases. The Chinese characters below the mark, `Tai Sun Bee Hoon` in one case and `Ben Heng Bee Hoon` in the other, are both in red. The English equivalent is green in both cases. As for the mark, the chilli-like objects in the plaintiffs` mark and the chillies in the defendants` mark are both red. The Chinese words at the top of the mark enclosed by the chilli-like objects in the plaintiffs` mark and the chillies in the defendants` mark are in red in both cases.
Secondly, the sizes of the various components of the label. The Chinese words at the top (showing the name of the company concerned) are somewhat larger and the strokes somewhat thicker in the plaintiffs` label than in the defendants`, but the main line of the words occupy the whole breadth of the label. Below the central mark, the Chinese words `Tai Sun Bee Hoon` in one case, and `Ben Heng Bee Hoon` in the other, are about the same size.
Thirdly, the size of the labels. The whole label, including the smaller writings at the bottom, is of about the same size in both cases, although the main part of the defendants` label occupies a larger space than the plaintiffs`. Since both packagings are intended for the 3kg packets of 
 beehoon 
, the volume of the packet is also about the same in both cases.
Finally, both labels are enclosed around the four sides by a green, threadlike border of a roughly similar design.
As Lord Radcliffe said in , one must not consider the question by placing the two labels side by side. One must allow for imperfect recollection and for the fact that marks are remembered by their general impression and not by a detailed comparison of the differences and similarities. Although a listing of the differences and the similarities is a good starting point for purposes of discussion, in the end one has to place oneself in the position of a customer in a real marketing situation. He may have seen or bought 
 beehoon 
 packaged in AB-1. He is subsequently presented with goods packaged in AB-2. The question I ask myself is this: allowing for imperfect recall, what are the chances of him thinking that he is presented with the same thing that he had bought before or seen before. I have to bear in mind the fact that some of the customers, particularly the cooked food hawkers (such as PW3, Mdm Tan Swie) are illiterate or have little education.
Giving the best consideration I can to this not an entirely easy case, I am inclined to find that there are sufficient dissimilarities between the two packagings as to make the case of a colourable imitation not proven. It seems to me that the main part of both the packagings that attracts the eye immediately is the mark in the centre. There are the thick markedly curved chilli-shaped objects in AB-1 contrasted with the much thinner smooth chillies pointed almost vertically upwards in AB-2. There is the predominant green mass at the bottom of the defendants` mark, accentuated by the green mass in the centre, contrasted with the sparser use of green in the mark in AB-1. Generally, there is much more empty space in and around the defendants` mark than is the case with the plaintiffs` mark. Another gross feature in AB-1 is that the red Chinese characters for Tai Sun Bee Hoon in the plaintiffs` mark are placed much closer to the bottom of the chilli-like objects so that, together with the red chilli-like objects and the features enclosed by these objects, you have a relatively large mass of red concentrated together, whereas in AB-2, the corresponding Chinese words are more clearly separated by the rather large green leaves and stalk. These grosser features of the two labels, seen, as they must be, at some distance rather than compared close up, do have the effect, it seems to me, of giving two sufficiently distinct mental pictures as to reduce to insignificant proportions any confusion on the part of the ordinary purchaser.
My best judgement is, therefore, that the defendants have succeeded in making enough distinction in their mark to make the get-up of their goods sufficiently different from that of the plaintiffs` goods to avoid a liability for passing off.
 Intention to deceive
The plaintiffs submit that their case is strengthened by the fact that there is evidence of an intention on the part of the defendants to deceive. An intention to deceive is not an essential ingredient in the tort of passing off. However, if such an intention is established, the burden on the plaintiffs to show confusion is lessened. In , Earl Loreburn said: 
 
When once you establish the intent to deceive, it is only a short step to proving that the intent has been successful, but still it is a step, even though it be a short step.
 
 
 
As stated earlier, the defendants and their related entities had used a succession of marks. People and its predecessor used a packaging in the form of AB-8, with a couple of red chilli hanging vertically downwards from a leafed stalk. The brand name was `Red Chilli Brand`. That packaging and brand continue to be used today.
When the defendants were incorporated in 1981, they marketed their 
 beehoon 
 under the `Golden Axe Brand` mark. In 1986, the defendants used a packaging AB-3, with the two serrated chilli-like objects like those in AB-1 enclosing a mountain shape. The mark contained the words in bold Chinese characters `The original Tai Sun 
 beehoon 
`. The plaintiffs took objection to this, and started proceedings in Suit No 4520/86. The parties eventually negotiated a settlement whereby the defendants agreed not to `pass off or use such packaging bearing the said wreath device and/or design.` The plaintiffs contend that AB-2 is another attempt at approximation to AB-1, and that is an indication of intention to deceive.
In conjunction with the decision to use AB-2, the defendants allege that they entered into an agreement with a Thai entity in which the father and grandfather of DW1 have a substantial interest purporting to provide for the importation at least 1 million 3kg packets of 
 beehoon 
 a year for sale in Singapore with provision for the imposition of hefty liquidated damages on failure to meet the target. The plaintiffs question the authenticity of this document, having regard to the fact that even at the best of times the defendants had not been able to sell anything like such a quantity. They say that this fortifies their point that defendants intend to deceive.
My views on these contentions are as follows. In the first place, if, as has been found, there is little likelihood of confusion between AB-1 and AB-2, it is not right to draw any inference of a fraudulent intent to deceive from AB-2 itself. The appearance of AB-2 suggests that there was an attempt to imitate the plaintiffs` get-up or at least that AB-2 was inspired by AB-1. However, the defendants also took care to introduce sufficient differences, which I have set out, to reduce or eliminate confusion. Even if there was an intention to deceive, that intention was not carried out. So it is my view that the intention cannot be inferred from the get-up itself.
The plaintiffs then seek to rely on the conduct of the defendants in proffering the alleged agreement whose authenticity they say is questionable. In this respect, I have to say that when one speaks of intention to deceive in this context, one is referring to an intention to use the get-up as a means of deceiving people into thinking that the defendants` goods and the plaintiffs` goods are from the same source. It appears that the document in question was introduced in support of the defendants` counterclaim for damages, which was abandoned in August 1992, when they amended their defence. Any intention there might be in proffering this document for that purpose would have nothing to do with any intention to deceive in the sense I have indicated. For this reason, I do not think that this document assists the plaintiffs in any way on this point.
I conclude therefore that the plaintiffs have failed in their claim, and it is dismissed with costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an appeal against the decision of the High Court dismissing the appellants` claim for conversion by the respondents of certain Caterpillar spare parts belonging to the appellants. The facts that gave rise to the appeal are briefly set out below.
The facts
In 1983, two security guards employed by the appellants at their warehouse namely, Mohammad Taz Khan (`Mohammad`) and Ramachandra s/o Ahinoo (`Ramachandran`), conspired to steal some Caterpillar spare parts from the warehouse. To dispose of the spare parts to third parties at a profit, they sought the help of one Doris Liauw (`Doris`) to find potential buyers. She introduced her then husband one Ng Kin Sai (`Ng`) to Mohammad and Ramachandran as someone with experience in the sale and disposal of spare parts. The trio, Mohammad, Ramachandran and Ng then devised the plan. On the nights when both Mohammad and Ramachandran were on duty, they would steal the spare parts from the warehouse and in the mornings, Ng using a rented vehicle would collect the stolen parts at a point just outside the warehouse. Having collected the parts, it was Ng`s responsibility to find a suitable buyer for the stolen goods. In the meantime, Ng had been looking for a buyer for these spare parts. He found the respondents in the 
 Yellow Pages 
 of the telephone directory and contacted the respondents` sales director, Jimmy Lim Chee Teck (`Lim`). Representing himself to be the director of a company called Unibone Enterprises (`Unibone`), Ng said that he had Caterpillar spare parts for sale at competitive prices. This was followed by a visit to the respondents` office and some telephone conversations between them. Finally, Lim was persuaded to place an order by choosing an item from a list produced by Ng. The item was first offered to Lim at a discount of 30%. After some negotiation, a further reduction of 55% was given to the respondents. The result was that the respondents paid 31% of the then consumer list price of the part concerned.
Subsequently, the respondents bought more stolen Caterpillar spare parts from Ng at similarly reduced prices. The transactions were conducted thus. Each time, Lim would write down on foolscap paper a list of spare parts he wished to purchase, hand a copy of the list to Ng and retain one for his own reference. Mohammad and Ramachandran would steal as many of the parts contained in the list as were available from the warehouse. In the early hours of the morning, Ng would arrive at the warehouse as arranged and collect them. These were then usually delivered to Lim between 7.30am to 8am the same morning. On receiving the goods, Lim would pay Ng by means of a cash cheque or by cash. In return, an official invoice from Unibone would be issued to Lim. There were ten separate transactions evidenced by invoices and payment vouchers. According to the documents, Lim paid to Ng a total of $181,000.
In October 1983, the appellants discovered the pilferage and reported the matter to the police. This led to the arrests and convictions of Mohammad, Ramachandran, Ng and Doris for theft of the Caterpillar spare parts. On 31 July 1986, the appellants commenced an action against the respondents for conversion of the stolen goods which the appellants valued at $500,000. The action was heard before the learned Chief Justice in the High Court. There was really no dispute that the spare parts acquired by the respondents from Ng were goods stolen from the warehouse of the appellants and prima facie the respondents had not acquired any title to the goods: 
 nemo dat quod non habet 
. However, the respondents in resisting the claim raised the defence that they purchased the goods in market overt in good faith and without any notice of any defect in the title of the goods. This defence featured in the arguments of counsel before the learned Chief Justice, although it was not raised in their pleadings.
 The decision of the High Court
In a reserved judgment, reported in 
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 702
 , the learned Chief Justice dismissed the claim of the appellants. He considered the common law rule of sale in market overt, which is now encapsulated in s 22(1) of the English Sale of Goods Act 1979. He held that this rule in the form as developed in England was inapplicable in the Singapore context, but the principles underlying the rule were germane to the circumstances of the case before him and were applicable. Reverting to the facts before him, he found first, that in Singapore there existed a regular and open market in Caterpillar spare parts, and secondly, that the respondents acted in good faith and without notice of the defect in title in the goods when they purchased them. On that basis, he held that the respondents had obtained good title to the Caterpillar spare parts, and therefore the appellants were unable to maintain the action for conversion. The appellants` claim therefore failed.
 The appeal
Before us, the appellants raised three grounds of appeal. First, they argued that the defence of market overt was not specifically pleaded by the respondents and hence it was not open to them to raise this defence and it was wrong for the court to decide this issue. Secondly, the appellants contended that the rule of sale in market overt is not applicable to the present case or to Singapore on the ground that there is no such thing as a market overt in Singapore similar to markets dedicated as such in England. Thirdly, the appellants challenged the learned Chief Justice`s finding that the respondents acted in good faith when they purchased the stolen spare parts from Ng.
On the first ground, we think it is too late in the day for the appellants to argue that the defence of market overt has not been pleaded and it was not open to the respondents to raise it and therefore the court below should not have decided it. The defence was raised and was fully argued below by counsel for both sides. It was on the basis of their arguments that the learned Chief Justice gave his decision. We are not disposed to decide this appeal purely on the procedural point that this defence was not specifically pleaded.
 Section 5 of the Civil Law Act
We now turn to the second contention mounted on behalf of the appellants, namely, that the rule of sale in market overt has no application in Singapore. It is common ground that by virtue of s 5 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1988 Ed), the provisions of the Sale of Goods Act 1979 of the United Kingdom apply in this case. Section 5 has been repealed by the Application of English Law Act (Cap 7A, 1994 Ed) which came into effect on 12 November 1993. However, s 6(2) of the later Act provides: 
 
In respect of any proceedings instituted or any cause of action accruing before 12th November 1993, section 5 of the Civil Law Act shall continue to apply as if it had not been repealed by this Act.
 
 
 
As the cause of action in this case accrued and the proceedings were instituted before 12 November 1993, s 5 of the Civil Law Act continues to apply in the determination of the issue before us. It would be helpful at this stage to set out the well known provision of s 5 of the Civil Law Act, so far as material, which is as follows: 
 
(1) Subject to this section, in all questions or issues which arise or which have to be decided in Singapore ... with respect to mercantile law generally, the law with respect to those matters to be administered shall be the same as would be administered in England in the like case, at the corresponding period, if such question or issue had arisen or had to be decided in England ...
... 
(3) For the purposes of this section - 
(a) the law of England which is to be administered by virtue of subsection (1) shall be subject to such modifications and adaptations as the circumstances of Singapore may require; ...
 
 
 
In terms of s 5, the issue before us is clearly with respect to mercantile law generally and the law as would be administered in England in the like case at this date is undoubtedly the Sale of Goods Act 1979 and, in particular, ss 21(1) and 22(1) thereof. This position was accepted by both parties. Both these provisions embody rules or principles of common law. Section 21(1) provides: 
 
Subject to this Act, where goods are sold by a person who is not their owner and who does not sell them under the authority or with the consent of the owner, the buyer acquires no better title than the seller had, unless the owner of the goods is by his conduct precluded from denying the seller`s authority to sell.
 
 
 
This, in essence, is the principle of 
 nemo dat quod non habet 
. Section 22(1), on the other hand, is an exception to that principle: it is the rule of sale in market overt. It provides: 
 
Where goods are sold in market overt, according to the usage of the market, the buyer acquires a good title to the goods, provided he buys them in good faith and without notice of any defect or want of title on the part of the seller.
 
 
 
In applying the law `as would be administered in England in the like case`, regard must be had to s 5(3) of the Civil Law Act and such law will have to be `subject to such modifications and adaptations as the circumstances of Singapore may require`. As we have said, s 21(1) of the Sale of Goods Act embodies the common law principle of 
 nemo dat quod non habet 
, and, as far as we can see its application in Singapore does not call for or require any modification or adaptation. However, it is in relation to s 22(1) of the Sale of Goods Act that such a question arises.
 Market overt
The rule of sale in market overt is one of great antiquity. It dates back to the sixteenth century: . In , Lord Denning MR gave a historical account of this doctrine. His Lordship said, at p 559: 
 
... we have to go back to the works of Sir Edward Coke. In 1596 there was an important case about market overt: 
 Market-Overt Case
 (1596) 5 Co Rep 83b. Coke reported it. He afterwards expounded the law of market overt in 
 Coke`s Second Institutes
, 
 v
ol 2, pp 713, 714. He first stated the rule of the common law which was, he said:
 
 
 
`... that all sales and contracts of any thing vendible in faires or markets overt, should not be good only between the parties, but should bind those that right had thereunto. But this rule hath many exceptions.`
 
 
 
Coke then set out 12 exceptions. The only one material for our purpose is no 11, which says:
 
 
 
`The sale must not be in the night, but between the rising of the sun, and the going down of the same: for he that hath a fair or market, either by grant or prescription, hath power to hold it per unum diem, seu dous, vel tres dies, etc, where (dies) is taken for dies solaris; for if it should be taken for dies naturalis, then might the sale be made at midnight. And yet the sale that is made in the night is good between the parties, but not to bind a stranger that right hath.`
 
 
 
His Lordship later continued, at pp 559-560: 
 
... in the 
 Market-Overt Case
, 5 Co Rep 83b, the judges laid emphasis on the need for the goods to be openly on sale in a 
 place
 where those who stand or pass by can see them. Thus, when a thief stole a silver basin and ewer belonging to the Bishop of Worcester and they afterwards appeared on sale in a scrivener`s shop in London, the purchaser got no title: because people go to a scrivener`s shop for pen and paper, not for gold or silver plate. Sir Edward Coke said, 5 Co Rep 83b:
 
 
 
`But if the sale had been openly in a goldsmith`s shop in London, 
 so that anyone who stood or passed by the shop might see it
, there it would change the property. But, if the sale be in the shop of a goldsmith, either behind a hanging, or behind a cupboard upon which his plate stands, 
 so that one that stood or passed by the shop could not see it
, it would not change the property: so, if the sale be not in the shop, but in the warehouse, or other place of the house, it would not change the property, for that is not in market-overt, and 
 none would search there for his goods
.`
 
 
 
If such be the requirement as to 
 place
, a similar requirement may be expected as to 
 time
. The goods should be openly on sale at a 
 time
 when those who stand or pass by can see them. Thus it must be in the day-time when all can see what is for sale: and not in the night-time when no one can be sure what is going on. And if in the day-time, what better test can you have than between sunrise and sunset? No half-light then, but full daylight.
 
 
 
A similar account was given by Scarman LJ at p 562.
The rule discussed above applies only to a sale made in a market overt. Every shop in the City of London is a market overt `for such things only which by the trade of the owner are put there for sale`. Outside the City of London, the rule applies to any `open, public, and legally constituted market`. To be `legally constituted`, the market must be one that has been created either by statute or charter, or established by long continual use. Moreover, in order to convey a good title to the purchaser, the sale must be conducted according to `the usage of the market`. The requirements are, inter alia, that the sale must be made at the place of the market on an ordinary market day during the hours between sunrise and sunset; the goods must be openly displayed for sale and the goods must be of a description which it is in the ordinary course of the seller`s trade to sell, and the whole transaction, that is, the sale and the delivery of the goods, must be begun and completed openly in the market. Thus, in , the sale of a silver basin and ewer stolen from the Bishop of Worcester in a scrivener`s shop in the City of London was held not to be a good sale, as the scrivener`s shop was not the usual place for the sale of such articles. In , there was a sale of some jewellery by a vendor to a jeweller in the City of London in a showroom above the jeweller`s shop where customers were only admitted by special invitation and that was held not to be a sale in market overt on two grounds: first, that the sale was not made in the open area of the shop where the public could have access, and secondly, it was a sale to the shopkeeper and not one by the shopkeeper to his customer. Similarly, in , the sale of a watch by auction held at an auction room on the second floor of a building in the City of London was held not to fall within the rule of a sale in market overt. In , a sale of a pair of Adam candelabra at a stall in a statutory market before sunrise was held not to be one falling within the rule. On the other hand, in , the sale of a motor car by private treaty in a market overt after the motor car had been put up for sale twice by public auction for which there was no bidder in the same market overt was held to be a good sale at market overt. There was evidence in that case that motor cars were sold by private treaty as well as public auction in that market and that the particular sale was conducted in accordance with market usage.
The rationale for holding that such sale is valid and capable of passing title to the goods sold is the openness of the transaction. In , Scarman LJ explained the rationale thus, at p 562: 
 
The reason why the law permitted a sale in market overt to confer a good title upon the bona fide purchaser was the openness of the transaction: see the judgment of Scrutton J in [1911] 2 QB 1031, 1040-1045. When shops were scarce, the market was the place, and market day the occasion, for the public to buy and sell. The market was regulated by the franchise-holder. The place, the day, and the hours of business were established under the authority of the franchise and were well known. Thus any person whose goods had been stolen would know where and when the thief was likely to seek to dispose of them, and would have an opportunity of finding and recovering them before they were sold in the open market. , ol II, p 449, describes the ancient safeguards for the true owner (including in Saxon times `the presence of credible witnesses`) and at p 450 of his , ol II, says:
 
 
 
`By which wise regulations the common law has secured the right of the proprietor in personal chattels from being divested, so far as was consistent with that other necessary policy, that purchasers, bona fide, in a fair, open, and regular manner, should not afterwards put to difficulties by reason of the previous knavery of the seller.`
 
 
 
The crucial question here is whether such a rule of sale in market overt is applicable to Singapore. It is true that in two cases before the High Court, it was said rather summarily that sales in question were not made in market overt. In decided in 1985 (unreported), LP Thean J (as he then was) said: 
 
The defendants contended that the purchase of the tea was made in a market overt according to usage and therefore they had acquired a good title thereto. That clearly was not so and on the materials before me I find that the defendants had no basis for such a contention.
 
 
 
Similarly in 
 
 
[1989] 2 MLJ 200
  at p 202, Lai Kew Chai J said: 
 
In my judgment, the plaintiffs have successfully shown that the defendants were not acting in good faith and without notice that the sale to them was made without the owner`s authority. They were buying at about half the market price and I find the evidence of Lim You Chong about his knowledge of the market price very unsatisfactory. He was obviously not keeping to the truth. I am sure he knew he was getting the rice on the cheap, that the circumstances were highly suspicious and I think he took a calculated risk, hoping to make an unusual amount of profit within a very short time. I am satisfied that the defendants did not buy from the market overt.
 
 
 
Thus, it can be said that it was implied in these cases that the rule of sale in market overt is applicable to Singapore. In both cases, however, the question whether the rule of sale in market overt has any application in Singapore was never addressed.
In contrast, in decided in 1988 (also unreported), Chan Sek Keong J made a summary pronouncement that there had been never and there was not then any market overt in Singapore. In refuting an argument that the sale in question took place at a market overt, he said: 
 
In connection with the issue of title, I should, at this juncture, deal with the related argument of counsel for the second defendants that her clients have obtained a good title to the said goods by reason of their having bought them in market overt in good faith and without notice of the first defendants` lack of title thereto. This argument was made on the assumption that the law of Singapore applied to the sale. The short answer to the argument is that there has never been and there is not now any market overt in Singapore.
 
 
 
The learned judge, however, did not go further to set out the basis on which he arrived at this conclusion; nor was any argument canvassed before him on the question whether the rule of sale in market overt has any application in Singapore.
The essence of this rule is steeped in the history and culture of England. It is an ancient rule which is becoming harder to justify in modern times. It seems to us that with the increasing number of shops in England, it is of limited use to innocent purchasers since it is confined to small geographical areas. The idea that the property owners are protected by the openness of transactions in markets is also becoming quite unreal considering the increased mobility of thieves and stolen goods. We do not think that the rule of sale in market overt, whether as it exists at common law or as it is encapsulated in s 22(1) of the Sale of Goods Act, is capable of being applied in Singapore.
One obvious and fundamental difficulty in the way of applying the rule of market overt in Singapore is the absence of any statute or charter creating any particular market in Singapore. Nor is there in existence any market that has been established by prescription or custom. There was certainly no evidence of such market in this case or in either of the two cases, and . Nor is there a custom by which every shop in a certain geographical area in Singapore, the equivalent of the City of London, is a market overt. It is therefore clear that the rule or doctrine of market overt is totally incapable of application in Singapore. This was recognized by the learned Chief Justice, who said, at p 706: 
 
It is plain ... that in order for a sale to constitute a sale in market overt in the City certain conditions must be fulfilled. Equally plain is the fact that these conditions were delineated in an era and in circumstances far removed from a contemporary Singapore. It would scarcely be desirable or necessary, therefore, to import wholesale into the Singaporean context the rule of market overt as it has evolved within the English legal system, lest we become entangled with the specific characteristics of markets overt in England, which derive from circumstances alien to us.
 
 
 
We respectfully agree with him entirely.
However, the learned Chief Justice having decided that it would not be desirable or necessary `to import wholesale into the Singapore context the rule of market overt` held that the principles underlying the rule of market overt are capable of application in Singapore. He said, at p 706: 
 
... it appears to me that the principles underlying the rule of market overt are germane to the circumstances of the present case. The defence of market overt was made available in England simply because of the need to give recognition to the fact that any established and regular market in goods is a living entity, in which the sheer volume of trading transactions in everyday practice not only makes it impossible to afford complete protection to ownership in goods when possession is lost, but also makes it necessary to accord protection to an innocent buyer of goods in the market. Commerce has tended to proceed to a not inconsiderable degree on the assumption that a man in possession of goods and disposing of them in the way of his business is entitled to do so.
 
 
 
He then referred to a passage from 
 Coke`s Second Institute 
, Vol 2, p 713 and continued, at pp 706-707: 
 
In a very real sense, these principles are not unique to the English context although, as the English example has shown, the precise scope of their operation in any particular place may well be constrained by local conditions and habits. The applicability of the principles to trading in goods in Singapore was indirectly recognized by Lai Kew Chai J in when he said, in passing, at p 102F: `I am satisfied that the defendants did not buy from the market overt`. For over a century Singapore has thrived as a free port and busy trading centre for all kinds of goods within the region, a fact of which judicial notice can be taken. Merchants and traders compete freely with each other to purchase goods from the cheapest sources, and resell them on the market at the most competitive prices. We would materially hamper the transactions of the many established markets existing in Singapore if we refuse to concede the crucial relevance of the principles underlying the market overt rule.
 
 
 
Reverting to the facts, the learned Chief Justice found that in Singapore there existed a regular and open market in Caterpillar spare parts. He said, at p 707: 
 
The existence in Singapore of a regular and open market in such parts is thus obvious from the above evidence, as are the quantity and variety of transactions being conducted in this market. It is clear that great public inconvenience and confusion would result if the rationale of the market overt rule could not operate. Of course, the relative facility of transfer of property in goods may in various instances make a `loser` of the original owner of goods which are converted, but such an `evil` (if indeed one can even call it that) is counterbalanced by the general practical virtues of a system that facilitates the passing of property in goods. It should also be pointed out that in the majority of cases, the original owner of the goods is covered by insurance, whereas it may be difficult for the innocent purchaser to enforce his remedy (and even if he is able to do so, it will be expensive).
 
 
 
It is quite evident that the learned Chief Justice has adopted the underlying principles of the rule of market overt and adapted and applied them to trading of goods which are conducted on substantial scales in Singapore, freed from all the restrictions which hedged around a sale in market overt in England. In particular, he has, in effect, treated the whole of Singapore as a `market overt` for the Caterpillar spare parts. With the utmost respect, we have two difficulties in the way of accepting such an extensive and wide rule as propounded. First, the operation of such a rule hinges on the question whether or not there is a `regular and open market` for a particular type of goods in question and is not dependent on a particular geographical area or locality where such goods are normally sold, and the answer to such question in turn depends on a finding of fact made by the court. Hence, with reference to any particular type of goods, it would not be possible for anyone who deals in those goods to know with certainty whether or not there is a `regular and open market` for those goods until it is found and determined to be so by the court. In our opinion, the operation of such a rule would create uncertainty in trade and commerce.
Secondly, the rule of sale in market overt is an exception to the principle of 
 nemo dat quod non habet 
 and any exception made to the rule of 
 nemo dat 
 principle should strike a balance between the two competing interests: the interest of the owner of the property and that of an innocent purchaser. The rule as propounded by the learned Chief Justice would tilt the balance far too much in favour of the innocent purchaser and would effectively erode almost completely the principle of 
 nemo dat quod non habet 
.
Much as we accept that the purpose or object of the rule of sale in market overt is to encourage the growth of markets, keep them well replenished with goods and protect commercial transactions, it also protects the interests of the property owners. The fundamental principle underlying such a rule is the openness of the market where the goods in question are sold openly in shops that normally sell such goods at normal sale hours between sunrise and sunset. In that connection, various restrictions have developed circumscribing such rule which render it of very limited application. These restrictions serve an important function of protecting property rights of owners. For instance, a person who has his goods stolen may go to his local market to trace the goods. The openness of the conduct of the transaction, the time and the place of the transaction are all important factors which would help to give the owner a sporting chance of recovering his goods.
In conclusion, for the reasons we have given, the rule of market overt as developed at common law and now encapsulated in s 22(1) of the Sale of Goods Act has no application in Singapore. Nor, with respect, do we find applicable the principles underlying such rule as propounded by the learned Chief Justice.
Having dealt with the crux of the appellants` appeal, we find it unnecessary to address the third contention raised by the appellant, namely, that the respondents did not purchase the Caterpillar spare parts bona fide and without notice of any defect of title.
 The respondents` case
 
 
We now turn to the issues raised by the respondents. Pursuant to O 57 r 9A(5), the respondents raised in their case the following additional grounds on which the decision of the learned Chief Justice should be varied or affirmed. They contended that the claim of conversion was not pleaded specifically by the appellants, that the appellants had not proved their claim of conversion and finally, that the damages of $500,000 as claimed have not been sufficiently proved.
On the matter of pleading, the respondents` argument has no merit. The appellants had pleaded sufficiently conversion as shown in para 4 of their statement of claim which averred as follows: 
 
All the said stolen Caterpillar spare parts of the said value of $500,000 were sold and delivered by ... to the defendants during the said period from January 1983 to September 1983. The defendants then being in possession of the said stolen Caterpillar spare parts have sold, pledged, delivered and/or otherwise dealt with or disposed of the said Caterpillar spare parts to a person or persons unknown without the plaintiffs` consent express or implied, whereby the plaintiffs have suffered loss and damages.
 
 
 
This paragraph clearly stated the essential elements of the cause of action for conversion.
Next, the respondents submitted that the appellants have not proved their claim of conversion. This is plainly unsustainable on the evidence. Lim said in evidence that they resold to third parties some of the spare parts bought from Ng. The remainder was mixed with their own stocks in their warehouse. The taking into possession of the spare parts, and the mixing and selling them were, in our view, acts which constituted dealings with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the appellants` rights of ownership. We find that the conversion has been proved.
We now turn to the question of the quantum of damages. The appellants had claimed damages in the region of $500,000. However, the respondents objected to this figure as it was a mere estimate and damages have not been proved. In our opinion, this argument does not change the outcome of the question of liability. The respondents are liable to the appellants on the claim of conversion, and as there was no assessment of damages below, such damages should be assessed by the registrar.
 Conclusion
In the premises, we allow the appeal, set aside the order made below, and order that interlocutory judgment be entered for the appellants with damages to be assessed by the Registrar. The appellants will have the costs here and below, but the costs of assessment will be reserved for the Registrar. There will be the usual consequential order for repayment to the appellants the deposit in court as security.

The appellant, Ng Theng Shuang, was convicted by the High Court on 15 September 1994 on two charges of using an arm, namely, an automatic pistol, by discharging Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullets from the said automatic pistol with intent to cause injury to one Karamjit Singh, the first charge, and to one Ou Kai San, the second charge, at Tin Sing Goldsmiths Pte Ltd, South Bridge Road, Singapore on 19 November 1992, an offence punishable with death under s 4 of the Arms Offence Act. He was also convicted on a third charge of having committed the robbery of a station wagon a short distance away from Tin Sing Goldsmiths at about the same time and on the same day as the first two charges with which he was charged, during the course of which robbery he was armed with a serviceable automatic pistol, an offence punishable with life imprisonment and with caning of not less than six strokes under s 3(3) of the same Act. Accordingly he was sentenced to death and sentenced to life imprisonment and caning with ten strokes respectively but in view of the sentence of death the court expressed the hope that the sentence of caning would not be carried out.
The appeal was against the two charges which carried the death penalty. We heard the appeal on 23 January 1995 and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
Karamjit Singh was a CISCO constable on duty at Tin Sing Goldsmiths` premises in South Bridge Road on 19 November 1992. He was armed with a Smith & Wesson revolver. Ou Kai San was a salesman employed by Tin Sing Goldsmiths and was attending to customers on that day when at about 3pm two armed gunmen wearing crash helmets entered the premises brandishing the guns they held in their hands. Karamjit Singh immediately reached for his revolver despite a command from one of the gunmen not to do so. The gunman fired at Karamjit Singh wounding him in the thigh. Karamjit Singh returned the fire and there was an exchange of gunfire among the three armed persons. In the exchange of fire one of the gunmen was hit.
The two gunmen then fled the premises and attempted to get away on a motor-cycle but Karamjit Singh pursued them and there was a further exchange of fire between Karamjit Singh and the gunman who was riding on the pillion. This time Karamjit Singh was hit on the right ankle. The spent bullet was later recovered from his socks and identified by the expert witness who gave evidence for the prosecution as a Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullet. Karamjit Singh was not sure whether his fire had hit any of the two gunmen.
The two gunmen did not, however, make good their escape as following this last exchange of fire the motor-cycle on which the two gunmen were riding skidded and fell. The motor-cyclist had collapsed to the ground. He died shortly thereafter. He had a gun-shot wound in his chest. He was later identified as one Lee Kok Chin (the deceased). A loaded Llama pistol and some live ammunition were recovered from his person.
In the meanwhile, the gunman who was riding on the pillion recovered from the fall and approached a station wagon, No SBG 9374 B, which had stopped in the traffic near the fallen motor-cycle, pointing the gun he was holding in his hand at the driver. As he approached the station wagon he fired a shot into the road near the rear of the station wagon. The driver and her passenger got out of the station wagon and as the driver walked away the gunman fired another shot into the ground, got into the station wagon and sped away in the direction of Maxwell Road. The spent bullets from the two shots fired by the gunman into the road were later recovered and identified by the expert witness called by the prosecution as Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullets.
We must return to the exchange of fire in the premises of Tin Sing Goldsmiths. Besides Karamjit Singh, Ou Kai San, the salesman, was also wounded. He was taken to the Singapore General Hospital for surgical treatment during the course of which a spent bullet was recovered from the region of his neck. This too was later identified by the expert witness called by the prosecution as a Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullet.
The four spent Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullets we have referred to earlier were sent to the Criminalistic Laboratory together with Karamjit Singh`s Smith & Wesson revolver and the Llama pistol recovered from the person of the deceased. The evidence of the principal scientific officer from the Criminalistic Laboratory at the trial was that all four Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullets were fired from the same gun and that gun could not be the Smith & Wesson revolver or the Llama pistol as neither of these two weapons could fire a Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullet.
Later, on the evening of 19 November 1992, the station wagon No SBG 9374 B which the gunman had hijacked to make his getaway was found abandoned near Market Street. The Scene of Crime Unit dusted the station wagon for fingerprints and lifted from the inside of the top right hand corner of the glass pane of the door at the driver`s side a partial fingerprint mark. A fingerprint expert from the Criminal Records Office, Criminal Investigation Department, gave evidence at the trial that he found at least 16 matching characteristics between the partial fingerprint mark lifted from the station wagon and a print taken from the appellant`s left little finger which enabled him to make a positive identification that the partial fingerprint mark lifted from the station wagon was that made by the appellant`s left little finger. The reliability of the `fingerprint` evidence which was a key question at trial was not pursued on appeal.
It seemed clear to us, as it also seemed clear to the learned trial judge, that the four Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullets were fired by the gunman who had hijacked the station wagon and had left the imprint of his left little finger on the inside of the top right hand corner of the glass pane of the door at the driver`s side.
Thus, the appellant who was arrested by the Malaysian police in connection with some alleged offences in Malaysia on 23 November 1993 and held at Bukit Mertajam Police Station until he was handed over to the Singapore police at Penang on 29 December 1993 was connected with the shooting at the premises of Tin Sing Goldsmiths on 19 November 1992 and the hijacking of the station wagon shortly thereafter.
The prosecution led further evidence from two witnesses who were acquainted with the appellant. Ng Swee Cheng, the girlfriend of the deceased, testified that the appellant, whom she knew as Ah Soon, was a friend of the deceased. She had first met the appellant when she was with the deceased in Penang in 1991. About a week before 19 November 1992 the deceased had come to Singapore and stayed with her at her flat. The appellant, too, was then in Singapore although she did not know where he stayed. She remembered going out to dinner with the appellant and the deceased. She also remembered that she had received a telephone call from the appellant at her flat inquiring after the deceased. On 19 November 1992 at about 7pm she had received a telephone call from the appellant who told her that the deceased had been shot at by the police. He sounded agitated and said that he had to leave for Malaysia immediately. He gave Ng Swee Cheng the pager number of the deceased`s elder brother in Penang and requested her to convey the bad news to him. Ng Swee Cheng had managed to do this through a commercial paging service in Penang.
The other witness, Han How Eng, testified that he was a friend of the appellant and that the appellant was in Singapore towards the end of 1992 when the appellant had stayed with him for five or six days during the visit. On the last day of this visit the appellant had telephoned Han How Eng at his place of work between 3pm and 4pm and told him that he was going back to Penang. When Han How Eng returned home that evening he found that the appellant had in fact left. He could not be more specific of the dates (towards the end of 1992) the appellant had stayed with him.
The evidence of these two witnesses was to connect the appellant further to the shooting at the premises of Tin Sing Goldsmiths on 19 November 1992 by showing that the appellant was in Singapore on that date up to between 3pm and 4pm if not to about 7pm.
After the appellant was brought back to Singapore on 29 December 1993 three statements were recorded from him under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code in respect of three charges with which he was charged. At trial the admissibility of these three statements was challenged but the learned trial judge, after a voir dire, admitted them in evidence as part of the prosecution`s case as having been made voluntarily. The admissibility of these three statements was not challenged on appeal.
In respect of the first charge he said: 
 
I did not open fire. It was my friend Ah Chin who opened fire. Ah Chin told me to go in to take the jewelleries. Before I entered the shop, Ah Chin handed me a false pistol which I could use to threaten people. Initially I have no intention of doing it but Ah Chin pestered me to do it. That is all.`
 
 
 
In respect of the second charge he said: 
 
I fired two shots in the air and escaped in a getaway car. I have no intention of causing any injury at all. I did not know at that time whether the pistol was a real or false one. My intention at that time was to leave the place as soon as possible. That is all.`
 
 
 
And in respect of the third charge he said: 
 
I don`t know whether the pistol I was armed with was a real one. Ah Chin told me it was a false one. That is all.`
 
 
 
The foregoing summarizes the material evidence at the close of the prosecution`s case. The learned trial judge having observed that `counsel very properly declined to make a submission of no case` called on the appellant to enter upon his defence. The appellant elected to and gave evidence on oath.
On appeal, however, it was contended that the learned trial judge had erred in law in calling on the appellant to enter upon his defence at the close of the prosecution`s case. Mr Karpal Singh, counsel for the appellant, contended that the learned trial judge had based his decision to call on the appellant to make his defence, as indeed he was bound to, on the test enunciated by Lord Diplock in the Privy Council in the now celebrated case of , an appeal from this court. This test is all too well known to every lawyer who practises in the criminal jurisdiction of our courts. It has been re-stated over and over again by our courts and is now too well entrenched in our criminal jurisprudence to bear re-examination. But Mr Karpal Singh invited us to re-examine the test and reject the minimum evaluation of the evidence as advanced by 
 Haw Tua Tau 
, that is to say that the evidence at that stage of the trial was not inherently incredible, which if unrebutted would warrant the appellant`s conviction before his defence is called and opt for a maximum evaluation of the evidence which would require the court to rule that a case beyond reasonable doubt had been made out against the appellant before calling his defence. He reminded us that the Malaysian Supreme Court had recently in rejected the minimum evaluation test for the maximum evaluation test.
It seems to us that the Malaysian Supreme Court laid emphasis on the words 
 `would warrant a conviction` 
 in s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code thus ignoring the words 
 ""if unrebutted` 
 as this court had done in and came to the conclusion that only proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
 would warrant a conviction 
. In 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 at p 52 Lord Diplock said this of 
 Ong Kiang Kek 
: 
 
... in the case of there are certain passages that seem, upon a literal reading, to suggest that unless at the end of the prosecution`s case the evidence adduced has already satisfied the judge beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty, the judge must order his acquittal. But this can hardly have been what that court intended, for it ignores the presence in the section of the crucial words `if unrebutted`, to which in other passages the court refers, and it converts the hypothetical question of law which the judge has to ask himself at that stage of the proceeding: `If I were to accept the prosecution`s evidence as accurate it establish the case against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt?` into an actual and quite different question of fact: `Has the prosecution`s evidence already done so?` ... their Lordships consider this to be an incorrect statement of the effect of [s 189(1)].
 
 
 
We respectively agree with Lord Diplock that the crucial words in s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which deals with the procedure to be followed at the close of the prosecution`s case, are `if unrebutted`. Clearly s 189(1) calls for a two-stage process in a criminal trial and this can only be achieved if a minimum evaluation of the evidence is made at the close of the prosecution`s case and this of necessity makes the question that the court has to ask itself at the close of the prosecution`s case a purely hypothetical one.
This was stated with admirable clarity by LP Thean J (as he then was) when delivering the judgment of this court in at pp 358-359. He said: 
 
In a criminal trial there are two critical stages at which the court has to make a decision. Under s 189 (1) of the CPC at the close of the case for the prosecution, the court has to decide whether the prosecution has made out a case, which, if unrebutted, would warrant a conviction of the accused. In deciding this question or issue, the court ought not to consider whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt. Lord Diplock in 
 Haw Tua Tau
 said at p 51:
 
 
 
`The crucial words in s [189(1)] are the words `if unrebutted`, which make the question that the court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such evidence that the words `if unrebutted` refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by s [189(1)] the court must act on the presumptions (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is inherently so incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inferences as to further facts or to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of any further explanation.
 
 
 
At that stage what the court has to decide is whether the evidence adduced, which is not inherently incredible and which, if it were accepted as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. If the court so decides that such essential element in the alleged offence has been established he must call for the defence. At that stage, however, he must keep an open mind about the veracity and accuracy of the evidence. After the defence has been called and evidence, if any, of the accused and other witnesses has been tendered and counsel for both sides have made their respective closing submissions, the court must, at that stage, proceed to examine the evidence adduced, assess the veracity and accuracy thereof and consider whether the prosecution has proved the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt`.
More recently Yong Pung How CJ re-stated the principles enunciated in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 in simpler terms in at p 262. He said: 
 
The principles on which a court should decide at the closing of the prosecution`s case whether there is a case for the accused to answer has been set out by the Privy Council in Although these principles are not without their problems in implementation, they have been followed by the courts in Singapore ever since. What these principles mean is that if the judge comes to the conclusion after hearing the prosecution`s evidence that there is evidence (not inherently incredible) which constitutes a prima facie case which the accused should be called upon to answer, he must call the accused to enter upon his defence. Of course, the accused might choose not to give evidence or call witnesses, and it is then left to the judge to assess the credibility of the witnesses and to decide in a case of conflict which of them he finds to be more credible, before deciding whether the case is proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
 
 
 
Rubin JC (as he then was) traced the formulation of the minimum evaluation test of the evidence at the close of the prosecution`s case enunciated by Lord Diplock in , which he described as `neither novel nor a total innovation of the criminal law`. We quote, with approval, what he said at p 951: 
 
The guidelines of Lord Diplock in were neither novel nor a total innovation of the criminal law. Practitioners at the criminal ar might be aware that what Lord Diplock attempted in was to modulate and amplify the practice directions issued by Lord Parker CJ to the benefit of magistrates and justices in 1962.
 
 
 
In a practice note dated 9 February 1962 (see [1962] 1 All ER 448, 
[1962] 1 WLR 227
), Lord Parker CJ sitting in the English Court of Appeal with Ashworth and Fenton Atkinson JJ set out for the benefit of magistrates guidelines when submissions were made on no case to answer. He said: 
 
`Those of us who sit in the Divisional Court have the distinct impression that justices today are being persuaded all too often to uphold a submission of no case. In the result, this court has had on many occasions to send the case back to the justices for the hearing to be continued with inevitable delay and increased expenditure. Without attempting to lay down any principle of law, we think that as a matter of practice justices should be guided by the following considerations:
 
 
 
(a) when there has been no evidence to prove an essential element in the alleged offence;
(b) when the evidence adduced by the prosecution has been so discredited as a result of cross-examination or is so manifestly unreliable that no reasonable tribunal could safely convict on it.
 
 
 
Apart from these two situations a tribunal should not in general be called on to reach a decision as to conviction or acquittal until the whole of the evidence which either side wishes to tender has been placed before it. If, however, a submission is made that there is no case to answer, the decision should depend not so much on whether the adjudicating tribunal (if compelled to do so) would at that stage convict or acquit but on whether the evidence is such that a reasonable tribunal might convict. If a reasonable tribunal might convict on the evidence so far laid before it, there is a case to answer.`
 
 
 
We were not persuaded by Mr Karpal Singh that the minimum evaluation of the evidence at the close of the prosecution`s case as propounded by and consistently followed in Singapore since then was not the proper test applicable to the provisions of s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which we set out below for the sake of completeness. It reads: 
 
When the case for the prosecution is concluded the court, if it finds that no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction, shall record an order of acquittal or, if it does not so find, shall call on the accused to enter on his defence.
 
 
 
Accordingly, on such an evaluation of the evidence a prima facie case was clearly made out against the appellant on each of the three charges with which he was charged and in our view the learned trial judge correctly called on the appellant to enter on his defence.
Mr Karpal Singh submitted that there was no direct identification of the appellant and that all the evidence connecting him with the shootings at the premises of Tin Sing Goldsmiths and outside it on 19 November 1992 and the subsequent hijacking of the station wagon were all circumstantial. Having carefully examined the prosecution`s evidence we were satisfied that the evidence inexorably pointed to the appellant and to the appellant alone. There was an unbroken chain of evidence which connected the shootings and the hijacking of the station wagon with the appellant. The fact that the spent Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullets recovered from Karamjit Singh`s socks and Ou Kai San`s neck region and from outside the premises of Tin Sing Goldsmiths and at the place from where the station wagon was hijacked could not be fired from either Karamjit Singh`s Smith & Wesson revolver or from the Llama pistol recovered from the deceased`s person pointed to a third person. The driver of the station wagon testified that she saw a gunman holding a gun and firing two shots into the road beside the station wagon as she got out from it and walked away; the two spent bullets recovered from the vicinity where the shots were fired into the road were identified as Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullets. Thus all the Win 9mm Luger Parabellum spent bullets were connected to the gun fired by that gunman. The driver of the station wagon also testified that it was that same gunman who hijacked her station wagon. The 
 coup de grace 
 was the identification of the fingerprint found on the inside of the top right hand corner of the glass pane of the door at the driver`s side of the station wagon as being the imprint of the appellant`s left little finger. In our view this was as positive an identification as one would wish. Although at trial it was contended that the fingerprint evidence was not reliable, no issue was made of this on appeal. Furthermore, there was the evidence of Ng Swee Cheng and Han How Eng both of whom were personally acquainted with the appellant who testified of the appellant`s presence in Singapore on 19 November 1992. Lastly, the appellant`s intention to cause injury must be gathered from the surrounding circumstances. In our judgment the submission of Mr Karpal Singh had no merit. So also, Mr Karpal Singh`s submission that the learned trial judge failed to make primary findings at the close of the prosecution`s case was neither here nor there since appellant`s counsel at the trial did not make a submission of `no case to answer`. The learned trial judge heartily agreed with defence counsel`s decision and called on the appellant to enter upon his defence. It followed that the learned trial judge must have been satisfied in his own mind that the prosecution`s evidence at the end of the prosecution`s case had made out a prima facie case on each of the three charges with which the appellant was charged, albeit on the test enunciated in 
 Haw Tua Tau 
, which if unrebutted, would have warranted a conviction on each of them.
The appellant elected to give evidence on oath. His defence was an alibi. He denied that he had participated in the shooting incidents at the premises of Tin Sing Goldsmiths and in the robbery of the station wagon on 19 November 1992. He said that although he had visited Singapore in the years previous to 1992 he had not been in Singapore during the year 1992. In fact he contended that from the middle of November 1992 to the end of that month he had stayed with a friend at the Boon Hwa Hotel in Taiping, Malaysia. However he failed to make good his alibi and he neither called the friend with whom he had stayed at the Boon Hwa Hotel in Taiping to testify on his behalf nor did he produce any other evidence of having stayed at the Boon Hwa Hotel in Taiping from the middle to the end of November 1992. His international passport which the Malaysian police had seized from him and handed over to the Singapore police showed no evidence of him having been in Singapore during the whole of 1992. He claimed that he had lost his restricted passport; in any event he maintained that he had not used the restricted passport to travel to Singapore at any time.
The appellant urged the court to disbelieve Han How Eng`s evidence as he contended that Han How Eng had been pressurized by the police into giving the evidence he gave. However, this was never put to Han How Eng in cross-examination.
The appellant also retracted his cautioned statements.
The appellant called only one witness to testify on his behalf. This was one Siow Kwen Sia who claimed to be a forensic consultant. At the conclusion of the trial the learned trial judge evaluated the whole of the evidence. We set out in full the learned trial judge`s evaluation of Siow Kwen Sia both as to his qualification as an expert in analysing fingerprint evidence as well as his evidence of his analysis, as this was the main plank of the defence`s case at trial. He said: 
 
The defence also called Siow Kwen Sia (Siow) the forensic consultant whose report had been put to Inspector Lau. Siow was frank in his admission that he had never undergone any training in fingerprint analysis. He had worked for 13 years as a forensic chemist with the Department of Chemistry in Kuala Lumpur but his work did not encompass fingerprint analysis. It was only after he left government service to start his own forensic consulting service in 1987 that he began to do some fingerprint work. He told the court that his knowledge of fingerprint analysis is what he himself picked up by reading books. He told the court that this was the first time that he was giving evidence in a criminal case as an expert on fingerprints.
 
 
 
Siow agreed with the suggestion of the DPP that in this case there was a good matching of positions between the two prints but he maintained, for the reasons given in his report, that there were only 11 matching characteristics in this case and that 11 were insufficient for the purpose of identification. Siow did not know what the probabilities were of two prints having 11 matching points being the prints from the same person but he said that he would look for at least 16 matching points before arriving at a positive identification because this was the yardstick used by Scotland Yard. He agreed that in different countries different numbers of matching points were considered adequate. He also agreed that there was no obvious inconsistencies in the two prints.
Siow`s basis for saying that Inspector Lau was wrong in treating as eight characteristics what should in fact be only four characteristics was an article published in the April 1982 edition of the 
 Journal of Forensic Sciences 
 headed `Fingerprint Comparison II: On the Development of a Single Filing and Searching System`. A perusal of this article shows that the article was a specialized article relating to the use of computerised automatic fingerprint identification (AFIS) system. I agree with Inspector Lau that it would not be proper to criticize the methods used for fingerprint comparisons with the naked eye by referring to parameters adopted or suggested for an AFIS system. I was also not persuaded that the characteristics said to be unclear by Siow was in fact unclear.
I rejected Siow`s criticism of Inspector Lau`s report. I accepted the evidence of Inspector Lau that there were 16 matching characteristics between the two prints and that based on that the possibility of an error are so remote that this possibility can for all practical purposes be discounted.
The learned trial judge then said that he found the appellant`s explanation for the loss of his restricted passport `vague and ambivalent`; that he accepted the evidence of Ng Swee Cheng whom he found was a truthful witness; that he accepted the evidence of Han How Eng as he rejected the appellant`s evidence that Han How Eng had been pressurized by the police into giving the evidence that he gave; and that he was satisfied with and accepted the evidence of Inspector Lau that the fingerprint found on the glass pane of the station wagon was the fingerprint of the appellant. With all these findings we agreed entirely as they were fully supported by the evidence which were summarized earlier in this judgment.
It appeared to us that the learned trial judge did not give any weight to the retracted cautioned statements. This was right. It was not necessary.
Finally, the learned trial judge said in his judgment that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who fired the shot in Karamjit Singh`s ankle and that it was the shot fired by the appellant that wounded Ou Kai San. These were bare findings. However, in our judgment the learned trial judge cannot be faulted for having so found. The chain of circumstantial evidence connecting the two spent Win 9mm Luger Parabellum bullets recovered from Karamjit Singh`s socks on his right foot and from Ou Kai San`s neck region to the gun fired by the appellant at the station wagon and the identification of the fingerprint on the glass pane of the station wagon as the print of the appellant`s left little finger which we discussed earlier in this judgment amply justified these findings. The intention to injure was gathered from the surrounding circumstances. When a person returns the fire of another he must intend to injure that person. Thus the intention to injure Karamjit Singh. So also when a person fires a gun into a room in which there are several persons present he must intend to injure one or other of the persons in the room. Hence the intention to injure Ou Kai San.
It was for these reasons that we dismissed the appellant`s appeal and confirmed the sentence of death passed on him by the learned trial judge.

In the court below, the appellant was jointly charged with one Goh Cheng Kee for trafficking under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) read with s 34 of the Penal Code. The joint charge read: 
 
You (1) Loo Koon Seng
(2) Goh Cheng Kee
 
 
 
are charged that you on or about 23 June 1993 between 4.15pm and 4.40pm in Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by transporting five packets of substance containing not less than 55.59g of diamorphine from Saujana Road to Jalan Lokam in motor car SBE 6502D without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
 
 The prosecution case
 
An agreed statement of facts was tendered at the start of the trial under s 376 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`). It read: 
 
(1) The accused B1 is one Loo Koon Seng (Loo), who is also known as Han Cher Seng. Prior to his arrest, he was unemployed and was residing at Blk 706, Hougang Avenue 2, #06-175.
(2) The accused B2 is one Goh Cheng Kee (Goh), who is also known as Poa Kee. Prior to his arrest, he was unemployed and was residing at Blk 410, Saujana Road, #05-104. 
(3) On 23 June 1993, at about 3.25pm, Goh was observed by a team of officers (1st team) from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) driving vehicle no SBE 6502D (the car), a Honda Accord, entering the customs checkpoint at Woodlands going towards Johore Bahru. At about 4.05pm, Goh was seen coming out from the customs checkpoint at Woodlands in the same car. The car then proceeded into Bukit Timah Expressway (BKE), turning into Bukit Panjang Road, then into Bukit Panjang Ring Road and finally into Fajar Road. The party of CNB officers then waited along Bukit Panjang Road for the car to come out from Fajar Road. 
(4) Meanwhile, at about 1pm on the same day, Loo was seen by another party of CNB officers (2nd team) leaving the premises at Blk 706, Hougang Avenue 2, #06-175. He boarded a taxi and proceeded to Dairy Farm Estate where he picked up his wife, his son and his mother-in-law in the taxi. They next proceeded to Charcoal Grill Restaurant. At about 2.15pm, they left the restaurant and took a taxi to the Singapore Zoological Gardens. They bought the tickets and went into the zoo at about 2.30pm. 
(5) At about 3.55pm, Loo and his family left the zoo in another taxi. Loo dropped his family off at Petir Road Bus Interchange. He then proceeded alone in the taxi to Saujana Road where he alighted at about 4.15pm. 
(6) In the meantime, a third party of CNB officers at Blk 410, Saujana Road saw the car no SBE 6502D arriving at the said place at some time after 4pm. Goh was seen alighting from the car and leaving hurriedly with a plastic bag in his hand for Blk 410, Saujana Road. At about 4.12pm, Goh was seen coming out from the said Blk 410 and returning to the car. He drove off in the car and after about 30m [sic], he picked up Loo, who was waiting along Saujana Road. 
(7) Goh and Loo then travelled along Saujana Road, Fajar Road, Bukit Panjang Ring Road, Bangkit Road, Bukit Panjang Road and the BKE. From the BKE the car turned into the Pan Island Expressway (PIE), then Lornie Road, Braddell Road and Upper Serangoon Road. The car then made a U-turn along Upper Serangoon Road and turned into Upper Paya Lebar Road and then into Jalan Lokam. The car then turned into a lane in front of Chung Khiaw Bank. 
(8) At this juncture, Loo alighted from the car and walked towards a row of shophouses at Tai Keng Shopping Centre. Loo was seen holding an envelope and putting it into the left pocket of his trousers. Goh was still seated in the car. At about 4.40pm, at the groundfloor of No 16A Jalan Lokam, Loo was arrested by Staff Sergeant Yeoh Seng Hock and Sergeant Lek Siang Heng. He was then brought to S/Sgt Yeoh`s car. 
(9) S/Sgt Yeoh then led a party of officers from the Police Tactical Team (PTT) to where the car SBE 6502D was and arrested Goh. 
(10) Both Loo and Goh were handed over [to] the CNB officers. The investigating officer Staff Sergeant Soh Koh Tong then searched Loo. Among other things, one torn envelope containing four packets of greenish substance was found in his right trousers` pocket (marked `A1`). Another brown envelope containing one packet of granular substance was found in his left trousers` pocket (marked `B1`). 
(11) Helena Granroth, a scientific officer from the Department of Scientific Services (DSS), analysed the substances in `A1` and `B1`. The substance in `A1` was found to contain not less than 2.93g of diamorphine (Certificate Lab No 93039382 marked `P19`). The substance in `B1` was found to contain not less than 52.66g of diamorphine (Certificate Lab No 93039383 marked `P20`). 
(12) The urine samples of both Loo and Goh were sent to DSS for analysis for the presence of morphine. Ann Young, a scientific officer from the DSS, analysed the samples but was unable to detect the presence of morphine in both the samples (Certificates Lab Nos 93039068 and 93039069).
 
 
 
The investigating officer, Staff Sergeant Soh Koh Tong (PW5) testified that the appellant was taken to No 16A, Jalan Lokam after he was arrested. He searched the appellant in the hall there and recovered the two envelopes containing drugs from the pockets of his trousers (exhs `A` and `B`). No fingerprints were lifted from the exhibits. During the cross-examination of PW5, the second defendant`s statement recorded under s 122(6) of the CPC was tendered. It read: 
 
Han Cher Seng asked me to give him a lift in my car, SBE 6502D as he wanted to return money owed to me. I did not know that Han Cher Seng had heroin with him. That is all.
 
 
 
The prosecution also sought to admit four statements recorded from the appellant under s 121 of the CPC. The admissibility of these statements was challenged. A voir dire was accordingly held and at its conclusion, the learned judicial commissioner found that they were involuntary and rejected all of them.
No other evidence was adduced by the prosecution.
At the conclusion of the prosecution case, counsel for the appellant did not make a submission of no case to answer. The learned judicial commissioner found that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against the appellant. However, he ruled that the prosecution had failed to adduce sufficient evidence to prove that there was a common intention between the appellant and the second defendant to traffic in the drugs found on the appellant. He held that there was no link in the evidence showing that the second defendant `
 either had knowledge that [the appellant] had the five packets of heroin on him or that [the appellant] was carrying the heroin or had the same in his possession with the knowledge and consent of [the second defendant] 
`. As these elements were absent, he held that s 18(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act was inapplicable. Section 21 of the said Act was also not applicable as the drugs were not found in the vehicle of the second defendant. The second defendant was accordingly acquitted.
In consequence, the learned judicial commissioner amended the charge against the appellant to exclude the element of common intention. The amended charge read: 
 
You, Loo Koon Seng, are charged that you, on or about 23 June 1993 between 4.15pm and 4.40pm in Singapore did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by transporting five packets of substance containing not less than 55.59g of diamorphine from Saujana Road to Jalan Lokam in motor car SBE 6502D without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
After the amended charge was read to the appellant, he indicated that he wished to plead guilty. This was rejected by the learned judicial commissioner. The appellant`s defence was called but he declined to give any evidence.
 The trial judge`s findings
The learned judicial commissioner accepted the evidence that the appellant had travelled with the second defendant from Saujana Road to Jalan Lokam as a passenger in the second defendant`s car. He also accepted the evidence that the appellant was seen holding a brown envelope which he put into his left trouser pocket as he walked toward the shophouses at Tai Keng Shopping Centre, and that upon his arrest, this envelope was found in his left trouser pocket along with another torn envelope in his right trouser pocket. The brown envelope contained one packet of granular substance containing not less than 52.66g of diamorphine and the torn envelope contained four sachets of greenish granular substance which contained not less than 2.93g of diamorphine. The total weight was 55.59g. As a result, he found that the prosecution had proved that the appellant was in possession of the envelopes containing the packet and sachets of diamorphine, which the appellant had transported in the second defendant`s car.
The learned judicial commissioner invoked the statutory presumptions under s 18(2) and s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, that as the appellant was proved to have had possession of the drug, he was also presumed to have known the nature of that drug and that he was, until the contrary was proved, presumed to traffic in that drug by the overt act of transporting in the second defendant`s car.
The burden of proof therefore shifted to the appellant to rebut the operative presumptions. By remaining silent, the learned judicial commissioner held that the presumptions of fact against him became conclusive. The learned judicial commissioner also drew the inference that the appellant was engaged in trafficking the drugs found in his possession from his silence. The appellant was accordingly convicted and sentenced to death.
 The appeal
The appeal rested on two grounds:
 
 
(1) The agreed statement of facts suggested that the appellant had only just come into possession of the drugs in `exh B` at the car park in Jalan Lokam. 
 
(2) The failure to give evidence in his defence was due to the fact that he did so in order to avoid implicating the others who were arrested with him the same day.
  
 
 
Counsel for the appellant, Mr Tan Teow Yeow (`Mr Tan`), said that the charge of trafficking upon which the appellant was convicted was with respect of the overt act of transporting the drugs from Saujana Road to Jalan Lokam. He contended that there was no evidence that the appellant was in possession of the brown envelope (exh `B`) at anytime before he got out of the car at Jalan Lokam. He argued that the agreed statement of facts only showed that the appellant placed the brown envelope into his left trouser pocket when he alighted from the car and that it was recovered from him there. In this respect, he submitted that the most probable inference arising from the facts in para 8 of the agreed statement of facts was that the appellant was handed over the brown envelope just before he alighted from the car. This, he argued, was emphasized by the fact that he was seen putting it into his left pocket. It was therefore contended that the appellant could not have transported the drugs from the point he boarded the vehicle to the point where he alighted at Jalan Lokam.
We noted that under s 376(1) of the CPC, facts admitted in an agreed statement of facts which is signed by counsel for both parties, are conclusive evidence of facts admitted. We were not persuaded by counsel`s argument that the appellant only came into possession of the drugs at Jalan Lokam. The inference that the brown envelope was in the appellant`s possession throughout and was transported by him from Jalan Saujana in the second defendant`s car was clearly one which the learned judicial commissioner was entitled to draw on the evidence. We agreed with the learned judicial commissioner that as the appellant was found in possession of the drugs, he is presumed to have had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking under s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The onus of proving otherwise had shifted onto him. He was in a position to rebut the prosecution case and provide an explanation as to the manner in which he came into possession of the drugs. By remaining silent, the appellant had failed to rebut the presumption against him.
Turning to the next ground of appeal, Mr Tan referred to the fact that the appellant had wanted to plead guilty at the commencement of the trial and at the end of the prosecution case, when the second defendant was acquitted. It transpired that on the day the appellant was arrested three other persons were also arrested at the flat No 16A, Jalan Lokam. These three other persons were later charged for trafficking in CC 31/94. The appellant gave evidence as the principal defence witness in that case and in the process, implicated himself. At the conclusion of that trial, two of the accused persons were convicted on the lesser charge of possession and one was acquitted. The public prosecutor`s appeal was later dismissed by this court [ 417]. Mr Tan contended that the appellant had shown that he was more interested in saving the lives of the second defendant and the other three for whom he had given evidence. In the circumstances, it was argued that the appellant`s refusal to give evidence did not necessarily mean that he was guilty and that it was inappropriate for the learned judicial commissioner to have drawn such an adverse inference against him.
We find this ground of appeal to be equally without merit. We were of the opinion that there was no basis on the evidence for the contentions made on behalf of the appellant.
It is clear that any inferences that could be drawn under s 196(2)(a) of the CPC from an accused person`s silence were that which could be properly drawn under the circumstances. In this respect, we did not find the learned judicial commissioner to have erred in any way when he stated: 
 
He (the appellant) was in a position to contradict the prosecution case but he chose not to. In fact it was not a case of the accused returning to his home with the drugs. Instead he was found conveying the drugs, leaving the conveyance and walking with the drugs towards a row of shophouses far away from his home. I could and did reasonably conclude in the circumstances from his silence that he was engaged in trafficking the drugs found in his possession.
 
 
 
We were not disposed to disturb this finding. We agreed that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. The appeal was accordingly dismissed and the sentence of death confirmed.

The appellant faced two charges in the district court: one charge under s 43(3A) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) of driving a motor vehicle on a road whilst under disqualification from driving (`the first charge`); and one charge under s 3(1) of the Motor Vehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act (Cap 189) of using a motor vehicle whilst there was not in force in relation to the use of the vehicle a valid insurance policy in respect of third party risks (`the second charge`). Following a trial the appellant was convicted of both charges. In respect of the first charge, he was sentenced to two months` imprisonment and disqualified from driving all classes of vehicles for one year. In respect of the second charge, he was fined $600 and disqualified from driving Class 3 vehicles for one year. He appealed against his convictions. Having heard the submissions of his counsel and of the deputy public prosecutor, I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons in writing.
 The facts
The facts of the case were straightforward and undisputed. The offence occurred in a Housing and Development Board (`HDB`) car park in Yishun Central. The `road` which the appellant was alleged in the charge to have driven on was the driveway of the car park. Essentially, what happened was this: on 27 December 1993, at about 8am, the appellant drove a motor car SBN 4216 X from its original position at Lot 117 in front of Block 325 Yishun Central along the driveway of the car park, until he reached Lot 370 in front of Block 320 where he then parked the car. At no point did the appellant leave the physical compound of the car park itself.
During the trial in the court below, the appellant did not deny having driven the motor car. The only bone of contention between the prosecution and the defence was the question of whether the car park driveway constituted a road within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act. The district judge ruled that it did and it was this decision which the appellant sought to challenge on appeal.
 Definition of the word `road` - 
The word `road` is defined in s 2 of the Road Traffic Act as `any public road and any other road to which the public has access ...` (the remainder not being relevant for the purposes of the present appeal). Plainly and somewhat regrettably, it is not a definition capable of affording us much assistance, since it employs as one of its terms of reference the very word it is meant to explain.
In the course of the appeal counsel for the appellant sought to elucidate the scope of the above definition by relying primarily on the case of . In that case the magistrate, in considering whether a car park could be a `road` within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act, stated: 
 
In my opinion, to hold that a car park is a road would stretch too thinly the ordinary meaning of the word road. There must be some evidence to show that in addition to being a car park, the place is used, inter alia, as 
 a thoroughfare or shortcut for vehicles between two points outside of it.
` (
 e
mphasis added.)
 
 
 
Counsel contended that the above observation was especially pertinent in the present case because the evidence appeared to show that no vehicle entering from Yishun Central could drive through the car park and use it as a shortcut to emerge onto Yishun Ring Road. There was only one entrance to the car park and one exit from it, both from Yishun Central. In other words, the car park driveway along which the appellant had driven could not be said to constitute a 
 thoroughfare or shortcut for vehicles between two points outside of it 
 (emphasis added).
Counsel further submitted that the learned magistrate`s decision in was binding upon this court since the prosecution in 1 had brought an appeal to the High Court, which appeal was dismissed by the High Court. It should be pointed out, however, that the High Court in dismissing the prosecution`s appeal in delivered no written grounds of decision; and that strictly, therefore, there was no basis in the present case for the operation of the stare decisis principle.
More importantly, a perusal of the decision in showed plainly that any attempt to apply on a general scale the limits set in that case on the scope of the term `road` could lead only to artificial, even arbitrary, results. To say that in all cases a road must be a place forming a thoroughfare or shortcut between 
 two points outside of it 
 would mean, for example, that a cul-de-sac (not being a public road) could never amount to a road within the meaning of the Road Traffic Act, however much vehicular traffic might travel along it, simply because it was open at one point only!
I should add at this juncture that no intention exists herein to deprecate the learned magistrate`s decision in itself, based as it was on the facts of that case and on the somewhat clumsily drafted charge preferred. In 
 Ng Khiok Ngee`s 
 case1 the accused had hit the complainant`s car whilst driving his own car on the second storey of the Golden Shoe Multi Storey Carpark. He was charged under r 27(B) of the 1981 Road Traffic Rules with driving on a road otherwise than in an orderly and careful manner and with due regard for the safety of others. Unfortunately, however, the `road` specified in the charge against the accused was not a particular storey of the car park building, but the Golden Shoe Multi Storey Carpark itself. Read literally, this would have encompassed in effect the entire building structure, including all storeys, all parking lots and all office units! No doubt this was a case of infelicitous drafting; and in the circumstances, therefore, it made sense to hold that in order for a car park to amount to a road, there 
 
... must be some evidence to show that in addition to being a carpark, the place is used, inter alia, as a thoroughfare or shortcut for vehicles between two points outside of it.
 
 
 
 
 The English position
 
It should be noted, of course, that the magistrate in 
 Ng Khiok Ngee 
`s case1 also placed reliance on the views expressed by Streatfeild J in This was an appeal to the Queen`s Bench Division from a finding made by justices sitting in the magistrate`s court that a car park fronting the main road and surrounded on its other three sides by such barriers as hedges and railings could not constitute a `road` within the meaning of the English Road Traffic Act 1930. Streatfeild J, as one of the three judges of the Queen`s Bench Division, stated that he did not think `
 anybody in the ordinary acceptance of the word `road` would think of a car park as a road 
`. In support of this proposition, he referred to s 15(1) of the 1930 Road Traffic Act (in largely similar terms to s 67(1) of our Road Traffic Act), which dealt with the punishment of persons for driving when under the influence of drink or drugs, pointing out that the phrase employed in the section was `
 driving or attempting to drive ... a motor vehicle on a road or other public place 
`. In his view, 
 
the words `or other public place` are wide enough to embrace a car park such as have described in this case. If it had been simply `on a road` it may be that a public car park would not be embraced by the word `road`, but in s 15(1) there is that distinction between a road and another public place.
 
 
 
With respect, however, I could see no logical basis for the above observations. To say that a distinction appears to have been drawn in the Act between a `
 road 
` and `
 other public place 
` tells us nothing about the meaning of the word `
 road 
` itself; and to place car parks within the category of `
 other public place 
` simply because this seems a `
 wide enough 
` category is surely to put the cart before the horse: it brings us no closer to an understanding of that category denoted by the term `
 road 
`.
Indeed, if Streatfeild J`s intention was to establish a general proposition that a car park could never amount to a road, then it would appear that he was at odds with the principles consistently adhered to by the English courts; and in this respect it may be noted that neither of the other two judges sitting with Streatfeild J expressed agreement with the general statement of principle he seemed to be making. So far as may be discerned from the ratio decidendi of the various authorities, the only real test of what constitutes a `
 road 
` is, simply, whether the area or space in question can be said to be a road `
 as a matter of common sense and ordinary meaning 
`: see for example Lord Parker CJ`s judgment at p 470 of .
The same point was made in by Kilmer Brown J. In delivering the judgment of the Queen`s Bench Division, he re-affirmed that a court deciding whether a particular area or structure amounted to a `road` for the purposes of s 196(1) of the English Road Traffic Act 1971 (in pari materia with our s 2 definition of `road`) would consider: 
 
whether there is in fact in the ordinary understanding of the word a road, that is to say, whether or not there is a definable way between two points over which vehicles could pass.
 
 
 
It follows from the nature of the test that much will depend on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. Thus, in for example, Streatfeild J`s opinion on the question of car parks as roads appears not to have found favour with the English Court of Criminal Appeal. This was a case in which an appellant had been convicted of driving dangerously on a road. Counsel argued before the Court of Criminal Appeal that in fact the alleged offence had occurred in a marketplace, on a site laid out as a car park; and that such a site did not amount to a `road` within the meaning of s 257 of the English Road Traffic Act 1960 (``). The appellate court held, however, that on the evidence in the case, the jury had been entitled to find that the site was a `road` within the meaning of s 257.
 Applying the above test to the present case
Within the context of our own experience, the principles espoused in these English authorities clearly complement one of the legislative aims behind the Road Traffic Act, namely, protection of the public from vehicular traffic. Nor is the test too loosely put, since the definition of `road` in s 2 of the Road Traffic Act is subject to the limiting condition that it be a road to which `
 the public has access 
`. Thus, for example, an unnamed pathway leading off a main road to a picnic area may amount to a `road` within the meaning of s 2, if it is used by motor vehicles as a way of communication between the main road and the picnic area; and it is open to the public. On the other hand, a pathway on a rubber plantation to which only the plantation owner and his rubber workers have access would not amount to a `road` for the purposes of our Road Traffic Act, even if the plantation owner regularly drove his jeep along this pathway.
In the present case, the `road` along which the appellant was said to have driven his car was the driveway of the HDB car park for Blocks 325 and 320 Yishun Central. From the sketch plan shown as exh A, it was clear that the driveway was a definable way between the relevant HDB blocks and the main road Yishun Central; and, from the evidence given at trial, it was clear also that the driveway was a two-way carriageway along which vehicular traffic could comfortably pass. It seemed to me that any person driving along this driveway should have been most astonished to be told that they were not driving upon a `road`, simply because they could not exit through to Yishun Ring Road from the car park.
Having regard to all the circumstances of the case, therefore, I was of the view that the car park driveway in this case amounted to a `road` within the meaning of s 2 of the Road Traffic Act.
I should add also that throughout these proceedings, the appellant has not denied that the public had access to the said car park driveway. Indeed it would have been rather difficult for him to do so, having regard to the fact that this was an open-air HDB car park built on level ground and in the midst of a housing estate.
For the foregoing reasons, the district judge was, in my view, fully justified in finding that the appellant had driven his car on a `road` whilst under disqualification. The appeal was accordingly dismissed and the appellant`s sentences in respect of both charges affirmed.

This was an appeal by the appellant, Tan Yew Lee, against his conviction by Lai Kew Chai J on 2 September 1994 on an amended charge of having in his possession for the purpose of trafficking not less than 1,456.97g of diamorphine at about 2.30pm on 10 January 1994 at Block 263 Waterloo Street #20-216, Singapore (`the flat`), contrary to s 5(1)(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act, by virtue of s 17 and s 5 (2) of the same Act. The appellant was sentenced to death.
At about 2.20pm on 10 January 1994, Inspector Lim Fung Suan (`Inspector Lim`) of the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) led a party of CNB officers and raided the flat. The other officers were Staff Sergeant Lee Sung Lim (`Staff Sergeant Lee`), Acting Staff Sergeant Ronnie See (`Staff Sergeant See`), Corporal Mohamad Juahir Ismail (`Corporal Juahir`), Corporal Stanley Tan (`Corporal Tan`) and Corporal Jasni bin Abdul Rahman (`Corporal Jasni`).
Upon arrival at the flat, Staff Sergeant See telephoned the appellant, identifying himself, and asked the appellant to open the door. The appellant instead latched the door from inside. The prosecution`s evidence was that Corporal Juahir forced open the front gate with a crowbar. Staff Sergeant Lee used the same crowbar to prise open an opening between the second and third louvres of the flat`s window. Through the opening both Staff Sergeant Lee and Staff Sergeant See saw the appellant running about several times in a great hurry between the kitchen toilet and the kitchen sink. When Corporal Juahir was about to break open the main door, the appellant opened the door.
The appellant surrendered one sachet of heroin from the top drawer of a bedside table in his bedroom and another sachet from his right waistline pocket. The appellant admitted to Staff Sergeant See that he had flushed some packets of heroin down the toilet bowl. All the CNB officers then went down to the bottom of the flat`s rubbish chute, which was on the fifth storey, at about 2.55pm. The appellant was also brought down. On the way down, the appellant was paged. The appellant, when asked by Staff Sergeant Lee, said that an addict friend was waiting for him at the void deck of Block 263, Waterloo Street. Staff Sergeant Lee left the party and proceeded to the void deck.
Inspector Lim and Corporal Juahir opened the door of the rubbish chute terminal and pulled out the plastic bin. They found 20 packets of yellow granular substance (hereinafter referred to as `Group B`) on the top of the inside of the bin. Underneath was a torn OG paper bag lined with a Jack`s Cake House plastic bag. Inside the OG bag were three open packets, some loose granular substance (hereinafter referred to as (`Group A`) and a cutter. The items were removed and lined on the floor.
The appellant gave an oral statement to Staff Sergeant See in answer to questions asked by Staff Sergeant See. The Hokkien questions and answers were recorded down phonetically in English alphabets in a shorthand book which Inspector Lim was carrying. The question and answer session lasted 30 to 35 minutes. The investigating officer, Inspector Chow Toong Chee (`Inspector Chow`) arrived later at the scene.
It is not disputed that the yellow granular substance in Group B weighed some 8,629g, containing not less than 1,388g of diamorphine, and that the yellow granular substance in Group A weighed some 321.1g, containing not less than 51.72g of diamorphine. In addition, some 46.19g of granular substance was retrieved from the floor where the Group B exhibits were laid out and found to contain not less than 7.25g of diamorphine. 4.26g of granular substance was recovered from the floor where the Group A exhibits were laid out and found to contain not less than 0.72g of diamorphine. The heroin the appellant surrendered in his flat amounted to 8.3g and 7.51g with a diamorphine content of 1.41g and 1.29g respectively. The substance recovered from the toilet bowl in the flat weighed 1.17g and contained 0.01g of diamorphine. The heroin the appellant surrendered and those found in the flat did not form the subject matter of the charge. Two fingernail clippings were obtained from the appellant. The scientific officer was unable to detect any diamorphine on them.
The appellant`s fingerprints were not found on any of the packets retrieved from the rubbish chute, nor on the OG paper bag, the Jack`s Cake House plastic bag or the cutter. No other paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking was found in the flat. The rubbish chute, which was located under the flat`s kitchen sink, was examined by Inspector Chow but no trace of heroin was found.
The appellant was medically examined. That night, he suffered from drug withdrawal and was taken to Alexandra Hospital to be examined. He was then referred to Changi Hospital.
On 12 January he was taken to Alexandra Hospital for his pre-statement medical examination. He did not make any complaint to the doctor. The appellant`s statement taken under s 122 (6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) stated that the drugs found in the flat belonged to the appellant, but not those recovered from the rubbish chute. After the recording of the statement, the appellant was taken back to Alexandra Hospital for his post-statement medical examination. The doctor on her own accord noticed that there were three small bruises of 1cm each in vertical alignment on the inner aspect of his right upper arm. Other than that, no other injury was noted.
There was evidence that the cleaners had been instructed to clear the rubbish chutes by 12pm every day, but there was no evidence whether the chute in question was in fact so cleared on 10 January 1994.
At the trial, the appellant contested the admissibility of the oral statement given by the appellant to Staff Sergeant See. First, the appellant alleged that when he opened the door Corporal Juahir rushed in and started to hit him. The appellant squatted down and warded off the punches with his arms. The appellant said he was struck in the arms and chest. He was then handcuffed. Staff Sergeant See then came in, pulled the appellant`s hair and slapped the appellant`s head with his hand. Staff Sergeant See, Corporal Juahir and Corporal Jasni allegedly chided the appellant for making them perspire and wiped their hands on his shirt.
This was denied by Staff Sergeant See, Corporal Juahir and Corporal Jasni. Inspector Lim denied witnessing this. During the main trial, Staff Sergeant Lee also denied seeing the alleged assault. Corporal Juahir testified that the appellant was handcuffed the moment he opened the door. Dr Yeo Thoon Kiat, who examined the appellant during his pre-statement medical examination, stated in his report that the appellant did not complain of any pain or injury. Dr Serene Ang, who noticed the bruises during the post-examination medical examination, testified that they were finger marks caused by the appellant`s arms being held tightly. They were unlikely to be caused by punches or kicks because of their location and because they were too small. They were discovered by her and not brought to her attention by the appellant.
It was admitted that the officers who took the appellant for the medical examinations were Corporal Juahir and Corporal Jasni. The appellant testified that he did not tell the doctors of the assault because the two officers were with him and he was afraid that they would beat him up later. Nevertheless, it would appear that the medical evidence does not support the appellant`s allegation that he was assaulted. That being the case, the trial judge, having observed the demeanour of the appellant and the prosecution witnesses during the trial, was perfectly justified in coming to the conclusion that the appellant had not been assaulted.
Secondly, the appellant alleged that Staff Sergeant See had threatened to detain the appellant`s brother, sister-in-law and mother unless he confessed to having the drugs in his possession. The appellant`s evidence was that Inspector Lim had said something like `heroin` to Staff Sergeant See in English when he pulled out the bin from the rubbish chute terminal. Staff Sergeant See asked the appellant whom it belonged to and he replied that he did not know. Staff Sergeant See asked if the drugs belonged to him and the appellant answered `no`. Staff Sergeant See then said that in that case the drugs must belong to the appellant`s brother. The appellant protested that the drugs were found downstairs and that it was wrong to get his brother involved, but Staff Sergeant See replied that he had the right to detain the appellant`s family members under s 55 of the Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act. The appellant alleged that Staff Sergeant See then threatened to arrest the appellant`s brother and sister-in-law since their clothes were found upstairs. Staff Sergeant See said that he had the right to arrest the appellant`s entire family and that nobody would believe the appellant since the drugs were found directly below his flat. Staff Sergeant See was alleged to have said that if the appellant did not own up, it would be too late to do anything after they arrested his whole family. The appellant argued with him but Staff Sergeant See said that he had the right to confiscate the flat and arrest his family.
The appellant alleged that Staff Sergeant See then asked the appellant to `own up`. The appellant made Staff Sergeant See promise that he would not arrest his family. The appellant then `owned up`. Staff Sergeant See asked where the drugs came from. The appellant replied that he could not answer as the drugs were not his. Staff Sergeant See then suggested that the appellant think of a name and so the appellant did. Staff Sergeant See suggested that in that case, since the drugs were not the appellant`s the appellant was merely keeping it for a friend. The appellant agreed. Staff Sergeant See then asked the appellant to sign the shorthand book. The appellant testified that, if he did not sign the book, his family would be involved in the matter, so he had no choice. The appellant alleged that over 20 questions were asked and Staff Sergeant See only recorded the conversation after all the questions were asked.
The prosecution evidence was that the confession contained in the five answers to the five questions were made voluntarily. It was not disputed that the recording lasted 30 to 35 minutes.
Staff Sergeant See`s evidence was that only five questions were asked. Staff Sergeant See`s explanation for the length of time taken was that he had to `get to the nearest sound of the Hokkien dialect` and so he took a longer time to write. After the statement was recorded, Staff Sergeant See read and explained it to the appellant. Both of them then signed the shorthand book. Staff Sergeant See handed the book to Inspector Lim, who read the statement to the appellant. After that, Inspector Lim signed the book. Staff Sergeant See denied threatening the appellant or making him any promises.
Inspector Lim`s evidence was that he could not hear what was being said as he stayed away from them. He confirmed that he read the statement back to the appellant in Hokkien and the appellant did not object, so he signed the shorthand book. Inspector Lim could not remember whether any conversation took place between the appellant and Staff Sergeant See while he was removing the packets of drugs from the bin because he was engrossed in what he was doing. Before that, he did not hear any threat. During the interview, he was about 20 ft or six metres away. He was standing away from them because he did not want the appellant to feel a sense of being threatened by him. Corporals Jasni and Juahir were on each side of the appellant to prevent him from escaping.
Corporal Juahir`s testimony was that he did not understand Hokkien, but he could see that there were questions and answers, and that Staff Sergeant See wrote down each reply after it was given. Corporal Jasni`s evidence was similar to Corporal Juahir`s.
The trial judge disbelieved the appellant`s allegations. He held that the appellant did not strike him as the kind of person who would condemn himself merely because Staff Sergeant See had threatened to detain his family, a threat which, we might add, the appellant`s own evidence suggests that he knew could not be carried out. That being the case, there is no basis for upsetting the trial judge`s rejection of the appellant`s allegation.
During the trial, much was made of the fact that the recording took 30 to 35 minutes and that more transpired between Staff Sergeant See and the appellant than the recording of the five questions. That may well have been the case, but having held that the appellant could not and would not have been influenced by any of the alleged threats, even if they were made, this fact becomes quite immaterial. This finding that the appellant could not have been influenced by any threats allegedly made by Staff Sergeant See also made it clear that it could not have been the case that Staff Sergeant See had suggested the answers to the appellant. If that had been so, the appellant would simply have refused to sign the shorthand book.
At the appeal, counsel for the appellant raised the further point that the appellant was under the influence of drugs at the time he gave the statements. This point was never raised in the trial below. Counsel cited 
 Bucknell and Chodse on Misuse of Drugs 
 on the effects of opiates and included the relevant passage in his bundle of authorities. We are unable to understand just what this text is supposed to be an authority of. It is certainly not an authority for any proposition of law and it can hardly be said to be expert evidence. In our view, it would involve a massive exercise in creative thinking to say that the appellant was under the influence of drugs simply because some six or eight hours later he was shown to be suffering from some form or other of withdrawal. This ground of appeal is therefore without any merit. That being the case, the statement given by the appellant to Staff Sergeant See was rightly admitted.
The contents of the statement are: 
 
Q1: What is this?
Accused: Drug. 
Q2: How much? 
Accused: 20 over packets. I do not know how many packets. 
Q3: Whom these things belong to? 
Accused: I kept for friend. 
Q4: What is the name of your friend? 
Accused: I called him Ah Loy. 
Q5: How do you contact him? 
Accused: Usually be comes to my house to look for me. He comes to my house once in 4 or 5 days. Sometimes he comes once a week.
 
 
 
Whether the part about Ah Loy was or was not true is not really important, as both the prosecution and the defence agree that it is not. The point is that the answers were an admission that the appellant had the drugs in his possession.
Counsel then submitted that the photographs in the exhibits did not show how the window louvres had been forced open. He questioned the ability of the officers to see clearly what was happening in the flat. In our view, this is not material as the appellant admitted in court that he was running between the kitchen sink and the kitchen toilet, which is what the officers testified they saw.
The appellant`s explanation was that he had tried to dispose of the four or five packets of heroin down the wash basin, but they became stuck. So he scooped them up and dumped them into the toilet. We accept that the fingernail clippings were obtained from the appellant some four hours afterwards and that there can be good reasons why no heroin was found on them. Also, we note that none of the officers testified whether they saw that there was wet heroin on the appellant`s hands or not. Therefore there is, strictly speaking, no independent evidence to contradict the appellant`s explanation. However, the story is so incredible that we find it incapable of belief. We note in passing that there is no evidence of the packaging of the four or five packets of heroin, as the appellant said, or 15 packets, as the officers said the appellant told them, which he dumped in the kitchen sink or the toilet.
Counsel argued that the officers should have stationed somebody at the bottom of the rubbish chute so he could see the drugs coming down if the appellant had really tried to dispose of them that way. The short answer is that this was exactly what the officers intended to do. However, as matters turned out, the rubbish chute terminal was on the fifth floor and not the ground floor. The confusion in the mind of Corporal Tan, who was assigned to this task, is understandable and it is not surprising he could not locate the terminal at first.
Counsel then submitted that no fingerprint was found on any of the packets of drugs and that no heroin was found on the rubbish chute in the flat`s kitchen. This is of course relevant but, in our view, the fact that the appellant was seen running about between the kitchen sink and the toilet several times, after he had latched his door, supported the inference that it was he who had thrown down the drugs. The likelihood that the drugs came from some other flat sharing the same chute or was placed in the rubbish chute bin, for no apparent reason, we might add, is so miniscule that we cannot but discount it instantly.
Similarly, the questions raised by counsel as to whether this packet or that, or whether the OG bag or other packets were found at the top or at the bottom of the pile of drugs are neither here nor there. Who is to know how the packets of drugs tumbled on their way down from the 20th floor? Counsel made much of Inspector Lim`s evidence that he had to reach in to remove some of the packets of heroin. He suggested that this might be because the drugs were not at the top as the inspector testified. It seems quite clear to us, however, that what the inspector meant was that they were at the bottom of the pile of drugs, and not literally `all the way in`.
Likewise, the fact that some of the packets were not broken is neither here nor there. The photographs show that there was rubbish at the bottom of the bin. These would easily have cushioned the impact.
Counsel then brought up the point that similar plastic bags could be seen both inside and outside the bin. We agree with the trial judge that it would be pure speculation to suggest that they were somehow linked.
In the end, we are of the view that the fact of the confession, the fact that the appellant was running about between the kitchen sink and the kitchen toilet several times in a great hurry after he latched the door, and the fact that the drugs were found at the top of the bin at the bottom of his rubbish chute was sufficient evidence to allow the trial judge to lead to the conclusion that the appellant had thrown them down the rubbish chute. The fact that the appellant so readily submitted to the officers by surrendering the small amounts of drugs in his bedroom drawer and his waistline pocket supports the finding that the appellant was trying to give the appearance of cooperation and hence to pull the wool over the eyes of the CNB officers. His explanation that he did not dispose of these because he had forgotten about them simply defies belief for he appeared to have suddenly remembered them when he was arrested.
That being the case, we hold that the trial judge had sufficient evidence before him to justify his finding that the prosecution had proven beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the heroin found at the bottom of the rubbish chute. The appellant had not made any real attempt to rebut the presumption that he had the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking and the judge was right to decide that he had failed to do so.
Accordingly, we are of the view that the appellant was rightly convicted beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly we dismiss this appeal.

The appellant was charged with trafficking in a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (`MDA`). The charge against him read as follows: 
 
That you, Osman bin Din, on or about 24 December 1993 at about 6pm at the car park of Block 215 Boon Lay Place, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) by offering to sell five compressed blocks and one bundle containing 9,504g of cannabis to one Kho Hock Ann for a sum of $29,000 without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5 (1)(a) of the said Act punishable under s 33.
 
 
 
The court was also informed that there was another charge against the appellant for trafficking in 108.3g of cannabis between 4.45pm and 6pm on 24 December 1993. However, on the application of the prosecution, this charge was stood down pending the outcome of the preceding charge.
At the end of the case, the trial judge convicted the accused. He appealed against the conviction and at the end of the hearing we unanimously dismissed the appeal. We now state our reasons for so doing.
 The prosecution case
On 24 December 1993, Senior Staff Sergeant Shah Ni (`SSSgt Shah Ni`) from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) received information that a man would be arriving at McDonald`s Restaurant (`McDonald`s`) at Boon Lay Place around 5.30pm on the same day to sell about 10kg of cannabis for $30,000. He instructed five officers under his charge, namely, Staff Sergeant Mohamed Supari bin Solehon (`SSgt Supari`), Corporal Karlson Teh (`Cpl Teh`), Corporal Chua Swee Keong (`Cpl Chua`), Narcotics Officer Zulkifli bin Rahmat (`NO Zulkifli`) and Narcotics Officer Kho Hock Ann (`NO Kho`) to assist him in the operation. NO Kho would be the undercover agent and act as the purchaser whilst the rest would provide security cover for NO Kho and arrest the target upon receiving the signal from SSSgt Shah Ni.
At around 5.30pm, SSSgt Shah Ni, NO Zulkifli, Cpl Teh and Cpl Chua stationed themselves at various spots inside McDonald`s whilst SSgt Supari waited at the car park in front of McDonald`s, which was near Block 215 Boon Lay Place. NO Kho arrived in a car, registration no SBZ 4602B, and sat on one of the tables outside the restaurant. He was joined by one male Malay, later identified by the appellant as `Amin`. At about 5.45pm, the appellant arrived and was duly introduced by Amin to NO Kho. The appellant beckoned Kho to depart with him and they walked to the latter`s car which was then parked at the carpark behind McDonald`s.
On the way there, a brief conversation took place in Malay, in which NO Kho asked the appellant about the quantity and price of the goods and whether he could give a `commission`, to which the appellant replied that he had 10kg which he was selling for $30,000. However, he added that he would discount the price to $29,000.
Thereafter, they boarded Kho`s car and drove towards the carpark in front of McDonald`s where the appellant had intimated his car to be. When they entered the carpark, they both alighted and the appellant proceeded to wave his hand. Moments later, a Honda Accord (`the Honda`), registration no SBC 2468G, entered the carpark, flashed its headlights and pulled up in front of NO Kho`s car. The driver was subsequently identified as one Mohamed Zainal Ali Khan (`Zainal`).
Meanwhile, they were being observed by SSSgt Shah Ni, SSgt Supari and NO Zulkifli. The appellant walked towards the Honda, opened the right rear passenger door to retrieve a Sunnex travelling bag from within, carried it to NO Kho`s car and placed it in the trunk. Once the trunk of the car was closed, the other officers, having received a signal from SSSgt Shah Ni, came and arrested Zainal and the appellant. An immediate examination of the Sunnex bag revealed six blocks of greenish vegetable matter suspected to be cannabis. The interior of the Honda was also searched and a clutch bag was recovered beside the front passenger seat. Cpl Chua was the only one who did not observe the Sunnex bag being handled by the appellant.
At the CNB office at Jurong Police Divisional Headquarters, the exhibits were weighed in the presence of the appellant. The drugs were later analysed at the Department of Scientific Services and were confirmed to be cannabis, weighing 9,504g. The appellant was handed over to the investigating officer, Senior Staff Sergeant Cheong Wah Chow (`IO Cheong`).
Two statements were recorded from the appellant by IO Cheong with the assistance of a CNB Malay interpreter Abdul Razak bin Othman (`Abdul Razak`). They consisted of a cautioned statement made under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code on 25 December 1993 between 12.20am and 12.45am (`the s 122(6) statement`) and a long statement made on 28 December 1993 between 1.50pm and 4.40pm (`the long statement`). The appellant objected to the admissibility of these two statements and a voir dire was consequently held.
 Trial within a trial
IO Cheong testified that both statements had been voluntarily given with no threat, inducement or promise offered before or during the recording of the statement. This was corroborated by Abdul Razak`s testimony. Senior Staff Sergeant William Porter (`SSSgt Porter`) and Corporal Mohd Rashef (`Cpl Rashef`) were also called to testify at the voir dire as there was some suggestion that they had pressured the appellant.
SSSgt Porter stated that at about 7.20pm on 25 December 1993, Cpl Rashef and he had interviewed the appellant for the purpose of gathering intelligence. The interview lasted for about two hours. SSSgt Porter interviewed him again on 27 December 1993 at around 3.05pm to verify certain matters mentioned by the appellant in the previous interview. This interview lasted for approximately three hours.
The evidence of the appellant in the trial within a trial was as follows.
He was 56 years of age and attended school for only five years at the primary level. He was only taught in Malay and his level of proficiency in English was minimal.
After his arrest on 24 December 1993, he was questioned in a rough manner by IO Cheong and Abdul Razak. He was told by IO Cheong that he `would be making a statement and there was nothing to it`. Later he was ushered into IO Cheong`s room for questioning. The appellant told IO Cheong that the drugs belonged to Amin and, when he persisted in denying that the drugs were his, he was told by IO Cheong that he would be beaten up if he did not tell the truth. Abdul Razak added that he would be sent to the gallows.
Subsequently, a statement was prepared for the appellant to sign. Although unwilling, he later appended his signature when he was told by IO Cheong and Abdul Razak that `there was nothing to it`. The appellant claimed that the statement was not complete and had omitted to mention that the drugs belonged to Amin and the circumstances in which he was found with them.
As regards the long statement, the appellant claimed that he was interrogated, prior to recording that statement, on 25 and 27 December 1993, by SSSgt Porter and Cpl Rashef. He was told that, if he did not tell the truth, they would recommend that he be sent to the gallows. They uttered harsh words and made him shed tears. However, if he were to sign the statement, they would put in a good word and his sentence would be light. However, the appellant alleged that no statement was signed by him on 28 December 1993. It was only on 30 December 1993 when his family paid him a visit that he signed four times on some documents after being told by IO Cheong that `it was nothing`. No interpreter was present then. Basically, he denied ever making the incriminating parts of the long statement. His daughter, Rosidah bte Osman, and his wife, Sarinah bte Taslin, testified that when they visited the appellant he was made to sign a document but they were unable to shed any light on the nature of the document.
The trial judge ruled the statements to be admissible as he was satisfied that they had been made voluntarily by the appellant. He also concluded that the allegations of threats and inducements had been made up by the appellant. In so far as relevant, the statements which were admitted are set out as follows:
 Section 122(6) statement recorded on 25 December 1993:
 
I have nothing to say. That is all.
 
 
 
 
 Long statement recorded on 28 December 1993:
 
 
 
(8) Since 1991 my wife Sarinah is suffering from diabetes and high blood pressure which requires frequent treatment at the hospital. Her medical expenses are high. I had been looking for jobs to help out in her expenses but was unsuccessful. I also tried to borrow money from friends and was also unsuccessful. About one month ago in November 1993, sometime in the afternoon I met a friend named Ariffin at a coffeeshop at Tanglin Halt Road ... I had also tried to borrow money from Ariffin but he was unable to help me. Ariffin then asked me whether I would be willing to deliver drugs for someone if there was an opportunity as the money was good. I agreed and we exchanged our home telephone numbers ... Ariffin said he would contact once he had the news. 
 
(9) ... Ariffin did telephone me at my house on three or four occasions and said there was still no progress on the offer of delivering drugs for that `someone`. 
 
(10) On 24 December 93 sometime past 2pm, Ariffin telephoned me and said there were drugs to deliver. Ariffin asked me whether I was still interested to do it. Ariffin said there was a bag of `ganja` to be collected from his house at Holland Close and to be delivered to someone at the McDonald Restaurant at Boon Lay. For the errand I would be given between $4,000 to $5,000. I told Ariffin that I needed sometime to think over it and would call him back at his house in an hour`s time. Ariffin had said the drugs to [be] delivered was `ganja` meaning cannabis. I thought over the offer and also did not discuss it with anyone else. At about 4pm, Ariffin telephoned me again and asked what was my decision. I asked Ariffin about the transport arrangements and said I would not want to go by taxi to deliver the `ganja`. Ariffin said he would provide the transport when I came to meet him at the carpark at his flat at Holland Close. Ariffin did not inform me about the driver of the motorcar which was to transport me to Boon Lay. All Ariffin said was that there would be transport (sic) provided. 
 
(11) As the money was attractive I agreed to Ariffin`s offer. Ariffin told me to meet him at the carpark infront of his flat at about 5pm ... 
 
(12) I ... arrived at 4.45pm ... Shortly after Ariffin came and met me. He was carrying a greenish blue coloured travelling bag. Ariffin said the travelling bag contained the `ganja`. The travelling bag was to be handed over to `Amin` and a male Chinese who would be waiting there ... Ariffin said after I had given the travelling bag to Amin I should collect $29,000 from Amin. After collecting the money I should return to meet Ariffin and hand over the $29,000 to him and then I would be paid the $4,000 to $5,000 as promised by Ariffin. Just about the same time, a light grey coloured motorcar ... came and Ariffin told me to enter the said motorcar ... I saw the driver of the motorcar was a male Malay ... one Zainal whom I knew but had not met some two months already. Ariffin opened the rear car`s door and placed the greenish blue coloured travelling bag onto the rear passenger seat. At the same time he also placed a small grey coloured clutch bag onto the rear passenger seat and told me to hand it to Zainal. I got into the motorcar and sat at the rear passenger seat to keep an eye on the travelling bag containing the `ganja`. I also handed over the clutch bag to Zainal as directed by Ariffin. 
 
(13) ... The motorcar then turned into Boon Lay Place. The motorcar then turned into the carpark in front of Block 215 Boon Lay Place ... At the carpark I alighted and went back to the McDonald Restaurant on foot to locate Amin and the male Chinese. I spotted both of them seat at a stool in front of the McDonald Restaurant. I went up to Amin and Amin introduced the male Chinese to me. I am unable to remember the name now. Amin told me to follow the male Chinese to his motorcar which was parked at the carpark behind the McDonald Restaurant. I would then direct the male Chinese to drive his motorcar to where Zainal`s motorcar was waiting. On arrival at the carpark in front of Block 215, the male Chinese then parked his motorcar in a parking lot. In fact Zainal`s motorcar was parked a few parking lots away. I alighted from the male Chinese`s motorcar and went over to Zainal`s motorcar. I opened the rear door and took out the greenish blue coloured travelling bag from the rear passenger seat and walked over to the male Chinese`s motorcar. The male Chinese was standing at the rear of his motorcar with his motorcar`s boot opened. I then placed the greenish blue coloured travelling bag into the boot. At about that time, four or five officers came towards me and placed me under arrest.
  
 
 
 
 Prima facie case
 
The trial judge was satisfied that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case. Accordingly, by virtue of s 18(1)(a) and (2) of the MDA he was presumed to be in possession of the substance and to have the requisite knowledge. In this respect, we agreed with him that there was sufficient evidence adduced by the prosecution against the appellant for his defence to be called. The appellant elected to testify from the witness box.
 The defence case
The appellant met Ariffin whilst he was under detention in prison between 1984 and 1986. He also became acquainted with Amin in 1982-1983 whilst being detained at Medium Security Prison. Upon release, he tried to look for a job but was unsuccessful. In October 1993, the appellant met Amin at a food centre in Boon Lay Place and the latter asked the appellant whether he knew of anyone who was interested in selling drugs. The appellant replied that he had just been released from prison and had no drugs. Amin gave the appellant his pager number and the appellant provided Amin with his telephone number. The appellant then requested Amin to keep him informed of any employment prospects.
On another occasion, the appellant saw Ariffin at Geylang Market and had a brief conversation, in which he asked Ariffin for a loan of $400 to $500. Two weeks later, the appellant happened to meet both Amin and Ariffin at a coffee shop at Tanglin Halt. The appellant reminded Ariffin about the loan to meet his wife`s medical expenses. Ariffin had no immediate funds and promised to get in touch with the appellant later. They exchanged their home telephone numbers.
On 24 December 1993, Ariffin telephoned the appellant at around 4pm and told him that he could lend the appellant $200 and asked him to come and collect it at his place at Holland Close. When he arrived, Ariffin came down and met the appellant at the void deck of the block. He gave the money to the appellant and asked him if the could deliver a `thing` to Amin at McDonald`s at Boon Lay Place. The appellant was initially reluctant and told Ariffin that he had no time to run any errand. Upon being persuaded, he relented and enquired about the ` thing` but was told that it was nothing and that he did not need to know about it. Ariffin then went back upstairs and a few minutes later arrived with a Sunnex travelling bag.
The appellant stated that he could not take the MRT as the Sunnex travelling bag looked heavy. Ariffin said that he would get a friend to drive him. Moments later, Zainal drove the Honda over and Ariffin placed the Sunnex travelling bag on the rear passenger seat. The appellant exchanged greetings with Zainal, whom he had also met once at Geylang Market. Ariffin also took out a small clutch bag and threw it into the car to the centre of the rear seat and told the appellant to give it to Zainal. The appellant alleged that he was unaware of the contents of the clutch bag and did not open it.
When the appellant arrived at McDonald`s, Amin introduced NO Kho to him and asked him to follow NO Kho to the latter`s car. On the way to NO Kho`s car, the appellant denied that the brief conversation regarding the sale of drugs took place. The appellant then directed NO Kho to the carpark where Zainal would be waiting. As the appellant and NO Kho alighted from the car, the police swarmed in and arrested the appellant and Zainal. The appellant denied ever touching the Sunnex travelling bag or carrying it out from the Honda into the trunk of NO Kho`s car.
In a nutshell, the appellant`s defence was that he was an innocent courier. He also claimed that the long statement was only handed to him on 30 December 1993 for signature and he denied ever making the incriminating parts of the long statement. Furthermore, the date `28/12/93` found at the end of the long statement was not in his handwriting.
The appellant further submitted that the failure to produce Amin and Ariffin was fatal to the prosecution case and there was insufficient evidence to tie the accused to the purported sale of the drugs as no money was exchanged. Moreover, the absence of fingerprints on the seized Sunnex travelling bag should be inferred in favour of him.
 The trial judge`s finding
The trial judge was satisfied by the account of SSSgt Shah Ni, SSgt Supari, NO Kho and NO Zulkifli about what happened at the scene, in particular, that the appellant had taken the Sunnex travelling bag from Zainal`s car and placed it into NO Kho`s car. Although Cpl Chua did not witness this event, the trial judge held that his account was attributable to either a faulty observation or recollection on his part at that time.
The trial judge decided that the appellant was not a truthful witness. In cross-examination, some discrepancies in his testimony emerged. When asked whether it occurred to him to inquire from Ariffin as to what the `thing` was, the appellant replied that Ariffin used to sell imitation goods and fancy ornaments and he therefore thought there was nothing to it. When he was questioned about whether he had specifically asked Ariffin that those things were indeed imitation goods and fancy ornaments, the appellant stated that Ariffin did not tell him about the `thing` that he was supposed to carry. However, when the question was immediately repeated, the appellant replied that Ariffin had mentioned to him that it was perfume. The trial judge was of the view that his reply was concocted at the eleventh hour.
On the issue of the non-production of the informer, Amin, the trial judge concluded that Amin`s evidence was not indispensable to the prosecution`s case and the failure to call him had not resulted in any gap in its case. In the trial judge`s view, it was particularly significant that counsel for the appellant had not seen fit to apply to the court for Amin to be produced at an earlier stage but had chosen to bring up the issue only in his closing submission.
With regard to the long statement, the trial judge was satisfied that it was indeed made by the appellant and that IO Cheong and Abdul Razak were witnesses of truth. In relation to the submissions on fingerprints, the trial judge was of the view that there was no primary or statutory obligation on the part of the authorities to undertake a fingerprint examination, particularly in the present case where the appellant was apprehended with the drugs. It was in any event within the statutory framework of the MDA for the appellant to explain how he came into possession of the drugs. Moreover, in the circumstances, the non-production of Woman Corporal Lim Leng Leng (`Cpl Lim`) who had dusted the exhibits did not in any manner cause any prejudice to the defence.
The trial judge also dealt briefly with the defence of entrapment. In this respect, it is well-settled since and reiterated in that this line of defence is not available to the appellant.
As such the trial judge was of the opinion that the appellant had failed to rebut the operative presumptions contained in s 18 of the MDA and he was convicted of the offence. The other charge which had been stood down pending the outcome of this trial was subsequently withdrawn by the Public Prosecutor and the appellant was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal in respect of that charge pursuant to s 177 of the Criminal Procedure Code.
 The arguments on appeal
Counsel for the appellants raised a number of grounds on appeal. First, it was submitted that the two statements made by the appellant should have been inadmissible. Secondly, there were several facets of the case which rendered it unsatisfactory, namely, that there were no fingerprints to incriminate the appellant and that the fingerprint expert should have been called to testify. In addition, the evidence of Cpl Chua should have been held in favour of the appellant. Thirdly, the appellant argued that the non-production of Amin should have raised a presumption against the prosecution under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act. Finally, counsel submitted that the trial judge had erred in concluding that the appellant had not discharged his burden of proving on the balance of probabilities his lack of knowledge that he was in possession of drugs.
 The admissibility of the appellant`s statements
In relation to both statements, the main complaint was that they were not given voluntarily but on account of an inducement or promise held out by both IO Cheong and Abdul Razak. The appellant was alleged to have been told that, if he should admit to the offence, he would receive a lighter sentence. Another complaint to that effect was that he was warned to tell the truth, otherwise he would be beaten up and sent to the gallows. Both IO Cheong and Abdul Razak were emphatic in denying that any promise or inducement was uttered.
As regards the allegation of `you had better tell the truth`, it has been held in that those words or equivalent expressions have always been held to import a threat or inducement. However, in a recent pronouncement of Chao Hick Tin JC, as he then was, in the facts of each case have to be looked at individually. This was the position adopted by the House of Lords in where Lord Hailsham stated that the question should be approached in a common sense way and in the context of the individual case. To this extent, we agree with the pronouncements of Chao JC and Lord Hailsham and find that, even if the allegation in the present case was true, we do not see how the expression could amount to a threat or inducement in the circumstances. Although those words were coupled with further statements to the effect that the appellant would be beaten up and sent to the gallows and verbal abuses which supposedly caused the appellant to shed tears, we are of the view that it was not sufficient to give the appellant any reasonable grounds for supposing that he would gain any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature by giving the statements. In any event, we would not disturb the trial judge`s finding that the appellant was lying and that there were no such threats or inducements as he had the opportunity to assess the demeanour of the appellant. We were not persuaded that the trial judge had made a wrong assessment of the evidence before him.
 Fingerprints
The next issue brought up by counsel related to the fingerprint examination undertaken by the CNB. The fingerprints of some of the exhibits were taken by Cpl Lim, who was not called as a witness. However, IO Cheong was present when Cpl Lim dusted the exhibits for prints and he testified that the six compressed blocks of cannabis and two sheets of newspaper which were in the Sunnex bag had produced a negative result, but he could not say whether no prints were lifted at all or whether prints were actually lifted but there were none to implicate the appellant. Moreover, Cpl Lim had not dusted either the Sunnex travelling or the clutch bag as, in IO Cheong`s opinion, it would have been pointless to do so as many people had handled them.
Counsel for the appellant contended that the appellant had been prejudiced by the failure of the prosecution to call Cpl Lim as a witness. Furthermore, the fact that there were no prints to implicate him was important in supporting his defence that the drugs did not belong to him and that he did not know the contents of the bag.
In our view, the submission ignores the crucial point that there is no primary or statutory obligation on the part of the authorities to undertake a fingerprint examination, particularly in a case such as this where the appellant was apprehended with the offending substance. In any event, within the statutory framework of the MDA, once possession is prima facie established, it is for the accused person to explain how he came into possession of the drugs. In this respect, we wholly agreed with the trial judge and the authority relied on in . In the circumstances, the absence of fingerprints was irrelevant as to whether the appellant had knowledge of the contents of the bag. Even if the drugs did not belong to him and he had not personally handled them, the appellant would still have fallen within the ambit of s 5(1)(a) and s 18(1)(a) of the MDA as there was sufficient evidence to show that he was in possession of the drugs and that he had offered to deliver them to Amin. Moreover, s 18(3) states : 
 
The presumptions provided for in this section shall not be rebutted by proof that the accused never had physical possession of the controlled drug.
 
 
 
Having regard to the evidence of IO Cheong and the officers who were at the scene of the crime, we were satisfied that there was no evidence of impropriety on the part of the prosecution or the investigating officer to suppress any evidence which might support the appellant`s case. We accepted that Cpl Lim was on leave at the material time and that it was not possible to contact her. In the circumstances, the submissions of counsel with respect to the fingerprints were without merit.
 The evidence of Cpl Chua
It was accepted by the trial judge that the testimonies of the officers at the scene of the crime, with the exception of Cpl Chua, were accurate. Counsel for the appellant submitted that Cpl Chua`s evidence would have been in favour of the appellant in showing that the appellant had not carried the Sunnex travelling bag and that the prosecution witnesses had fabricated their evidence. As regards the demeanour of the witnesses, we were reluctant to overturn the finding of the trial judge that SSSgt Shah Ni, SSgt Supari, NO Kho and NO Zulkifli were witnesses of truth as we did not see any basis on which the trial judge had unreasonably come to that conclusion.
As for Cpl Chua`s account, the trial judge had held that it was attributable to either a faulty observation or recollection on his part at that time. In this respect, he referred to an observation made by Abdul Hamid J in where he said at pp 63 and 64 : 
 
... Discrepancies may, in my view, be found in any case for the simple reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. Sometimes what may appear to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies. Absolute truth is I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common experience. In weighing the testimony of witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often recognized by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate need do is to consider the discrepancies. ... On the other hand, if the magistrate finds that the discrepancies do not detract from the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would then be proper for him to regard the discrepancies as trivial and ignore them. On the other hand, if the magistrate finds that the discrepancies relate to a material point which would seriously affect the value of the testimony of the witness or witnesses then it would be his duty to weigh the evidence carefully in arriving at the truth ...
 
 
 
In the circumstances, we were of the view that the discrepancy was but minor and not fatal to the prosecution case in the light of the overwhelming evidence in the prosecution`s favour.
 Failure to produce Amin, the informer
Counsel for the appellant submitted that the failure to call the informer, Amin, resulted in a serious gap in the prosecution case and thus an adverse inference should be drawn against the prosecution under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act. It was argued that Amin was more than just an informer and had actually participated in the transaction as he was instrumental in arranging the deal and was physically present to introduce the purported buyer to the purported seller. As such he may have given evidence to prove that the appellant was merely an innocent courier.
A somewhat similar contention was raised before the Court of Appeal in , a position which was subsequently reiterated in . In delivering the judgment of the court, I had stated at p 794: 
 
... Quite apart from the statutory protection of anonymity afforded to informers under s 23 of the Act [MDA], it is our view that [the informer] was not indispensable to the prosecution case which could have been proved through the evidence of ... as well as other independent evidence. The failure to call him did not result in any gap in the prosecution case as such.
 
 
 
In that case, the informer had played an even larger role as he had been there throughout the whole transaction and had even driven one of the appellants to pick up his friend in whose car the drugs were kept prior to the delivery, and had then taken them to a location where the appellant was subsequently arrested.
A similar position was also taken in the Malaysian case of where the informer had played an active role throughout the whole transaction. The Supreme Court held that the non-production of the informer did not affect the outcome of the case in the light of the other overwhelming evidence in favour of the prosecution.
We were disposed to agree with the trial judge in this instance that the non-production of the informer would not affect the outcome of the case in the light of the overwhelming evidence before us which we will now come to discuss.
 The appellant`s knowledge
The main feature of the appellant`s defence was that he was an innocent courier and had no knowledge whatsoever of the contents of the bag. The prosecution, having established possession, placed reliance on the operative presumptions under s 18(1)(a) and (2) of the MDA which provides as follows: 
 
(1) Any person who is proved to have in his possession or custody or under his control - 
(a) anything containing a controlled drug shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.
 
 
 
(2) Any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug.
 
 
 
Following the decision of the Court of Appeal in , it is settled law that the burden rests on the appellant to prove on the balance of probabilities that he was not in possession and did not know the nature of the controlled drug which was contained in the bag. For the following reasons below, we were not convinced that the appellant had discharged his burden on the balance of probabilities.
The appellant had known Amin and Ariffin when they were in prison. He himself had testified that he thought Ariffin was in jail for suspected drug dealing. He also said that Amin used to tell the prison inmates that he imported drugs through the airport. Furthermore, when he met Amin again at Boon Lay Place sometime in October or November 1993, the latter had enquired of him about drugs, stating that he was looking for people who were interested in selling them. This showed that Amin was still very much involved in the drug business and it was improbable that the appellant would not have known of this when he was delivering the Sunnex bag on that fateful day.
After his release from prison, the appellant had seen Amin at least twice, once at Boon Lay Place around October and November 1993 and the second occasion at Tanglin Halt in November 1993. Ariffin was present with Amin on the second occasion. The appellant had also met Ariffin two weeks prior to that at Geylang Market. Moreover, the appellant had seen Zainal before at Geylang Market and thus knew who he was. It could be attributable to mere chance that they had seen each other on those occasions and we would hesitate to dive into the realm of speculation. The point remains however that the appellant must have at least suspected that since Amin, Ariffin and Zainal knew each other and that Amin and Ariffin had at one time dealt in drugs, they must have been colluding to deliver some drugs on 24 December 1993.
This led to the observation that the appellant was not too curious or perturbed by what was in the Sunnex bag when another person in his position would have sought to find out. First, he had agreed to deliver the `thing` even before Ariffin had brought down the bag for him to look at. Secondly, a chink in the armour was revealed when the appellant was cross-examined. The relevant passages were these: 
 
Q: Did it not occur to you to find out at least what is the thing you are supposed to carry before you agree to it?
A: He used to sell imitation goods like perfumes and fancy ornaments. I thought there was nothing to it ... 
Q: Did you then tell Ariffin, `Are those things imitation goods and perfumes and fancy ornaments` ? 
A: He did not tell me anything about the things I was supposed to carry. He said that there was nothing to it. What I need to do was to give those things to Amin. 
Q: Now, you have not answered my question. I am asking you, did you ask Ariffin, the things that he asked you to carry, are they imitation goods or perfumes or fancy ornaments ? 
A: Ariffin told me that it was perfume. 
Q: So now you are telling the court for the first time that Ariffin did tell you that it was perfume that you are asked to carry. 
A: I was not asked earlier. This is the first time I was asked such a question.
 
 
 
The appellant seemed to contradict himself as he first stated that he thought they were imitation goods but later changed his story to say that he was told by Ariffin that it was perfume. The wavering response suggested that he knew the true contents of the bag but was reluctant to admit the fact. We wholly agreed with the trial judge that his reply that the bags contained perfume was clearly contrived.
It was improbable that the appellant did not find it strange that Amin had asked him to hand the `thing` to NO Kho, when all along he had been asked by Ariffin to deliver it to Amin, and the latter then distanced himself altogether from the whole event by asking the appellant to follow Kho to his car whilst he just sat around. The appellant had failed to give an acceptable explanation to this whole series of behaviour.
A further flaw was revealed in the appellant`s testimony when he stated that, although he had told Zainal that it was up to him to find a place to park, he did not know where Zainal had taken the car and neither did he enquire. Although there were two carparks, one behind and the other in front of McDonald`s, the appellant duly directed NO Kho to the latter. When they were in the carpark the appellant had said that he `thought Zainal would be there but apparently he had then not arrived`. These facts seemed to indicate that the appellant had planned to meet Zainal at that particular carpark and that his statement that he did not know where Zainal had gone could not be true. In fact, the appellant later changed his story and said that Zainal had told him that he would be waiting for the appellant at the carpark in front of McDonald`s.
Taken together with the statements which we decided were correctly admitted as well as the testimonies of the officers who were present at the material time, we were satisfied that the appellant was guilty of trafficking in drugs and had failed to rebut the operative presumptions contained in s 18 of the MDA. We found that the grounds of the appeal raised were without merit and accordingly we dismissed the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
By these two applications, the plaintiffs seek injunctions against the defendants in exactly the same terms of the injunctions they claim in the main suit. Apart from their claim for damages and delivering up, if the interim injunctions they seek were granted in these interlocutory proceedings, the plaintiffs would in substance obtain all the reliefs they seek without proceeding to a final hearing. In these circumstances, I think that it is legitimate for the court to have some regard for the apparent weight of the plaintiffs` case. While recognising that no issues of fact can be resolved on affidavit evidence, I think it is legitimate for the court to form some idea about the relative strengths and weaknesses of the parties` respective case by reference to facts or law not in dispute, at the same time making due allowance for the possibility that particular points of fact or law might be decided one way or the other at the trial. I think that the threshold for the plaintiffs to cross in this case should be somewhat higher than that their claim should not be frivolous or vexatious or that it should merely be arguable. The oft-cited passage from Lord Diplock`s speech in the American Cyanamid case should be used as guidelines rather than as immutable rules in the exercise of the court`s discretionary jurisdiction in the matter of granting or withholding interim reliefs.
The plaintiffs` claims are in two parts: copyright infringement and passing off. The claim on copyright infringement has undergone a considerable metamorphosis. The re-amended statement of claim and the further and better particulars show that the claim is asserted by the first plaintiffs on the basis, as I understand it, of certain outline drawings of car exhaust systems in the plaintiffs` catalogue `Power on the Road` published, it is said, in conjunction with the introduction of the Remus exhaust systems in the United Kingdom in November 1990. The alleged infringement is in the importation and sale etc of car exhaust systems which the defendants know or ought reasonably to know were not made with the consent of the first plaintiffs as the copyright owners.
It is conceded by the defendants that copyright can be infringed by dealings in articles which are three-dimensional reproductions of them. This is right in principle, but it is an open question to what extent it is applicable in the case at hand. There are certain obstacles or unanswered questions in the way of the plaintiffs` claim. Firstly, there is the question of originality. At least six out of the 17 drawings in the catalogue which the plaintiffs allege have been infringed appear to be substantial reproductions from drawings appearing in the 1990 issue of a catalogue published by Sebring, a long established firm in which the first plaintiffs` directors had worked for many years before they left to set up the first plaintiffs. There is therefore a serious question about originality at least in respect of these six drawings. This also rather throws doubt on the plaintiffs` claim in regard to the other drawings in the first plaintiffs` catalogue.
Plaintiffs` counsel said that there were presumptions in the law in favour of the plaintiffs in regard to these matters, but he refrained from pointing to any specific ones when invited to do so.
Secondly, the claim being based on s 32 of the Copyright Act, the defendants are liable only if they knew or ought to have known that the making of the articles was carried out without the consent of the copyright owner. Assuming in the plaintiffs` favour that they are the copyright owners in respect of all the 17 drawings, there is the issue whether the defendants were or are selling counterfeit products, ie products made without the first plaintiffs` consent. In this respect, there is evidence that the defendants were selling products obtained from Exclusive, the first plaintiffs` sole distributors in the United Kingdom. The first plaintiffs are unable to say, and they have not said, that these articles were not made with their consent.
There is also the exhaust system sold by the defendants to Dr Yeong. The plaintiffs have had it since November 1993, when Dr Yeong agreed to have it removed by the second plaintiffs from his car, no doubt for use as evidence in these proceedings. Although in the best position to do so from all points of view, no one on the plaintiffs` side has come forward with any positive evidence as to whether the unit is counterfeit or genuine. They could have, for example, cut open the unit and examined the inside and provided technical evidence to support their claim, but they have not done so. Instead, they are content to rely on the date of manufacture allegedly stamped on the unit and assert that no such product was made by the plaintiffs at that time.
Plaintiffs` counsel in his reply submission, rather late in the day if I may say so, referred to exh TMM-11, an invoice showing some units sold to an Indonesian party. The furthest he was able to go was to say that these units, to use his own words, could be fake. There is really no evidence that that is in fact so.
It does not seem to me that the plaintiffs` case on copyright infringement is founded on anything like a cogent basis.
The plaintiffs` main grievance appears to be that the defendants are marketing the Remus exhaust systems without being the first plaintiffs` authorized dealers. They seek in the main to stop a phenomenon known as parallel import. They seek to do this by relying on the law of passing off. I now turn to that aspect of their claim.
The plaintiffs` case is that the first plaintiffs follow a very high standard in the manufacture of their products, and that they maintain a high quality service in the distribution of their products through a careful selection of authorized distributors and dealers. Affidavit evidence was produced from customers of Fong Kim and Hui Auto, their authorized outlets, of the very good service provided by these outlets. The plaintiffs contend that it is part of the selling point of the Remus products that they carry a two-year warranty.
Plaintiffs` counsel referred to two Canadian cases, and . Counsel submitted that what the plaintiffs market is not just the merchandise itself; just like Sony and Seiko, what the plaintiffs market is a whole package consisting of the merchandise, the service and the warranty.
I think I need only to make two observations. Firstly, the extension of the law of passing off, which was sought to be done in the 
 Seiko 
 case2, was expressly struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada on appeal. See . The 
 Sony 
 case1 followed the first instance decision in the 
 Seiko 
 case2, and it did not go on appeal. So the last word on the subject in Canada, in terms of time and authority, is in the 
 Seiko 
 case on appeal 3 and that is to the effect that such an extension of the law of passing off is not warranted.
No case on the point has been decided in Singapore. So plaintiffs` counsel says there is a case for a trial, so as to resolve which of the two contending schools of thought should prevail here. This may be so, but in my view, as an argument for the grant of interim relief, it is of neutral, if not negative, value.
Secondly, the sort of quality control that the plaintiffs assert here, even taking everything in their favour, is nowhere near the institutionalized, systematic approach in either the 
 Sony 
 or the 
 Seiko 
 case2, on which the plaintiffs rely. There is nothing in any contract between the first plaintiffs and the second plaintiffs detailing the obligations to maintain quality or the standards of the quality, nor is there such thing between the second plaintiffs and Fong Kim or Hui Auto, their authorized dealers. Counsel for the defendants put it succinctly when he said that there is no discernible chain of assurance of standards. I must say I agree.
There is a conflict of evidence as to the actual practice in terms of the giving and honouring of warranties by Fong Kim or Hui Auto. These issues cannot be resolved here. What is clear is that there is no warranty card given at any stage of the distribution process, with the result that it is uncertain what are the terms of the warranty and on whose behalf any warranty is given.
I think on the whole that the plaintiffs` case based on the concept of a package, while no doubt arguable, does not appear to be of great strength. As I said earlier, one cannot make any definitive assessment at this stage in regard to either part of the plaintiffs` claim, but on a consideration of the case as it has presented itself at this stage, it does not look to me to be one where interim relief should be granted which would in effect give the plaintiffs all that they seek in the main action in terms of injunctive relief.
As the Court of Appeal said in , when considering an application for an interim injunction, whether mandatory or prohibitory, the court should take whichever course appears to carry the lower risk of injustice if it should turn out to have been wrong at the trial in the sense of granting relief to a party who fails to establish his right at the trial or of failing to grant relief to a party who succeeds at the trial. My assessment, which can of course be only tentative and provisional at this stage, is that there is a lower risk of injustice to refuse the applications than to grant them. In the event the plaintiffs succeed at the trial, injunctions might then be granted, and any loss and damage sustained by the plaintiffs could then be assessed. It would be easier to prove how much damage the plaintiffs had suffered as a result of the unauthorized sale by the defendants than to prove how much profit the defendants would have made if they had been allowed to continue selling. So from this point of view, I am also inclined to refuse the applications.
I would dismiss the plaintiffs` applications. As for costs, I was of two minds whether to order costs in the cause or to award the defendants their costs in the cause. Having heard the arguments, I am inclined to accept the defendants` argument that the plaintiffs should not have made these applications. I order that the defendants shall have the costs of these applications.
 Application dismissed

This is an appeal by the Public Prosecutor. The respondents referred to hereafter as `the two accused` were originally charged that they, in furtherance of the common intention of themselves and two other persons, had committed the offence of culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304(a) read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The two accused had pleaded guilty to this original charge, but the learned trial judge rejected their pleas of guilt on the basis that the facts as presented by the prosecution did not support the charge. The trial judge amended the charge to one of furthering a common intention to commit attempted murder under s 307 read with s 34 of the Penal Code and convicted the two accused on the amended charge. We heard the appeal by the Public Prosecutor on 20 March 1995 and we allowed the appeal. We convicted the two accused on the original charge and sentenced each of them to eight years` imprisonment and six strokes of the cane. We now give our reasons.
 At the trial
Both the accused had admitted to the statement of facts read by the prosecutor. The salient parts of the statement are reproduced below: 
 
Events leading to the death of the deceased
 
 
 
7 Investigations revealed that on 30 December 1993 around midnight, the deceased was drinking liquor in the room of the first accused on the third floor of the workers` quarters at Choa Chu Kang North. The second accused, one Phisit Thaenthaisong, also known as `Sit` to his friends (hereinafter `Phisit`) as well as one `Somjai` were also present in the room together with a few others.
8 Sometime later, the deceased had an argument with `Somjai` and Phisit over money matters. In the course of the quarrel, `Somjai` stood up and kicked the deceased on his face twice. The deceased, who was then seated, tried to block the kicks with his hands. Somjai then told Phisit `
 Ow lery Sit 
` in Thai which means `Come on Sit`. At this juncture, Phisit hit the deceased on his forehead twice with a liquor bottle. 
9 Thereafter, Phisit and `Somjai` carried the deceased to the window and threw him out of the said window. `Somjai` and Phisit then looked out of the window to check the condition of the deceased. `Somjai` and Phisit was later shouting in Thai `
 yang mai tai 
` which means `not yet died`. The first accused was seen taking a knife from his room. `Somjai` then ran out of the room followed by Phisit and the two accused persons. 
10 Meanwhile, the deceased was running away in a staggering fashion along a temporary access road below the workers` quarters. Having reached the ground floor, Phisit and `Somjai` pursued the deceased. `Somjai` and Phisit caught up with the deceased and Somjai hit him with a wooden pole several times. Phisit also hit the deceased on his leg twice with a wooden stick which he had picked up earlier. Following this, Somjai punched the deceased on his face. The deceased then collapsed to the ground and Somjai stamped his chest and kicked him. The deceased was groaning in pain and gasping for air. 
11 Somjai then dragged the deceased to a wooden fence adjoining the worksite. The deceased`s head was forced through a gap under the fence. Phisit assisted `Somjai` to push the deceased through the opening below the fence. Both of them then dragged the deceased towards a forested area away from the worksite. 
12 Along the way, the first and second accused met up with Somjai and Phisit. The second accused came up and kicked the deceased several times. The second accused also helped to drag the deceased towards the forested area. 
13 The deceased was dragged down a slope to a forested area and thereafter to a muddy stream off Stagmont Ring Road. `Somjai` and Phisit then waded into the stream with the deceased, following which Somjai pressed the deceased`s head into the muddy water. A bubbling sound was heard. 
14 Following this, `Somjai` approached the first accused and asked for the knife which the first accused was carrying. The first accused then handed the knife to `Somjai`, who took the knife, walked back into the water, lifted up the deceased`s head and slashed it, inflicting a fatal cut-throat injury. 
15 Thereafter, the first and second accused returned to their quarters followed by `Somjai` and Phisit. 
16 The two accused persons together with `Somjai` and Phisit had acted in furtherance of the common intention of all four of them to inflict serious bodily injury to wit, the fatal cut-throat injury, on the deceased. From the gravity of such bodily injury suffered, it was likely to cause death.
 
 
 
Autopsy
 
 
 
6 On 4 January 1994, an autopsy was conducted by the Deputy Director of the Department of Forensic Pathology, Dr Wee Keng Poh. Upon examination, Dr Wee discovered a fatal cut-throat injury in front of upper neck which extended from one side of the neck to the other, measuring 16 cm along the long axis and 10 cm at its widest point. Dr Wee also found a fracture measuring 26 cm at the top of the skull across the right superior frontal across the right parietal to right side of superior occipital bone. Extensive fractures were also found at the base of the skull. Dr Wee further listed out the following injuries found on the body of the deceased: 
i oblique laceration 3.5 x 2 cm right forehead just above the lateral aspect of the right lateral eyebrow; 
ii oblique laceration 2 x 1 cm lateral aspect of right eyebrow; 
iii group of two vertical lacerations measuring 1.5 x 0.5 cm and 1.5 x 0.4 cm over the left forehead; 
iv near horizontal laceration 1.5 x 1 cm left cheek and just below the left lower eyelid; 
v oblique laceration 2.5 x 0.5 cm over the left upper lip; 
vi near vertical laceration mid chin measuring 2.5 x 1.5 cm; 
vii bruise mid upper lip; 
viii cut 2 x 1 cm left thenar eminence of thumb anteriorly; 
ix cut 2.5 x 0.5 cm over the front of left palm; 
x cut 2 x 0.5 cm front of base of right finger and second knuckle; 
xi cut 2 x 0.5 cm over front of right fifth knuckle; 
xii front upper incisors knocked out of its sockets.
 
 
 
The certified cause of death was `cut-throat injury; contributed by: fractured skull`.
 
 
 
The learned trial judge had read the records of preliminary inquiry. Even though the statement of facts was admitted by both accused, the learned trial judge felt that there was some discrepancy between the facts as stated in the statement of agreed facts and the testimony of Dr Wee at the preliminary inquiry.
Thus, Dr Wee was called to testify before the learned trial judge. The question posed by the prosecution and the answer which ensued are as follows: 
 
Q: Now, there are certain facts which I wish to put forward to you and I wish you to express an opinion on it. Now, we have in evidence that after the deceased was thrown out of the window and subsequently one `Somjai` and one Phisit caught up with him, he was groaning in pain and gasping for air. We also have in evidence that at the muddy stream where the deceased`s head was pushed into the water, a bubbly sound was heard. Now, are you able to express any opinion as to when the head of the deceased was pressed into the water, was the deceased still alive?
A: My opinion - the deceased was at that point of time still alive.
 
 
 
The learned trial judge then interjected, and asked Dr Wee to consult the notes of the preliminary inquiry. He was asked whether he had anything to add to what he said at pp 163 and 164 of the notes. Dr Wee`s reply was that he had nothing to add. The questions which the learned trial judge had referred Dr Wee to were posed to Dr Wee at the preliminary inquiry and are as follows: 
 
Q: Is it possible that in this case the larynx of the deceased was cut after he was dead?
A: Because the body was badly decomposed, I can`t for sure say whether the cut throat injury was done when the deceased was alive. 
Q: You would not exclude the possibility that the larynx was cut after the deceased was dead? 
A: I cannot exclude that possibility.
 
 
 
After hearing Dr Wee`s affirmation that he had nothing to add to the answers which he gave at the preliminary inquiry, the learned trial judge rejected the guilty pleas of the two accused on the basis that the facts did not support the charge, because, in his words, `there was a doubt as to whether the deceased was alive when his throat was cut.` The trial then proceeded as indicated above, where the learned trial judge amended the charge and convicted the two accused on the amended charge, on the basis that since the deceased could be dead when his throat was cut, a charge for culpable homicide not amounting to murder was inappropriate and a charge for attempted murder (of a dead person) under s 307 was more appropriate.
 Issue before the court
The issue on appeal was whether the learned trial judge erred in law and in fact in failing to convict the two accused on their plea of guilty in respect of the charge under s 304(a).
In , a full bench of the Court of Appeal held, at p 145I: 
 
We reiterate therefore that, in our judgment, the recording of a statement of facts by the court following an accused`s plea of guilt, which began as a matter of practice which evolved primarily as a means of assisting judges to determine the appropriate sentence, has evolved into a legal duty on the court to record a statement of facts and to scrutinize the statement of facts for the explicit purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge are made out therein.
 
 
 
Although the statement of facts could also support the amended charge under s 307, the discretion of the court to alter the charge at any time before judgment as provided under s 163 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) does not necessarily permit the judge to amend the charge. The duty of the court as spelt out in 
 Mok Swee Kok 
 is to `scrutinize the statement of facts for the explicit purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge are made out therein.` While the court retains a discretion under s 187 of the CPC to convict the accused on his guilty plea, if the court finds that the statement of facts discloses that the offence for which the accused has been charged is made out, and the accused admits to the statement of facts without qualification and does not qualify the plea of guilt or the statement of facts at any stage of the proceedings, the court ought not to amend the charge and, unless there are exceptional circumstances otherwise, the court ought to convict the accused on that charge.
 Records of the preliminary inquiry
Were all the elements of the charge made out in the statement of facts? The learned trial judge had questioned the completeness of the statement of facts by referring to the records of the preliminary inquiry. With respect, the records of the preliminary inquiry were not evidence before the court. There are no provisions in the CPC for making these records admissible in evidence in the trial at the High Court, except in very limited situations which do not apply to the instant case: see s 368, CPC. Even where the court sitting in its appellate capacity specifically calls for such records as in , the Court of Criminal Appeal made it quite clear that they were aware that it was only exceptionally that the court would treat as evidence the contents of the records which were not testified to at the trial: see p 244 and s 55 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (SCJA). As the court said, in explaining the purpose of a preliminary inquiry, in at p 315G: 
 
A person brought before a magistrate for the purpose of a preliminary inquiry is not tried. Nor is he in fact charged. The purpose is to enquire into the evidence and then if there is sufficient evidence which makes out a prima facie case against the prisoner to frame a charge and to commit him to the High Court for trial.
 
 
 
Thus the learned trial judge ought not to have taken cognizance of the records of the preliminary inquiry. At the stage of the proceedings where the learned trial judge rejected the accused`s pleas of guilt, there was no evidence before him which justified his refusal to accept the guilty pleas.
 Analysis of the statement of facts and Dr Wee`s testimony before the learned trial judge
There was no reason for the learned trial judge to have raised any issue as to whether the deceased was dead or alive at the time the cut-throat injury was inflicted because the two accused clearly admitted that they had caused his death by admitting to the statement of facts.
When Dr Wee was recalled a second time, upon the trial judge expressing his doubts as to whether the deceased was dead or alive at the time the cut-throat injury was inflicted, Dr Wee unequivocally affirmed that in his opinion, the cause of death was the cut-throat injury. Cross-examination by counsel for the two accused did not shake his testimony or detract from his conclusion that the cause of death was the cut-throat injury. Counsel also did not produce any medical evidence to the contrary which would indicate that the deceased was dead at the time the cut-throat injury was inflicted. As such, Dr Wee`s medical opinion that the cause of death was the cut-throat injury remained intact.
 Conclusion
Thus, we allowed this appeal and we exercised our powers under s 54 of the SCJA (Cap 322) and convicted the two accused under the original charge and sentenced them accordingly as stated before.

Whether trial judge should have called for accused to enter defence
 
Three accused, namely, Foong Seow Ngiu (the first accused), Tan Aik Heng (the respondent) and Lim Ping Hwa (the third accused), were tried before the High Court on a charge that, on or about 8 April 1994 at about 3.35pm at Blk 62, Circuit Road, #08-307, Singapore, in furtherance of a common intention, they had in their possession 32 packets of substance containing not less than 26.37g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking and by virtue of ss 5(2) and 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) they trafficked in that quantity of diamorphine, an offence under s 5(1)(a) and punishable under s 33 of the Act. At the close of the prosecution`s case, the trial judge held that a prima facie case had been made out against the first and third accused but not against the respondent. Accordingly he acquitted the respondent without calling for his defence. Against the acquittal this appeal was brought and was heard before us. We allowed the appeal and remitted the case to the trial judge for the respondent`s defence to be called. We now give our reasons.
 The prosecution`s case
The evidence adduced by the prosecution at the close of its case was this. On 8 April 1994 at about 12pm, a team of officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) kept watch on Blk 62, Circuit Road, particularly the flat #08-307 (the flat) which belonged jointly to the first accused and his wife, Ng Soi May. At about 3pm, the officers were keeping watch from three different locations. Staff Sergeant K Jeyathasan (S/Sgt Jeyathasan), Cpl Chua Kek Kiong (Cpl Chua) and Azmi bin Basiriun (Azmi) positioned themselves at the MacPherson Secondary School along Circuit Road. Acting Staff Sergeant Lester Lim Hang Meng (Ag S/Sgt Lim) and Patrick Phoa Soo Yeong (Patrick Phoa) placed themselves on the ground floor of Blk 62. Another officer, Yap Keng Chuan (Yap) kept watch over the first accused`s flat from Blk 67 which overlooks Blk 62. Soon thereafter, Yap saw a person, who fitted the description of the first accused, leaving the flat and proceeding to the ground floor. He informed Ag S/Sgt Lim on the walkie-talkie and hurried down the staircase and joined Ag S/Sgt Lim and Patrick Phoa on the ground floor of Blk 62. All three of them waited at the lift landing on the ground floor. When the doors of the lift opened, they saw the first accused; he was holding a brown envelope in one hand. They arrested him after a brief struggle. During the struggle the first accused threw the brown envelope onto the floor a little distance away. The envelope was recovered and was found to contain ten sachets of granular substance, later discovered to be heroin. A key pouch was seized from the first accused. Thereafter, the officers went to the first accused`s flat. Cpl Chua opened the front wooden door with a key from the key pouch. S/Sgt Jeyathasan entered first with his revolver drawn. He saw the first accused`s wife, Ng Soi May, seated in the hall near a fish tank watching television, and the respondent and the third accused seated opposite each other on the floor at the entrance of the kitchen. S/Sgt Jeyathasan moved in and placed Ng Soi May under arrest. S/Sgt Lim placed the respondent under arrest and Cpl Chua placed the third accused under arrest.
Both Cpl Chua and S/Sgt Lim testified that they saw the third accused sitting at the entrance of the kitchen facing a large number of drug exhibits which was laid out before him. The respondent was sitting and leaning against the kitchen archway, facing the third accused. They saw the third accused holding a plastic spoon in his right hand and a small plastic sachet in his left. They could not remember seeing drugs on the spoon. They assumed that the third accused was filling the sachet. S/Sgt Lim testified that the respondent appeared to be talking to the third accused but was doing nothing else.
The drug exhibits laid out before the respondent and the third accused were:
 
 
(a) one big packet of granular substance; 
 
(b) 31 sachets of granular substance; 
 
(c) a smaller, loose sachet of granular substance; 
 
(d) a stack of 21 new empty plastic sachets; 
 
(e) an improvised weighing scale which has a metal rod with hooks at each end, a string tied in the centre and which was taped to a chair in front of the third accused, and at one end there was a plastic sachet with 1-cent, 5-cent and 20-cent coins in it serving as counterweight. 
 
(f) three disposable lighters; 
 
(g) a pair of scissors; 
 
(h) a pair of tweezers; 
 
(i) two packets of Marlboro cigarettes; 
 
(j) a plastic container with water; and 
 
(k) a light brown envelope.
  
 
 
S/Sgt Lim stated that he also saw a rolled up aluminium foil, which appeared to be unused, lying on the floor.
Senior Staff Sergeant Cheong Wah Chow (Sn S/Sgt Cheong) was the investigating officer. He testified that he arrived at the flat at about 4.20pm. He was briefed on the events that had transpired. S/Sgt Jeyathasan handed to him the brown envelope containing ten plastic sachets of granular substance and the key pouch (recovered from the first accused). He seized and marked the various drug exhibits. He also seized an orange coloured plastic bag containing a bundle of 280 new empty plastic sachets on top of the concrete slab in the kitchen. In addition, he seized from the respondent a handphone and a pager. The 21 new sachets seized from the floor each measured 10cm x 7.5cm, and were of the same size and transparency as the 31 sachets containing the granular substance. These 31 sachets were still not sealed. The ten sachets recovered from the first accused were of the same size and transparency as those seized in the flat, but were heat sealed. The 280 empty new sachets were also of the same size and transparency.
Sn S/Sgt Cheong further testified that he weighed one of the ten sachets. It weighed 7.94g. The 31 sachets together weighed 261.12g with their wrappings. The smaller sachet was half-filled. This was heat sealed, but with a small hole in one corner. He was of the view that this sachet could have been used for smoking. He also said that he came across an aluminium foil. He did not seize it as he thought it was not significant. He agreed with defence counsel that the rolled up paper, aluminium foil, tweezers and water were all articles which could be used for consumption of heroin. He agreed that the smaller sachet as well as one or more of the 31 sachets could be used for consumption. The three coins on the scale weighed 8g. Sn S/Sgt Cheong weighed one of the 31 sachets randomly and found that it weighed 7.8g. From his experience in the CNB, heroin was sold in the streets in sachet form with each sachet weighing approximately 8g. The plastic container with water can also be used for packing drugs.
Counsel for the respondent sought to admit the respondent`s statement taken under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). The statement was admitted, and it read as follows: 
 
I met `Ah Hwa` at the ground floor of Blk 62, Circuit Road. `Ah Hwa` brought me to a flat on the eighth storey to chitchat with his friend. I do not know the name of his friend. About five minutes later, CNB officers came and arrested all of us inside the flat.
 
 
 
The name `Ah Hwa` referred to the third accused.
Sn S/Sgt Cheong agreed with counsel for the third accused that in not seizing items like the aluminium foil and not submitting them for analysis he had caused an omission in the evidence. He also agreed that the rolled up piece of paper could be used for inhaling heroin and if that was so, the foil could have burnt marks and could have been used to inhale heroin. He did not see any plastic trimmings on the floor.
Counsel for the third accused introduced the third accused`s statement made under s 122(6) of the CPC which Sn S/Sgt Cheong had recorded on 9 April 1994 at midnight and the statement was admitted. It read as follows: 
 
When I went to the flat #08-307 at Blk 62, Circuit Road, the heroin was already on the floor at kitchen. The heroin does not belong to me and I do not know its ownership.
 
 
 
Inspector Vincent Teo Chin Seng attached to the financial investigation department of the CNB testified that $3,600 was seized from the respondent`s pocket, $1,100 from his wallet and $15,500 from the glove compartment of his car. The first accused was according to his financial profile quite poor. No evidence was given of the financial profile of the respondent and the third accused.
The big packet and the 31 sachets had 389.97g of granular substance with a net diamorphine content of 26.37g. The big packet contained 150.30g and the 31 smaller packets contained 239.67g. The purity level was 6.76%. The ten sachets contained 73.27g of granular substance with a net weight of 4.76g of diamorphine. The purity level was 6.46%. Helena Granroth, the scientific officer, testified that the difference between the two purity levels in relative terms was not significant. They were both of the same low grade of heroin.
Dr Lee Tong Kooi, the other scientific officer, testified that each of the accused had the following amounts of morphine in their urine samples:
 
 
(i) in respect of the first accused`s sample, 49.29mg per 5ml; 
 
(ii) in respect of the respondent`s sample, 425.4mg per 5ml; and 
 
(iii) in respect of the third accused`s sample, 359.7mg per 5ml.
  
 
 
The admissibility of the statements of the first accused recorded by Sn S/Sgt Cheong was objected to. After a voir dire, they were admitted in evidence. These comprised a statement made under s 122(6) of the CPC (the s 122(6) statement) recorded on 8 April 1994 at 10.33pm and a statement made under s 121 of the CPC (the s 121 statement) recorded on 12 April 1994 between 10.30am to 12.30pm and 13 April 1994 at 2pm. The s 122(6) statement was as follows:
Ah Heng brought the heroin to my flat for packing. The heroin does not belong to me or my wife Ng Soi May.
The first accused, in his examination-in-chief in the voir dire, referred to the respondent as `Ah Heng`. The relevant part of the s 121 statement was as follows: 
 
8 In end March 1994, `Ah Hwa` said he wanted to introduce ... `Ah Heng` to me ... .
9 On 6 April 1994 sometime in the afternoon I called `Ah Hwa` and told `Ah Hwa` to order one pound of heroin from `Ah Heng`. I told `Ah Hwa` to inform `Ah Heng` not to short change me on the weight of the pound of heroin. `Ah Hwa` assured me that this would not be the case and that he would bring `Ah Heng` to my flat to pack the pound of heroin into 60 packets. `Ah Hwa` quoted to me the pound of heroin at $3,600 and would be handed over to `Ah Heng` when he came with the heroin to my flat. I ordered the pound of heroin because I had an order of ten packets from `George` for $850 and also the extra packets for my own consumption and for future sale to `George`. 
10 On 7 April 1994, in the night, `George` telephoned me and wanted ten packets of heroin. I told him I do not have any stock with me and I could only supply him the ten packets the next day. 
11 On 8 April 1994 sometime past 3pm, `Ah Hwa` together with `Ah Heng` came to my flat. This was the first time `Ah Heng` came to my flat. `Ah Heng` was introduced to me by `Ah Hwa`. My wife, Ng Soi May, and I were in the flat. My wife was then watching TV programmes in the bedroom when `Ah Hwa` and `Ah Heng` came. She was not aware of these transaction in the flat. `Ah Heng` was carrying a carrier plastic bag. I opened the door for both of them to come in. The three of us went to the kitchen where `Ah Heng` took out a plastic packet of heroin from the carrier plastic bag. I handed $3,600 to `Ah Hwa` who in turn handed it to `Ah Heng`. I cannot remember whether `Ah Heng` kept the $3,600 in his pocket. I also could not remember who cut open the plastic bag where the three of us took some heroin out for smoking. I told `Ah Hwa` to assist me to pack ten packets of heroin for me first as I had a customer waiting for it. `Ah Hwa` then used a plastic spoon to scoop the heroin from the big plastic bag into smaller plastic packets. I sealed the ten packets of heroin by using a disposal lighter and a metal tweezer. Not long after `Ah Hwa` and I had packed the ten packets of heroin, `George` called up and said he would soon arrive at the lift on the ground floor of my block to collect the ten packets of heroin. I put the ten packets of heroin in a brown envelope and went downstairs. Before I left I told `Ah Hwa` and `Ah Heng` to continue packing the heroin into smaller packets. Before I left the flat my wife Seow May was still watching TV in the bedroom. When I opened the door of the flat she came out from the bedroom and continued to watch TV at the hall.
 
 
 
The relevant part of the s 121 statement recorded later was this: 
 
13 After opening the door, the CNB officers brought me into the flat. On entering my flat I saw my wife under arrest and was seated at the hall. She was still watching TV programmes. At the kitchen I also saw `Ah Hwa` and `Ah Heng` also under arrest and handcuffed. They were caught by CNB officers in the act of packing heroin into the smaller plastic packets earlier on when the CNB officers entered the flat. `Ah Heng` was then seated on the floor packing the heroin with his back facing the main door while `Ah Hwa` was facing the main door. I saw many packets of heroin on the floor. I presumed those were packed by `Ah Hwa` and `Ah Heng` when I had gone downstairs. After that, `Ah Hwa`, `Ah Heng` and I were put into our bedroom guarded by some CNB officers. My wife was kept in the hall.
 
 
 
 
 Decision below
 
At the close of the case for the prosecution, the trial judge decided that the prosecution had established a case against the first and third accused which, if unrebutted, would warrant their conviction of the charge and called upon them to enter on their defence. However, as against the respondent, he decided that no such prima facie case had been established. He was unable to come to a prima facie finding that the respondent had either possession or joint possession of the heroin within the meaning of s 18(4) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act). Mere knowledge of possession of the heroin was not enough. The respondent must be shown `to exercise practical control over it in some way as, for instance, the third accused was exercising control over the same.` The trial judge held that he was unable to draw any irresistible conclusion adverse to the respondent from his proximity to the various packets of heroin in view of the evidence that the smaller sachet of heroin could have been used for smoking, and this was supported by the fact that his urine had a high content of morphine. The respondent`s presence in the flat could have been for no other purpose than to consume heroin. His being in the company with the third accused could not be regarded as `knowledge and consent` within s 18(4) of the Act sufficient to constitute a joint possession. Acquiescence or condonation of the first and third accused`s conduct was not sufficient to saddle the respondent with joint possession.
The trial judge held that the first accused`s s 122(6) statement was not a confession. The words `brought the heroin to my flat for packing` did not state or irresistibly suggest the inference that the first accused had prior knowledge or that he had given consent to the respondent to bring the heroin to his flat, and `the second sentence reinforces this belief.` The trial judge took the view that there was nothing in the statement in the circumstances that would suggest the inference that the first accused had possession of the heroin or committed the offence of trafficking as charged. The trial judge therefore held that he could not take the s 122(6) statement into consideration against the respondent.
The trial judge, however, held that the s 121 statement made by the first accused was a confession. He said that, following , the confession by an accused against a co-accused can be the basis of a conviction. Such a confession is considered weak evidence against the other accused. Normally in a joint trial in the absence of any serious conflict between the direct evidence and the evidence contained in the confession of a co-accused, where the accuracy and credibility of that statement tentatively remains intact, it is sufficient for the court to take into consideration the contents of the statement as the primary facts and call on the accused to enter upon his defence. However, where circumstances are such that the statement on its face on a material point contradicts other evidence and/or constitutes self-contradictory evidence in respect of a material matter or matters, then it is dangerous to act on the statement as against the accused. This is because `the reliability` of the statement would be seriously in question, quite apart from any considerations of the appraisal or weight to be attached to the statement at the conclusion of the defence case.
The trial judge held that did not decide that all the primary evidence adduced by the prosecution must be acted upon irrespective of its quality and that any degree of assessment of the evidence should not be made at the end of the prosecution`s case under s 189(1) of the CPC. 
 Haw Tua Tau 
 decided that the court must act on the presumption that the primary evidence is true unless the evidence is inherently incredible.
Reverting to the statements made by the first accused, the trial judge was of the view that the allegations contained in his s 121 statement seriously contradicted those in his s 122(6) statement. In his s 122(6) statement he denied owning the heroin, but in his s 121 statement, he said that he bought it from the respondent for $3,600, the delivery taking place in his flat, and that the sale was arranged by the third accused. The trial judge held that the s 122(6) statement was not a confession by the first accused and therefore he could not take the statement against the respondent. Nonetheless, he could not ignore it and in the broader interest of justice he could and did take it into consideration in favour of the respondent. The s 122(6) statement contradicted the s 121 statement and impinged on the truth of or otherwise and the consequent reliability of the allegations therein against the respondent.
The trial judge also held that as the first accused was a poor man, it was inherently incredible that he could pay the respondent $3,600 in cash. A reasonable inference was that the first accused had in fact purchased it on credit earlier from some other source.
The trial judge formed the opinion that para 13 of the s 121 statement was volunteered to implicate the respondent, as the first accused related events to which he was not a witness. The first accused was not there when the CNB officers entered the flat, yet he stated the positions where the respondent and the third accused were seated respectively. The first accused also stated that he presumed that the packets of heroin on the floor were packed by the respondent and the third accused, whereas the CNB officers` evidence was that the respondent was only sitting there and talking to the third respondent. This made his allegations inherently incredible. The first accused might have implicated the respondent in the hope that Sn S/Sgt Cheong would look at his case and that of his wife sympathetically or reduce his charge.
The trial judge concluded that in any event the first accused`s s 121 statement did not say that the first accused had seen the respondent packing the heroin. It merely alleged selling and delivery by the respondent to the first and third accused. This would have occurred before the raid by the CNB officers. Thus, even if it was prima facie reliable, possession had passed from the hands of the respondent. As the respondent had divested himself of any further possession of the heroin upon delivery to the first accused, the respondent`s continued presence in the flat was to consume heroin. There was thus no common intention. Thus, if the s 121 statement was prima facie reliable, it would support the charge against the respondent of selling and delivering the heroin to the first accused. In that case, the s 121 statement cannot be taken into consideration against the respondent as it was not a confession in respect of `the same offence` falling within s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). The trial judge held that the fact that the heroin was on the kitchen floor at the time referred to in the charge distinguished the instant case from the Canadian case of . In that case, a buyer of opium arranged with the seller to meet at a certain place for the purpose of transacting the sale of the opium. As the seller was about to hand over the opium, the police intervened and the seller threw away the opium. It was held that the possession of the opium in the hands of the seller was with `the knowledge and consent` of the buyer because the buyer had arranged for the meeting to take place at that particular time and place. He had therefore consented to the seller being in possession of the opium.
 The appeal
Before we proceed further, it is necessary to focus on the charge that has been brought against the three accused. The charge in substance is that they, in furtherance of a common intention, had in their possession the quantity of diamorphine in question for the purpose of trafficking and by virtue of ss 5(2) and 17 of the Act trafficked in that quantity of diamorphine. In preferring this charge, the prosecution has invoked s 34 of the Penal Code and ss 5(2) and 17 of the Act. All these provisions are well known and it is unnecessary to set them out verbatim. Suffice it here to say that the prosecution relies on s 34 of the Penal Code to establish the liability of all the accused for the criminal act alleged to have been committed by one or more of them in furtherance of their common intention. The criminal act was the trafficking in the quantity of drugs. In proving trafficking in this case the prosecution needs only to show that the accused had possession of that quantity of drugs at the material time. Once possession is proved, s 17 of the Act comes into operation and the accused are presumed to have the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking, and unless this presumption is rebutted, under s 5(2) of the Act they committed the offence of trafficking. On the question of possession, the prosecution relies on s 18(4) of the Act which provides: 
 
Where one of two or more persons with the knowledge and consent of the rest has any controlled drug in his possession, it shall be deemed to be in the possession of each and all of them.
 
 
 
We now turn to the evidence adduced below on the question of possession. Apart from the first accused`s statements there was really no evidence to show that the respondent was in possession or joint possession of the drugs. The prosecution therefore relies principally on the statements. First the s 122(6) statement. That statement was to the effect (i) that the respondent brought the heroin to the first accused`s flat for packing; and (ii) that the heroin did not belong to the first accused or his wife. In relation to this statement, the first question is whether it is a confession. On this, the test has been laid down by Lord Guest in the Privy Council in at p 291: 
 
The test whether a statement is a confession is an objective one, whether to the mind of a reasonable person reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made it can be said to amount to a statement that the accused committed the offence or which suggested the inference that he committed the offence. The statement must be looked at as a whole and it must be considered on its own terms without reference to extrinsic facts ... It is not permissible in judging whether the statement is a confession to look at other facts which may not be known at the time or which may emerge in evidence at the trial.
 
 
 
The test was approved of by this court in . In our opinion, having regard to the terms of the charge and reading the statement at the time and in the circumstance in which it was made, the statement is a confession. The inference suggested by the statement was that the first accused was in possession of drugs. The content of this statement is not inherently incredible in the circumstances. That being so, there is evidence that the respondent took the drugs to the flat for packing and that the drugs were in the possession of the first and third accused at the time of their arrest. Thus, the first and third accused had possession of the drugs with the knowledge and of the respondent, and consequently under s 18(4) the respondent is deemed to be in possession of the drugs. Following from this, under s 17 all three of them are presumed to have the drugs in their possession for the purpose of trafficking. Whether a sale was contemplated or not at the same time is besides the point. This statement, if accepted, together with the other evidence adduced by the prosecution establishes the essential elements of the charge against the respondent.
Next, we turn to the s 121 statement made by the first accused, the material part of which has been set out above, and it is not necessary to repeat it. Briefly, it said that the third accused brought the respondent to the flat and through the third accused`s introduction the respondent sold a quantity of drugs to the first accused, for which the first accused paid the respondent the sum of $3,600. This statement is clearly a confession; and the trial judge has so found. Here again, this part of the statement is not inherently incredible in the circumstances. Thus, there is some evidence that the first and third accused, at the material time, had possession of the drugs with the knowledge and consent of the respondent. By selling and delivering the drugs to the first accused on the introduction and in the presence of the third accused the respondent had knowledge of and consented to the first and third accused having possession of the drugs. Hence, on the basis of this statement and the other evidence adduced, the essential elements of the charge have been established against the respondent.
We now come to the question of discrepancy or inconsistency between the two statements which the trial judge considered material and as a result he found that the relevant part of the s 121 statement `was tenuous and inherently weak or inconsistent with other evidence.` We accept that there are certainly discrepancies between the two statements - the trial judge considered them as contradictions. First, in the s 122(6) statement, the first accused said that the drugs did not belong to him, whereas in the s 121 statement, he said that he had bought them. But ownership of the drugs is not in issue and is not material to the charge. Next, there is a discrepancy that relates directly to the respondent`s involvement in the drugs. In the s 122(6) statement, the first accused said that the respondent brought the drugs to the flat for packing but in the s 121 statement, he said that the third accused brought the respondent to the flat and through the third accused`s introduction, he bought the drugs from the respondent for $3,600. Here again, we do not think that this discrepancy is really material - at any rate at this stage of the prosecution`s case. Both the statements incriminate the respondent, albeit in different ways. On the basis of either of the statements, he was involved in bringing the drugs to the flat, which form the subject matter of the charge. On the basis of either of them, he had knowledge of and consented to the first and third accused having possession of the drugs. In our opinion, at this stage of the prosecution`s case, these discrepancies between the two statements are not such as to nullify entirely the evidential value of either of the statements to the extent that neither of them is not even prima facie reliable. Of course, the discrepancies would certainly affect the weight to be attached to the first accused`s allegations against the respondent with which the court will be concerned at the end of the whole case, after hearing all the evidence including the evidence, if any, adduced by the defence.
As for the parts in para 13 of the first accused`s s 121 statement rejected by the trial judge, they are clearly speculation on the part of the first accused and they have no evidential value even at this stage. Any other inference to be drawn should be left to the trial judge at the conclusion of the whole case.
The trial judge in the instant case, if we may respectfully say so, has taken great pains in examining the two statements and made detailed evaluation of their accuracy and veracity by casting them against each other and against other evidence and came to the conclusion that the s 121 statement was tenuous, inherently weak or inconsistent with other evidence. With the utmost respect, it seems to us that such evaluation of evidence as carried out by him would be a proper and appropriate exercise to be carried out at the end of the case when all the evidence (including, if any, evidence adduced by the defence) has been placed before him. At the close of the prosecution`s case, however, the test to be applied in evaluating the evidence is that as laid down in . The test is too well known to need any repetition here. Suffice it here to say that it has been clearly expounded by Lord Diplock at pp 51-52 which repays close attention. It has been followed and applied consistently in our courts and has very recently been reaffirmed by this court in . With great respect, it is unnecessary for us to dwell upon or adopt other judicial elaborations or pronouncements of the same test, such as those found in and , which may give rise to some confusion.
In conclusion, in our judgment, at the close of the prosecution`s case, there is some evidence, not inherently incredible, which, if unaccepted, would establish all the essential elements of the charge against the respondent. His defence therefore ought to have been called. We have so ordered.

The appellant applied under s 96 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1994 Ed) (the LPA) for the High Court to direct the Law Society of Singapore to apply to the Chief Justice for the appointment of a disciplinary committee in respect of a complaint against an advocate and solicitor, Suppiah Thangaveloo (Thangaveloo). The High Court refused the appellant`s application. Instead, the court made an order affirming the determination of the Council of the Law Society that a formal investigation into the complaint was not necessary. The appellant appealed to the Court of Appeal against this order. We dismissed his appeal and we now give our reasons.
 The background to the appellant`s complaint
The appellant was arrested on 6 May 1986 and subsequently charged together with three other persons for abetting one Yee Kim Yeou (Yee) in trafficking 1,693.47g of diamorphine at Changi Airport. Tan Siang Leng (Tan) was one of the others charged together with the appellant. The appellant`s family engaged Thangaveloo to act as his counsel shortly after his arrest, but discharged him from acting further after between two to three months. This took place before the preliminary inquiry for the case was held. The appellant then appointed Mr Francis Seow as his counsel on or about 7 August 1986. Mr Francis Seow was in turn discharged, and Mr R Palakrishnan (Palakrishnan) was eventually appointed to act on the appellant`s behalf. Palakrishnan went on to represent the appellant during his trial. Thangaveloo also acted for Tan, for whom he eventually conducted the defence at the trial when the appellant was jointly tried. Tan, together with all the other accused persons, elected to remain silent. The appellant, however, gave evidence which touched on his relationship with Tan. In particular, the appellant testified about his attendance at a travel agency with Tan and the assistance he gave him in the purchase of an air ticket for Yee. This corroborated the only substantive direct evidence which the prosecution had linking Tan to the drug trafficking arrangement. Thangaveloo was instructed not to cross-examine the appellant. Nevertheless, in his closing submissions on behalf of Tan, Thangaveloo stated: 
 
The [appellant] is not found lying on one or two points but his entire testimony is a tissue of lies. It is a rehearsed, tailored testimony shoving all blame on [Tan] who is used as a pawn in weaving the [appellant`s] story.
 
 
 
This submission, along with other submissions to the effect that the appellant had fabricated his testimony, formed the basis of the appellant`s complaint to the Law Society about Thangaveloo`s professional misconduct. During the trial, counsel for the appellant (Palakrishnan) urged the court to expunge this aspect of Thangaveloo`s submissions. The trial judges declined to do so. All the accused persons were convicted as charged and their convictions were affirmed on appeal. However, Tan was acquitted by the Court of Appeal on the ground that his defence ought not to have been called. The judgment of the Court of Appeal is reported in [1993] 1 
 CLAS News 
 262 [and 
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 ]. Thangaveloo did not act for either the appellant or Tan in the appeal.
The appellant complained of Thangaveloo`s alleged misconduct to the Law Society on 15 September 1993. The Inquiry Committee (IC) which investigated the complaint found that it did not merit a formal investigation and the Council of the Law Society adopted this finding. The determination of the Council was affirmed by a judicial commissioner in the High Court and the appellant appealed against the court`s order.
In his written grounds of decision, the learned judicial commissioner dealt with three main allegations of misconduct raised on the appellant`s behalf by his counsel in the proceedings below, Mr JB Jeyaretnam. The first allegation of misconduct lay in Thangaveloo having attacked the appellant`s evidence in his final submission without having cross-examined the appellant. Second, contrary to his instructions from Tan, Thangaveloo had alleged that the appellant`s evidence was a tissue of lies. Finally, by so conducting himself, Thangaveloo had misled the court. The judicial commissioner saw no merit in these arguments. Rather, he opined that it was Thangaveloo`s duty to his client and to the court to demonstrate to what extent the evidence of the appellant could not be accepted. There was no apparent reference in the submissions to any instructions which the appellant might have communicated to Thangaveloo while the latter had acted for him. The judicial commissioner observed that it was not improper to attack the evidence of a witness, whether a co-accused or otherwise, in a criminal trial by reason only that counsel had not cross-examined the witness. Moreover, there was no suggestion from Tan that Thangaveloo had acted contrary to his instructions or had conducted himself in any manner otherwise than in accordance with his retainer. He owed a duty to Tan to carry out his lawful instructions but he owed no less a duty to the court to review the evidence against his client. He was expected to present reasoned arguments as to whether the evidence ought or ought not to be accepted and if it was the case that the evidence consisted of lies he should be permitted to say so. All in all, there was nothing to indicate how the court was misled. It was not shown that Thangaveloo suggested or relied on any fact which was not in evidence. The judicial commissioner was satisfied that Thangaveloo had acted in Tan`s best interests, reviewing the evidence of the appellant which implicated Tan and attacking it with reasoned arguments. Accordingly, he dismissed the appellant`s application.
 The motion to admit fresh evidence
In this appeal, counsel for the appellant filed a motion to admit fresh evidence before this court, contained within a bundle of documents which had been tendered as Vol 4 of the record of appeal. These documents allegedly showed that Thangaveloo, contrary to his denials, had in fact received `detailed instructions` from the appellant while still retained by him. A similar application was made, albeit orally, before the court below. The judicial commissioner refused to admit the bundle of documents tendered by Mr Jeyaretnam. This bundle of documents was exhibited before us as bundle `MS-5` in an affidavit filed on 12 April 1995 by Catherine Seet, the appellant`s sister, in support of the appellant`s motion in this appeal. Catherine Seet explained that the documents exhibited as `MS-5` were not the documents that Mr Jeyaretnam was instructed to tender to the court. Instead, she stated that the relevant documents were actually those now collectively exhibited as Vol 4 of the record of appeal. Consequently, these documents have been placed before the court for the first time.
In s 96 LPA proceedings, the judge sits in the exercise of his appellate and supervisory jurisdiction (). The Court of Appeal in 
 Whitehouse 
 approved of the proposition stated by Lai Siu Chiu JC (as she then was) in in the following terms: 
 
The court here is exercising its appellate jurisdiction over the defendants as an administrative tribunal (see decision of Chan Sek Keong JC [as he then was] in 
 
 
[1988] 3 MLJ 9
 ). Therefore, the court should be slow to disturb or interfere with the findings of fact by the inquiry committee unless it can be shown that supporting evidence was lacking or there was some misunderstanding of the evidence or there were other exceptional circumstances justifying the court to do so.
 
 
 
In his grounds of judgment, the judicial commissioner stated that he had to decide on the basis of the evidence presented before the IC. He did not think that fresh evidence was admissible. For the purposes of the present appeal, the starting point in principle was to consider O 57 r 13(2) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1990 (RSC), which states that the Court of Appeal shall not receive fresh evidence `except on special grounds`. These special grounds have been judicially considered in , and adopted by the Singapore Court of Appeal in . It must be shown that:
 
 
(a) the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use in the trial; 
 
(b) the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case; and 
 
(c) the evidence must be such as is presumably to be believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible although it need not be incontrovertible.
  
 
 
The test specifies conjunctive requirements for the special grounds contained within the three limbs stated above. In respect of the first limb, the appellant contended that it was not so much a question of having been unable to obtain the evidence with reasonable diligence. He had always been ready to tender the documents if the IC had requested for them. His complaint was that he was not even given the opportunity to present the documents at the IC proceedings, since he had never been called upon to present any evidence or to rebut Thangaveloo`s explanations to his complaint. The first limb of the test simply requires the appellant to show that the evidence could not have been produced before the court below despite reasonable efforts having been made. We saw no reason why the documents could not have been placed before the judicial commissioner, or, for that matter, even before the IC when the appellant first lodged his complaint. Indeed, the appellant admitted that the documents were always available. He claimed that instructions had been given for the documents to be placed before the court below. For some reason, a different set of documents was tendered by Mr Jeyaretnam. There was therefore no question of the appellant having been unable to obtain the documents with reasonable diligence for use in the court below. Thus, the motion failed at the first hurdle. It was unnecessary to consider the other `special grounds` and accordingly, we dismissed the motion.
 The arguments on appeal
On appeal, the appellant alleged that Thangaveloo had not conducted himself professionally and ethically, and that by such conduct he had prejudiced his defence at the trial. The appellant alluded to various considerations, which include, inter alia, the following allegations of misconduct:
 
 
(a) Conflict of interest arising from Thangaveloo having previously acted for the appellant and continuing to act for Tan right up to trial. Thangaveloo allegedly used the appellant as an `interpreter` for Tan even after he had been discharged from acting for the former. 
 
(b) Breach of professional ethics and legal privilege arising from Thangaveloo`s alleged use of the appellant as Tan`s `interpreter`. 
 
(c) Thangaveloo had misled the court in failing to follow Tan`s instructions and taking matters into his own hands in his submissions, without having cross-examined the appellant.
  
 
 
In addition, the appellant contended that the judicial commissioner erred in:
 
 
(a) Failing to appreciate the real issue, which was Thangaveloo`s misconduct. There was a conflict of proper administration of justice on one hand and counsel`s professional ethics on the other. 
 
(b) Failing to consider the fact that the appellant and his sister were not given any opportunity to be present at the IC hearing on 13 June 1994 and 11 August 1994 and were not able to know, respond to or rebut Thangaveloo`s explanations. 
 
(c) Refusing to admit certain vital documents tendered by Mr Jeyaretnam, which tended to show that Thangaveloo had in fact received detailed instructions while retained by the appellant.
  
 
 
 
 (1) The allegations of misconduct
 
 
 
 
 (a) `Conflict of interest` [or `conflict of duty`]
 
In respect of the alleged `conflict of interest`, counsel founded his arguments on this basis. Thangaveloo had initially acted for the appellant and had continued to act for Tan. The potential line of defences available to the appellant would have been known to Thangaveloo. As such, there was a clear conflict of interest. Thangaveloo had also allegedly used the appellant as an interpreter while obtaining instructions from Tan, thus making the appellant believe that there would not be any opposition to his line of defence.
The use of the terminology `conflict of interest` in this context was somewhat imprecise. In its ordinary sense, it applies to a situation where a solicitor has placed his personal interest above that of his client`s. In that sense, there is a `conflict of duty and interest`. In the present case, we were not concerned with any `conflict of interest` as Thangaveloo had not placed himself in a position where his personal interest might conflict with that of Tan (or the appellant as his former client). There was no allegation that he had any personal interest in making the allegedly offending submissions on behalf of Tan. The cases cited by the appellant in fact concern a conflict of duties owed to different clients. In a typical `conflict of duties` scenario, a solicitor may find himself in a position whereby his duty to serve the interests of two or more clients is in conflict. In a manner of speaking, there is a `conflict of interest` but this is in respect of serving his clients` irreconcilable interests. involved such a case, where a firm of solicitors which had elected to continue acting as common solicitors for two clients found their clients` interests directly in conflict. The same consideration of this issue of `conflict` arose in the factual scenarios of cases such as or . The common thread linking all these cases was that they involved a solicitor acting for two clients whose interests were diametrically opposed. In such cases, the solicitor clearly bears the burden of showing that his clients` conflicting interests did not prevent him from properly discharging his duties to both of them (per Barakbah FJ in 
 Yong & Co 
`s case5, at p 45).
The facts in the present case were quite removed from those in the cases cited by the appellant where a conflict of duties had been considered. One important distinguishing element in the present case immediately became apparent. There was a brief transitional period when Thangaveloo had remained as counsel on record for both the appellant and Tan. Thangaveloo was, however, no longer acting for the appellant at the time the allegedly offending submissions were made. He was not in a position where he was attempting to serve two masters such that his duty to one was inconsistent with his duty to the other. He had not received any instructions from the appellant to act against Tan, or vice versa. When he was first retained by both the accused, it was on the understanding that they would both claim trial to the charges and they would each have to present their respective defences.
The distinction became more obvious when we considered the inappropriateness of the analogies counsel attempted to draw from the cases cited. Those cases concerned civil proceedings where the solicitors were in a clear position of conflict in trying to act for two parties whose interests were irreconcilable. A more plausible case of conflict might have been made out if, hypothetically, Thangaveloo had obtained instructions from the appellant and, having discharged himself, gone on to join the Attorney-General`s Chambers and conducted the prosecution against the appellant, armed with personal knowledge of, say, the appellant`s intended line of defence. The facts at present clearly did not even come close to anything like this scenario. In any event, there is no practice rule or common law rule which sets up a blanket disqualification to a solicitor acting against a former client (). The Law Society`s Practice Directions and Rulings (No 25(c), ch 1, 1989) reflect the position at common law. There is also no general prohibition against acting for both parties to the same (civil) transaction, although it is said to be undesirable because of the `inherent dangers` involved (per Barakbah FJ in 
 Yong & Co 
`s case5, at p 45).
There appeared to be no reported authority which was factually on all fours with the present case perhaps came closest. This case involved a solicitor who, having discharged himself from acting for A in an action against B, went on to accept a retainer for B in the same cause. Counsel for the appellant cited this case as authority for this principle: if counsel has acted for a client, he ought not to accept a brief against his client if he knows anything as counsel that may be prejudicial to the former client, though the client refuses to retain him. This is the stated principle which the 3(2) 
 Digest 
 (2nd Reissue) p 509 cites as being attributable to the 
 Cholmondeley 
 case9. In 
 Rakusen 
 (at p 164), Cozens-Hardy MR was faced with a similar submission of `conflict of duty` on the basis of this principle. With the express concurrence of Fletcher-Moulton LJ and Buckley LJ, the Master of the Rolls stated in no uncertain terms: `I have read and reread that case, and in my opinion it lays down no such principle` (at p 837). He noted that, in the subsequent case of , Eldon LC, to whom the principle in 
 Cholmondeley 
 is attributed, himself had to qualify and clarify the statements he had made. In our opinion, the views of the court in 
 Rakusen 
 explaining the `principle` in 
 Cholmondeley 
 were entirely correct. The headnote to the 
 Cholmondeley 
 case9 and the statement in the 
 Digest 
 do not reflect the true principle which the case stands for. In 
 Rakusen 
, Buckley LJ noted that the principle which 
 Cholmondeley 
 stands for is that of disapproval of a solicitor `going over to the other side` to act for B, having discharged himself from acting for A in his claim against B. The following remarks (at p 844) were apposite: 
 
Of course he owes his former client the duty not to disclose that which he had learned confidentially, but 
 there is no duty in the solicitor to abstain from serving another client in the matter if there is no breach of that confidentiality
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In the same vein, Cozens-Hardy MR observed (at p 835): 
 
I do not doubt for a moment that the circumstances may be such that a solicitor ought not to be allowed to put himself in such a position that human nature being what it is, he cannot clear his mind from the information which he has confidentially obtained from his former client; but 
 in my view we must treat each of these cases, not as a matter of form, not as matter to be decided on the mere proof of a former acting for a client, but as a matter of substance ... we must be satisfied that real mischief and real prejudice will in all human probability result if the solicitor is allowed to act
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The overriding consideration, therefore, was not simply the risk or possibility that Thangaveloo might eventually end up having to attack the appellant`s defence, having previously acted for the appellant. Continuing to act in such circumstances would not constitute misconduct by itself. Such a risk or possibility would arguably exist in every case where counsel acts for two or more co-accused. If so, the logical consequence of a finding that this constituted misconduct would be that counsel will henceforth be precluded from acting for more than one accused in a joint trial. The fact remained that Thangaveloo was not acting for the appellant at the trial. In our judgment, the issue of conflict of duties presently raised required the court to examine whether by acting for Tan and making such submissions as he did against his former client (the appellant), real mischief and real prejudice would result. A mere risk or possibility of mischief or prejudice is insufficient. This was an adaptation of the test laid down by Cozens-Hardy MR from 
 Rakusen 
`s case8. We considered that the main questions raised in this appeal were these:
 
 
(a) Did Thangaveloo have access to confidential information relating to the appellant`s proposed line of defence while he was retained by the appellant? 
 
(b) Would real mischief and real prejudice to the appellant have resulted from Thangaveloo`s continued representation of Tan? 
 
(c) Did he in fact breach his duty of confidentiality to the appellant? On the `once privileged, always privileged` principle, this duty continues to exist despite his discharge unless the privilege has been waived (). Thus, the question would be whether he had used or revealed to the court any confidential information obtained during his retainer in the course of his submissions.
  
 
 
Counsel submitted that Thangaveloo must have been privy to more than merely general instructions, despite having acted for him for only two months or so. Before the IC, Thangaveloo stated that he was retained by the appellant for only about a month and was discharged before the preliminary inquiry. He said that the only instructions he had received from the appellant were in relation to arrangements for his marriage while in remand, in respect of a vehicle on hire purchase which was eventually seized, and, finally, about the manner of his arrest at Changi Airport. Both the accused had denied involvement and neither was pointing any accusing fingers at the other. Palakrishnan agreed that the instructions given to Thangaveloo would have been minimal and that since only general instructions had been received, there was no divulgence of any confidential information. The IC was satisfied that Thangaveloo had not received any specific instructions before he was discharged.
We noted that the appellant did not allege at any time that he had actually revealed his intended line of defence to Thangaveloo, whether during or after his retainer. Instead, in his lengthy letter of complaint, exhibited in Catherine Seet`s affidavit of 22 November 1994, he referred vaguely and generally to `instructions` having been given. He did not, however, condescend into particulars of what those `instructions` pertained to. Moreover, it was difficult to accept the appellant`s contentions that since Thangaveloo had obtained general instructions from him, the potential line of defences would have already been envisaged, and that, a priori, Thangaveloo would have known that his defence would implicate Tan. The appellant`s evidence was the only direct evidence which identified Tan as having assisted in the purchase of the air ticket for Yee. The prosecution had not adduced any substantive direct evidence to identify Tan. If the appellant`s proposed defence had indeed been disclosed or discernible from the outset, it would have been inconceivable that he and Tan could have remained on cordial terms. It would have also been incredible for Palakrishnan to claim that he and Thangaveloo had cooperated in guarding each other`s client`s interests, since their interests would have been in conflict. Palakrishnan even stated that their cooperation went to the extent of sharing their research during the trial-within-a-trial and at the close of the prosecution`s case. All this took place prior to the appellant having given evidence. In the circumstances, it was clear that the dispute only emerged after Thangaveloo`s allegedly offending submissions were made. If the appellant had disclosed his proposed defence to Thangaveloo right from the beginning, the dispute would surely have arisen then and not only at the trial.
Having considered all the circumstances and the evidence, we felt that the only reasonable answer to question (a) as framed above was that Thangaveloo had not been privy to any confidential information in relation to the appellant`s proposed line of defence. Correspondingly, in relation to question (b), it was difficult to imagine that any real mischief or prejudice could have been occasioned. From our perusal of Thangaveloo`s written submissions which were employed during the trial, we were unable to discern any statements therein which purported to draw on evidence which was not already before the trial judges. There was no reference, direct or implicit, to any instructions which the appellant might have given him in the course of his retainer which tended to contradict the appellant`s evidence and thus suggest that he had lied. Thangaveloo made no attempt to suggest that, on account of having previously acted for the appellant, he had special or intimate knowledge of the appellant`s instructions which would place him in a position to know that his oral testimony was a tissue of lies. The judicial commissioner summed up his observations thus: 
 
I do not see any reference to any instructions which the plaintiff might have communicated to Thangaveloo which were in any way made use of in the submission. I do not see that Thangaveloo has relied on any material other than what was before the court.
 
 
 
We found ourselves in entire agreement with these observations. Primarily, Thangaveloo`s duty in the conduct of the trial was to act in Tan`s best interests. He only owed a residual duty to the appellant, and this was the duty to respect the confidence reposed in him in respect of whatever information was gleaned from the appellant during his period of retainer. There was nothing from Thangaveloo`s submissions to indicate that there had been a breach of the duty of confidentiality or a contravention of the rules of professional privilege.
 (b) Misconduct arising from using the appellant as Tan`s interpreter
We turned next to consider the arguments relating to Thangaveloo`s alleged use of the appellant as an `interpreter` for Tan, both in relation to the allegations of conflict of duty as well as breach of professional ethics and privilege. In respect of the `conflict of duty` argument, it was submitted that this arrangement had led the appellant to believe that there would not be any opposition to his line of defence. The merit of this argument was doubtful. If the appellant had indeed acted as an `interpreter`, he must have been concerned only with conveying Tan`s instructions to Thangaveloo. It was not open to the appellant to contend that by merely interpreting Tan`s statements, Thangaveloo had, in effect, tacitly approved of his intentions to shift the blame to Tan. This presupposed that Thangaveloo had already known what the appellant`s intended line of defence would be. Thangaveloo denied that he had used the appellant as an interpreter for any substantive purposes at all. Even if the appellant had performed such a function on Thangaveloo`s behalf, we did not see how this would either have revealed the appellant`s potential line of defence, or would have compromised the appellant`s position in any way. If his proposed defence implicating Tan had indeed been disclosed from the outset, we did not see how it was possible that the appellant and Tan had maintained warm relations and how their counsels could possibly have been able to cooperate in guarding each other`s client`s interest. In our opinion, the only inference to be drawn from such conduct was that the disclosure of the appellant`s defence implicating Tan only emerged at a fairly late stage in the entire chronology of events. Indeed, counsel for the appellant conceded that the two accused persons had initially embraced a common defence, and had parted company only later.
Counsel went on to contend that the effect of the interpretation sessions had completely prejudiced and jeopardized the appellant`s defence. We did not accept this argument. It appeared more probable that the appellant would have benefited from being aware of Tan`s instructions. He would have known certain elements of Tan`s defence which he would not have otherwise been in a position to know, unless Tan himself had divulged such information. The only person who might have been prejudiced by such an arrangement, if anyone could conceivably have suffered prejudice at all, was Tan. The appellant was not alleging misconduct in relation to Thangaveloo`s conduct of Tan`s defence. Tan himself has not filed any complaint against Thangaveloo. He merely stated somewhat cryptically that he did not want Thangaveloo to act for him in his appeal as he was `very unhappy and disappointed in the way he conducted (his) case.` No reasons were given as to why this statement was made.
We noted that Palakrishnan had stated before the IC: `The instructions were common - no conflict.` On his part, Thangaveloo informed the IC: 
 
When I was briefed to act for both I was not uncomfortable because both denied involvement, nobody was pointing any finger to another - there appeared to be no reason to expect any conflict of interest. Of course if there had been I would have had myself discharged.
 
 
 
There was no suggestion that the appellant and Tan had both given Thangaveloo instructions in relation to their respective defences simultaneously. After all, they were obviously not raising the same points in their respective defences. The appellant alleged, however, that misconduct was also evident from the fact that he had translated Tan`s instructions for Thangaveloo at the latter`s request, and had given instructions to Thangaveloo in Tan`s presence once in Queenstown Remand Prison. It was not entirely clear exactly how such conduct, even assuming it had taken place, would have amounted to Thangaveloo`s submissions being a breach of professional ethics. We considered the authorities cited on behalf of the appellant. Cases such as and were concerned with communications to a common solicitor acting for both parties to a dispute. Thus, communications made by one party to the solicitor in his common capacity would not be privileged. was cited as well. Once again, the facts involved two parties with opposed interests. A had a claim against B in respect of a warranty for a horse sold by B. They went together to A`s solicitor`s (S) office to record a statement by B relating to A`s claim, and arranged for S to write to a third party in respect of the subject matter of the claim. S only represented A, who eventually brought an action against B. It was held that B`s statement was not a privileged communication, on the basis that B had not made the statement to S as his attorney. In any event, the communication was made in the presence of A.
The principles of law enunciated in the above cases appear to be settled, but they must be read within their proper context. Counsel contended, relying on the net result of these cases, that since the appellant and Tan had made communications in each other`s presence to Thangaveloo, there was the prima facie risk of prejudice to the appellant`s case. In our view, the cases cited by counsel did not support this argument. They only went as far as to indicate, as in , that communications made by parties in each other`s presence to their common solicitor must be revealed should either party seek to have them disclosed. Applying this proposition to the present case, it may have been open to Thangaveloo, in conducting Tan`s defence, to point to communications made by the appellant to him and require their disclosure. This was not the appellant`s bone of contention as such a course was never adopted by Thangaveloo. Moreover, a crucial presumption was that both the appellant and Tan had known that the former would be giving evidence which, if accepted, would implicate the latter. It presupposed that Thangaveloo had known about the appellant`s intended line of defence, and notwithstanding that, had deemed it appropriate to continue acting for Tan. No adequate grounds have been shown to support these presuppositions. On the contrary, all the indications were that Thangaveloo had not received specific instructions from the appellant about his defence, and therefore had no reason to expect that the appellant`s defence would implicate Tan. We were not persuaded that the appellant`s defence was prejudiced in any way by his alleged involvement in the interpretation of Tan`s instructions.
 (c) Misleading the court and failing to cross-examine the appellant
From our perusal of the appellant`s evidence during the trial, as set out in the Court of Appeal`s judgment in 
 
 
[1993] 2 SLR 14
 , it was apparent that the appellant`s evidence was intended to exonerate himself of liability. In doing so, he pointed an accusing finger at Tan. Counsel emphasized that if Tan wished to dispute these aspects of his evidence, it should have been incumbent on him either to instruct Thangaveloo to cross-examine the appellant, or to take to the witness stand himself to give his version of the facts. Unfortunately, on Tan`s instructions, neither of these courses of action was adopted. Instead, Thangaveloo submitted that the appellant`s evidence was a tissue of lies.
On appeal, counsel for the appellant contended that the misconduct lay in Thangaveloo having misled the court in making gratuitous observations as to the appellant`s credibility. In doing so, he had given his own assessment in a manner which counsel described as being more like `an amicus curiae not representative of his client`s interest`. In not having followed his client`s instructions, Thangaveloo was said to have taken matters into his own hands and thereby misled the court. It was not disputed that Thangaveloo was instructed not to cross-examine the appellant. What was less certain was whether Tan had in fact told him expressly not to refute the appellant`s evidence or to refrain from attacking his credibility as well.
The main issue to be considered was not simply whether the law as it stands would sanction Thangaveloo`s approach towards trial advocacy. In our opinion, the question was whether Thangaveloo`s submissions amounted to professional misconduct. The judicial commissioner opined that it would not be improper to attack the evidence of a witness, whether a co-accused or otherwise, in a criminal trial by reason only that counsel had not cross-examined the witness. In effect, he ruled that this would not constitute misconduct. No submissions were presented in respect of this issue by Mr Jeyaretnam below. Nevertheless, the judicial commissioner addressed the question at length with reference to Palakrishnan`s submissions during the trial. Before us, counsel submitted that the judicial commissioner had erred. Counsel relied principally on the statements of Lords Herschell LC and Halsbury in . The case concerned an action for libel against the defendant solicitor, the libel being allegedly found in a warrant to act authorizing him to commence proceedings against Browne, who was alleged to have committed various annoyances and breaches of the peace. Dunn raised the defence that the warrant to act was a privileged document. At the trial, some of the signatories to the warrant gave evidence on Dunn`s behalf. They were not cross-examined as to whether they had in fact suffered such annoyances and given Dunn such instructions. Nevertheless, the plaintiff submitted that the entire thing was a sham, and that Dunn did not draw up the document. The House of Lords held that the plaintiff was not entitled to frame his submissions in this manner. Lord Herschell LC opined (at p 70): 
 
... it seems to me to be absolutely essential to the proper conduct of a cause, where it is intended to suggest that a witness is not speaking the truth on a particular point, to direct his attention to the fact by some questions put in cross-examination showing that that imputation is intended to be made, and not to take his evidence and pass it by as a matter altogether unchallenged and then, when it is impossible for him to explain, as perhaps he might have been able to do if such questions had been put to him, the circumstances which it is suggested indicate that the story he tells ought not to be believed, to argue that he is a witness unworthy of credit.
 
 
 
Lord Halsbury took a substantially similar view, stating (at p 76): 
 
To my mind nothing would be more absolutely unjust than not to cross-examine witnesses upon evidence which they have given, so as to give them notice, and to give them an opportunity of explanation, and an opportunity very often to defend their own character, and not having given them such an opportunity, to ask the jury afterwards to disbelieve what they said, although not one question has been directed either to their credit or to the accuracy of the facts they have deposed to.
 
 
 
The judicial commissioner found 
 Browne 
 distinguishable on two main grounds. 
 Browne 
 was a civil case and the facts did not have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Second, the evidence was entirely `one way`; there was no contrary evidence from the plaintiff. It was therefore not open to the plaintiff`s counsel to ask the jury to come to a different conclusion as that would be a misdirection to the jury on the evidence. The judicial commissioner found the following statement in instructive: `It could not be said, as a matter of law, that justices must accept a witness` evidence merely because it was unchallenged` (at p 114). During the trial, was also cited. The case involved two co-accused (B and F) charged with wounding S with intent to cause him grievous hurt. B`s defence was that he had not stabbed S and did not know who had done so. However, in closing submissions, B`s counsel proposed to put forward an imaginary case showing that F had stabbed S. The trial judge intervened and said he was not entitled to do so. This intervention was affirmed on appeal.
 Bircham
stands as authority for the principle that an accused (B) was not entitled to put an imaginary case implicating his co-accused (F) through his counsel`s submissions, without having put his case to F when F gave evidence. If the intended line of submission had been put to F, F could have dealt with the suggestion, and F`s counsel could accordingly have cross-examined B as to his record. The judicial commissioner found 
 Bircham 
`s case17 clearly distinguishable and declined to further consider it. We agreed with his reasoning. 
 Bircham 
`s case17 was clearly different and not relevant to the present case because the principle stated arose out of facts which showed that B was effectively substituting his original defence that he did not know who had stabbed S, with a defence which implicated F as the primary perpetrator of the crime. These defences were patently mutually inconsistent and if the submissions were allowed, would clearly cause prejudice to F, who had no opportunity to answer to the allegations at all while in the witness box.
We considered the other cases cited by the appellant in the present appeal. contains dicta framed along very similar lines to those noted earlier from 
 Browne 
`s case17. Three of the witnesses for the defence were not cross-examined on their evidence supporting the accused`s alibi. Lord Hewart LCJ held that the conviction was unsatisfactory and the appeal should be allowed. His Lordship opined (at p 207): 
 
In our opinion, if on a crucial part of the case, the prosecution intend to ask the jury to disbelieve the evidence of a witness, it is right and proper that the witness should be challenged in the witness-box or, at any rate, that it should be made plain, while the witness is in the box, that his evidence is not accepted.
 
 
 
, a decision of the Irish Court of Appeal, was also cited, with particular reference to Ronan LJ`s dicta (at p 388), approving of : 
 
The settled law and practice (in England) is that, if you do not cross-examine a witness, so as to give him an opportunity of explaining and justifying his evidence or any part thereof, you are taken to have accepted the evidence in respect of which you have not so cross-examined.
 
 
 
We noted, however, that this observation was purely obiter. Ronan LJ was commenting on the difference in practice between the English and Irish courts, and was merely noting what he believed was the `settled law` in England. He went on to add: `I say nothing as to how far governs the Irish Courts.` As such, Ronan LJ`s views could not be authoritative or even persuasive. It was not open to the appellant to suggest that they enunciate a general principle which could guide this court in the present appeal.
Finally, the appellant cited . The principle extracted by the appellant from this case was this: `once the right to cross-examine a witness is foregone it is not open to a party to make any grievance about it.` This statement does appear in the judgment (at p 142) and also in 
 Sarkar on Evidence 
 (13th Ed) at p 1339. Nevertheless, it has been quoted entirely out of context. It would be misleading to ignore the context in which this statement was made. 
 Shyamsingh 
 involved an appeal filed by the petitioner against the decision of the Deputy Inspector-General of Police. By the decision below, the Deputy Inspector-General had dismissed the petitioner`s appeal against an order made pursuant to a departmental inquiry which removed him from police service. As a ground of appeal, the petitioner alleged that he was not given the opportunity during the earlier departmental inquiry of examining a witness for the respondent. Only one witness was called, and the record showed that the inquiry officer had given the petitioner the opportunity to cross-examine him, but the petitioner had declined to do so. Consequently, it was not open to him to claim that he was aggrieved, having elected to forego his right to cross-examine the witness. The statement of principle in 
 Shyamsingh 
`s case20 must be read with caution; the case certainly does not stand for the expansive proposition that no `grievance` whatsoever can be raised as long as a witness is not cross-examined.
Having perused the authorities cited, we agreed with the judicial commissioner`s conclusion that they did not lay down any rule prohibiting Thangaveloo`s attack on the appellant`s credibility in his final submissions, simply because he had not cross-examined him. The cases had generally involved parties on opposing sides of adversarial litigation, whether they were parties to civil cases, or criminal prosecutions. There is an abundance of authority for the proposition that if counsel ignores or omits to cross-examine a witness on material points that go against his client`s case, they may be taken as an acceptance of the truth of that part of the witness`s evidence. This is well-entrenched in the context of ordinary adversarial proceedings. We would, however, express some doubt whether this principle applies equally and without exception to the failure or omission of counsel for an accused person to cross-examine a co-accused. None of the authorities cited by counsel dealt with the rather exceptional scenario which arose in the present case.
It was pertinent to note that the appellant did undergo lengthy cross-examination from the DPP during the trial. It was not as if his evidence had been completely unchallenged or uncontroverted. The DPP`s cross-examination was intended to highlight the inconsistencies in the appellant`s evidence. Thus, the appellant`s evidence-in-chief, taken together with his evidence upon cross-examination from the DPP, represented the extent of the evidence which Thangaveloo was entitled to draw on to make his submissions in relation to the evidence tending to implicate Tan. Thangaveloo`s duty, however, was not to prove the prosecution`s case beyond reasonable doubt, but to raise reasonable doubts as to the prosecution`s case against Tan. On its own, the appellant`s evidence may not have sufficed to form the basis for Tan`s conviction. Nevertheless, such evidence could have been considered as being materially corroborative of the prosecution`s case against Tan. It was not open to Thangaveloo to submit that the appellant`s evidence should not be imported into the case against Tan. Anything which is said in the witness box by an accused who is jointly charged and tried with others is evidence against himself and his co-accused, though such evidence should be examined with care since the desire of one accused to blame the other may well be the reason for his evidence in court which incriminates his co-accused: , at p 21 per Roberts CJ; see also . In the circumstances, Thangaveloo would have been duty-bound to show how such evidence was not credible or devoid of any corroborative value. There was also authority to the effect that for as long as counsel remains authorized to act for a client, it is his duty to do what he considers to be in his client`s best interests, even in the absence of express instructions from his client (). This case provided a clear illustration of the extent of counsel`s duties to his client. Lord Esher MR observed (at p 143): 
 
The duty of counsel is to advise his client out of court and to act for him in court, and until his authority is withdrawn he had, with regard to all matters that properly relate to the conduct of the case, unlimited power to do that which is best for his client.
 
 
 
Counsel thus has absolute control over the conduct of the case on his client`s behalf, and unless it can be shown that he had acted contrary to his client`s interests, an allegation of misconduct would be difficult to sustain.
A further issue raised on appeal required this court to consider whether Thangaveloo had misled the court in allegedly not following Tan`s instructions. Thangaveloo was evidently placed in an unenviable position. While duty-bound to act in his client`s best interest, he had also been instructed not to cross-examine the appellant and not to render his client a compellable witness by requiring him to give evidence. What else could Thangaveloo have done to deal with the appellant`s evidence against Tan, which, if accepted by the trial judges, could have been potentially damning for Tan? Having accepted that there was no indication that Thangaveloo had either drawn on extraneous or privileged information or claimed to have been intimately aware of certain facts which were not before the court, acted contrary to Tan`s instructions, or made the submissions with the intent to mislead the court, the judicial commissioner opined that `it was his duty to promote and protect his client`s best interests by all proper and lawful means`. In a case such as the present, Tan`s best interests lay in Thangaveloo reviewing the evidence of the appellant and attacking it with reasoned arguments. We fully supported these grounds. There was no basis for the appellant to suggest that Thangaveloo was `giving his own assessment` in a manner `not representative of his client`s interest`. If those submissions were not representative of Tan`s interest, they certainly did not serve Thangaveloo`s own interest or any other person`s interest either. There was no allegation that Thangaveloo had any personal interest in the outcome of the proceedings. It was also important to note that Tan had elected to remain silent, but had claimed trial to the charge. Thangaveloo had been instructed to advance arguments and comments on the evidence against him. Tan did not dispute that these were his instructions. If Tan had been concerned about jeopardizing the appellant`s defence, he could have instructed Thangaveloo not to make any submissions at all.
The appellant alleged that the judicial commissioner had failed to appreciate that the real issue was Thangaveloo`s misconduct, ie whether there was a breach of professional ethics. The mere fact that the judicial commissioner had made some references in his grounds of decision to the trial judge`s receptiveness to hearing Thangaveloo`s submissions was not evidence that the judicial commissioner had failed to consider adequately the question of Thangaveloo`s allegedly improper conduct. The judicial commissioner reasoned that the trial court was not misled in any way by Thangaveloo`s submissions. We need only point out briefly that at various points in his grounds of judgment, the judicial commissioner did make constant reference to Thangaveloo`s duties to Tan (eg at pp 6F, 9A, 10C, F, 11A, C, E-F, record of appeal, Vol I). We were satisfied that he had correctly addressed his mind to the issues before him.
 (2) Breaches of natural justice by the IC
The final ground of appeal related to the appellant`s grievances over the manner in which the IC dealt with his complaint. These grievances could be treated generally as allegations of breaches of natural justice. The appellant complained that:
 
 
(a) The IC did not interview him or his sister (Catherine Seet) personally on the material issues raised in the complaint. 
 
(b) The IC did not extend to him a copy of Thangaveloo`s written explanation before the hearing convened on 13 April 1994. It only did so after the Council had made its determination based on the two IC reports dated 16 June 1994 and 24 August 1994. Consequently, he had no opportunity to rebut Thangaveloo`s explanation. 
 
(c) At the hearing on 13 April 1994, the IC had asked his sister who was present to leave the hearing room. He was not given the opportunity to know the proceedings or the case put up by Thangaveloo and to rebut accordingly. 
 
(d) The IC failed to notify him or his sister of the further hearing on 11 August 1994 and hence deprived him of an opportunity to rebut Thangaveloo`s explanations in relation thereto. 
 
(e) The IC did not or failed to ask him or his sister about the nature and details of the instructions he had given to Thangaveloo when he was still retained.
  
 
 
In typical inquiries into alleged breaches of natural justice, these have generally involved a solicitor against whom a complaint has been lodged, claiming that he has not had adequate notice of the charges against him or full opportunity to meet them (see , and ). In the present appeal, the appellant contended that the right to a hearing before the IC must be accorded to him as well, since the IC had requested to hear Thangaveloo`s explanations. The failure to afford him a right to be heard after Thangaveloo had given his explanations before the IC was said to amount to a breach of the audi alteram partem principle of natural justice.
As a general rule, the complainant is not entitled to a right of hearing at IC proceedings (per Chan Sek Keong JC [as he then was] in , at p 493). Chan Sek Keong JC held: 
 
Save for s 87(5) [now s 86(6)], the [Legal Profession] Act does not prescribe any procedural requirements that the Inquiry Committee must follow in investigating a complaint against an advocate and solicitor. Section 87(5) [s 86(6)] was 
 not intended to confer any rights on a complainant
 but to provide an opportunity to the advocate and solicitor complained against to reply to the allegations against him and to request an oral hearing. There is nothing in s 87(5) [s 86(6)] to say that even if he were to request an oral hearing, he would be automatically entitled to one. The reason is that the Inquiry Committee might accept his explanation and exonerate him ... It therefore follows that the advocate and solicitor concerned would be entitled to a hearing if the Inquiry Committee were not satisfied that the explanation met the charges against him. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Chan Sek Keong JC, however, went on to consider that if Teo (against whom the complaint was made) had not asked for a hearing and thereby had not acquired a right to a hearing, it could not be contended that, in these circumstances, the plaintiff had such a right (at p 494). Ex hypothesi, this observation could be taken to mean that Chan Sek Keong JC might have accorded the complainant a right to be heard as well, if Teo had himself acquired a right to be heard pursuant to s 86(6)(b). With respect, this was not what Chan Sek Keong JC envisaged. Section 86(6) specifies certain procedural requirements before the IC calls upon a solicitor to answer any allegations made against him. Nevertheless, the procedure for the actual conduct of the inquiry is not regulated by the LPA. The IC is free to determine and regulate its own procedures. In 
 Jumabhoy 
`s case26, even if a right of hearing had been afforded to Teo, it did not mean that the complainant would have correspondingly acquired such a right as a necessary consequence.
Unlike Thangaveloo, against whom the complaint was directed, the appellant was unable to point to any statutory right to be heard at the inquiry. Instead, the appellant contended that, on a general principle of natural justice or fairness, the IC had failed in its duties. In essence, the appellant`s grievance was that he did not have any right of reply to Thangaveloo`s explanations. It must be noted, however, that the inquiry process is not adversarial but `inquisitorial`. The IC was only required to determine whether there was a prima facie case which would merit formal investigation. The requirements of natural justice must depend on the particular circumstances of each case and the subject-matter under consideration (per Wee Chong Jin CJ in , at p 67). The IC sits to conduct an inquiry; it does not either condemn or criticize. As held by this court in : 
 
The role of the Inquiry Committee is merely to investigate the complaint. It does not have to make any conclusions on misconduct or whether an offence was committed but simply to consider whether or not there is a prima facie case for formal investigation.
 
 
 
The concept of fairness in IC proceedings need not extend to affording the complainant a right to an oral hearing. Natural justice does not dictate that the appellant be given a right to fire a final salvo in reply, as it were, once Thangaveloo has furnished his explanations, bearing in mind the fact that the IC proceedings are neither adversarial nor accusatorial. All that natural justice requires is that the person or body charged with making the decision should act fairly. In the circumstances, and having regard to the role of the IC, we were of the view that the allegations as to breaches of natural justice were not tenable.
Having considered the various grounds and submissions, we were of the unanimous opinion that there was no merit to the appellant`s appeal. We dismissed his appeal with costs and ordered that the security deposit be paid to the respondent.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellants were jointly tried in the High Court on 12 October 1994 of having trafficked in diamorphine and thereby committing offences under s 5(1)(a) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act). The first appellant, Lee Yuan Kwang (Lee) was charged with the offence of trafficking in 192.12g of diamorphine contained in two packets and 20 sachets without authorization on 9 January 1994 at about 12.41pm at Raffles Boulevard by delivering the diamorphine to the third appellant, Choo Tong Sai (Choo). Lee and the second appellant, Quek Ah Ling (Quek), were charged with the further offence of trafficking in 1319.06g of diamorphine contained in 15 packets and 57 sachets without authorization on the same day between 12.40pm and 12.46pm, in furtherance of the common intention of them both, by transporting the drugs in a motor car bearing registration No SZ 8103Y from Raffles Link to the car park of Telok Ayer Food Centre.
The third appellant, Choo, was charged with the offence of trafficking in 166.3g of diamorphine contained in two packets on 9 January 1994 at about 12.42pm in front of Marina Square Shopping Mall, Raffles Boulevard, by delivering the two packets of diamorphine to the fourth appellant, Yakoob bin Mohamed (Yakoob). Choo was further charged with trafficking in not less than 25.82g of diamorphine contained in 20 sachets by virtue of his possession for the purpose of trafficking of the diamorphine on 9 January 1994 at about 2.10pm at Marina Square Shopping Mall. Yakoob, the fourth appellant, was charged with the offence of trafficking in 166.3g of diamorphine contained in two packets by virtue of his possession for the purpose of trafficking of the diamorphine on 9 January 1994 at about 1pm in Marina Square Shopping Mall. These two packets were the ones which Choo was accused of having delivered to him.
At the conclusion of the joint trial, the four appellants were convicted of the offences as charged and sentenced to the mandatory death penalty. They have appealed against their respective convictions.
 The facts
The prosecution`s narrative of the events was largely unchallenged. The prosecution`s case was that on 9 January 1994 the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) received information that Lee and an associate would be delivering drugs in a vehicle bearing registration number SZ 8103Y. The vehicle was found parked at Raffles Link. At about 12.30pm, Sgt Henry Tan of CNB spotted Lee (whose identity he knew) and two other persons (later identified as Quek and Choo) boarding the car. Lee and Choo were front and rear seat passengers respectively, while Quek took the driver`s seat. They travelled a short distance from Raffles Link to Raffles Boulevard where they stopped near a taxi-stand which was in front of another entrance to Marina Square Shopping Mall. Along the way Lee delivered two packets and 27 sachets containing diamorphine to Choo. Choo alighted from the car with a red and white paper bag with black and white checks. Quek and Lee drove off immediately.
Choo walked to the taxi stand where he met Yakoob. After a short conversation, they walked off towards the entrance of Marina Square Shopping Mall. Yakoob had the red and white paper bag slung over his shoulder and he went into a shop named `ZONE` on the ground floor. Choo took the escalator going up to the upper floor. At about 1pm, a team of CNB officers moved into the `ZONE` shop and arrested Yakoob. He dropped the red and white paper bag as the officers were about to arrest him. The bag contained two packets of yellowish granular substance. These two packets were confirmed by Dr Saw Chwee Guan (Dr Saw) from the Department of Scientific Services to contain 166.3g of diamorphine. At about 2.10pm, Choo was also arrested at Marina Square Shopping Mall. He was taken to CNB headquarters at about 2.25pm. A search revealed that he had two white envelopes in his left and right trouser pockets. Each envelope contained ten plastic sachets of light yellowish granular substance. Each of these sachets was again confirmed by Dr Saw to contain between 12.88g to 12.94g of diamorphine.
After Choo had alighted, Quek drove the car to Telok Ayer Food Centre where he and Lee proceeded to have their lunch. Four CNB officers arrested Lee and Quek. Lee put up a violent struggle but was eventually subdued and handcuffed. Quek remained silent. They were placed in a CNB car. One of the arresting officers, Cpl Ronnie Goh, was given a brown clutch bag and a bunch of keys (B1) by an unidentified female Chinese who told him that she had found them at the table where Lee and Quek had sat. Lee acknowledged that these two items were his. It was later ascertained that the clutch bag contained two bunches of keys providing access to three flats: the first bunch (B2) was for unit #10-1868 at Blk 557 Ang Mo Kio Ave 10 (the AMK flat), and the second (B3) for two flats, Blk 690 Hougang St 61 #10-262 (the Hougang flat) and Blk 403 Tampines St 41 #03-73 (the Tampines flat). It was also later ascertained that the `master` bunch of keys (B1) also contained keys to all three flats, in addition to the key to the car.
ASP Lim Chei Yoo later arrived at the scene. He asked Lee to surrender `the thing` (referring to the drugs) and the latter told him it was in the car. Two canvas bags were found in the boot of the car. Lee indicated that the drugs were in a black `New Sun` bag. ASP Lim examined the bag and found it to contain several packets of yellowish granular substance. There were 13 such packets. The other bag found in the boot contained two other empty bags. Lee further revealed that there were more drugs at the front of the car and in the glove compartment. A paper bag was found on the floorboard of the front passenger seat, containing a packet of yellowish granular substance. In the glove compartment, ASP Lim found seven envelopes with contents and some empty envelopes. Lee admitted to ASP Lim that five of the envelopes contained ten sachets of `
 pei hoon 
` (drugs in Hokkien) and that two other envelopes contained three and four sachets of drugs each.
Lee and Quek were both brought to the CNB Headquarters at about 1.25pm. ASP Lim instructed Insp Alan Moh to raid the three flats using the keys contained in bunches B1, B2 and B3 which had been given to Cpl Ronnie Goh. At about 2.10pm CNB officers arrived at the AMK flat together with Lee and Quek. Lee had rented this flat in mid-November 1993 at $1,200 per month from one Cheng Song Koon. On searching the flat, the CNB officers recovered from the master bedroom four stacks of white envelopes, a bag of unused empty plastic bags, two electric sealers, two electronic weighing scales, several empty packets that had been cut, one porcelain bowl with some substance on it and one stained porcelain bowl. Dr Saw analysed the two porcelain bowls and found the first bowl to contain 6.30g of a powdery substance containing 1.31g of diamorphine and the second bowl to be stained with diamorphine.
They proceeded to search the Tampines flat which was owned by Lee`s father. In that flat, cash, bank documents and other valuable items were seized from the person of Lee and the flat. A sum of $7,200 was found in the brown clutch bag handed to Cpl Ronnie Goh, and this was also seized. The Hougang flat was rented by Quek from one Ng Yin Seng. Ng Yin Seng testified that on 5 January 1994, Quek and Lee met him at the flat to negotiate its rental. Ng asked for a rent of $1,200 per month but Lee persuaded him to reduce it to $1,000 per month. The CNB officers returned to their headquarters at about 5.40pm bringing with them Lee and Quek and all the exhibits seized.
 The statements to the police
The prosecution produced and admitted in evidence the s 122(6) CPC statement of Lee pertaining to the second charge of selling two packets and 20 sachets of substance containing a total of 192.12g of diamorphine to Choo. As recorded by Sn S/Sgt V Kanasalingam, Lee stated that he sold 20 sachets of heroin to Choo for $1,200 and that he asked Choo to hand over two packets of heroin weighing about 2lbs to Yakoob. He also stated that both Choo and Yakoob were known to him. The prosecution also produced and admitted in evidence the statement of Yakoob recorded by Insp S Gopala Krishnan. Yakoob stated that he had nothing to say.
 The defences
 
 
 
 (1) Lee Yuan Kwang
 
The first appellant, Lee, elected to remain silent when his defence was called. Instead, he gave evidence on behalf of Quek. He admitted that the drugs in SZ 8103Y were his and that he alone was trafficking in drugs. He had never told Quek about his drug-trafficking activities and had led Quek to believe that they were only delivering contraband cigarettes. He confessed to the charge of trafficking which had been brought against Quek and himself jointly.
In cross-examination by counsel for Choo, Lee admitted supplying Choo with 20 sachets of heroin and handing to him the red and white paper bag containing two packets of heroin which were to be handed over in turn to Yakoob. This was also the substance of his s 122(6) statement which had been admitted in evidence. Thus, he also confessed to the other charge of trafficking which had been brought against him solely. When cross-examined by counsel for Yakoob, however, Lee maintained that he would not answer certain questions despite the trial judge`s ruling that he was a compellable witness.
 Lee Yuan Kwang`s appeal 
In Lee`s petition of appeal, counsel only raised the argument that the trial judge had erred in law in allowing the DPP to cross-examine Lee extensively after Lee had indicated that he did not wish to testify on matters concerning Choo and Yakoob. During the trial, the reason why Lee chose to remain silent was not clear. Counsel for Quek suggested that this may have been due to the fact that he did not wish to inadvertently implicate Choo or Yakoob when his only intention was to give evidence to exonerate Quek. After hearing lengthy submissions on Lee`s compellability, the trial judge ruled: 
 
Now, I think the relevant section would be s 122(3) read with s 134(4)(a) of the Evidence Act. And the ruling on a natural construction is that the first accused, having taken the affirmation to become a witness and elected to give evidence on behalf of the second defendant, he is now obliged and compellable to answer questions in cross-examination by counsel of the other co-accused on one hand, and, on the other hand, by the deputy public prosecutor on behalf of the prosecution.
 
 
 
Lee had given evidence admitting that he was the one solely responsible for drug trafficking and that he would bear the consequences of the two charges brought against him. No submissions on his behalf were presented at the close of the defence. In effect, it was fait accompli as he had already taken it upon himself to admit to the charges and exonerate Quek. Any additional evidence he might have given would have had no consequential impact in terms of tending to prove that he had committed the offences as charged. There was no other allegation on any other basis that the trial judge had wrongly convicted Lee.
At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for Lee informed the court that he had instructions to apply to withdraw the appeal. Accordingly we dismissed his appeal.
 (2) Quek Ah Ling
Quek was a driver and an odd-job labourer, last employed as a ship lasher at the PSA container port. He resided with his fourth sister, her husband and their two teenage children in a three-room flat at Blk 403, Ang Mo Kio. He first met Lee at the turf club around September or October 1993 and they became friends. Lee was known to him as a bookmaker with whom he placed bets. On or about the first of January 1994, Lee asked Quek for a favour. Lee`s motorcycle had broken down and he needed Quek to help him drive around to deliver contraband `Salem` cigarettes for one week. Quek initially declined but later agreed. Lee had previously given Quek some such contraband cigarettes to smoke when they went out together. On 4 January 1994, both Lee and Quek proceeded to Siang Hock Corp to rent a car for one week from 4 January to 11 January 1994 at a daily charge of $70. The rental was registered in Quek`s name but Lee paid the charges. Quek gave the rental firm Lee`s telephone and pager numbers. Quek had in fact rented another vehicle, SZA 1092, from Siang Hock Corp for $825 from 23 December to 28 December 1993, with a further extension to 3 January 1994, just before the rental of SZ 8103Y. He had struck a lottery and rented the car `for fun` during the holiday season. Lee was also with Quek when this car was rented and had similarly permitted Quek to use his telephone and pager numbers for the rental firm`s record purposes.
The arrangements made for their cigarette delivery enterprise that week involved them spending the entire week together. As part of their daily routine that week, from about 9.30am or 11.30am till about 8.30pm or 9.30pm, they drove around and delivered two to four cartons of cigarettes each day, spending the rest of the time together at shopping centres or watching movies. Quek would drive according to Lee`s directions. For the duration of the week, Quek stayed with Lee at the latter`s father`s flat at Tampines (the Tampines flat referred to earlier). Lee told Quek that he had kept the contraband cigarettes at the AMK flat. Lee alone took the cigarettes from the AMK flat and loaded them into the boot of the car. Quek would remain in a coffee-shop nearby and therefore he did not know what Lee was loading into the car. When Lee made deliveries, he would take the car key from Quek in order to open the boot as they had been given only one key by the car rental company. Lee instructed Quek not to leave until he returned. Quek would also not meet any of Lee`s customers. Quek had only been to the AMK flat twice and on the second occasion Lee asked him to help tidy up the place. It was then that Quek saw 20 cartons of cigarettes placed on the floor in the bedroom. Quek also saw the bowls, plastic bag sealers, weighing scales and other paraphernalia then but he did not know what they were for and did not suspect anything. Lee told him they belonged to a friend. The first time Quek saw Lee carrying cigarettes for delivery during that week when he assisted Lee was around the 6 or 7 January. Quek saw Lee taking a bag out from the boot and he noticed that cigarette cartons were sticking out from the bag as Lee walked towards a flat to make a delivery.
On 9 January 1994, Lee asked Quek to drive him to Marina Square. They arrived at Raffles Link at about 12 noon. Quek gave Lee the car key, whereupon Lee entered the shopping mall. Choo eventually accompanied Lee back to the car and both men entered the car. Quek did not know Choo and was not introduced to him. Quek drove a short distance after which he asked Lee where Choo was going so he could send him there. On reaching the main road, Choo asked Quek to let him alight near the taxi-stand. Other than this conversation, Quek did not take note of any conversation that might have taken place between Lee and Choo in the car. He stopped to let Choo alight. He saw that Choo was carrying a red paper bag. He then drove off to Telok Ayer Food Centre where he and Lee were later arrested.
The evidence that Quek drove the car while the delivery of drugs was effected by Lee to Choo was clear and uncontroverted. Quek`s defence hinged on his successful rebuttal of two presumptions under the Act. The first under s 21 is that he was in possession of the drugs since he was `the person in charge of the vehicle for the time being`. From this presumption, the second under s 18(2) arises that he knew the nature of the drugs. Quek sought to show that he did not know that they had been transporting drugs. He thought he was merely assisting Lee to deliver contraband cigarettes. He did not know that the canvas bag in the boot contained packets of heroin and he did not notice the paper bag on the floorboard of the front passenger seat, which was also found to contain heroin. He also did not know what was in the glove compartment. The crux of his defence was that he was an exceedingly gullible and ignorant accessory; he never had the necessary mens rea of trafficking as he never even knew that Lee had drugs in his possession.
A cautioned statement was recorded from Quek on 9 January 1994 at about 11.35pm at the CNB. Quek stated: 
 
The recovered bags and envelopes were brought into the car by `Ah Kwang` (Lee). I do not know the contents. He only told me the bags contained cigarettes. Ah Kwang was arrested together with me outside the car. I am not a drug addict and I do not know how drugs look like.
 
 
 
Lee`s evidence substantially supported Quek`s.
The trial judge pointed out various aspects of Quek`s evidence in concluding that he had failed to rebut the presumption of trafficking on the balance of probabilities. In particular, the trial judge observed that Quek`s financial position did not square easily with the earlier rental of SZA 1092 and the Hougang flat. He claimed to have paid the $825 charge for the rental of the first vehicle, SZA 1092, to drive around `for fun` during the holiday season. However, his evidence was that he had only worked once or twice in the month of December 1993. He was only earning $1,200 per month at most, and he was not paid when he helped his sister at her hawker stall. The trial judge looked at the totality of Quek`s evidence on his financial position and, in particular, the details given in relation to his alleged streak of lottery winnings. Quek claimed to have amassed the sum of $3,000 from three or four 4-D winnings in the preceding three months. These were found to be `evasive and incredible`. As for the rental of the Hougang flat, Quek`s evidence was that he decided to move out to stay on his own sometime during November or December 1993. He shared his bedroom in his sister`s flat with his teenage nephew and niece. Living conditions were cramped and increasingly inconvenient for him. Once again, however, Lee was involved, this time in handling the rental negotiations and even lending Quek $2,000 to pay for the deposit and first month`s rental. On 5 January 1994, the only day that they viewed the flat, they signed the tenancy agreement, paid the deposit of $2,000 and took possession of the keys. The trial judge found that Quek`s answers became `more far-fetched and thin when queried on the usual badges of an ordinary tenancy and his resources or arrangements to meet the rental`.
The trial judge observed that the `most outstanding feature` of Quek`s evidence was the glaring flaw at the core of his defence, which was that he believed he had only been helping Lee to deliver contraband cigarettes. The trial judge found Quek`s evidence on this crucial aspect `completely unconvincing`. He summed up four important factors. First, there were only between two to four cartons of cigarettes delivered each day. Each carton was purchased by Lee at $18 but no evidence was led to show how much he sold them for. At most, even accepting the possibility that there were four cartons of cigarettes delivered each day, the profit margin would probably have barely met the daily cost of car rental and petrol. Quek could not therefore have honestly believed that the risks justified the cost of renting the car for one entire week. Second, Lee and Quek were virtually inseparable throughout the entire period until their arrest. Quek was literally at Lee`s beck and call, to the extent of staying together at Lee`s father`s flat at Tampines. Third, Quek had rented the Hougang flat under suspicious circumstances. He could not show how he could afford the rent and had not made any firm arrangements to share the flat with anyone. Finally, Quek had admitted seeing the drug-related paraphernalia in Lee`s AMK flat but had claimed ignorance of what the items were for. He also claimed ignorance of what drugs looked like. It would be quite incredible that he could have remained completely unaware of Lee`s drug activities.
 The appeal 
On appeal, counsel for Quek submitted that the trial judge had erred in drawing only adverse inferences from the circumstances surrounding the rental of the car SZA 1092 and the rental of the Hougang flat. In doing so, the trial judge had allowed himself to be prejudiced by the evidence. It is not entirely clear whether the judge accepted the DPP`s submission that the earlier rental of SZA 1092 for the period immediately preceding 4 January 1994 was linked to drug trafficking activities as well. The prosecution could only establish that Lee was also with Quek when SZA 1092 was rented and that Lee`s pager and telephone numbers were furnished to the car rental company. Payment for the rental charges was made by Quek and not Lee. Quek maintained that Lee was only with him occasionally and not every day for that duration. There was no other evidence of what Quek did for those 12 days when he had this vehicle. Quek claimed that most of his time during that duration was spent at the Somerset Billiard Club at Balestier Point. If renting the car had truly been intended to be an exercise in self-indulgence to celebrate his lottery winnings, there was no necessity for Lee`s presence at the time of rental or for his pager and telephone numbers to be used. Ultimately, however, there was no direct evidence adduced by the prosecution to show that there was any connection between the rental of SZA 1092 and drug trafficking activities. It did not follow, simply because there was an earlier arrangement to rent a car (SZA 1092), that inferences could be made that this rental was also for some illicit purpose. The duty remained on the prosecution to adduce cogent and compelling evidence that there was something covert or illicit in this rental as well. More fundamentally, it was unclear how this piece of evidence could be particularly probative.
In relation to the rental of the Hougang flat, if Quek had indeed struck lottery and won more than $3,000, he would, on his own evidence, have $2,000 left under his third elder brother`s safekeeping. It seemed curious then that he did not arrange to retrieve his money from his brother first before deciding to rent the flat and pay the deposit on 5 January 1994. It also seemed curious that the keys to the Hougang flat were actually in one bunch (B3) as well as in the `master` bunch of keys (B1) referred to earlier. On their own evidence, there was no arrangement for Lee to share the flat with Quek. Yet all these keys were left in Lee`s custody. The trial judge took the view that the circumstances surrounding the rental were suspicious. In our opinion, these suspicious circumstances alone were insufficient to facilitate the inference which the prosecution invited the court to draw, namely, that the Hougang flat was rented to be used as alternative premises for drug related activities. We noted that nothing incriminating was found in the Hougang flat rented by Quek. There was also no evidence to suggest that either of them had even gone to the premises after 5 January 1994. There was an element of possible prejudice to Quek`s defence if this evidence was cast in the light suggested by the prosecution. Unlike the trial judge, we hesitated to attach much weight to this particular piece of evidence.
On this footing, we proceeded to consider whether Quek had in fact established a defence to the charge. We were mindful of the fact that the evidence against Quek was partly circumstantial and the entire case against him was premised on the presumptions under s 21 and s 18(2) of the Act. The second presumption hinges on the first and we would emphasize the need for additional caution in such cases. Counsel invited us to consider several aspects of Quek`s evidence. Quek had no known drug associations. The CNB was apparently unaware of his identity but had been on the lookout for Lee instead. Choo and Yakoob both had no idea who Quek was. Upon the arrest of Lee and Quek, Lee was the one who had been subjected to questioning. In their cautioned statements, both Lee and Quek maintained that the latter was completely ignorant of Lee`s drug activities. Both also gave fairly consistent testimony in this respect at trial. There was also no evidence that Quek had obtained any monetary gain or any other substantial benefit in kind from his efforts. The drug-related paraphernalia was found in Lee`s AMK flat. There was nothing incriminating found on Quek`s person or in his Hougang flat or his sister`s flat. In short, there was no direct evidence implicating Quek for the trafficking activities apart from the fact that he was the driver of the vehicle. These factors were indeed worthy of careful consideration, as they suggested that Quek`s defence of ignorance of the entire drug-trafficking scheme might be credible.
The charge against Lee and Quek, in substance, was that, in furtherance of their common intention, they trafficked in the quantity of drugs in question by transporting the drugs in the motor car from Raffles Link to the car park of Telok Ayer Food Centre. The evidence of common intention in this case, like the rest of the evidence against Quek, was circumstantial. It is clear that in most cases, evidence of common intention has to be inferred from the acts or conduct of the accused or the relevant surrounding circumstances. The prosecution`s case was largely anchored on the fact that Quek was driving the car while Lee delivered the drugs to Choo in the back seat. Thus, Quek would be acting in furtherance of the common intention with Lee to transport the drugs since the facts raised a strong inference that he was privy to a prearranged plan.
We agreed that the considerations highlighted by counsel on appeal created some doubt in our minds as to Quek`s guilt. Nevertheless, the compelling aspects of the prosecution`s case also had to be considered. The burden was on Quek to rebut the presumptions of trafficking and of knowledge of the nature of the drugs on the balance of probabilities and not merely to raise reasonable doubts as to his guilt. Quek`s main defence was that he had never known about Lee`s drug-trafficking activities as the latter had always been careful to conceal them from him with his ruse of delivering contraband cigarettes. Lee claimed that he always stored the drugs in the boot, placing them in bags and camouflaging their appearance by placing cigarette cartons on top. On the day of their arrest, however, it was quite clear from the state of the vehicle that Lee had not concealed the drugs in the manner he claimed he always took pains to do. Moreover, Lee claimed that he always delivered the drugs to his customers together with some contraband cigarettes. There were no cigarettes found in the car or with Choo or Yakoob. There were only three packets of contraband cigarettes found in the AMK flat which was raided. There was also no evidence that they had delivered any cigarettes earlier in the morning of 9 January 1994, although Lee maintained that he had just run out of supplies the day before.
The degree of gullibility and unquestioning trust allegedly displayed by Quek was unbelievably extreme. There was clear evidence that they were engaged in some illicit trade, yet it never occurred to Quek to enquire about the consequences if they were caught, let alone to examine the cigarettes that they were purportedly delivering. Quek would have us believe that he was basically prepared to drive Lee to the ends of the earth if Lee had so requested. The DPP described this as `an unreal disinterest` in failing to enquire about the alleged scheme and about Lee`s affairs. The circumstances surrounding the alleged cigarette distribution were highly dubious. No cogent reason was given as to why they had to spend an entire week together, renting a car just to ferry around not many cartons of cigarettes. Moreover, it is difficult to accept Quek`s evidence that he was unaware of any conversation that might have taken place between Lee and Choo in the car. The trial judge observed: 
 
He was completely unconvincing on this crucial part of his evidence. He was not a simple minded, gullible person ever so ready to believe everything that Lee Yuan Kwang told him.
 
 
 
We carefully considered the totality of Quek`s evidence. We were of the opinion that the trial judge correctly rejected Quek`s defence on account of the inherent unreliability of his evidence. On this premise, we agree that his defence was a fabrication and that he had failed to rebut the statutory presumptions. Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal.
 (3) Choo Tong Sai
Choo was a drug addict. He had been assisting his sister in selling porridge at her hawker stall in Tiong Bahru market. He worked between three to four times a week from 5am to 11am, earning a variable income of about $100 to $200 a week. He claimed to be paid between $600 to $1,000 per month. He also worked as a runner for an illegal bookmaker and he claimed that he received about $2,000 per month for his efforts. He was not married but lived with one Mary Choo, with whom he lived at a flat in Ang Mo Kio. He stated that she was also a drug addict and that she used to consume his drugs. Mary Choo was not called as a witness for him. Choo had been detained on various occasions at drug rehabilitation centres since the age of 15. By September 1992 he was severely addicted to heroin despite undergoing three lengthy detention terms of 30 months each between 1984 and 1992. He was able to consume a sachet of heroin in three to four days. He also gave evidence that he had used up nine out of ten sachets of heroin purchased from Lee on 20 December 1993 within 20 days. This meant a consumption rate of one sachet every two days.
Choo was first introduced to Lee in December 1993 when Lee supplied him ten sachets of heroin for $70 per sachet. The second purchase was on 9 January 1994. Lee agreed to sell him 20 sachets for $1,200. They met on the second floor of Marina Square Shopping Mall and he paid Lee $1,200. On proceeding to the car SZ 8103Y, he met Quek for the first time. While travelling from Raffles Link to the taxi stand on Raffles Boulevard, Lee lifted a folded paper bag lying on the rear seat near where Choo was seated. Lee told Choo that the two envelopes contained within the bag were for him. Choo took the envelopes and put them in his trouser pockets. Choo agreed to disembark near the taxi stand on Raffles Boulevard. Just before Choo alighted, Lee indicated to an Indian-looking man at the taxi-stand and handed over the paper bag to Choo. He asked Choo to hand over the bag to the Indian man. This man looked familiar to him. He eventually recognized him as Yakoob when he got nearer to him. He said he handed the bag to Yakoob as soon as they met. They sat down on a nearby bench and had a brief conversation before proceeding to the entrance of the shopping mall where they parted company. Both Choo and Yakoob were arrested soon after.
Like Quek, Choo claimed to be the innocent accessory who was manipulated by Lee. In relation to the first charge of trafficking by delivering 166.3g of diamorphine in two packets (contained in the red paper bag) to Yakoob, he was presumed to have known the nature of the drug under s 18(2) of the Act. He claimed in his defence that he did not know the contents of the paper bag which he handed to Yakoob. In relation to the second charge, the presumption under s 17 of the Act was that the 25.82g of diamorphine eventually found in Choo`s possession were meant for the purpose of trafficking. In his defence, he stated that he was a drug addict and the drugs found on his person were for his own consumption.
Choo called Dr Lim Yun Chin (Dr Lim) to give evidence on his behalf to the effect that he was a hard-core drug addict. The prosecution did not really dispute this. Dr Lim further opined that Choo exhibited a marked psychological dependence on drug abuse. Again, this was not disputed. The main controversy related to the level (or his capacity) of drug consumption. Dr Lim stated that from his study of the summary of evidence given by Choo, his history of drug abuse and evidence of his withdrawal symptoms, it was possible that a hard-core drug addict like Choo could consume a total of 25.82g of diamorphine at the rate of one sachet every three or four days.
Choo claimed that he suffered extremely severe withdrawal symptoms while in the CID lockup. These symptoms lasted five days, after which he felt better and he recovered reasonably well after a week. Yet he refused a referral to the Changi Prison Hospital in the early hours of 10 January 1994. The two escorting CNB officers said that he preferred to remain in the CID lockup because he could cope better there than at the Changi Prison Hospital. His evidence of severe withdrawal symptoms was rejected by Dr Leow Kee Fong (Dr Leow) of the Changi Prison Hospital. Dr Leow opined that Choo would not have managed to cope with these symptoms in the CID lockup if they had been as severe as he described.
Choo also challenged the voluntariness of two inculpatory statements which he had made to the investigating officer. This naturally led to a voir dire on the admissibility of these statements. The trial judge ruled that these statements had been voluntarily made and admitted the statements for the purpose of impeachment proceedings. He went on to state in his grounds of decision that he ruled that the statements were voluntarily made and that Choo`s credit had been impeached.
In respect of the first charge, s 18(1) and (2) operated to give rise to a presumption that Choo had the drug in his possession and that he knew the nature of the drug. Choo had possession of the bag in which the drugs were contained. The two packets were quite sizeable and could have been seen by Choo. Choo denied seeing the contents of the bag, even though he admitted that he had carried the bag by the handles when he alighted from the car. He claimed that when Lee handed the bag to him, it was folded and hence he was unable to see what was inside. He agreed that the bag was quite heavy and bulky. The gross weight of the packets was almost 1kg. The learned judge observed that it looked difficult to fold the bag in the manner Choo had claimed as the contents were bulky. In the trial judge`s opinion, Choo failed to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities. The trial judge took the view that the necessary elements of the offence of trafficking had been established and Choo was not the innocent courier for Lee as he contended.
As for the second charge, the trial judge found that Choo did not show severe withdrawal symptoms while in the CID lockup. Choo had apparently elected to remain in the CID lockup and there was no cell record indicating any complaint from him. He must have been able to cope with his withdrawal symptoms (if any) since he had chosen to remain in the lockup. The trial judge concluded from these observations that Choo did not have that high a degree of dependency on heroin. Moreover, Choo`s sources of income were unclear. He had not shown how he could have been able to afford to maintain his drug addiction at the rate of consumption alleged.
 The appeal 
Counsel for Choo informed the court that he would not be pursuing the issue of the trial judge`s ruling for a joint trial to be conducted. The gravamen of the arguments on appeal was that the trial judge had erred in the conduct of the impeachment proceedings, such that Choo`s defence was prejudiced. On a more general basis, counsel submitted that insufficient weight was given to the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.
The voir dire and impeachment proceedings
Counsel for Choo contended on appeal that the trial judge erred in finding that Choo`s credit was impeached by wrongly admitting the two statements made by Choo on 19 and 22 January 1994 without making a ruling as to their voluntariness at the conclusion of the voir dire. The trial judge made a ruling as follows: 
 
I am admitting the statements of the third accused (Choo) which he made, which I am satisfied he had made on 19 and 22 January this year.
 
 
 
The trial judge subsequently suggested that as long as it was established that the statements were made by Choo, a voir dire was in fact unnecessary and it was wrong for him to have gone into the voir dire. The accused would still have the opportunity to raise issues relating to the voluntariness of parts of the statement after it had been admitted. Counsel pointed to another aspect of the conduct of the trial which he submitted was prejudicial to Choo`s defence. The trial judge had apparently called for the statements while the voir dire was still in progress and had looked at the entire statement.
 Nayeb Shana (Shahana) v The Emperor
was cited by counsel to support the contention that the trial judge had to decide on the question of voluntariness before proceeding with the impeachment proceedings. It must be noted that the ruling in 
 Nayeb Shana 
`s case1 was made in the context of jury trials. The judge, whose sole province was to decide questions of law, would have had a duty to exclude inadmissible evidence from the consideration of the jury. It is less compelling to adhere to such rigid delineations in the present-day context where jury trials have long since been abolished. The trial judge has the duty to decide on both the law and the facts. He is also expected to be able to exclude inadmissible or prejudicial evidence from consideration. In the prevailing climate of criminal practice and procedure, it may have been procedurally improper for the trial judge to have looked at the statements in their entirety in the course of the voir dire. Nevertheless, such procedures requiring that the trial judge be shielded from statements, or portions of statements, the voluntariness of which may be disputed, are relics of jury trials from days of yore. They hold no real significance in present-day trials where judges are equally competent to decide on disputes of fact as well as the law. Ultimately, the main question is whether, having heard the evidence, the trial judge had properly directed himself in finding that the statements had been voluntarily made. In the present case, the record and the grounds of decision indicated that he was always mindful of the importance of the issue of the voluntariness of the statements. There was also no indication from our perusal of the record that the trial judge had allowed himself to be unduly prejudiced by the contents of the statements. We are satisfied that there was no material irregularity in the conduct of the impeachment proceedings which would occasion a failure of justice. In the circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to conclude that Choo`s credit had been impeached.
Choo`s substantive defences to the two charges
The first charge against Choo was one of trafficking in 166.3g of diamorphine, involving the delivery of the bag containing two packets of drugs to Yakoob. On appeal, the defence contended that while Choo undeniably had possession of the drug, the mens rea element was unreliable. The prosecution had relied on Choo`s oral statement to ASP Lim at CNB HQ to show that there was an arrangement for Choo to be the `go-between` for Lee and Yakoob in respect of the drugs specified within the first charge. ASP Lim said he had asked Choo how much he paid Lee for the drugs and how much he received from Yakoob. Choo said he received $7,200 from Yakoob and gave Lee $8,400. The difference of $1,200 was the amount which Choo himself would have paid for the other 20 sachets found on him (which were the subject of the second charge). Choo apparently went on to add that, if not for this arrangement, he would not have been able to obtain the 20 sachets at the low price of $1,200. The trial judge understood this to mean that Choo`s assistance in the delivery of the larger quantity of heroin to Yakoob was the reason why Choo was given a special price of $1,200 for the 20 sachets.
One problem was that this conversation between Choo and ASP Lim was in Hokkien and there was no evidence of when or whether Choo paid Lee the $1,200. The prosecution only had evidence that $7,200 was found on Lee. It was thus argued by Choo that this oral conversation had never taken place. The trial judge chose to accept ASP Lim`s evidence which was confirmed by NO Kho Hock Aun who was guarding over Choo when the statements were made. The trial judge was clearly persuaded by the DPP`s argument that it was unnecessary for the prosecution to show how or when Choo received payment from Yakoob. It was also submitted that the remaining $1,200 was to be paid on some other occasion or that some other arrangement had been made for payment.
Choo`s evidence consisted largely of denials of knowledge. The bag was in his custody for only a very brief duration. Nevertheless, the definition of `trafficking` within the Act does not require that the person alleged to traffic in drugs must have had the drugs for a substantial length of time. All that is required is that possession be transferred from one person to another ( at p 281). On similar reasoning, Choo was presumed to know the nature of the drugs even though he might only have had them in his possession for a short while. His evidence that he never checked to see what the bag contained and was merely an innocent courier was not credible. He knew that Lee was a drug trafficker. He himself had admitted arranging to meet Lee to collect 20 sachets from Lee, purportedly for his own consumption. He was aware that the bag was heavy and its contents were bulky. He held the bag by its handles and in doing so, it must have been obvious, particularly to a self-confessed heroin addict, what its contents were. The drugs were packed in clear plastic and not wrapped in any elaborate fashion so as to conceal them. In our opinion, he had not shown on the balance of probabilities that he did not know the nature of the drugs or that there were drugs at all. As such, not much could turn on whether Choo`s oral statement to ASP Lim was correctly admitted. As it had no real bearing on our decision, we decline to express our opinion on the correctness of its admission into evidence.
In respect of the second charge, the prosecution relied directly on the presumption in s 17 of the Act that the 20 sachets of heroin, weighing 25.82g, were in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. Choo claimed that the trial judge wrongly rejected his evidence that these 20 sachets were meant entirely for his own consumption. Counsel contended on appeal that all, or at least part of, these 20 sachets could reasonably have been intended to be kept by Choo, since Choo had professed to be a hard-core drug addict. In dealing with this contention, the trial judge observed: 
 
... he could not have afforded such an expensive habit. He would consume, like all other addicts of limited means and as described by Dr Leow, just enough heroin to achieve a high without developing increased tolerance, ie the body`s ability to metabolize the drug.
 
 
 
Choo claimed that he purchased the first 10 sachets of heroin from Lee on 20 December 1993. On 9 January 1994, just before he took delivery of the 20 sachets, he had only one sachet left out of the ten purchased, meaning that he must have consumed one sachet of heroin every two days. There was no independent evidence that Mary Choo had helped him consume the drugs. Mary Choo`s particulars were not given to the investigating officer to enable her to be traced. Choo`s allegedly prolific rate of consumption would have far exceeded even Dr Lim`s assessment of Choo`s capacity to consume heroin. Dr Lim had given evidence that a hard-core addict, which Choo claimed to be, could have consumed one sachet every three to four days. Dr Leow, however, was of the view that Choo would have presented severe withdrawal symptoms had he in fact consumed the heroin at the rate alleged.
In our opinion, the fact that Choo was able to remain in the CID lockup contradicted his claims of slavish dependence on drugs and severe withdrawal symptoms. From the totality of the evidence, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that Choo probably did not suffer withdrawal symptoms and did not have to consume heroin at the level he had claimed. The more likely explanation was that Choo was not a hard-core drug addict but had to resort to trafficking to find some means of sustaining his own addiction. We see no reason to differ from the trial judge`s conclusions in this regard. We adopt the approach taken by the court in . In 
 Goh Soon Huat 
, the Court of Appeal observed that even if it could be accepted that the accused was capable of consuming drugs at the phenomenal rate alleged, it did not immediately follow that he was not also a trafficker. The same might be said of Choo in the present case. The trial judge quite rightly doubted Choo`s abilities to sustain his drug abuse habits as his sources of income were not at all clear. All told, he would have had to spend $1,900 on the two heroin purchases within a three-week span from 20 December 1993 to 9 January 1994. We were not persuaded that he had shown that he had the means to finance his addiction at the phenomenal consumption rate alleged. Even if one accepted that a portion of the drugs had been bought for his own consumption, the scanty evidence proffered by Choo did not lend credence to his defence. In the light of the above considerations, we would agree with the trial judge`s conclusion that Choo had not succeeded in rebutting the presumption under s 17. We accordingly dismiss his appeals against conviction on both charges.
 (4) Yakoob bin Mohamed
The fourth appellant, Yakoob, was residing in a flat in Blk 412 Tampines Avenue 7 Street 41 prior to his arrest. He was working as a tower crane signaller at the Suntec City construction site, near Marina Square, drawing a salary of between $2,000 to $3,000 per month, including overtime supplements. He first met Lee in 1988. In August 1988, Yakoob was detained in a drug rehabilitation centre and had associated with drug addicts. He met Lee again by chance in late 1992 whereupon they exchanged pager numbers. Lee himself was released from a DRC in 1993 and they met quite often thereafter. Yakoob gave evidence that Lee was a close friend whom he confided in. He had told Lee that he was planning to get married, but he did not have enough money for the wedding expenses. Lee lent him $3,000 interest-free to meet the expenses for the wedding which was scheduled for June 1993. Lee attended Yakoob`s wedding. Yakoob managed to repay Lee $2,000 from the cash gifts he received during the wedding, and eventually the entire sum was repaid. Yakoob felt grateful that Lee had helped him in his hour of need.
On 8 January 1994, Lee paged Yakoob to ask for a favour. Lee told him that he was going to Malaysia and he needed Yakoob to keep some `ubat` for him. Yakoob understood `ubat` to mean heroin, but despite some initial hesitation, he found it difficult to refuse on account of his debt of gratitude to Lee. He eventually agreed to keep the heroin for Lee in his locker at his workplace at Suntec City. They arranged to meet on 9 January 1994 at the taxi stand. At about 12.30pm that day, Yakoob was given a red paper bag by Choo who said it was from Lee. He had until 1pm to return to work and so he went to the shop `ZONE`. He began to realize that the bag was heavy and he thought that, if Lee had handed him the bag, he would have returned it to Lee, suggesting that the quantity of heroin was too large.
Yakoob`s main defence was that his intention was to return the drugs to their rightful owner at the time when he was arrested. He did not intend to sell the drugs and he no longer had any connections with drug addicts. It was therefore contended that the act of `returning` the drugs to Lee would not constitute an act of `delivery` for the purposes of falling within the definition of trafficking.
In rejecting Yakoob`s defence, the learned judge stated in his grounds: 
 
In my judgment, Yakoob bin Mohamed failed to rebut the presumption that he was in possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking. I did not believe him when he said that he had agreed to keep the drugs as a favour for Lee Yuan Kwang and the intention was to return the drugs to Lee Yuan Kwang. The prosecution had led overwhelming evidence of the delivery of the drugs by Choo Tong Sai to Yakoob bin Mohamed who was in possession of the drugs until his arrest. He had dropped the bag knowing full well the dire consequences that would visit him.
 
 
 
 
 
 The appeal 
 
 
 
On appeal, counsel for Yakoob took issue with the paucity of reasons given by the trial judge. He maintained that the trial judge had wrongly evaluated the evidence. A further point which merited consideration related to the defence that returning the drugs to their rightful owner (Lee) did not constitute, without more, trafficking within the meaning and purpose of the Act.
It appeared from the record of proceedings that the trial court`s attention was drawn to the evidence of Choo`s oral statement to ASP Lim. The trial judge indicated at one point that if the prosecution was relying on the presumption in s 17 of the Act, then it could not rely on what Choo said in his statement which did not form part of the case against Yakoob. Yet a slightly disconcerting comment was made later by the trial judge in these terms: 
 
Now, you got evidence, prosecution has evidence at the close of the prosecution case, of a confession, of an alleged confession by the third accused to Lim Chei Yoo, 
 that crucial confession, which implicates also the fourth accused
. And on the case law as decided recently by the Court of Appeal, 
 that is independent evidence that can sustain a conviction
. [Emphasis added]
 
 
 
This last reference to `case law` was undoubtedly a reference to and in which the Court of Appeal, interpreting s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed), ruled that the confession of a co-accused who is jointly tried could suffice to support a conviction. The trial judge`s comments suggested that he did not see a distinction between those cases which interpret s 30 of the Evidence Act and the present case. The crucial distinction is that s 30 of the Evidence Act covers co-accused who are `being tried jointly for the same offence.` We would therefore agree with counsel that the situation at present, as far as Yakoob was concerned, did not fall within the s 30 scenario. While the judge had ruled that all the offences were `committed in the same transaction` as to come within s 176 of the CPC, the charges before him (at least in respect of Choo and Yakoob) clearly did not constitute `the same offence`. Rather, Yakoob faced an independent charge which was quite unconnected with the two charges against Choo. Notwithstanding this troubling aspect, we noted that the trial judge did not make any reference to Choo`s oral statement in the portion of his grounds of decision which dealt with Yakoob`s case.
Examining all the evidence against Yakoob, there was clearly still a case to be answered even if the evidence of Choo`s oral statement had been wrongly imported into Yakoob`s case. In particular, there was no real dispute that Yakoob was in possession of the drugs and hence had satisfied the actus reus of the offence of possession. By virtue of s 17 of the Act, he was thus presumed to have had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking and unless the presumption is rebutted he would have committed the offence of trafficking. Perhaps it was in this sense that the trial judge felt that the prosecution had led `overwhelming evidence` against Yakoob, since the elements of possession and knowledge of the nature of the drugs were clearly present. The burden would therefore still be on Yakoob to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not have the drugs for the purpose of trafficking.
Counsel`s arguments raised the nice question, considered by the Court of Appeal in , whether the act of returning the drugs to their `true` owner would constitute delivery within the definition of trafficking in the Act. At the outset, it may be noted that the prosecution had relied on s 5(2) of the Act. The offence in question took place on 9 January 1994, shortly after s 5(2) was inserted by the 1993 amendments to the Act. In 
 Goh Hock Huat 
`s case2, the court was considering an offence which took place in 1992. The prosecution could therefore not avail itself of s 5(2). Nevertheless, some observations of the court in that case remain pertinent. In particular, the following dicta touching on the meaning of `deliver` within the Act are instructive: 
 
In our view, if the respondent had transported the drugs back to Lu, the owner, or had handed them back to him on his calling for them on New Year`s Eve, then, even though Lu was the owner, there would clearly have been a delivery within the definition of trafficking under the Act. The requirement is merely the transfer of possession from one party to another.
 
 
 
In 
 Goh Hock Huat 
, it was submitted that the mere act of possession could not amount to an act preparatory to trafficking or for the purpose of trafficking (s 5(1)(c) of the Act). The court saw no merit in this submission and opined that while the act of possession by itself might not come within the purview of s 5(1)(c) [in the pre-s 5(2) statutory regime], `the position would be very different if it were shown that the possession or keeping of the drugs was merely the prelude to an act of trafficking.` On this reasoning, it was sufficient for `possession` that Goh was entrusted with the safekeeping of the drugs; he would be trafficking in drugs as this custodial act was to facilitate their subsequent delivery to (and collection by) Lu, the `true` owner.
Section 5(2) of the Act removes the difficulties which the court had to surmount in 
 Goh Hock Huat 
`s case. It is now clear that a person commits the offence of trafficking if he had in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking. In the present case, the charge against Yakoob was one of trafficking by virtue of his possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. Yakoob`s evidence was that he had originally intended to keep the drugs for Lee as requested. Upon realizing that a substantial quantity of drugs was involved, he later vaccillated and was considering whether to return them to Lee when he was arrested. On either analysis, whether he was a mere bailee or custodian or even if he was in the process of returning the drugs to Lee, it was evident that he had possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, ie he would eventually transfer possession back to Lee. This alone would bring Yakoob`s case within s 5(2). Adopting the court`s interpretation of `deliver` in 
 Goh Hock Huat 
, he could not succeed in rebutting the presumption of possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking on the basis of the argument that `returning` the drugs to Lee was not trafficking. By a future act which would transfer possession of the drugs to Lee, Yakoob would be admitting, in effect, that he would deliver the drugs to Lee, albeit at a subsequent time. The fact that this time had not yet arrived was immaterial because of s 5(2), the insertion of which was intended to clarify Parliament`s intention that once the presumption of trafficking was invoked, `there was no need to show the overt act of trafficking which he had intended to do.` (Parliamentary Debates, 2nd Reading of the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill, 10 November 1993 - Prof S Jayakumar, at p 925.)
Counsel submitted that the Act seeks to punish traffickers, meaning persons who intend to purvey the drug to end-users. He relied in the main on Lord Diplock`s comments in the Privy Council decision in . Lord Diplock opined in that case that there was a necessity to ensure that those who promote the distribution of drugs must be severely punished. In Lord Diplock`s words, `supplying or distributing addictive drugs to others is the evil against which s 3 (of the 1973 Misuse of Drugs Act) with its draconian penalties is directed.` Counsel also drew our attention to the Australian decision of . In 
 Carey 
, the accused alleged that the drugs found in her possession belonged to her sister, who had left them with her for temporary safekeeping. She knew that they were drugs, but her intention was only to return them to her sister. The charge brought against the accused was one involving the supply of drugs. Section 3 of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 of New South Wales defines `supply` as follows: 
 
`Supply` includes sell and distribute, and also includes agreeing to supply, or offering to supply, or keeping or having in possession for supply, or sending, forwarding, delivering or receiving for supply ... .
 
 
 
Delivering the judgment of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, Hunt J was of the view that the above definition of `supply` did not include the mere transfer of physical control (ie return) of drugs to their owner or to the person reasonably believed to be the owner. As such, the defence of the accused was accepted and her conviction was quashed. Counsel also referred the court to in support of his contention that keeping drugs for the purpose of returning them to their owner would not constitute the offence of trafficking. In , the first and second respondents were convicted on the lesser offence of possession of controlled drugs. They knew of the presence of drugs in the flat but the drugs were left there by one Loo Koon Seng (Loo) who was their rightful owner and who had intended to retrieve them from the premises. Based on his primary submission that `trafficking` must connote promotion or distribution of drugs, counsel contended that mere bailees like Yakoob were not truly intended to be captured by the scope of the wide-ranging presumptions in the Act. He cited the example of an unsuspecting cloakroom attendant who is handed a coat which he knows to contain drugs and later returns it to its owner with the drugs intact. He argued that the attendant is not trafficking drugs in the sense that he has not actively promoted the distribution of the drugs. He has merely returned them to the owner and is therefore not a trafficker in what counsel submits is the `true` sense of the word.
We shall deal first with the cases cited by counsel. It should be noted that the amendments to the Act in December 1993 have changed the complexion of s 17 and also introduced s 5(2). Thus, we do not see how the statements of the Privy Council in 
 Ong Ah Chuan 
 could have any relevance in the current statutory climate. The definition of `traffic` in s 2 of the Act has not been amended. The Act itself makes no reference to `end-users` or promotion or distribution of drugs, apart from the fact that `distribute` comes within one of the seven definitions of `traffic` in s 2. There is no requirement that the person found in possession must be shown to be a `dealer` or `supplier` in order for the presumption of trafficking in s 17 to operate. There is also no requirement in the Act for any directly proximate connection between any particular end-user and an accused who is found in possession of a quantity of drugs which attracts the presumption of trafficking in s 17. appears to be factually analogous to the present case. The court`s reasoning may, however, be easily distinguished on the point that s 25(1) of the New South Wales Act makes the supply of prohibited drugs an offence. The relevant offence of `supplying` drugs, as defined in the Australian legislation, may carry the necessary connotation that there must be some element of provision, distribution or promotion of drugs. The same cannot be said of the local offence-creating provisions and the definition of `traffic` in s 2 of the Act, which are worded in quite dissimilar terms. As for 
 Wan Yue Kong 
`s case8, it must be emphasized that this case was decided within the framework of the existing law prior to the 1993 amendments. Counsel did not advert to the important fact that, in that case, the court expressly found that the prosecution had not adduced any evidence to show that the first and second respondents were involved in any overt acts of trafficking. They were merely found in possession of the drugs and hence could only have been convicted of the offence of possession. In the present statutory regime, however, s 17 as it now stands would give rise to the presumption that the first and second respondents had the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, and unless they succeeded in rebutting the presumption, they would have committed the offence of trafficking in the drugs.
The only reasonable inference to be drawn from all the circumstances was that Yakoob knew of Lee`s drug trafficking activities. It was telling that Yakoob never enquired about the quantity of drugs to be deposited with him. He also claimed to find it strange that Lee himself did not hand him the drugs but that Choo was the one delivering it. Yet he insisted thrice that he could not simply refuse to take the bag and turn Choo away since the bag did not belong to Choo. This was allegedly only because Yakoob mentioned Choo`s name. Even though he felt frightened that the bag was so heavy, his first reaction was not to try to return the drugs to Choo or to keep the drugs in his locker. Instead, he walked into the `ZONE` shop to ponder over whether to keep or return the bag. Yakoob also chose to remain silent when called to give a cautioned statement, declaring that he had nothing to say. He claimed to have been confused and frightened. It did not occur to him to exculpate himself in any way and he also did not want to implicate Lee. Yakoob`s silence in the face of the weighty evidence against him permitted an adverse inference to be drawn, in the light of all the circumstances. Crucial aspects of his evidence were less than convincing and certainly fell short of discharging his burden of rebutting the presumption of trafficking. Accordingly, we dismiss his appeal.
In summary, we are of the view that the trial judge correctly concluded that all the accused persons were guilty of the offences as charged owing to the overwhelming evidence against them as well as their inability to rebut the presumptions under the Act on the balance of probabilities. We are of the view that he had given due consideration to all the evidence before arriving at his findings. We see no reason to disagree with his decisions and accordingly we dismiss all the appeals.

Whether defence entitled to cross-examine psychologist who made report
 
The appellant pleaded guilty in the district court to a charge of cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The statement of facts tendered by the prosecution alleged that on 13 October 1992, the appellant had deceived his brother-in-law, one Teo Chye Hoe, into believing that he (the appellant) was in a position to start a joint venture business, which deception had induced Teo to give the appellant a cash cheque for the sum of $20,000. Following the appellant`s conviction, the district judge was apprised of his antecedents. The appellant had on his record two previous convictions for cheating under s 420 of the Penal Code, both sustained on 2 July 1979. The sentence imposed in respect of each conviction had been, respectively, one day`s imprisonment and a fine; and it appeared that the appellant, not having been able to pay the fines, had undergone the in default custodial sentences. On 29 April 1985 the appellant had also been convicted in the High Court of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and had received a sentence of ten years` imprisonment.
Before sentencing the appellant, the district judge called for a corrective training report. The report subsequently forwarded to the court stated that the appellant was physically and mentally fit to undergo corrective training and recommended the imposition of such a sentence. Having duly considered the plea in mitigation made by the appellant`s counsel, the district judge sentenced the appellant to five years` corrective training. I dismissed the appellant`s appeal against sentence after hearing the arguments of his counsel and of the deputy public prosecutor. My reasons therefor are set out in the following grounds.
 The present appeal
Counsel`s main argument on appeal was based on a ground not set out in the petition of appeal. He submitted that the sentence of corrective training imposed by the district judge was wrong in principle because such sentences were meant to be confined to that category of offenders aged between 18 and 30 years, whereas the appellant in this case was 37 years old. The upper limit of 30 years proposed by counsel was somewhat puzzling, since s 12(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), in providing for sentences of corrective training, requires only in sub-s (a) that the offender in question be `not less than 18 years of age` and that he be `convicted before the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment for a term of 2 years or upwards, and has been convicted on at least two previous occasions since he attained the age of 16 years of offences punishable with such a sentence.` (Section 12(1)(b) is not relevant for our purposes.)
In support of his argument, counsel relied on such English decisions as and . A perusal of these cases revealed, however, that none of them established the proposition that an offender over 30 years of age must not be sentenced to corrective training. Nor, indeed, is there any provision in our Criminal Procedure (Corrective Training and Preventive Detention) Rules which indicates that only prisoners aged between 18 and 30 years may be sentenced to undergo corrective training. It is true that in the English Court of Criminal Appeal, in dismissing an appeal against a sentence of corrective training, made reference to an offender being `young enough` for corrective training to be imposed. The rationale for this, however, as the court`s judgment clearly showed, lies in the purposes for which corrective training exists. Such a sentence `is intended to be reformatory, in that [the offender] will get a general education to fit him as a responsible citizen.` (See p 648 of Lord Parker CJ`s judgment.)
A similar philosophy is reflected in r 3 of the Criminal Procedure (Corrective Training and Preventive Detention) Rules which provides that: 
 
The purposes of training and treatment of convicted prisoners while serving sentence of corrective training shall be to establish in them the will to lead a good and useful life on discharge, and to fit them to do so ... .
 
 
 
Clearly, therefore, the principal aim of corrective training is to turn an offender away from the easy allure of crime by putting him through a regime of discipline and by providing him with certain work skills. For this reason, corrective training is most likely to succeed in the case of a relatively youthful offender for whom there still remains, after his discharge, a not insignificant portion of his life in which to put to use the skills acquired in training. This does not translate, however, into the proposition that an arbitrary upper age limit should be imposed on the category of offenders eligible for corrective training. Any decision on whether, in a particular case, corrective training will be `
 expedient with a view to 
[the offender`s] 
 reformation and the prevention of crime, 
` lies within the discretion of the sentencing court. In the present instance, on the evidence before me, it did not appear that the district judge exercised his discretion wrongly in sentencing the 37-year-old appellant to corrective training. The report by the prison psychologist had certified the appellant to be physically and mentally fit to undergo such training; and there was nothing to indicate that at 37, the appellant was `
 too old 
` for the reformative aims of corrective training to be achieved.
Counsel argued, in the alternative, that with only three convictions behind him (two of which had been passed on the same occasion), the appellant could hardly be regarded as a `
 menace to society 
`. I could not see how this in any way advanced the appellant`s case. It is true that corrective training should be reserved for those offenders who have displayed (as Lord Parker CJ put it in ) a `
 tendency to crime 
`; and that is why s 12(1)(a) and (b) stipulate certain sorts of antecedents which must exist in an offender`s case before corrective training can be considered. This in no way establishes a requirement that an offender must be a `
 menace to society 
` before corrective training can be imposed. Indeed, had the appellant posed a true `menace to society`, the fitting punishment would have been a sentence of preventive detention under s 12(2). As the English Court of Criminal Appeal noted in (cited by counsel himself): 
 
The object of preventive detention is to protect the public from men and women who have shown by their previous history that they are a menace to society while they are at large.
 
 
 
Counsel further contended that although the appellant`s previous convictions brought him within the category of offenders described in s 12(1)(a), nevertheless his case was not one which showed such a need for `
 reformation and the prevention of crime 
` as to render a sentence of corrective training `
 expedient 
`. Indeed, counsel argued that the appellant was well capable of `
 reforming himself 
`. In my view, this argument found no support from the facts of the case. The appellant already had two previous convictions for cheating when he was convicted of culpable homicide not amounting to murder in 1985. The substantial custodial sentence he received on that occasion apparently failed to deter him from the criminal life, for, soon after his release from prison, he was up to his old cheating tricks again. In short, the appellant`s behaviour would appear to demonstrate the sort of tendency towards crime I referred to earlier; and, in the circumstances, I found the district judge to have been justified in finding the appellant`s case an appropriate one for the imposition of corrective training.
Yet another ground of appeal raised in the petition of appeal was the district judge`s refusal of counsel`s application to cross-examine the prison psychologist responsible for the corrective training report. The psychologist had remarked in para 5 of the report that the appellant was `
 beginning to be a seasoned cheat 
 
 although he 
 [had] 
 also served a long imprisonment for homicide 
`. In his grounds of decision, the district judge stated that he had not been influenced by these remarks and made clear his awareness of the fact that the report was only to `
 confirm 
 [the appellant`s] 
 suitability or otherwise for corrective training 
`. Notwithstanding this, the petition of appeal maintained the appellant`s `
 reservations 
` on this score and went so far as to include the sinister comment that ignoring the psychologist`s conclusion was `
 something easier said than done 
`. In my opinion and on the facts of the case, such a comment was entirely unwarranted; and had counsel ventured any further in his arguments before me, I should have had no hesitation in taking him to task. The district judge`s written grounds indicated plainly that in considering the appropriateness of corrective training in the appellant`s case, he had regard to the psychologist`s report only to confirm the appellant`s physical and mental fitness for such training. This is stressed at least twice in his grounds of decision: see in particular pp 6-7. Moreover, as the district judge pointed out, there is nothing in Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which makes it mandatory for a sentencing court to call for such a report. Section 12 merely states that the court `
 shall consider the physical and mental condition of the offender and his suitability for 
` corrective training. Corrective training reports are called for by judges essentially as a matter of practice, to confirm what they have been able to observe of an offender during his appearance in court and from the evidence available before them (evidence presented by defence counsel in the course of a mitigation plea, for example). These reports are extended to defence counsel as a courtesy and the offender does not thereby acquire any right to cross-examine the prison psychologist.
For the reasons set out above, therefore, I found no merit in the appeal and accordingly dismissed it.

The respondent was acquitted of the charge of importing into Singapore not less than 3,468g of diamorphine, an offence under s 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act). Against his acquittal the prosecution appealed. By a majority, with the Chief Justice dissenting, we dismissed the appeal. We now give our reasons.
 The prosecution evidence
The prosecution evidence was as follows. On 23 July 1994 at about 10.56pm, the respondent arrived at the Changi Airport on board Silkair Flight MI 895 from Hatyai, Thailand. At about 11.15pm, he was spotted by Customs Officer Lawrence Wang Khai Wah (CO Wang) walking with a trolley towards the customs clearance gates. On the trolley, there were a brown leather bag (the bag) and a small white paper bag. CO Wang found the behaviour of the respondent suspicious in that the respondent was looking both to his left and right. CO Wang stopped the respondent, checked the respondent`s passport and was told by the respondent that he would be leaving the next day for the Philippines. CO Wang brought the respondent to the customs checking counter to examine the bag. On emptying the bag of the clothing he found that the inner linings on both sides of the bag were bulging. Following this, the respondent was brought to the customs duty office. Senior Customs Officer Ang Sin Ban (SCO Ang) examined the bag. He offered a cutter to the respondent and asked him to cut open the lining. The respondent asked SCO Ang to do so himself. On making a small slit, SCO Ang found white powder inside. SCO Ang thereupon took out a test kit and confirmed, by performing a simple chemical test, that the white substance contained heroin.
In cross-examination, counsel for the defence put the following question to CO Wang: 
 
Q: Mr Wang, I am instructed by my client that at the time when the bag was cut open, SCO Ang asked him what is this, and he said something to the effect that, `This one is stones, someone asked me to carry for him`. Isn`t it true that this statement was made by my client to you and SCO Ang?
 
 
 
CO Wang replied in the affirmative. He did not, however, remember whether the respondent had gestured to his fingers to indicate that by `stones` he meant the gems used on rings. SCO Ang testified that the respondent asked him after the test was completed, `Sir, is it drug?` He did not ask the respondent what the substance was. When told about what CO Wang had said in cross-examination, SCO Ang said he could not remember if such an exchange took place.
The following important items were subsequently found and seized from the respondent. They were a passport belonging to one `Aung Myat` with the photograph of the respondent newly inserted, a Singapore disembarkation card with the address in Singapore stated as `Jalan 24, Lorong 24`, a boarding pass for Silkair Flight MI 895 from Hatyai to Singapore, an airline ticket for the flights Hatyai to Singapore and Singapore to Cebu bearing, inter alia, the status `RQ` and `OK` respectively, US$800 and 220 Thai bahts in cash, a receipt for a fine of 800 bahts issued to Aung Myat at Hatyai Airport for overstaying in Thailand, a piece of paper with Burmese writing containing some information (of which more will be said later), three photographs of the respondent, a small telephone book with entries in Burmese, some clothing and the white paper bag containing a new tube of toothpaste and a new toothbrush.
From about 12.05am to 2.30am, the respondent remained in the customs duty office and both CO Wang and Chief Customs Officer Michael Koh Keng Siang (CCO Koh) were assigned to guard him. However, the respondent and CCO Koh were left very much on their own in a partitioned area of the customs duty office. CO Wang interrupted them once or twice to ask for help from CCO Koh. During this time, CCO Koh questioned the respondent intermittently about the respondent`s background and how he came to be carrying the bag into Singapore. They conversed in English. CCO Koh made rough notes of what the respondent said. On 25 July 1994, he transferred the notes into his pocket book. The rough notes he took were then destroyed. In the pocket book, the following entry was found: 
 
Accd spoke to me in English and also voluntarily divulged the following:
 
 
 
He is working as a bread seller in Bangkok with meagre income. Stayed Bkk for last six yrs. Recruited by another male Myanmese called `Maung Maung` and offered US$3000 to bring said brown bag which he believed to contain `stones` to Cebu via S`pore. He was paid half in advance (part of which he had spent on himself and also sent some to his family in Myanmar). Balance half would be paid on completion of assignment. There are many Nepalese and Myanmese in Bangkok who have been recruited by `Maung Maung` who works for an African syndicate. Many Caucasians also involved who are seldom checked by authorities at checkpoints. He took a flight from Bkk to Hdy. In Hdy, he was given two options by `Maung Maung`. Firstly, to hand carry the brown bag on board flight from Hdy to S`pore. On arrival at S`pore, to remain in transit area till the following morning for connecting flight to Cebu. Secondly, the brown bag would be checked in by someone in Hdy airport. On arrival in S`pore, he would pick up the bag and deposit at left baggage after customs clearance and subsequently would stay at Geylang Lor 24. Would pick up bag the following morning for departure to Cebu. He chose option 2 as he considered option 1 too risky. He was shown the bag in Hdy and later given the air ticket and baggage tag. He also claimed there were two other Myanmese in Hdy hotel but could not depart as they did not have the goods. He also said that his photo on the passport was just taken and had recently been affixed to the passport.
The information obtained from the respondent by CCO Koh was not divulged to the investigating officer, Inspector Ong Peng Boon (Insp Ong), from the Central Narcotics Bureau (the CNB). CCO Koh explained that he only wanted to gather information which might be useful to him in the course of his work. He agreed that he did not take down verbatim what the respondent had said. He further agreed that the respondent did not use certain words such as `meagre`, `recruited`, `syndicate` and `Caucasians`. Counsel for the defence suggested that the respondent did not say `Geylang Lor 24` because he did not know of Geylang at the material time.
Insp Ong took custody of the respondent and the white substance at about 2.05am. The white powder was scooped up from the two sides of the bag and placed in two separate bundles. Later, the substance was analysed and found to contain not less than 3,468g of heroin. The identification and quantification of the heroin were not challenged at the trial.
Back at the headquarters of the CNB, a statement was taken from the respondent by Insp Ong under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the s 122(6) statement) with the assistance of a certificated Burmese interpreter, Ms Marler Swe (Ms Swe) at 5.45am. In it, the respondent said: `I have nothing to say.` The statement was admitted in evidence without any challenge. A long statement was subsequently recorded from the respondent by Insp Ong under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (the s 121 statement), again with the help of Ms Swe. The recording of this statement consisting of 25 paragraphs began on 27 July 1994 and continued on 28, 29 July and on 2 August 1994. The defence sought to admit the statement into evidence. In the s 121 statement, the respondent put forth a detailed defence. Essentially, he said that he did not know that the bag contained drugs; he thought he was carrying `stones` or gems.
 The defence
It is necessary to set out in some detail the evidence given by the respondent. His evidence in court was largely the version he gave in the s 121 statement. He is a Burmese by nationality, a Bengali by race and a Muslim by religion, and aged 30 years. He has been living in Thailand illegally for the past six years. He received his schooling primarily in his hometown in Myanmar and then in Yangon. He was instructed mainly in Bengali and Burmese but had also learned a little English. As a student, he participated in the uprising against Ne Win`s government. For fear of arrest and imprisonment, he fled to Thailand. There, he moved from town to town to avoid detection and deportation by the authorities for being an illegal immigrant. In fact, he was arrested three times and sent back to Myanmar. Each time, he managed to return to Thailand. He earned his living as a `roti prata` hawker. Sometimes, he worked at construction sites.
In 1994, he was staying in the Silom district in Bangkok where he sold `roti prata` from a push cart. There was a mosque called the Haroon mosque in the area. This was a mosque frequented by Muslims from the Indian subcontinent because a mixture of English, Hindi and Bengali was used in the mosque. He came to know a Chulia Muslim by the name of Maung Maung from his regular attendance at the mosque. Maung Maung also patronized his stall for `roti prata`. Originally from Myanmar, Maung Maung was a successful money-changer and a gem trader who carried on his business in the vicinity of the mosque. There were many other such traders in the area.
About three months after the respondent had first come to know Maung Maung, the latter took the respondent to a tea shop for a chat. They spoke in Burmese and the respondent revealed that he was an illegal immigrant. At a subsequent meeting at the mosque, Maung Maung arranged for them to meet on the morning of 21 July 1994. At the appointed date and time, they met at a McDonald`s restaurant near the mosque. Maung Maung told the respondent that he needed someone to bring a bag of gems abroad and asked if the respondent was interested. If he agreed, the respondent would be paid US$3,000 altogether, half of which would be paid in advance and the other half to be paid on his return. When told that the respondent did not have a passport, Maung Maung assured the respondent that he would take care of it. The respondent asked if the bag would contain only gems to which Maung Maung replied in the affirmative and reassured the respondent that there would be nothing in the bag which would get him into trouble. Then Maung Maung took the respondent to the Haroon mosque where he swore on the Qur`an that there would only be gems in the bag and that the respondent would not get into trouble. Maung Maung then asked the respondent to wait at the McDonald`s restaurant while he went to get the tickets. Shortly after, Maung Maung returned and asked the respondent to see him at the same restaurant on the following day at 8am.
The next morning, Maung Maung took him to a studio to have his photograph taken for the passport. The three photographs seized from him when he was arrested were taken at this studio. In fact, two of the photographs seized were identical with the photograph used in the passport of Aung Myat. Maung Maung instructed the respondent to meet him again at 8pm that night at the McDonald`s restaurant. Maung Maung also gave the respondent his contact number which was noted by the respondent in his little telephone book. Against the name Maung Maung, a pager number 1144/575689 and handphone number 01-4980438 appeared in the telephone book seized from the respondent.
That night, Maung Maung took the respondent to a hotel room and asked him to wait there. A male person who introduced himself to the respondent as Yusoof came to the room. He said in Burmese that Maung Maung had sent him there. The two of them spent the night in the room. Yusoof told the respondent that he was a Myanmar Muslim and that for several years he had been staying in Singapore on a student pass. The respondent had an opportunity to glance through Yusoof`s passport. The name contained in it was not Yusoof but was a Burmese name. Although the respondent could not remember the exact name, it could have been `Myo Lwin`.
The next morning Maung Maung met them at the lobby of the hotel and took them in a waiting taxi to the Bangkok airport. At the airport, Maung Maung took out the bag from the boot of the taxi. The respondent was told to carry the bag into the airport with Yusoof. The respondent said he found that the bag was quite heavy. At the counter Yusoof checked in for a flight to Hatyai. He also checked in the bag. Yusoof then handed to the respondent a passport under the name of Aung Myat, a ticket to Hatyai and a boarding pass. They flew to Hatyai on the same flight. However, they were not seated together. When they arrived at Hatyai, Yusoof took the respondent to the Haadyai International Hotel where he checked into Room No 760. Yusoof took the bag into Room No 760 and placed it in the cupboard. The cupboard was not locked. They went out for lunch and then returned to the room.
Back in the hotel room, Yusoof told the respondent a little more about his assignment. The respondent was told that he was to go to Cebu, Philippines, with the bag. He would have to change planes at Singapore. Yusoof told him that he could wait in the transit area at the Singapore airport for the change of plane. He need not collect the bag in Singapore as the bag would be put on the flight to Cebu by the airline staff. The respondent said that he had also asked Yusoof about the contents of the bag and was told that the bag contained only gems. Yusoof asked the respondent to familiarize himself with the particulars of Aung Myat in the passport and to practice the signature of Aung Myat. Yusoof also handed to the respondent the Singapore immigration disembarkation form which he had already filled up. The respondent practised the signature and then signed the disembarkation form. They left the hotel for the airport at about 5.30pm. Before leaving the room, Yusoof took out a long-sleeved shirt from the bag and asked the respondent to wear it because it looked more respectable than the shirt the respondent had on. The respondent took off his short sleeve shirt with floral prints. This was put into the bag by Yusoof. The floral shirt was found in the bag later and was the only old item amongst the clothing.
Before leaving the hotel for the airport the respondent told Yusoof that he wanted to buy some toiletries. Yusoof told the respondent to wait while Yusoof went off and returned with a small white paper bag containing a tube of toothpaste and a toothbrush which he gave to the respondent. This was the white paper bag that the respondent had when he was arrested.
On the way to the airport Yusoof gave the respondent a slip of paper. Written on it in Burmese were instructions on what the respondent was to do. The paper had the number 2212221 written on it which was the telephone number of the Singapore Airport Flight Information Service. It also stated that if the journey broke overnight in Singapore he was to stay at No 23, Jalan 24, Lorong 24, telephone number 7444468. It was in evidence that the Geylang address was that of a cheap boarding house. The address and telephone number of the hotel he was to stay at Cebu was also given. The note also stated that on reaching the hotel in Cebu he was to call Maung Maung at 2371405. Yusoof also handed to the respondent a sealed envelope which was not to be opened until he got on the plane.
The respondent and Yusoof arrived at Hatyai airport at about 6.20pm. At the counter the staff told them that he could not check in yet because he did not have a confirmed ticket and was on the reserve list. This was confirmed by the `RQ` status on the relevant portion of the air-ticket. He waited until about 8.15pm when the staff asked him to come forward and confirmed that a seat was available. Yusoof attended to the formalities of checking-in and then handed over the travel documents and 1,200 Thai bahts to the respondent and showed the respondent the way to the immigration counter. At the immigration counter the respondent was fined 800 Thai bahts because the passport showed that `Aung Myat` had overstayed for eight days in Thailand. This was borne out by the receipt found on the respondent.
The respondent opened the sealed envelope on the plane. It contained US$800 as part of the advance that Maung Maung had agreed to give him. He had asked Maung Maung to pay the balance of the advance to some creditors in Bangkok on his behalf. He then threw away the envelope. In his statement, the respondent had said that the envelope contained US$900. He corrected this part of the statement.
When the plane landed in Singapore he disembarked and entered the terminal building. He was looking around when he was approached by a female staff who asked if she could help. He asked her in English for directions to the transit room. She asked to see his ticket, she looked at it and told him that he had to collect his bag first. She then told him by words and gesticulation to go past the immigration counter, get his bag and then go upstairs for the flight to Cebu. The respondent said that he was sure that Yusoof had told him that he need not worry about the bag as the bag would go straight to Cebu. He only collected the bag in Singapore because the lady told him that he had to collect the bag first before taking the plane to Cebu.
After clearing immigration he went to the luggage belt and picked up the bag. He had at that time decided to take a taxi and spend the night at the place stated in the paper given to him. He was pushing the trolley and looking around when a customs officer came up to him and asked for his passport and air ticket. The officer looked at the documents and directed him to a counter. At the counter, as requested by the officer, he put the bag on the counter, opened it and took out the clothes therein. The bag was not locked. It was the first time he had opened the bag. Except for the shirt that Yusoof had put into the bag in Hatyai, the rest of the clothing in the bag did not belong to him. He was not surprised when the bag was emptied that there were no gems in it because he thought they would be hidden away.
The respondent confirmed that at the customs duty office an officer had offered him a knife and asked him to cut the inside of the bag. He declined and had asked the officer to do so. When the officer cut the bag he did not see any white powder because he was seated at the sofa and his view of the bag was obstructed by the officer. The officer then went to a table near the sofa and put the knife into some liquid. When the officer asked him in English: `What`s this?`, he replied `stone`. At the same time, he gesticulated with his fingers the stone on a ring.
The first time the respondent saw that the bag contained white powder was when another officer at a later stage cut open the bag. When he saw the white powder he felt sad because he realized he had been cheated. Although he knew that carrying gems out of Thailand into other countries without declaring the stones was an offence, he was told that it carried the penalty of forfeiture of the gems and a short term of imprisonment only. Therefore, he agreed to the plan and the small risk. Maung Maung had specifically said that the contents of the bag would not get him into serious trouble.
The respondent confirmed that another officer was with him for a few hours that night. This officer had over this period questioned him in English about his background and how he came to be carrying the bag. He replied as best he could whenever he understood what the officer was trying to say. He denied making those statements contained in the pocket book of the officer that were inconsistent with his testimony in court. In particular, he denied having said anything about an `African syndicate`, about `Caucasians` being involved and about staying in Geylang. He did not know what `syndicate` or `Caucasian` meant and he did not know that there was a place called Geylang in Singapore. Further he denied having told the officer that Maung Maung was in Hatyai.
The respondent said that Insp Ong spoke with him using a Burmese lady as an interpreter. That was during the recording of the s 122(6) statement. The interpreter told him that the penalty for the offence was death. She also said that he would be taken to court the next morning but that was not the High Court and he could not say anything to the court. A detailed statement would be taken from him later. She told him that if he had anything to say he could say it later. When she told him this he replied that he had nothing to say. The respondent told the court that he said that because it was late and because the interpreter had told him that after he was taken to court Insp Ong would take a full statement from him. He decided that he would tell Insp Ong all he had to say when the full statement was recorded. Subsequently, he gave a detailed statement to Insp Ong with the assistance of the same interpreter. In the main, the respondent did not dispute the accuracy of the s 121 statement. Such was his evidence at the trial.
Ms Swe in her evidence said that she read the entire warning under s 122(6) to herself and then told the respondent the substance of it. She said she did not translate word for word. She remembered telling the respondent that a further statement would be taken from him but could not recall whether she said that before or after the respondent had made his s 122(6) statement.
Miss Sylvia Lim, the assistant counsel assigned to defend the accused, gave evidence that she made an enquiry with Thai Airways in Singapore and obtained certain information and documents from the airline. One Miss Teo Mui Lim, a secretary with Thai Airways, was called to produce these documents. She produced the passenger manifest printout of the flight TG 233 on 23 July 1994 from Bangkok to Hatyai and also a printout of what was termed `a post date investigation printout`. The latter printout showed that one Maung Maung (telephone number 2918896) on 22 July 1994 booked two tickets on flight TG 233 departing for Hatyai on 23 July 1994 in the names of `MR AUNG/MYAT and MR MYO/LWIN`. The passenger manifest printout showed that these two persons were on the flight TG 233 and that Aung Myat was allocated seat 36A and Myo Lwin seat 38F. Miss Teo also produced another computer printout from the `Royal Orchid Plus` frequent flyer programme of Thai Airways. It listed, inter alios, Maung Maung as a member of this programme. It gave his business telephone number as 4980438 and his home telephone number as 0291-8896 and address as No 84/11, Soi Watrap Buakuao, Chardenkrung 80 Road, Bangkok. The printout also showed the mileage that had been credited to Maung Maung under the programme. The telephone number 4980438 listed by Thai Airways as Maung Maung`s business number was the same number recorded by the respondent in his telephone book as the telephone number Maung Maung gave him.
Miss Lim in carrying out the investigations went personally to Hatyai and made an enquiry with Haadyai International Hotel. There she obtained the original registration card relating to the occupation of Room 760 on 23 July 1994. The name of the guest as recorded in the registration card was Maung Maung. While she was there, Miss Lim went to a shop close to the hotel and did a bit of shopping and was given a paper bag similar to the paper bag which the respondent had with him when he was arrested: it bore the same name and logo. Miss Lim also went to Bangkok. There, she took photographs of the Silom district of the Haroon mosque, of the McDonald`s restaurant close by and of gem stores around the Haroon mosque. The respondent identified on the photograph the McDonald`s restaurant where he met Maung Maung. He also identified on the photographs the Haroon mosque and the gem stores in the vicinity. Miss Lim also took a photograph of an open area near the mosque. The respondent identified this area where gem traders and other traders gathered. He said that they would gather in the mornings and in the evenings. In addition, Miss Lim located the address which, according to the records of Thai Airways, was the residence of Maung Maung and took a photograph of that house. This appeared to the learned trial judge to be the residence of a well-off person.
 The High Court`s decision
It was not in dispute that the respondent was in possession of the bag and the bag contained the drugs, the subject matter of the charge. Accordingly, by virtue of ss 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the Act, the respondent was presumed to have the drugs in his possession and further, to know the nature of the drugs. The burden therefore shifted to the respondent to rebut the presumptions on a balance of probabilities. On this burden of proof, the learned trial judge had this to say: 
 
Where such a presumption is invoked the onus of rebutting that particular presumption shifts to the defence and it is accepted law that that onus is discharged on a balance of probabilities. Where a person found in possession of (say) heroin claims that he did not know it was heroin that claim may well be true but because the onus is on the defence the mere possibility that the claim may be true is not sufficient, more is required: the court must be satisfied that the claim is more likely to be true than not.
 
 
 
Adverting to the evidence, the learned trial judge was mindful of the fact that the defence proffered by the respondent was one often used. He said: 
 
Whether innocent or guilty, the invariable defence of a person in whose possession controlled drugs are found is: `I did not know it contained drugs`, and the task of the judge is to sort out, as best as he can and within the bounds of accepted legal principles, the innocent from the guilty. This is a difficult and demanding task for the judge, the more so because the penalty is often the mandatory one of death. There is no room for mistakes. It is therefore necessary for the judge to review the evidence as painstakingly and honestly as he can ...
 
 
 
The learned trial judge considered as significant the first reactions of the respondent upon his arrest and discovery of the drugs in the bag. The respondent at that time told CCO Koh that he was carrying precious stones to Cebu for Maung Maung. A couple of days later, he gave a long and detailed statement to Insp Ong. In the circumstances, the learned trial judge did not draw an adverse inference against the respondent for saying nothing in his s 122(6) statement. He believed that there was some misunderstanding about the importance of giving a statement there and then. Turning to the statement recorded by CCO Koh, the learned trial judge decided that it could not be given too much weight. The respondent had a very limited knowledge of English and the statement was recorded without the help of any interpreter and some of the words used there could not have come from the respondent. Moreover, the statement was recorded in the pocket book long after the conversation had taken place.
The learned trial judge found that Miss Lim`s evidence and the documentary evidence produced by Miss Teo of Thai Airways confirmed the respondent`s story. He said: 
 
... These details confirmed the accused`s story that he and another person had travelled to Hatyai on a ticket bought by Maung Maung. It even gave Maung Maung`s address and telephone number. If these details had not been produced, the prosecution could have taken the position (and indeed did for a while) that the entire story of Maung Maung, of Maung Maung being a gem trader and the accused being a courier of gems for Maung Maung was a fabrication. Because Miss Lim unearthed evidence from Thai Airways that Maung Maung had booked the ticket on which the accused flew to Hatyai the prosecution could no longer challenge the existence of Maung Maung and could no longer challenge the assertion of the accused that he was a courier for Maung Maung. What the prosecution now wanted the court to find was that the story of the accused that he believed that he was carrying gems was a fabrication and that in truth he knew or ought to have known that he was carrying heroin for Maung Maung.
 
 
 
Finally, the learned trial judge considered the merits of the respondent`s defence and the credibility of the respondent`s evidence. He also considered the various aspects of the case submitted by the prosecution. He then came to the following conclusion: 
 
I reviewed his [the prosecution`s] submissions and the evidence in this case very carefully. I accepted the accused`s account of his educational background and of why he was in Thailand. I accepted his account of how he met Maung Maung and how he got involved in carrying this bag from Bangkok to Cebu. I accepted the accused`s evidence that when Maung Maung asked him to smuggle precious stones he believed Maung Maung. I also accepted the accused`s evidence that Maung Maung was a known money-changer and gem trader operating in the vicinity of the Haroon mosque in Bangkok. The accused proved to my satisfaction that he believed that he was smuggling precious stones into Cebu. I was satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the accused did not know that the bag in fact contained heroin. I therefore acquitted and discharged the accused.
 
 
 
 
 The appeal
 
Before us, the sole ground of appeal by the prosecution was that the respondent had not successfully rebutted the statutory presumptions. In this connection, the prosecution highlighted the following aspects of the case. The respondent had no reason to trust Maung Maung who was virtually a stranger. Although the respondent said that Maung Maung was a successful gem trader and a money-changer, it was probably more accurate to describe Maung Maung as a street hawker and a small time money-changer. After all, Maung Maung did not even have permanent shop premises. He merely traded in the vicinity of the mosque. Therefore, the respondent ought to have been suspicious when he was asked to carry the bag of gems for the huge reward of US$3,000. In fact, the respondent did not quite trust Maung Maung. This lack of trust was revealed by the number of times he asked both Maung Maung and Yusoof about the contents of the bag. The respondent was not an illiterate man, having received quite a number of years of formal education. Moreover, he was by no means a gullible or naive person. As a student, he took part in the uprising against Ne Win`s government. In Thailand, he lived alone for six years and relied on his wits to avoid detection and deportation. He was clearly suspicious of what he was asked to do.
The prosecution contended that the respondent was not an innocent custodian of the bag; he had many opportunities to inspect the bag, and yet he chose not to do so. The bag was not locked at all material times. His lack of compulsion to check the contents of the bag was incredible. In truth, he knew or must have known that he was carrying drugs for Maung Maung. He must have accepted the assignment fully aware of the consequences of his conduct. The story that he believed that the bag contained stones because that was what Maung Maung had told him and because of the oath taken at the mosque was incredible on the totality of the evidence, and was a complete fabrication.
The prosecution relied on what this court said in , at p 253: 
 
... the appellant`s conduct was suspect and indeed that he might have suspected that something was amiss. Given this scenario, the appellant`s task of rebutting the presumptions on a balance of probabilities must surely have been rendered extremely difficult from the outset.
 
 
 
 
 Our decision
 
Essentially, in these arguments the prosecution attacked the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge, and relying on the suspicious circumstances of the case urged this court to draw inferences against the respondent which the learned trial judge should have drawn. We were, however, not persuaded by these arguments. These findings of fact were made by the learned trial judge after a careful deliberation and they turned on the learned trial judge`s evaluation of the evidence of the respondent. It is settled law that an appellate court will not interfere with a trial judge`s findings of fact based on the credibility and veracity of the witnesses whom the trial judge has seen and observed when giving evidence, unless the findings are clearly against the weight of evidence and unsupportable: see , at p 42; , at p 417 and , at p 5. On the evidence before the learned trial judge, it cannot be argued that his findings were against the weight of evidence and unsupportable.
The learned trial judge found that the respondent had not fabricated the existence of such a person called Maung Maung. The evidence adduced for the defence showed that a person called Maung Maung booked two tickets for the flight from Bangkok to Hatyai and that the respondent and another passenger Myo Lwin travelled on these two tickets. The telephone number of Maung Maung in the records of Thai Airways was the same number recorded in the book found in the possession of the respondent. All this evidence corroborated what the respondent had said in his lengthy s 121 statement which was recorded soon after his arrest. The evidence of Miss Lim of what she had found in her investigation with reference to the various localities in Bangkok and the hotel in Hatyai also corroborated what the respondent had said in the s 121 statement.
The crucial point in the evidence of the respondent which, of course, was not corroborated by other evidence was his agreement to carry for Maung Maung precious stones out of Thailand to the Philippines via Singapore and his evidence that he did not know that what was concealed in the bag was drugs. On this issue, the learned trial judge who had seen and heard the respondent giving evidence found that what the respondent said was on the balance of probabilities credible and accordingly he accepted his evidence. He came to this conclusion after a careful consideration of all the evidence including the suspicious circumstances raised by the prosecution.
It is true that in this case clearly the task of the respondent to rebut the statutory presumptions of possession of the drugs and knowledge of the nature of the drugs in the face of the suspicious circumstances relied upon by the prosecution was a difficult one. First, in particular, the respondent had the mens rea to smuggle gems or precious stones out of Thailand to the Philippines via Singapore; he had knowledge of the illicit nature of the contents of the bag he carried. Secondly, all too often drug couriers raise the well-known and common defence that they were deceived by some one else and that they believed that what they carried were contraband articles but not drugs. However, the learned trial judge was fully alive to the suspicious circumstances in this case and to the defence all too often raised by drug couriers. He clearly had these matters in mind when he assessed and evaluated the evidence of the respondent, and notwithstanding such matters he found the respondent`s evidence credible. In our opinion, on the basis of the evidence before the learned trial judge, we can find no ground for saying that he was in error in so finding. It is not the law that by reason of the respondent`s knowledge of the illicit nature of the content of his bag his evidence that he did not know that the content was drugs could not and should not be believed. Such knowledge on his part only renders it all the more difficult for the court to believe his evidence. Very much of course depends on the circumstances of the case.
The learned trial judge also directed his mind to the fact that the respondent said nothing in his s 122(6) statement. But he drew no adverse inference against the respondent. First, before the statement was made the respondent had told CCO Koh that he was carrying precious stones to Cebu for Maung Maung and how he agreed to be a courier of the precious stones for Maung Maung. Secondly, soon after the s 122(6) statement, the respondent gave a detailed account of the events in the s 121 statement. The learned trial judge found that probably there was some miscommunication between the respondent and Miss Swe, the interpreter, on the need to give a statement.
It is clear to us that the learned trial judge found it significant that the defence of the respondent as contained in the s 121 statement was confirmed in some material respects by the documentary and other evidence adduced by the defence, and that to a considerable extent his evidence in court was consistent with what he had earlier said in the s 121 statement. This is of particular importance in this case, as the s 121 statement was furnished to the respondent`s counsel only shortly before the trial commenced.
In our judgment, the learned trial judge on the evidence before him was justified in coming to the conclusion that the respondent had rebutted the statutory presumptions. We can find no grounds for interfering with these findings.
 Yong Pung How CJ
(delivering the grounds of dissenting judgment): The respondent, Hla Win, was acquitted of the charge of importing into Singapore 3,468g of diamorphine. His acquittal was appealed against by the prosecution. At the conclusion of the hearing, I found the appeal to be of merit and was unable to agree with the majority decision to dismiss the appeal. The following are my reasons.
 The law
Section 7 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act) states: 
 
Except as authorised by this Act ... it shall be an offence for a person to import into ... Singapore a controlled drug.
 
 
 
There is no doubt that the statutory offence is not one of strict liability and that proof of mens rea is required. In , this court clearly said, at p 63: 
 
The mens rea that is required is set out by the Canadian Supreme Court in the following passage in [(1978) 85 DLR (3d) 161] (at p 170):
 
 
 
`Where the offence is criminal, the Crown must establish a mental element, namely, that the accused who committed the prohibited act did so intentionally or recklessly, . Mere negligence is excluded from the concept of the mental element required for conviction. Within the context of a criminal prosecution a person who fails to make such inquiries as a reasonable and prudent person would make, or who fails to know facts he should have known, is innocent in the eyes of the law.`
 
 
 
... Hence, apart from the physical act of bringing the drugs into Singapore, it has also to be shown that the appellants knew or intended to bring the drugs into the country. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The mens rea of the offence requires an accused person to possess knowledge of two different facts. First, the accused must know he is bringing drugs and secondly, that he is bringing the drugs into Singapore. In the instant appeal, I was concerned only with the former requirement. It must be appreciated that the concept of wilful blindness qualifies the requirement of knowledge (see ). As Professor Glanville Williams aptly remarked in his , at p 125: 
 
... the strict requirement of knowledge is qualified by the doctrine of wilful blindness. This is meant to deal with those whose philosophy is: `Where ignorance is bliss, `tis folly to be wise.` To argue away inconvenient truths is a human failing. If a person deliberately `shuts his eyes` to the obvious, because he `doesn`t want to know,` he is taken to know.
 
 
 
To this end, the Act actually displaces the presumption of innocence in favour of the accused by providing for the presumption within s 18(2) that the accused who is in possession of the drug has knowledge of the nature of that drug. Therefore, the burden is on the accused to rebut the statutory presumption on a balance of probabilities. The established case law has set out some guidelines in considering whether the presumption of knowledge has been rebutted. In , the principles laid down in and modified in were applied by the trial judge. In its grounds of judgment, this court quoted the following passage by the trial judge: 
 
Ignorance is a defence when there is no reason for suspicion and no right and opportunity of examination, and ignorance simpliciter is not enough.
 
 
 
At this juncture, I emphasize that where the accused, who is not an innocent custodian in the sense that the drugs were planted in his bag without his being aware of them, accepted the goods in circumstances which rendered the taking of the precaution of satisfying himself that the goods were what they purported to be and were not drugs an imperative, then, if he did not take the trouble to inspect them, but merely relied on another person`s assurance, he would not rebut the statutory presumption of knowledge. In fact, he would be guilty of wilful blindness to the obvious truth of the matter.
In the end, the finding of the mental state of knowledge, or the rebuttal of it, is an inference to be drawn by a trial judge from all the facts and circumstances of the particular case, giving due weight to the credibility of the witnesses. In this connection, I am mindful of the principle that the appellate court should generally defer to the conclusion which the trial judge has formed when a trial judge makes findings of fact, including a finding of inferential fact of knowledge, based on the credibility of witnesses. However, this principle of law is not absolute and inflexible. The appellate court cannot, merely because the question is one of fact, and because it has been decided in one way by the trial judge, abdicate its duty to review his decision, and to reverse it, if it deems it to be wrong, in the sense that it is against the weight of the evidence and unsupportable. It would be different where inferences are to be drawn only from truthful evidence. I refer to the cases of 
 The Glannibata 
, and in support of these uncontroversial propositions. With that, I advert to the evidence before me.
 The evidence
I respectfully adopt the meticulous account of the evidence adduced at the trial given in the grounds of judgment of the majority. I shall only highlight and discuss the evidence pertinent to the question of knowledge.
By his own admission, the respondent was not an innocent custodian in the sense that the drugs were planted in his bag. He was not even an innocent custodian in the wider sense that he was carrying something innocuous for someone else. Instead, the respondent had agreed to smuggle a bag of gems out of Thailand for Maung Maung, knowing that it was an unlawful act. In return, he expected a substantial reward of US$3,000, some Thai bahts and a passport for his services. Having been asked to smuggle something illicit, I found that there was already a strong reason for the respondent to be suspicious of the goods and to find out what he was carrying.
Reverting to the evidence before me, I found that the respondent, had other grounds to be suspicious of the goods he was carrying. The respondent claimed he believed Maung Maung`s words and oath that the bag contained only gems; there was little reason for him to do so because Maung Maung was virtually a stranger. A quick review of the background of the respondent revealed that he was quite capable of taking care of himself. As a student, he lived away from his home and family in Yangon. He also took part in a student uprising against his government. For six years, he lived alone in Thailand as an illegal immigrant. During this time, he was constantly on his guard for fear of capture and deportation by the Thai authorities. Indeed, he had been captured on three occasions and sent back to Myanmar. Each time, he managed to return to Thailand. The respondent was hardly a naive or a gullible person. In view of his background and experience, his claim to have reposed such a high degree of trust in Maung Maung was incredible, more so in the light of the fact that he had been asked to take up a job which involved some risk. Although they were of the same faith and nationality, the fact remained that he had barely known Maung Maung for three months.
In addition, the questions the respondent asked first of Maung Maung and then of Yusoof about the contents of the bag evinced a lack of trust. In Bangkok, after Maung Maung had told him about the assignment, the respondent asked Maung Maung whether the bag contained only gems. He said in evidence: 
 
... Yes Sir, I asked whether it is true that the bag contained gem stones only ... I asked Maung Maung then Maung Maung told me to go to the mosque and said he will swear holding the Qur`an ... .
 
 
 
Subsequently, whilst in Hatyai, he made the same enquiry of Yusoof. He said in his long statement, as later affirmed in evidence: 
 
... I did ask for the contents of the bag but Yusoof told me there was no need to do so as there were only gems in the bag and those things cannot land me into trouble ... .
 
 
 
It was clear from the questions asked, especially the one posed to Yusoof, that he was suspicious of the contents of the bag being gems only and was anxious about not getting himself into serious trouble. He also did not completely trust Maung Maung`s words and the oath.
In the light of the above, my next question was what did the respondent suspect or fear that the bag might contain? He was prepared to smuggle gems, knowing that the smuggling of gems might get him into trouble. However, he was willing to accept the risk of a fine or a short term of imprisonment. Obviously, the respondent was not afraid of the smuggling of contraband which carried the same type of risk and entailed the same sort of consequences. He must have been concerned about the smuggling of something which might have far more serious repercussions. On the evidence, the respondent spent his entire life in the region, commonly referred to as the Golden Triangle, which is the hub of illicit drug activities. Again, taking into account his background, I was convinced that the respondent knew of the existence of the lucrative but illegal trading in drugs. In the premises, the irresistible inference must be that he was suspicious that there might well be drugs in the bag and that he was being asked to be a drug courier.
In all the circumstances, I thought it incumbent on him to check the bag for its true contents. However, he did not do so. This, in my view, was the most fatal weakness in the defence. I found that he had ample opportunity to do so in Hatyai. It was his evidence that after lunch he stayed with Yusoof in the hotel room all afternoon until they left for the Hatyai Airport at 5.30pm. During this time, they managed to get some rest on their beds. They did not talk to each other when they were resting and he did not know if Yusoof took a nap. In those few hours, the respondent did not take any steps to examine the bag although it remained unlocked at all material times. There was certainly no evidence that he was prevented by Yusoof from checking it. It was incredible that an assurance by Maung Maung would operate so strongly on his mind that he would forgo the chance, which he had, to ascertain the truth for himself and to avoid a potential situation of peril. In any case, I had already found that he did not trust Maung Maung completely as he claimed.
With the greatest respect to the learned trial judge and to my learned brethren, I found that the proper inference to be drawn from the facts and circumstances was that the respondent had wilfully shut his eyes to the obvious truth of the matter. The respondent did not want to know and chose not to find out that he was carrying drugs. Quite apart from the presumption within s 18(2) of the Act, such wilful blindness was tantamount to knowledge. In the premises, I found that the acceptance of the respondent`s belief that he was carrying gems was wrong and could not be supported by the evidence. For the sake of completeness, I add that, in my view, the respondent had not rebutted the statutory presumption that he knew that he was carrying drugs.
In coming to my conclusion, I appreciated the fact that the respondent had been a very consistent witness. His long statement made shortly after his arrest and his evidence in court were substantially similar. Moreover, the independent evidence obtained by counsel for the respondent supported many aspects of his evidence. Nevertheless, I was of the opinion that the corroboration of his evidence and his consistency must be viewed with caution. The matters so substantiated, including the existence of Maung Maung, the Haroon Mosque, the McDonald`s Restaurant, the existence of Yusoof, the flight to Hatyai, the stay in Haadyai International Hotel and finally the flight to Singapore were features common to the operation of any smuggling outfit, whether of drugs or of gems. They were relevant to show that the respondent was a courier, which was in any event undisputed. However, these aspects were immaterial to the question of the respondent`s knowledge of what he was smuggling. As such, his truthfulness in these matters should not, in my view, be accorded undue weight when dealing with the question of knowledge. Accordingly, I would have allowed the appeal and convicted the respondent.

This case involves appeals and cross-appeals. The defendants in the trial below (the first and second appellants, and the third and fourth respondents here) were Trade Facilities Pte Ltd (Trade Facilities) and Looi How Wah @ Peter Looi (Looi). The complainant was Socieacute;teacute; Jas Hennessy & Co, acting through the Public Prosecutor (the third and fourth appellant, and the first and second respondent here). Trade Facilities and Looi were each convicted by the learned magistrate Lee Teck Leng on two charges under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Ed) (the Act).
The first count against each of the respondents charged Trade Facilities and Looi separately with selling to Nissan Trading Co Ltd (Nissan) of Japan 100 cases of `Hennessy XO`, each case containing 12 bottles. The bottles were alleged to contain counterfeit `Hennessy XO` cognac and alleged to bear counterfeit Trade Mark Registration No. S/77727 or a colourable imitation thereof falsely applied to or impressed on them, contrary to s 73 of the Act. The second count against each of the respondents charged them separately with importing 97 cases of the same, also contrary to s 73 of the Act.
 The facts
It was not disputed before me that the bottles contained adulterated `Hennessy XO` cognac and that the `Hennessy` mark was affixed without the authority of the complainant or its agents.Nor was it disputed that neither the complainant nor its agents sold any Hennessy XO to Trade Facilities or Looi. The events leading to this action are as follows.
On 26 October 1993, Keiji Ueno (Ueno) of Nissan received a fax from one Higa of Universal Trading Co Ltd (Universal) of Japan stating that there were 300 cases of Hennessy XO available for sale at US$718 per case, with loading in Singapore; and asking Ueno to consider the offer, adding that an order for 100 cases was acceptable.Ueno placed an order for 100 cases.
On 28 October 1993, Ueno received another fax from Universal confirming the order and stating: 
 
... the seller asked that we inquire of the buyer whether it would be possible for the seller to ship another 100 cases two weeks after the first shipment, as the seller has 200 cases. The original B/L and invoice will be sent by DHL after the shipment.Payment will be made by telegraphic transfer after the receipt of the documents.
 
 
 
On 29 October 1993, Nissan issued a purchase order to Universal for 100 cases of Hennessy XO at US$718 per case.Nissan thought they were buying genuine Hennessy XO, albeit at lower prices than the usual US$750 to $760 per case for parallel imports.Nissan later received an invoice and a packing list dated 5 November 1993 issued by Trade Facilities. The invoice stated that payment should be made via telegraphic transfer into Looi`s bank account.On 17 November 1993, Nissan remitted the sum of US$71,800 in accordance with the instruction.
The 100 cases of Hennessy XO arrived in Tokyo on 23 November 1993.On 1 December 1993, a Japanese law firm TMI Associates (TMI) informed Nissan that the 100 cases of Hennessy XO were suspected to be counterfeit.On 5 December 1993, after examining the goods, TMI advised Nissan to stop distributing them.Nissan only managed to recover 12 cases and five bottles out of the 15 cases already distributed.
Ueno contacted Universal and requested them to inquire into the matter.On 14 December 1993, Nissan received through Universal a letter from Trade Facilities saying that Trade Facilities would accept a return of the 97 cases and that Trade Facilities would arrange to refund the money in January 1994.In January, Nissan received a letter of credit issued in their favour by Sun Tat Textiles (Sun Tat).As Nissan was afraid that they might be perceived as selling the 97 cases, they queried Trade Facilities and was assured by a letter dated 1 February 1994 explaining that Sun Tat issued the letter of credit because Trade Facilities`s own cash-flow was tight and confirming that Sun Tat issued the letter of credit as a financier and not purchaser.Nissan arranged for the 97 cases to be returned to Trade Facilities. The goods were shipped on 8 February 1994 and arrived in Singapore on 19 February.On 22 February they were seized. Trade Facilities was named as the consignee in the bill of lading.
A copy of the bill of lading for the seized consignment of counterfeit Hennessy XO was produced in court.Nissan was the shipper and Trade Facilities was stated to be the consignee and the party to be notified. This suggests that the goods were consigned directly to Trade Facilities instead of a bank. The whereabouts of the three original bills of lading are not known. The goods would only have been released on production of the original bill of lading.
Also produced was a letter sent by Trade Facilities to TSK Lines giving them instruction on what to do with the shipment, and a faxed copy of the original bill of lading.Both of these had `Peter Looi Trading` printed on them by the fax machine.
Ueno testified that parallel imports are legal in Japan.He testified that the terms of the agreement were as reflected in the documents.He denied that there were other terms.He admitted that it was common practice in Japan for goods to be shipped on a consignment basis so that the importer can inspect the goods first and then pay only if satisfactory.However, he denied ever dealing with Universal on a consignment basis.It was also not Nissan`s usual mode of trading. They had only done a deal on consignment basis once before, and that was not with Universal.In this case, he could not recall any oral agreement that Nissan would pay for the goods only upon inspection.As far as he was concerned, Nissan was to pay by telegraphic transfer once they received the documents.He explained that Nissan could have paid before receiving the documents because they had been dealing with Universal for many years and that Universal had probably sent Nissan copies of the documents.He believed his staff arranged for the telegraphic transfer after ascertaining that the goods were loaded.
The telegraphic transfer was made on 17 November 1993 and inspection of the goods in Japan was made on 28 November 1993.Nissan seldom used telegraphic transfers, their normal practice being `letter of credit on sight`.
He admitted that Trade Facilities was very ready to refund Nissan the money for the goods.Originally the consignee was requested to be Horizon Impex and the party to be notified was Shantou Wanxing Trading Co in China.Ueno was not happy with the terms and insisted that Trade Facilities be made the consignee and the party to be notified because he was worried that Nissan might be construed as selling the counterfeit liquor.He was not the only one communicating with Universal concerning the return of the goods.A colleague, Yamamoto, was also dealing with it.Both of them were concerned about this. The arrangement was not made so as to entrap Trade Facilities.
The defence`s case was that the counterfeit Hennessy XO belonged to someone called Chan Ah Kow (Chan) and that Looi did not know that they were counterfeit.Looi had met Chan about three times.Chan lived in Batu Pahat. The first time was at Dynasty Nite-club at Kallang Leisure Drome.A Mr Teo, Mr Bache Loo and about five or six other Indonesians were also present.Looi formed the impression that they were big businessmen.Chan asked Looi what business he was in and Looi said he was in general trading.Looi mentioned beer and alcohol and Chan said that he could supply liquor like Martell and Hennessy.
Looi testified that he contacted Higa by fax to look for buyers.Higa indicated he could get buyers.Having found a market in Japan, Looi asked Chan what quantity he could supply.Chan said over the phone he could supply 100 to 200 cases of Hennessy XO, subject to Chan`s confirmation.Chan asked about the price.Looi asked Higa, who told him that it was about US$720 per case.Looi told Chan this over the phone.
After a few days, Looi met Chan at Peninsular Hotel sometime around the end of the first week of October 1993.Chan gave Looi a sample bottle as a gift.Looi said that he did not examine the bottle carefully to see if it was a counterfeit.Subsequently, Looi agreed over the phone to deal with Chan. The terms were that Chan would ship the goods to the buyer.After Looi was paid by the buyer Looi would pay Chan.Looi was to pay the freight first but Chan would reimburse him.Looi also had to use a bonded warehouse to handle the transhipment from Batam to Singapore and thence to Japan.Looi`s commission was US$20 per case and he had to split this with Higa.
On 3 November 1993, Looi went over to Batam and witnessed the loading of the goods.He took out a bottle to ensure that it was the right brand.
Looi said that one of the terms he made with Higa was that the buyer could inspect the goods first before paying Looi.He told Higa to ask the buyer to pay into his bank account. The sum of $114,233.80 was paid to his account on 16 or 17 November.Looi issued a cheque for $40,000 to Bache Loo because he owed Looi about $60,000.Looi told Bache Loo to arrange the payment to Chan.Looi knew that Bache Loo would arrange for a Mr Teo Cai Long to pay the money to Chan.Chan called up to confirm he had received the money.Looi deducted several thousand for the freight and storage expenses.Looi paid Higa his half share of the US$2,000 commission.
A few weeks later, Higa contacted Looi to say that the buyer suspected the goods to be counterfeit and wanted to return the goods.Looi did not have the money and had to contact Chan, who became angry.Chan agreed to refund the money if the goods were returned to him.As Looi had no money, Sun Tat Textiles was asked to open the letter of credit.Bache Loo was apparently known to Sun Tat.Looi agreed to pay a 6% commission.
Horizon Impex was, to use the words of Looi, a `friend` of Sun Tat.Looi believed that Sun Tat requested the consignee and the party to be notified to be Horizon Impex and Shantou Wanxing Trading Co respectively.Nissan wanted the goods to be shipped back to Singapore and Looi agreed even though he thought it was unreasonable. The wording in the letter in which Trade Facilities agreed to indemnify Nissan and stating that Nissan was not selling were drafted by Nissan.He testified that he had never seen the original bill of lading.His clerk, Wendy, and Kerry Bonded Warehouse did all the paperwork.
Looi gave evidence that when he heard of Alain Barboteau, it was the first time that he learnt how to tell if the goods were counterfeit.Alain Barboteau was the complainant`s expert who gave evidence in court on how to distinguish the genuine Hennessy XO from the counterfeit ones.
Looi agreed that he was the owner of 5,002 out of 5,003 shares in Trade Facilities.He admitted that Universal had never made a mistake in his previous dealings with them. They had never done one thing when Looi told them to do another. The papers in the file concerning this transaction were thrown away when Looi closed down his office in Peninsular Plaza in March or April 1994.So he did not have the originals to the documents.Looi said that he did not have to keep the documents because Trade Facilities was inactive. Trade Facilities also did not have to file accounts for income tax.
He confirmed that the letter to the carrier was sent on his instructions.A bill of lading for a similar consignment of 100 cases of Hennessy XO sent to Kobe was also opened on his instructions. These were shipped to Wing Trading of Nara. There was no trouble with this consignment.
Looi testified that he did not have to report the commissions for income tax purposes because these were not chargeable to income tax.He claimed that his accountant told him this.He said he earned the commission and not Trade Facilities.His daughter was the one who filed his income tax return, so he did not know what the amount filed was.He did not know whether he told her to fill the commissions in.
According to Looi, he had started out on his own in 1977.He had since seen people cheated and had on one occasion also been cheated.He was therefore aware of the dangers of trading.However, if one was overly careful one would not trade at all.
Looi did not exchange name cards with Chan. They merely exchanged mobile telephone numbers.Chan told Looi that he was from Batu Pahat. The second time they met was in Peninsular Hotel where Chan presented a bottle of Hennessy XO to Looi. They did not exchange name cards, but Looi gave Chan his and took him up to his office. The third time they met was in Batam, at the Puri Garden Hotel.In between the three meetings they had contacted each other by phone.Chan did not give him a name card then either.By then, Looi knew that Chan was from Torina Sdn Bhd. The number of Chan`s mobile phone was 730762.
Looi could not remember if he told his first set of lawyers, Rayney Wong & Co, about Chan.He said that he did tell them he was merely a broker.He did not instruct them to protest about the seizure because he was waiting for them to guide him.Looi claimed that the instructions to Nissan to pay by telegraphic transfer after receipt of the documents were not in accordance with what he told Higa.
In the meantime, there had been a civil suit between the authorized distributor of Hennessy XO for the Asia Pacific region, Moet-Hennessy Asia Pte Ltd, and the complainant on the one hand, and Looi and Trade Facilities on the other.Looi explained that the reason for the discrepancies between his testimony and what was said in his affidavits and answers to requests for further and better particulars in the civil suit was because he had left everything to his lawyers.I note here that the appellants used three sets of lawyers.Rayney Wong was instructed initially.Darshan & Partners were then instructed to take over in the civil proceedings and Spencer Gwee & Co were instructed to take over in the criminal proceedings.Looi`s allegations against his lawyers appear to extend to at least the first two firms.
Looi said that he did not give the details then because his lawyers did not ask.He did not tell his lawyers Chan was from Torina Sdn Bhd because they did not ask. The same was for the mobile phone number.Likewise, he did not tell his lawyers about the meetings with Chan because they did not ask. The statement that he was acting as a commission agent was left out of the earlier affidavit and appeared only in the affidavit of 11 July 1994 because earlier the lawyers also did not ask.He did not initially give his lawyers Chan`s full name because they did not ask.In short, all the discrepancies and omissions were allegedly due to the fault of his lawyers, who did not ask him the pertinent questions.
Looi also testified that he never knew that there was counterfeit Hennessy XO in the market.So it never crossed his mind to address the issue.However, he later said that he probably asked Chan if the goods were genuine and he replied `yes`.When asked to make up his mind he said that he was not sure.He believed in Chan because of his standing.In his affidavit, Looi had also said that he obtained assurances from Chan that the goods were genuine.
Looi`s explanation (for the fact that the $40,000 he made out to Bache Loo and the $60,000 Bache Loo allegedly owed Looi only amounted to $100,000, while the amount to be remitted to Chan after deducting commission and expenses should be $108,000) was that he kept the $8,000, as this `small little money` could be settled in the future. This was so even though it amounted to 21/2 times the total commission paid by Chan.Looi testified that this was done without Chan`s consent as it was very commonly done.He did not find out Chan`s source because it was a supplier`s secret.Otherwise there would be no need for brokers.
Looi`s diary in which he recorded Chan`s and Teo Cai Long`s telephone numbers was tendered in the court below. The learned magistrate noted that Chan`s name was not under `C` but at `K`, squeezed above another entry. There was no space left under `C`. Teo Cai Long`s name was also squeezed at the top under `T`.However, other names were also similarly squeezed in elsewhere. The learned magistrate noted that only Chan`s and Teo Cai Long`s names were written in a similar black ink and that, as Looi knew Teo Cai Long earlier, they should not have been written at the same time.
Bache Loo was not called by the defence.Apparently he had gone to Amsterdam. The defence did not ask for the trial to be adjourned for Bache Loo to be called.Higa was also not called.Apparently he was unwilling to give testimony for Looi or Trade Facilities as he did not want to be seen siding with them.No reason was given why Teo Cai Long was not called.
It was also argued that the respondents did not sell the offending articles.Alternatively, if they had, the sale took place in Japan and not in Singapore.Accordingly, the court in Singapore does not have jurisdiction to hear the charges of selling.It was further argued that there was no importation of the goods into Singapore.
 The decision below
The magistrate held that `sell` in s 73 of the Act is not to be construed according to niceties of the contract law of sale, but is to be understood in the popular sense of the word.Reliance was placed on . He relied on the following to find that Trade Facilities, acting through Looi, did sell the counterfeit Hennessy XO in Singapore:
 
 
(1) Universal was only acting as an intermediary and could not be regarded as selling the spurious goods; 
 
(2) Trade Facilities was registered in Singapore and had a Singapore registered address; 
 
(3) the 100 cases were loaded on board the vessel Bunga Terasek in Singapore, and Trade Facilities was the shipper of these goods as shown by the shipping documents; 
 
(4) the invoice and the packing list for the shipment were issued by Trade Facilities on their letterhead, both bearing Trade Facilities`s company stamp; 
 
(5) the payment of US$71,800 was remitted by Nissan into Looi`s bank account in Singapore.
  
 
 
The magistrate decided that `import` in s 73 of the Act did not have the same meaning as in s 3(1) of the Customs Act (Cap 70).Just because the goods were dutiable did not mean that `import` had the same meaning. The definition of `import` in the Customs Act was for the purpose of determining when customs duties were payable and was not of general application.Furthermore, it would lead to an absurd dichotomy between dutiable and non-dutiable goods under s 73 of the Act.Instead, the meaning of `import` should be that as found in s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1), which simply means `to bring or cause to be brought into Singapore by land, sea or air` as applied to statutes like the Misuse of Drugs Act in . Trade Facilities and Looi had therefore imported the 97 cases into Singapore.
The argument that Trade Facilities and Looi were entrapped was rejected by the magistrate on the ground that there was no such defence. The principle in was followed. The fact that the 97 cases were returned goods made no difference as this should be seen in isolation.
On the question of whether it was Trade Facilities or Looi who committed the offence, the magistrate relied on . He decided that as Trade Facilities had no mind of its own, Looi was just as guilty as he was the person directing and controlling its affairs.Both the company and the human agent could be charged and convicted.Otherwise it would be easy to evade responsibility as a company cannot be imprisoned.
The magistrate was satisfied that Trade Facilities did sell the goods in Singapore.He rejected Looi`s allegation that it was a sale on consignment as it was not supported by the documents. There was also no need for Nissan to pay Looi so early if that was the case, nor was there a need for Nissan to raise a purchase order on 29 October 1993 or for Trade Facilities to issue the invoice and packing list dated 5 November 1993, which was before the shipment set sail on 8 November 1993.It was also too much of a coincidence that Higa`s first error would happen to be in this transaction.
The magistrate rejected the defence that Trade Facilities and Looi were merely agents for Chan, on the ground that it made no difference. The case of was relied on.
Furthermore, Looi was not a credible witness. The magistrate disbelieved the defence that Trade Facilities was merely acting as an innocent agent of Chan. There was an absence of documentary evidence.Also, Looi`s account of Chan`s involvement was improbable. There were numerous inconsistencies between Looi`s oral evidence and his documentary account. The magistrate took the view that the entries in Looi`s diaries were more likely to have been made at the same time and were concocted.It was very convenient that Looi had discarded all of Trade Facilities`s files. The absence of documentary evidence of Chan`s existence indicated that he was nothing more than a figment of Looi`s imagination.
The convoluted manner in which it was alleged Chan was paid as well as the way in which Looi claimed he could retain the $8,000 meant that the account could not bear close scrutiny. Teo Cai Long and Bache Loo were not called as witnesses.Also, Trade Facilities went a long way, to the extent of paying some US$4,200 in commission, to facilitate the return of the goods by issuing a letter of credit for US$70,000 when the commission earned was only half of US$2,000.
Looi also wavered when asked whether it was Trade Facilities or Looi who was acting as agent and earned the commission.His evidence during cross-examination that he acted in his own capacity was also contradictory to his defence filed and his examination-in-chief answers that it was Trade Facilities which was the agent.His evidence that he had inspected a bottle in Batam was also inconsistent with his defence filed.Looi also said Chan assured him that the goods were genuine but he could not say how.In any event, there was no reason for Looi to seek assurance as he claimed not to know there was counterfeit Hennessy in the market.
Furthermore, Looi never mentioned that Chan lived in Batu Pahat and was from Torina Sdn Bhd until he gave evidence.Neither did he mention the three meetings or Chan`s telephone number. The magistrate observed that Looi was eager to evade responsibility for the affidavits and the reply to the complainant`s request for further and better particulars filed in the civil suit.
Accordingly, the defence had failed to prove on a balance of probabilities that Trade Facilities and Looi were merely innocent agents.In any event, Looi had failed to show that he had taken all reasonable precautions against committing the offence and had not given all information in his power in respect of Chan despite the complainant`s relentless demands for it.[See .]
 The appeal
Largely the same issues were canvassed before me.Before dealing with them, it would be convenient to set out the relevant statutory provision.Section 73 of the Act states: 
 
Any person who imports, sells or exposes or has in his possession for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods or thing to which a counterfeit trade mark is applied or to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied, shall, unless he proves that -
 
 
 
(a) having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence under this section, he had, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark and on demand made by or on behalf of the prosecution, he gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods or things; or
(b) he had acted innocently,
 
 
 
be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for each goods or thing to which the counterfeit trade mark is applied or the registered trade mark is falsely applied (but not to exceed in the aggregate $100,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
 
 
 
 
 The meaning of `sell`
 
Counsel for the respondents argued that the magistrate misapplied the principle behind the case of . The case dealt with s 13 of the English Markets and Fairs Clauses Act 1847. The facts of were as follows. There a farmer contracted with one Trebble at the farmer`s house for the sale of two pig carcases to be delivered at Trebble`s shop. Trebble`s shop was within the limits of a marketplace.Pigs were tollable items and the farmer was convicted by the justices of selling tollable items in a market place. This was because the justices found that the risk in the pigs did not pass until delivery in Trebble`s shop.On appeal, the court quashed the conviction.Ridley J said at p 44: 
 
This question arises upon an Act of Parliament the use of the word `sell` in which is, according to previous decisions, not to be construed with reference to the niceties of the law of contract of sale, or to the distinction between a sale and an agreement to sell, or to the question whether the property in the goods has passed, but is to be understood in a popular sense; and although if a lawyer were asked where the sale of these pigs took place he might say that in the legal sense it took place at the butcher`s shop because, until they were delivered there and weighed the sale was not complete, any ordinary person, not a lawyer, who was asked the same question would unhesitatingly say that the sale took place on December 9 at the farmhouse.
 
 
 
Ridley J followed the earlier case of . There the agreement to sell was made outside the town limits and the delivery inside.It was held that the contract to supply was a sufficient sale and hence the butter was sold outside the town limits.
Counsel submitted that the difficulty in this case was that, even if there was a sale, the agreement to sell was clearly made in Japan. The offer was communicated by Universal to Nissan in Japan.Ueno accepted the offer in Japan. The goods were also delivered in Japan.So, leaving aside the question of where the property in the goods could be said to pass (which was not in Singapore anyway), a layman would most probably have said that the sale took place in Japan. The greatest obstacle in the way of finding that the sale took place in Singapore was that until the agreement was reached, all the negotiations were done between Higa and Ueno in Japan, albeit Higa did consult Looi by way of telephone or fax. Therefore, even if the popular sense of the word `sell` was used, the sale took place in Japan. The fact that Trade Facilities and Looi were in Singapore was clearly irrelevant, for Higa was in Japan.Similarly, the fact that the goods were shipped from Singapore was irrelevant.Likewise, the fact that the payment was effected in Singapore was irrelevant. It would have been irrelevant in whether the payment was made in the farmhouse or Trebble`s shop, just as it was irrelevant where the pigs were delivered. Where the invoice and the packing list was issued were also irrelevant because these matters occurred only after the sale.
I was initially attracted to this argument.However, I have come to the conclusion that the approach used in cannot be adopted in interpreting s 73 of the Act.Section 73 says that any person who `sells` commits an offence.It does not prohibit the sale itself. The prohibition is aimed against the person and the act of selling, and not the transaction of sale or the agreement to sell. Thus, although the word `sells` must be given its ordinary English meaning, it is the meaning of the word as a verb that is required.1 used a transactional approach.It determined that the agreement to sell was made at the farm, and hence a layman would say that the sale took place at the farm.In my view, regardless of whether the case was rightly or wrongly decided, it has no application so far as s 73 of the Act is concerned.Section 73 of the Act prohibits the act of selling.Where the sale took place and where the agreement to sell was made is not conclusive.I would go further and say that whether a sale or an agreement to sell is reached is also not conclusive.A fishmonger can be said to have been selling fish on Tuesday even though on the day itself nobody bought or agreed to buy any fish from him.If he set up the stall and made the sales pitch, then he sold fish that day even if at the end of the day he did not manage to sell any of the fish.
The question whether a person `sells` must be looked at from the point of view of the seller and not the buyer.It is the act of selling that is crucial, not the transaction.In order to determine whether a person has sold goods, the court must look at all the circumstances of the case. The same goes where the court has to decide where the act of selling takes place.In deciding these questions, it is the acts which the person does that is relevant, not the resulting transactions, if any.
 The meaning of `import`
The Act itself does not provide a definition of the word `import`.In my view, the proper approach in interpreting the word is to start from s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act. This is because s 2(1) states quite clearly: 
 
In this Act, and in every written law enacted before or after the commencement of this Act, the following words and expressions shall, without prejudice to anything done prior to the commencement of this Act, have the meanings respectively assigned to them unless there is something in the subject or context inconsistent with such construction or unless it is therein otherwise expressly provided:
 
 
 
...
`import`, with its grammatical variations and cognate expressions, means to bring or cause to be brought into Singapore by land, sea or air;
Thus, the interpretation in s 2(1) will apply unless there is something in the subject or context which is inconsistent with such a construction or it is otherwise expressly provided. There is no question of there being an express provision giving the word `import` in the Act a different meaning. The question then is whether there is something in the subject or context which is inconsistent with the meaning assigned to the word by s 2(1).
Counsel for the respondent`s argument was that as liquor are dutiable goods, the meaning assigned to the word `import` by s 3(1) of the Customs Act (Cap 70) should apply.In my view, this argument has no merit. The Customs Act is concerned with the imposition of customs duties. Thus, whether something is dutiable or not is of utmost importance. The Trade Marks Act has nothing to do with customs duties.Whether something is dutiable or not is therefore irrelevant.It cannot be the case that there is one test for `import` under s 73 for dutiable goods and another for non-dutiable goods.
There is therefore nothing in the subject or context of s 73 which requires the use of the special meaning assigned to the word `import` in the Customs Act.In coming to this conclusion, I have kept in mind the consideration that Singapore also relies on entrepot trade. There may thus be very good policy reasons why Singapore should or should not police the transhipment of goods bearing counterfeit trade marks or the like as they pass through Singapore`s free trade zone.However, that is something that Parliament must deal with.If Parliament is of the view that transhipments through Singapore should not be caught by s 73, then it is open to it to amend the Act by expressly incorporating the Customs Act definition of `import` into the Act.
That is not to say that the meaning of `import` in s 73 is necessarily as wide as that provided for in s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act.If the word `import` in s 73 means simply to bring or to cause to be brought into Singapore, then it would appear that any person who brings into Singapore a counterfeit branded handbag, wallet, watch or the like would have committed an offence under s 73.He or she would then have the burden of proving on a balance of probabilities the defences provided for in s 73. Thus, a Singaporean vacationing with her family in, say Hong Kong, who visits Stanley and purchases a counterfeit branded handbag from one of the stalls there will run foul of s 73 if she takes it with her when she returns with her family to Singapore.I cannot imagine that Parliament intended such an absurd result.
Section 73 states that an offence is committed by a person if he `imports, sells or exposes or has in his possession for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture` the offending articles.In my view, s 73 is directed at persons who deal in the course of business, in one way or another, in goods to which a counterfeit trade mark is applied or to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied.It is not aimed at the consumer who uses or merely possesses these goods.Similarly, it cannot be invoked against the same consumer when he brings the offending article into Singapore merely because he happens to have purchased it abroad. Thus, the words `for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture` applies equally to the word `import` in s 73.A person therefore does not `import` something into Singapore within the meaning of the word in s 73 of the Act unless it is done for the purpose of sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture.
 The statutory defences
I now come to the question of the statutory defences provided for in s 73. There are two defences.For convenience, I shall refer to them as the s 73(a) defence and the s 73(b) defence.
The s 73(a) defence is relatively straightforward. There are three elements in this defence, all of which must be satisfied. Thus, in order to avail himself of this defence, it is quite clear from the plain language of s 73(a) that the accused must prove: (1) that he took all reasonable precautions against committing an offence under s 73;(2) that at the time of the alleged offence he had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark; and (3) that on demand by or on behalf of the prosecution, he gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods or things.
The question of the defence in s 73(b) is more difficult. The issue is made more complicated by the legislative history of s 73(b).Until 1991, the word `otherwise` appeared in the predecessors to s 73, so that the defence read `otherwise he had acted innocently.`The word `otherwise` was in s 73(b) of the Trade Marks Act (1985 Ed).When this was repealed in 1991 by the Trade Marks (Amendment) Act 1991 and replaced by the present s 73, the word was omitted.It is not clear if the omission of this word was deliberate or accidental.All the cited cases dealt with provisions where the word `otherwise` appeared.
In , s 2(2) of the English Merchandise Marks Act 1887 contained a similar defence to that found in s 73.Section 2(2)(a) and s 2(2)(b) contained the defence found in our s 73(a).Section 2(2)(c) provided a defence to the accused if `otherwise he had acted innocently.`The court rejected the argument that the defence in s 2(2)(c) could be relied on in a case where no reasonable precaution had been taken even though there was no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade description.Lord Hewart CJ said at p 133: 
 
What defences are open to the defendant?There is a clear division of a twofold nature: the defendant may prove the matter contained in paras (a) and (b), which are united by the conjunction `and`; but apart altogether from those paragraphs, he may prove para (c), the language of which is not `that he had acted innocently,` but `that otherwise he had acted innocently`; in other words, there is the clearest possible dichotomy.If the defendant proposes to prove that which is contained in paras (a) and (b), that is one line of defence, but if the circumstances are such that while his defence is of that nature it is built upon materials that are incomplete, he cannot have recourse to para (c) for the purpose of establishing a portion of that which is alleged in paras (a) and (b). To hold the contrary would be destructive of this part of the section and would involve what appears to me to be at least two absurdities; first, it would involve the conclusion that paras (a) and (b) contain a mere illustration of the kind of defence which may be put forward, and secondly, that the word `otherwise` is to be omitted from para (c). The subsection, as I understand it, means that if a defendant seeks to excuse himself upon the ground that he had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade description he must lay the foundation of that defence by establishing that he has taken all reasonable precautions; in other words, the section in effect says that it is no excuse for the defendant to say that he had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade description unless he shows that he has taken all reasonable precautions.
 
 
 
In my view, upon reading ss 73(a) and 73(b), the natural inference is that even without the word `otherwise`, the intention of the legislature is that the defence in s 73(b) does not apply to the situation where the elements in the s 73(a) defence are only partially satisfied. The observations of Lord Hewart CJ on this aspect of the defence in is just as applicable with or without the word `otherwise`.Section 73(a) cannot be a mere illustration of s 73(b), for otherwise there would be no need to lay down such stringent requirements.It cannot be the intention of the legislature that if a defendant cannot satisfy s 73(a) because one or more elements of the defence is missing, he can nevertheless rely on s 73(b). This will make nonsense of the requirements of s 73(a).
Therefore, the s 73(b) defence requires more than just an incomplete s 73(a) defence.In other words, if 
 a 
, 
 b 
and 
 c 
make up the s 73(a) defence, the defence under s 73(b) cannot be satisfied by only 
 a 
 and 
 b 
, or just 
 b 
 and 
 c 
, or 
 a 
 and 
 c 
.It must at least require this incomplete defence and something else.
However, it seems to me that Lord Hewart CJ placed too much emphasis on the word `otherwise` that was found in that provision.I do not see how the presence of the word `otherwise` must lead necessarily to the conclusion that, if a defendant seeks to excuse himself upon the ground that he had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade description, then he must lay the foundation of that defence by establishing that he has taken all reasonable precautions.In my view, this proposition is too wide.It is also not one which must follow from the mere presence of the word `otherwise`.
The word `otherwise` appears to me to serve only the purpose of emphasizing the point that, even if a defendant cannot establish the first defence, he can nevertheless still rely on the second defence.It also emphasizes the fact that the second defence cannot merely be an incomplete first defence.Apart from that, the word is really quite superfluous.
If Lord Hewart CJ was right, then it follows that similarly, if an element of a defence includes the fact that the defendant has taken all reasonable precautions, then he cannot argue that `otherwise he had acted innocently`.More absurdly, if part of the defence is that he had, on demand by the prosecution, given all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods or things, then he similarly cannot say that otherwise he had acted innocently. This must be so, for the word `otherwise` draws no distinction between one element of the s 73(a) defence and another.Yet, it is often the case that an innocent person will wish to cooperate with the prosecutor.In fact, this is frequently the very mark of innocence.
It cannot be the case that if the proposed proof of innocence includes an element of the first defence, then in no circumstance can the second defence be established and the defendant must prove all three elements of the first defence regardless of the weight of the other circumstances which tend to show that he had acted innocently.In that case, the defendant will be better off if he had taken no care at all, has all the reasons in the world to suspect the genuineness of the mark, and refuses to give any information to the prosecutor!I cannot believe that this was the intention of Parliament.
The absurdity that follows from the line of reasoning in is vividly illustrated by the local case of . In that case, the appellant, who could only be said to have imported socks, was found guilty under s 12 of the Merchandise Marks Ordinance (the precursor to s 73 of the Act). The appellant did not know and had no reason to suspect that the socks contained counterfeit trade marks or any trade mark at all.In fact, he had not even ordered socks.He could not check the goods until he accepted delivery of the goods by handing in the bill of lading.However, if he accepted delivery, the offence of importing would be complete.As the court found, no reasonable precaution could be taken.And because no precaution could be taken, none was in fact taken. The first defence therefore could not be satisfied.As the appellant was relying on the fact that he had no reason to suspect the genuineness of any mark on the socks, it was held that he could not rely on the second defence.With the greatest respect, it appears to me that such a result is quite indefensible and McElwaine CJ was rightly justified to feel reluctance in arriving at it.
A perusal of the cases reveals the confusion that was thrown up. There appear to have been two conflicting lines of authorities. The first line stemmed from . In that case, Christie, Manson & Woods had described in their catalogue as Dresden china something which was not Dresden china.Before the sale, the seller`s attention was drawn to this.Accordingly, at the sale, the sellers said to those present that it was doubtful whether the items were Dresden china and that they would only sell it for what it was. The court held that the conviction under s 2(2) of the above English Act must be quashed for they were not putting forward the untrue marks as true marks.
Grantham J held in that case that, although the sellers could not show that they had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade mark, their actions were nevertheless bona fide and that it is wrong to say that they could not be innocent unless they were free from all suspicion as to its genuineness.Channell J expressed the view that the gist of the defences must be that there are other cases of innocence beside absence of knowledge or of suspicion.Channell J thought that it would be open to set up the defence of absence of mens rea and that innocence means `innocence of any intention to infringe the Act of Parliament` and not innocence of any intention to defraud.
In the accused stocked a children`s elixir called Dongre`s Balamrit.He also had a spurious concoction called Domre`s Balamrit. The complainant, the manufacturer of Dongre`s Balamrit, tried to entrap the accused by asking for Dongre`s Balamrit.He was offered the real thing at 12 annas a bottle.When asked if there was something cheaper, the accused offered him another make, namely, Domre`s, for 8 annas a bottle.It was held that the trade mark of Dongre`s Balamrit was counterfeited.However, it was held that the accused had a defence, in that he had acted innocently, to a charge under s 486 of the Indian Penal Code, which is similar to and was the predecessor to s 73.It was held at p 113 that: 
 
That the provisions of s 486 of the Indian Penal Code are aimed at retailer [sic] who connives with a fraudulent wholesaler or manufacturer in palming-off on an unsuspecting public goods which purport to be other than what they are. The accused does not come within this category.No attempt at substitution was made and the Domre`s bottles were offered at a lower price as being a different and cheaper article.
 
 
 
was cited with approval by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) in , which was in turn followed in
The other line of cases originated from . In that case , was distinguished.However, it is not apparent from the various judgments pronounced what the exact grounds of distinction were.In this case, the appellant had filled bottles embossed with the name of the Felinfoel Brewery Co with beer from the Bass C.He put Bass`s labels on the bottle. The court upheld his conviction under s 2(2) of the Merchandise Marks Act 1887.A perusal of the three judgments will show that no satisfactory reason was given for the decision despite a surfeit of dicta.
The most relevant of these dicta was the one which adopted Channell J`s view in that innocence means innocence of any intention to infringe the Act of Parliament and not innocence of any intention to defraud. This was interpreted to mean that there must not have been any intention to do the acts proscribed by the statute.So, in order to avail oneself of the second defence, it must be shown that what was done was done either inadvertently or because of a mistake of fact.
In an earlier Irish case of , the facts were quite similar to . The defendant filled bottles embossed with the plaintiff`s trade mark with its own mineral water. It then affixed its own labels to the bottles and sold them as the defendant`s mineral water. It was held that s 2 of the Merchandise Marks Act 1887 was nevertheless infringed even though there was no intention to defraud.In the High Court, Porter MR agreed with the view that innocence does not mean innocence of an intention to defraud but means innocence of an intention to violate the statute.He was of the view that: 
 
Several states of facts, besides those in sub-ss (a) and (b), may be suggested which would render a sale under a false trade mark innocent, eg if the vendor bona fide believed that he had the authority and consent of the owner of the Trade Mark, or if, in spite of all reasonable precautions, a sale had taken place of a bottle, or even a few bottles, bearing a trade mark, but not believed or suspected to bear it.Possibly even a reasonable belief that the trade mark had been abandoned, or assigned to some one who did not intend to use it, or the like, might amount to innocence in its use within the Act.But where a man knows that another is the owner of a trade mark, and he intentionally uses it by applying it to his own goods, from motives of personal convenience or profit, I am of the opinion that he cannot, under the statute, claim immunity on the ground of innocence.
 
 
 
In the Court of Appeal, it was held that the second defence cannot simply be parts of the first defence.Fitzgibbon LJ said at p 401: 
 
In my opinion, the words `otherwise acted innocently` apply to cases similar to those described in (a) and (b), where a defendant can prove that he was innocent of any intention to infringe the Act: for instance, that he was unaware that the mark applied to the goods was the trade mark of another manufacturer, or that the act was done by some other person for whom he was not responsible;but they cannot apply to a case like the present, where the defendant admittedly knew that the embossments on the bottles were registered trade marks, which he wilfully applied to goods not manufactured by the proprietors of those marks.
 
 
 
In the view was expressed by Viscount Caldecote CJ at p 55 that: 
 
I agree with that statement of the position by Lord Hewart CJ.Precisely the same argument is true and should prevail if a defendant seeks to come under (c) by proving, not the first part of (a), but the second part only of (a).
 
 
 
This supports my view that there is no distinction between one element in the s 73(a) defence and another.
It will be noted that the view that `otherwise` acted innocently means that the defendant had acted in some way by inadvertence or mistake of fact gained further ascendance. To escape responsibility under the second defence, it was necessary for the defendant to prove that there was no intention to do the act in question, that is, to sell the offending article.
In , the approach in , which was apparently approved of in was cited with approval. This was a case where the accused was saying that he had no reason to suspect that the trade marks were counterfeit.
Coming back to , McElwaine CJ in that case was driven by the and line of authority to comment at p 49 that: 
 
I find it difficult to imagine how an importer who does not get possession can ever have any defence such as the legislature intends him to have if in such a case `acted innocently` is to be confined to an act of inadvertence.On the other hand it seems to me to be impossible to give cl (c) one interpretation when applied to the word `imports` and an entirely different interpretation when applied to the next three verbs in the same section.
 
 
 
It can thus be seen from this case that the example given by Fitzgibbon LJ in about one who was unaware that the mark applied was a trade mark of another was not a case where a defendant could be said to have otherwise acted innocently, as interpreted by and .
In my view, the line of cases following from , which has been impliedly adopted by this court in and when it approved of , is the correct one to follow. There are two reasons for this.
First, if we are to follow the line of authorities as interpreted by , it would mean that the second defence is not open to a defendant who knows or has reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark.However, if he has no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark, then he cannot rely on the second defence because of the word `otherwise`.So, regardless of whether he has or has not reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark, he cannot rely on the defence of acting innocently.With respect, this is patently ludicrous.
Secondly, selling and importing are hardly acts that can be done inadvertently.None of the cases have been able to show how one can sell or import without respectively the intention of selling or importing.It is difficult to see how this can be done.Similarly, as exposing or possession must be for the purpose of sale or for some other purpose of trade or manufacture, these acts similarly cannot be done inadvertently. The upshot of this is that the defence of innocence is only available if the acts are done inadvertently.However, the acts proscribed by s 73 can hardly be done inadvertently. The result is that, for all practical intent and purpose, the `inadvertence` limb of the s 73(b) defence is emasculated.
I am supported in my view by the passage from cited above. I have already said that if is right, then it is not possible to rely on the s 73(b) defence unless one has not taken all reasonable precautions, had reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade mark and has proffered no information to the complainant.However, if that is the case, I am at a loss as to how, apart from mistake of fact, the defendant can possibly be said to have acted innocently.
Thus the only meaning that can be attributed by the inexorable logic of following this line of authorities is that the s 73(b) defence only relates to mistake of fact.It was suggested that this defence can also apply in the case where the act was done by somebody for whom the defendant has no responsibility.However, if the act was done by somebody for whom the defendant has no responsibility, then the short answer is that it was not, even vicariously, the act of the defendant.In my view, the conclusion that the s 73(b) defence is nothing more than the defence of mistake of fact cannot be supported in Singapore. This is because there is already a general defence for mistake of fact under s 79 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).So, if this interpretation of the s 73(b) defence is right, the conclusion must be that the s 73(b) defence is superfluous.If mistake of fact is the only instance possible where the defendant can be said to have acted innocently, then there is simply no point in enacting s 73(b).
It must be remembered that s 2 of the English Merchandise Marks Act 1887 is not as wide as our s 73.Most notably, it does not cover the act of importing.We should therefore not blindly follow the English authorities on s 2 and transplant them to our s 73. I can think of some instances where someone who consciously imports an offending article which he suspects to bear a counterfeit trade mark nevertheless can be said to have acted innocently.Suppose a foreign buyer suspects that certain bottles of Hennessy XO he purchased were counterfeit.In order to confirm this, he sends a bottle to the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research (SISIR) for testing.SISIR accepts the bottle knowing that it is suspected to be counterfeit.SISIR would have imported the bottle, for part of its trade is the testing of products.Can it be said that SISIR has not acted innocently?I do not think that in such a case, SISIR can be said to have committed even a technical offence under s 73.It makes no difference if instead of SISIR, it was a private laboratory.
Hence, I conclude that the , as interpreted by , line of cases cannot be followed in Singapore.For this reason, I decline to follow them.Similarly , should not be followed.In any event, it can easily be distinguished.
McElwaine CJ in reluctantly followed . Rightly or wrongly, Lord Hewart CJ in that case was greatly influenced by the presence of the word `otherwise` in the second defence. The word no longer appears in s 73(b).
The learned magistrate in this case came to the conclusion that the omission of the word `otherwise` in s 73(b) was inadvertent.He was persuaded by the fact that the records of the parliamentary debates reveal that there was no debate on the scope of the statutory defence that would lead to a deliberate deletion of that word.I am of the view that just because there was no debate in Parliament over the omission of the word `otherwise` does not necessarily mean that its deletion was unintended.In my view, when the legislature deletes a word from a piece of legislation, the presumption must be that there is a reason for so doing.Unless therefore it is very clear that the deletion was inadvertent, one must presume that it was deliberate. This is especially so when the repeal and re-enactment of s 73 has the effect of changing the scope of the provision and the penalty under it.For this reason, if I am wrong about not following , I hold that can be distinguished on the grounds that the word `otherwise` no longer appears in s 73.
The s 73(b) defence is not limited to inadvertence or mistake of fact.Nevertheless, in order to prove innocence under s 73(b), it is not sufficient to just show an incomplete s 73(a) defence.However, the mere fact that in order to prove a s 73(b) defence, a defendant has to rely on facts which are also elements of a s 73(a) defence, is not by itself a sufficient ground for saying that the s 73(b) defence cannot be relied on. Moreover, the mere fact that a defendant cannot establish an element of the s 73(a) defence does not mean that he cannot have acted innocently.It is permissible in certain circumstances to point to other additional facts which can turn an incomplete s 73(a) defence into a s 73(b) defence.
It may well be that for a case like that in , the fact that no precaution can be taken is sufficient to make good the failure to take all reasonable precautions, so that the incomplete s 73(a) defence is transformed into a perfected s 73(b) defence.After all, if no reasonable precaution can be taken, then all reasonable precautions in that case would mean no reasonable precaution.All of nothing is, after all, nothing.However, there is no need to decide this.Similarly, it may well be the case that the decisions in and are correct on the facts of those cases even though the reasoning cannot be wholly accepted.I express no opinion on this.At the end of the day, much will depend on the facts of each individual case.
 Application of the principles to the facts
In this case, Looi had admitted to instructing Higa by fax to look for buyers in Japan.When Higa found the buyer, Looi negotiated for the price through Higa.His instructions to Higa were over the telephone and the fax machine.Adopting the ordinary English meaning of `sell`, there can be no doubt that Looi did do the act of selling the Hennessy XO in question.Hence, whether or not the transaction was a sale by consignment is immaterial.It is the act of selling that is caught by s 73, not the transaction.A trader no less sells goods when he sells them by using the sale by consignment method.Even if the prospective buyer decides at the end of the day not to accept the consignment so that no sale took place, the trader has no less committed the act of selling the goods for the purpose of s 73.
Similarly, there can be no doubt that Looi did the acts of selling the Hennessy XO in Singapore. The fact that the actual offer received by Nissan was communicated by Higa in Japan is immaterial.So is the fact that the acceptance was made in Japan so that the agreement to sell is most likely to have been concluded in Japan.Where the contract was concluded in law and where the property passes is not conclusive. There is no doubt that Looi called up Higa from Singapore. There is also no doubt that the faxes were sent from Singapore.All the acts of selling done by Looi were done in Singapore. The inevitable conclusion therefore is that Looi was selling the Hennessy XO and he was doing it in Singapore. Therefore, the Singapore courts have jurisdiction over the matter.No doubt the actual communication with Ueno of Nissan was made by Higa in Japan.In all likelihood, Higa was also selling the Hennessy XO.However, this fact is immaterial, for there is no reason why both of them cannot be selling the same goods at the same time.Of course, Higa did his acts of selling in Japan, and the Singapore courts have no jurisdiction over this.Similarly, even if Looi`s evidence that he was acting for Chan is accepted, this does not detract from the fact that Looi was nevertheless selling the Hennessy XO.He may have been selling as an agent for somebody else, but he was nonetheless selling.
For these reasons, it is not material whether the magistrate believed Ueno`s or Looi`s evidence on this aspect of the case.So far as the question of selling is concerned, Looi had for all relevant purposes admitted to doing the prohibited act.On the basis of either version, it is quite clear that Looi was selling the counterfeit Hennessy XO and he was doing it in Singapore.Calling Higa to give evidence would not have made any difference whatsoever.
Turning to the question of the importation of the 97 cases into Singapore, again, there can be no question but that the 97 cases have been imported into Singapore so far as the Interpretation Act definition is concerned.It is not, and cannot be, disputed that the goods were seized when they were in Singapore territory. The question then is whether they were imported into Singapore for the purpose of sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture.
The counterfeit Hennessy XO here were returned by Nissan. They had been rejected by Nissan because it suspected them of being counterfeit.In my view, the acceptance of the return of goods sold in the course of trade is something done for a purpose of trade.It is a necessary incident of the trade of selling the goods. The 97 cases of counterfeit Hennessy XO had therefore been imported into Singapore for the purpose of s 73.
The question then is whether Looi or Trade Facilities imported these 97 cases.In my view, it is again quite clear that Looi or Trade Facilities or both have done this.While Nissan was the sender of the goods, it was Looi who had arranged for the financing of their return.He was the one who procured the letter of credit from Sun Tat.On the basis of this letter of credit, Nissan sent the goods to Singapore. Therefore, Looi had caused the 97 cases to be brought into Singapore. They were caused to be brought into Singapore for a purpose of trade. Therefore Looi had imported the goods.
I now come to the issue of whether it was Looi or Trade Facilities who did the acts of selling and importing.In my view, the magistrate was right to apply the principles behind to the facts of this case.If the evidence shows that Looi`s mind and will were behind Trade Facilities, then Looi cannot hide behind the corporate veil of Trade Facilities.Otherwise, the Act can be evaded with impunity by the simple device of incorporating a $2 company to carry on the trading.In this case, the evidence does show that Trade Facilities was nothing more than the alter ego of Looi.It was nothing more than a vehicle that Looi employed as and when it suited him.All but one of Trade Facilities`s shares were held by Looi and the single directing mind behind Trade Facilities belonged to Looi. This was an appropriate case to lift the corporate veil and the magistrate was correct when he did so.
On the other hand, the fact that the corporate veil has been lifted does not absolve Trade Facilities of all liability. The acts and intentions of a company`s managers can be attributed to that of the company.In this case, Trade Facilities allowed itself to be used as a vehicle of Looi`s. Thus when Looi used Trade Facilities to sell and to import counterfeit Hennessy XO, Trade Facilities was just as liable. Trade Facilities was more than a passive employer. The invoices were sent by Trade Facilities. The fax messages were sent using Trade Facilities`s machine.When the goods were sent to Japan, Trade Facilities was the shipper.Similarly, when they were returned, Trade Facilities was the consignee and the party to be notified. Trade Facilities had taken an active part in the acts of selling and importing. Therefore, Trade Facilities is also culpable.
Then, there is the question of whether the respondents can rely on the statutory defences.So far as the selling is concerned, it seems clear to me that neither of the respondents can rely on the s 73(a) defence. The evidence shows that Looi had clearly not given all information in his power with respect to Chan, assuming Chan exists, to the complainant despite repeated demands by it.I do not for one instance believe that this is because Looi had left everything to his lawyers and the lawyers had not asked.
As for the s 73(b) defence, it seems to me that so far as the selling is concerned, the respondents also cannot establish this defence.Even if Looi`s evidence about Chan is accepted, and even if it is accepted that Looi had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade marks on the Hennessy XO and had taken all reasonable precautions, there is nothing in Looi`s evidence which can be used to show innocence. The mere fact that Looi was acting as an agent (assuming it is true) is not something that can be used to show innocence when Looi had consciously refused to provide information about his principal to the complainant.I am of the view that, barring exceptional circumstances, the fact that one is a mere agent is not something that can be used to establish innocence when the agent has failed to give all the information in his power with respect to the principal to the complainant when so demanded.
Apart from the allegation that Looi was an agent of Chan, there is no additional fact which can establish innocence. That being the case, the respondents` alleged s 73(b) defence is nothing but an incomplete s 73(a) defence. Therefore, the respondents have not satisfied me that they have acted innocently when they sold the Hennessy XO.
The reason why, in relation to the charges of selling, the respondents cannot rely on the s 73(a) defence applies equally to the charges of importing. The respondents have not provided the complainant with all the information within their powers about Chan.It is not sufficient in the case of goods returned by buyers to just provide the complainant with information about the buyer who rejected the goods. The seller accepting the return of the goods must provide information about the person he got the goods from in the first place.
Apart from this, I am of the view that in normal circumstances, the fact that the importation of goods resulted from a rejection of the same goods sold by a seller to a foreign buyer can be used to show innocence.If the seller is able to establish a defence in relation to the original act of selling to the foreign buyer, then it can be sufficient to show that the subsequent importation of the same goods was because the buyer had decided to return them. This is so even if the ground for the rejection of the goods is that the buyer alleges that the goods are counterfeit.Where this happens, a normal and quite innocent reaction of the seller is to accept the return of the goods. This can be done for no reason other than to ascertain the truthfulness of the buyer`s complaint.It makes no difference that, by now, the seller obviously has reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade mark, as the buyer had complained about them. The contrary position would make no commercial sense, for the seller would then either have to abandon the goods in a foreign land or send somebody over to check the goods.Redirecting the goods to another place will not avail the seller, for then he can be said to sell them again.
I am therefore of the view that where a seller sells goods to an overseas buyer which are discovered to be counterfeit, and the seller is able to establish a defence to the original act of selling, he can normally be said to act innocently when he imports the same goods back to Singapore because the foreign buyer has rejected the goods. The fact that when he imports those goods he now has reason to suspect the genuineness of the trade mark applied to them is not sufficient by itself to defeat the defence of innocence.
The contrary position is not necessarily true.It may be that in certain circumstances, even if the seller is unable to establish a defence to the original act of selling, he may nevertheless be able to show that he acts innocently when he imports them upon rejection by the buyer. This may be so even if the ground of the rejection is that the goods are counterfeit.I express no view on this because it appears to me that much depends on the facts of the particular case.It would therefore be premature to dismiss the possibility that the defence of innocence can still be established even though there was no defence to the original act of selling.
In the present case, the primary reason why the respondents cannot establish a defence to the charges of selling the Hennessy XO was because they have refused to provide all information that was in their power about the source of the counterfeit goods.In my view, this refusal sufficiently taints the subsequent import so that, in relation to the import, when the respondents persist in failing to provide the information asked for by the complainant, they cannot avail themselves of the defence of innocence.In the absence of some special circumstance, this is so even if, at the time of the original act of selling, the seller had taken all reasonable precautions and had no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark.
In my view, although the element of providing information about the person from whom the defendant obtained the goods, when requested for by the complainant, is not an indispensable element of the s 73(b) defence, it is nonetheless often of great importance.Only exceptional facts can displace this element of innocence, even in respect of the s 73(b) defence.
There is no such special circumstance in this case.No good reason was offered to the court, explaining why the respondents had failed to give all the information in their power with respect to the persons from whom they had obtained the goods, when demanded by the complainant. Therefore, in this case, this failure is fatal to both the s 73(a) and the s 73(b) defences in respect of the charges of selling and also of importing.
That being the case, whether the magistrate ought or ought not to have accepted the respondents` evidence about Chan is neither here not there.Even if Looi`s story about Chan and what transpired is accepted, it does not have any material bearing on whether the respondents did sell the counterfeit Hennessy XO.Similarly, it does not have any bearing on whether the respondents imported the 97 cases.More significantly, it does not establish any defence to the charges of selling and importing.I am therefore of the view that the respondents were rightly convicted.
 The sentences
Trade Facilities was fined $40,000 and $15,000 respectively for selling and importing the counterfeit Hennessy XO.Looi was fined $80,000 and $30,000 respectively for selling and importing. The respondents are appealing, and the complainant is cross-appealing, with the consent of the Public Prosecutor, against the sentences imposed on Trade Facilities and Looi.
The maximum penalty for an offence under s 73 of the Act is a fine of $10,000 for each article to which the counterfeit trade mark is applied, but not exceeding $100,000 in the aggregate, or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both.
In sentencing the respondents, the magistrate appeared to have been influenced by the fact that there was no evidence to link the respondents to any syndicate that would have produced the counterfeit Hennessy XO.In my view, the legislature has not drawn a distinction between someone who counterfeits a trade mark, makes a die or other instrument for counterfeiting trade marks, and someone who violates s 73 by selling, importing or the like.In all cases, the maximum penalty is a $100,000 fine or five years` imprisonment or both. The only difference is that, in the case of s 73, where the number of offending articles is few, then the maximum fine is $10,000 per article. That being the case, someone who infringes s 73 can in certain circumstances be no less culpable than one who counterfeits the trade mark. The trader is subject to the same sanctions as a manufacturer or counterfeiter.
On the facts of this case, although it is not necessary for the purpose of dismissing the respondents` appeal against conviction to examine the magistrate`s finding of fact on the Chan Ah Kow story, it is necessary to do so for the purpose of sentencing. The magistrate`s finding was that Looi`s account about Chan was an afterthought and a figment of Looi`s imagination.He also found that Looi was not a credible witness. The rejection of his defence on this ground is in my view wholly justified by the evidence. This amounts to a finding that Looi`s story about Chan Ah Kow was nothing but a tissue of lies. That being the case, it is quite inconsistent to then say when sentencing Looi that the court will not make any finding beyond the fact that Looi had not established his defence. The fact that a defendant has all but spun an entire fairy tale in court is a relevant consideration when sentencing.
Taking into account the seriousness of this case and the manner in which the respondents have conducted the defence, I am of the view that there is no merit in the respondents` appeal against the sentences imposed.On the other hand, I agree with the complainant that a custodial sentence should be imposed on Looi. Therefore, in addition to the fines that have been imposed on the respondents, I will sentence Looi to three months` imprisonment for each offence. The sentences will run concurrently.
I will therefore dismiss the respondents` appeal and allow that of the complainant`s.
 Respondents` appeal dismissed. Complainant`s appeal allowed.",1995-05-03 00:00:00,SG High Court

Cur Adv Vult
 
The applicant in this criminal motion is the appellant in MA 43/94 and seeks by this motion to adduce further evidence in the appeal. The applicant faced in the court below five charges of criminal breach of trust. The first charge read as follows: 
 
You, Carl Elias s/o Jack Moses Elias, NRIC No 1475884/D, are charged that you, on or about 23 October 1989, in Singapore, being entrusted with property, namely, 2,000 Overseas Union Bank Warrants 1994 for the purpose of delivering these warrants on behalf of Trans-Pacific Credit Pte Ltd (the company) to DBS Securities Pte Ltd pursuant to a sale (per contract Number 414270/501) of the said warrants, and thereafter to pay the proceeds, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 406 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
The other four charges were virtually identical save for the property alleged to have been entrusted to the appellant and the respective contract numbers. These were: 10,000 Inter-Pacific Industrial Group Bhd shares (contract numbers 413142/501); 12,000 North Borneo Timber shares (contract numbers 413124/501 and 413125/501); 92,000 Keppel Investment Warrants 1991 (contract numbers 414182/, 414176/501, 414179/501 and 415507/501 and 100,000 Straits Steamship Warrants 1994 (contract numbers 414292/501, 414307/503, 414295/501 and 414289/501).
 The facts
Briefly, the facts of the case were that in March 1989, the applicant entered into a share financing scheme with a finance company known as Trans-Pacific Credit Pte Ltd (Trans-Pacific). Under the scheme, loans were extended to the applicant by Trans-Pacific, these loans being in turn secured by shares which the applicant purchased. The arrangement was that the applicant would be permitted to borrow up to 60% of the value of any shares he had deposited with Trans-Pacific. At the same time the applicant also had a securities trading account with DBS Securities Pte Ltd (DBS Securities).
On 16 October 1989, the applicant sold through DBS Securities five lots of shares, which shares later became the subject matter of the five charges levelled against the applicant. These were shares which the applicant had deposited with Trans-Pacific as security for their loan. On 23 October 1989, the five lots of shares were handed over to the applicant by a Trans-Pacific staff in order that he might deliver them to DBS Securities for the completion of the sales made on 16 October 1989. The prosecution`s case against the applicant in the court below was that the arrangement between the applicant and Trans-Pacific necessitated the sales proceeds being credited directly to Trans-Pacific rather than to the applicant`s DBS Securities account. This was to prevent the applicant`s loan facility with Trans-Pacific from becoming undersecured. To that end, so the prosecution alleged, cover notes were attached to the shares handed over to the applicant, which notes contained directions to DBS Securities to credit the sales proceeds to Trans-Pacific.
Subsequently, however, the sales proceeds were credited to the applicant`s DBS Securities account. On 25 October 1995, the applicant did withdraw $20,000 from this account. He paid this sum into his loan account with Trans-Pacific. The bulk of the sales proceeds which had been credited into his DBS Securities account was also withdrawn by the applicant some time later but these were used for other purposes.
At trial, staff from DBS Securities testified that they had not received Trans-Pacific`s cover notes together with the shares and that had they known of Trans-Pacific`s instructions regarding the sales proceeds, they would not have credited the moneys into the applicant`s securities trading account. The prosecution`s case was that the sales proceeds had been dishonestly misappropriated by the applicant, thereby constituting the offence of criminal breach of trust.
In his defence the applicant claimed that he had been the owner of the shares both in law and in equity and that accordingly any proceeds from their sales belonged to him as well. As such, he argued, it had been perfectly in order for the sales proceeds to be credited into his account with DBS Securities rather than to Trans-Pacific. His only obligation to Trans-Pacific, so far as he had been concerned, was to reduce his outstanding loan and it was for that reason that he had made a payment of $20,000 into his loan account with Trans-Pacific on 25 October 1989. The applicant also argued that throughout his dealings with Trans-Pacific from the time he first entered into the share financing scheme, Trans-Pacific had failed to maintain that the loan extended to him was fully secured at all times.
At the conclusion of the trial it was held by the district judge that the prosecution had proved all five charges beyond reasonable doubt. The applicant was convicted and sentenced to varying lengths of imprisonment on the five charges, the total period of imprisonment imposed amounting to 34 months. MA 43/94 was the appeal mounted against his convictions. The hearing of the appeal was adjourned but, in the interim, the applicant filed CM 5/95, seeking leave to adduce further evidence.
 The motion to adduce further evidence
The further evidence in question consists of a report by a firm of certified public accountants. This report compares the outstanding loans which the applicant had with Trans-Pacific on specific dates, with the market values of the shares deposited as security with Trans-Pacific at those dates. The report is intended to show that at various dates the applicant`s outstanding loans with Trans-Pacific exceeded 60% of the shares deposited as security; yet Trans-Pacific took no action on these occasions.
In the affidavit in support of the motion, the applicant explains that the necessity of demonstrating Trans-Pacific`s inaction arises because, in his grounds of decision, the district judge held that: 
 
(I)t was abundantly clear that the shares were not intended to be given back to [the applicant] without more ... . His ownership of the five counters of shares was not entirely free from encumbrances as they were purchased using TPC`s funds; they remain therefore subject to the rights of the pledgees and would only be free of such rights when he had reduced his financial liability to the level that is secured by existing securities pledged or when he had cleared all his liability. [Pages 23-24, grounds of decision.]
 
 
 
The applicant claims that the report will go to show that in fact Trans-Pacific had, `
 from the inception of the loan transaction, never maintained or insisted that the margin of shares deposited with TPC for the loans be maintained 
`.
 The applicable principles
The principles governing an application to adduce further evidence on appeal are set out succinctly in the headnote to : first, it must be shown that the evidence could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial; secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given at the trial, it would probably have an important influence on the result of the case, although it need not be decisive; and thirdly, the evidence must be apparently credible although it need not be incontrovertible.
 The above principles as applied to the present motion
Applying the above principles to the applicant`s case, it is clear to me that he cannot hope to clear even the first hurdle, that is, the condition of non-availability at trial. He has not explained in his affidavit why such a report could not have been made available during the trial in the court below. In effect, the report does no more than to restate the evidence heard in the course of the trial below. For example, the evidence-in-chief of PW9 Choo Lee Lee, at pp 148-149 of the notes of evidence, in which she stated: 
 
Between 23 October 1989 and 30 October 1989, the loan due from accused to Trans-Pacific Credit is $618,188.26. Comparing this figure with the value of shares in Trans-Pacific Credit`s possession pledged by the accused, obviously there is great disparity and the loan amount exceeded our security.
 
 
 
Yet, in spite of the admitted irregularity, the applicant apparently continued to be permitted to draw upon his loan facility with Trans-Pacific: this is plain, for example, from the applicant`s own evidence at pp 263-265 of the notes of evidence.
In short, therefore, there was considerable evidence led in the course of the trial below on the very matter on which the present accountants` report touches on; and, as I have said, no explanation was offered by the applicant as to why the report could not have been produced at trial. Indeed he even admits at p 3 of his affidavit that the report is `
 based on the evidence tendered at the trial` 
. In the circumstances, therefore, I am of the opinion that the application to adduce this report as further evidence cannot be allowed.
I should add that, during the hearing of this criminal motion, counsel for the applicant endeavoured also to show that the report would have had an important influence on the result of the case; whilst the Deputy Public Prosecutor endeavoured to show otherwise. This involved quite a lot being said, therefore, about the merits of the substantive magistrate`s appeal. As I shall be hearing MA 43/94 soon, I do not propose in these grounds to go into the arguments concerning the merits of the appeal. CM 5/95 is accordingly dismissed for the reasons I have set out above.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The second plaintiff was formerly the managing director of some subsidiaries within the Inchcape group of companies in Singapore. He retired and returned to the United Kingdom in 1973. Whilst in retirement, he was requested by three persons, one of whom was James Kwok Hoi Thin (`James Kwok`), the second third party, to join them in setting up a company to trade in medical and surgical equipment. James Kwok was the second plaintiff`s former subordinate in the Inchcape Group. He enjoyed the confidence and trust of the second plaintiff. Thus, Ikumene Singapore Pte Ltd (`Ikumene`), the first plaintiffs, was incorporated on 29 December 1978 with the second plaintiff holding 47,000 (ie 94%) of the 50,000 issued shares of $1 each.
The second plaintiff thus provided the working capital through his holding of 47,000 fully-paid shares. He also executed a guarantee in favour of Far Eastern Bank Ltd (`the bank`) relating to the overdraft and other facilities extended to Ikumene. By way of security for the facilities granted by the bank to Ikumene, he executed a memorandum of charge in favour of the bank on his fixed deposit of $200,000 with the bank.
On 19 October 1981 the defendant was appointed auditor of Ikumene. Presumably the defendant had started auditing before her appointment because the audited accounts of Ikumene for the year ended 31 December 1979 contained the auditor`s report of 20 October 1981.
On 12 February 1982 the audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 1980 were completed with the auditor`s report of 12 February 1982. On 30 October 1982 the audited accounts for the year ended 31 December 1981 were completed. Accompanying the said accounts was the auditor`s report of 4 November 1982.
In respect of these three sets of audited accounts, the auditor`s reports stated that the accounts were properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act (Cap 185, 1970 Ed) (`the Act`) so as to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Ikumene for the respective years and that the accounting and other records had been properly kept in accordance with the Act.
The 1979 audited accounts showed a loss of $10,371. This was adjusted in the 1980 accounts upward to $25,850. The 1980 audited accounts showed a loss of $28,788, resulting in an accumulated loss of $54,638. However, the 1981 audited accounts showed a profit of $20,332, thereby reducing the accumulated losses to $34,306. Following the favourable results shown in the 1981 accounts, James Kwok, who was appointed the managing director shortly after the incorporation of Ikumene, was congratulated by the second plaintiff at a board meeting on 30 December 1982 on the results and the turn-around to profitability of Ikumene.
On 18 August 1983 Ikumene received a letter from the bank with a copy to the second plaintiff demanding payment of $193,623.98 within 14 days, failing which the same would be set off against the second plaintiff`s fixed deposit with the bank.
On 8 February 1984 a further letter of demand was sent by the bank to the second plaintiff for payment under his guarantee of the sum of $198,215.12, being the amount due from Ikumene with interest to date of payment.
On 5 March 1984 the bank exercised its rights as pledgee of the moneys under the second plaintiff`s fixed deposit which then stood at $250,801.68 inclusive of accrued interest. Of this sum, $201,338.61 was set off by the bank against the amount due from Ikumene.
In the meantime, on receipt of the bank`s letter of 18 August 1983 referred to above, the second plaintiff instructed a firm of professional accountants, Kwan Wong Tan & Hong (`Kwan Wong`) to conduct full investigations into the accounts of Ikumene. On 20 March 1986 Kwan Wong gave a report on their investigative work on the accounts of Ikumene for the three years ended 31 December 1979, 1980 and 1981 audited by the defendant.
On the 1979 audited accounts, Kwan Wong referred to an oversight by the defendant in the accounts in not having included an item of purchase, thereby understating the loss by $15,479, and the adjustment made by her in the 1980 audited accounts. On the adjustment, the defendant, in her notes which were to be read as an integral part of the accompanying accounts, stated: 
 
The accounts for 1980 have been restated to correct an understatement in loss due to an oversight in not having included an item of purchase but have accounted for in closing stock. The effect of the inclusion in the 1979 accounts is to increase losses by $15,479.
 
 
 
In the opinion of Kwan Wong, the 1979 accounts with such understatement did not show a true and fair view: 
 
As the adjustment of $15,479 represents 39% of sales for 1979 and 149% of the reported loss for 1979, before adjusting for this prior period item, we are of the opinion that this amount of $15,479 is material to the 1979 accounts and accordingly the said accounts does not show a true and fair view.
 
 
 
Kwan Wong`s views were supported by PW3, one John Curran, who testified as an expert on accounting matters. This is what he said in answer to questions from counsel for the plaintiffs (see notes of evidence at p 51): 
 
 
Q: See 1AB48-49 on the adjustment of $15,479? 
 
A: I agree with Kwan Wong`s view that the 1979 accounts did not show a true and fair view ... $15,479 represents 30% of the stock value of $50,899.
  
 
 
PW3 also found these deficiencies in Ikumene`s accounting records: 
 
 
(i) the purchase ledger was not properly maintained. The totals for 1979 and 1981 did not agree with purchase accounts in the general ledger and were not written up contemporaneously; 
 
(ii) the purchase accounts in the general ledger were not written up contemwith large proportion by value of adjustment at year-end by auditors; 
 
(iii) the stock cards for 1979 and 1980 had no cross-references to purchase and sale sources, no value balances for reconciliation to a stock control account in the general ledger which had no such account. There is no indication that the balance of stock shown on the cards had been checked with physical stock, some stock cards included a mix of different stock items. There was no index reference on the stock cards that could detect loss of stock card and which could be used to indicate on a purchase or sale invoice that a stock card entry had been made. There was no clear distinction between stocks held for own account and stocks held on consignment. For 1981, no stock cards were sighted; 
 
(iv) there was no debtors ledger, no individual account for each debtor and receipts were not always issued for payments received; 
 
(v) the cash book showed receipts improperly analysed to sundry income instead of debtors and payments improperly analysed to purchases instead of creditors.
  
 
 
In PW3`s view, proper accounting records had not been kept by Ikumene and it was not possible to say whether the accounts based on those accounting records gave a true and fair view. In answer to questions from counsel for the defendant on his report tendered as PB1-11, PW3 said (see notes of evidence at p 54): 
 
 
Q: PBI `auditors could not have been in a position to know whether or not the accounts showed a true and fair view`. You are not saying by this statement that the audited accounts for 1979-81 did not show a true and fair view? 
 
A: Yes, that is correct. But it was impossible for the auditors to determine whether or not the accounts show a true and fair view.
  
 
 
At the end of the plaintiffs` case the defendant elected not to adduce evidence but chose to submit that she had no case to answer. I therefore accept the views of PW3 that no proper accounting records had been kept by Ikumene, and that based on those records and on the defendant`s working papers which do not show that adequate checking or verification had been done, the defendant could not say if the accounts gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Ikumene (not that the accounts did not in fact give a true and fair view of the affairs of Ikumene other than the 1979 accounts which understated the loss by $15,479).
But does this give rise to a cause of action to the plaintiffs? To do so, the defendant must have owed a duty to the plaintiffs, there must have been a breach of that duty, and that breach caused the loss giving rise to the claim.
The defendant was appointed the auditor by Ikumene pursuant to a directors` resolution of 19 October 1981. The defendant therefore owed a duty to Ikumene arising from the appointment. Under s 207 of the Act, the auditor has to report to the members on the accounts required to be laid before the company in general meeting and on the company`s accounting and other records relating to those accounts. The auditor, in his report, has to state whether the accounts, in his opinion, have been properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Act so as to give a true and fair view of the company`s affairs, and whether the accounting and other records required to be kept by the company have been properly kept in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The defendant, therefore, also owed the second plaintiff a duty arising under s 207 of the Act.
The duty of an auditor is to exercise reasonable care and control. See the classic statement by Lopes LJ in 
 Re Kingston Cotton Mill Co (No 2) 
 1 at pp 288-289: 
 
But in determining whether any misfeasance or breach of duty has been committed, it is essential to consider what the duties of an auditor are. They are very fully described in 
 Re London and General Bank
 [[1895] 2 Ch 673], to which judgment I was a party. Shortly they may be stated thus: It is the duty of an auditor to bring to bear on the work he has to perform that skill, care, and caution which a reasonably competent, careful, and cautious auditor would use. What is reasonable skill, care, and caution must depend on the particular circumstances of each case. An auditor is not bound to be a detective, or, as was said, to approach his work with suspicion or with a foregone conclusion that there is something wrong. He is a watch-dog, but not a bloodhound. He is justified in believing tried servants of the company in whom confidence is placed by the company. He is entitled to assume that they are honest, and to rely upon their representations, provided he takes reasonable care. If there is anything calculated to excite suspicion he should probe it to the bottom; but in the absence of anything of that kind he is only bound to be reasonably cautious and careful.
 
 
 
Having regard to the deficiencies in the accounting records of Ikumene, it is my view that the defendant had not exercised reasonable care expected of her when without adequate checking or verification, she certified that Ikumene`s accounts gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Ikumene and that the accounting and other records had been properly kept in accordance with the Act. But the duty is only to Ikumene and its shareholders in respect of their interest as shareholders.
In 
 Caparo Industries Plc v Dickman & Ors 
 ,2 the respondents owned shares in a public company, Fidelity PLC, whose accounts for the year ended 31 March 1984 showed profits far short of the predicted figure which resulted in a dramatic drop in the quoted share price. After receipt of the audited accounts for the year ended 31 March 1984, the respondents purchased more shares in Fidelity PLC and later made a successful take-over bid for the company. Following the take-over, the respondents brought an action against the auditors of the company, alleging that the accounts were inaccurate and misleading in that they showed a pre-tax profit of some o1.2m for the year ended 31 March 1984 when in fact there had been a loss of over o400,000, and that the auditors had been negligent in auditing the accounts which the respondents relied on to purchase further shares and made their take-over bid. The House of Lords held that an auditor owes no duty of care to an individual shareholder in the company who wishes to buy more shares in the company. In delivering his judgment, Lord Bridge said, at pp 579-580: 
 
The position of auditors in relation to the shareholders of a public limited liability company arising from the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 1985 is accurately summarized in the judgment of Bingham LJ in the Court of Appeal ([1989] 1 All ER 798 at p 804, 
[1989] QB 653
 at pp 680-681):
 
 
 
`The members, or shareholders, of the company are its owners. But they are too numerous, and in most cases too unskilled, to undertake the day-to-day management of that which they own. So responsibility for day-to-day management of the company is delegated to directors. The shareholders, despite their overall powers of control, are in most companies for most of the time investors and little more. But it would, of course, be unsatisfactory and open to abuse if the shareholders received no report on the financial stewardship of their investment save from those to whom the stewardship had been entrusted. So provision is made for the company in general meeting to appoint an auditor (s 384 of the Companies Act 1985), whose duty is to investigate and form an opinion on the adequacy of the company`s accounting records and returns and the correspondence between the company`s accounting records and returns and its accounts: s 237. The auditor has then to report to the company`s members (among other things) whether in his opinion the company`s accounts give a true and fair view of the company`s financial position: s 236. In carrying out his investigation and in forming his opinion the auditor necessarily works very closely with the directors and officers of the company. He receives his remuneration from the company. He naturally, and rightly, regards the company as his client. But he is employed by the company to exercise his professional skill and judgment for the purpose of giving the shareholders an independent report on the reliability of the company`s accounts and thus on their investment. Vaughan Williams J said in 
 Re Kingston Cotton Mill Co
 [1896] 1 Ch 6 at 11: ""No doubt he is acting antagonistically to the directors in the sense that he is appointed by the shareholders to be a check upon them."" The auditor`s report must be read before the company in general meeting and must be open to inspection by any member of the company: s 241. It is attached to and forms part of the company`s accounts: ss 238(3) and 239. A copy of the company`s accounts, including the auditor`s report, must be sent to every member: s 240. Any member of the company, even if not entitled to have a copy of the accounts sent to him, is entitled to be furnished with a copy of the company`s last accounts on demand and without charge: s 246.`
 
 
 
No doubt these provisions establish a relationship between the auditors and the shareholders of a company on which the shareholder is entitled to rely for the protection of his interest. But the crucial question concerns the extent of the shareholder`s interest which the auditor has a duty to protect. The shareholders of a company have a collective interest in the company`s proper management and in so far as a negligent failure of the auditor to report accurately on the state of the company`s finances deprives the shareholders of the opportunity to exercise their powers in general meeting to call the directors to book and to ensure that errors in management are corrected, the shareought to be entitled to a remedy. But in practice no problem arises in this regard since the interest of the shareholders in the proper management of the company`s affairs is indistinguishable from the interest of the company itself and any loss suffered by the shareholders, eg by the negligent failure of the auditor to discover and expose a misappropriation of funds by a director of the company, will be recouped by a claim against the auditor in the name of the company, not by individual shareholders.
 
 
 
I find it difficult to visualize a situation arising in the real world in which the individual shareholder could claim to have sustained a loss in respect of his existing shareholding referable to the negligence of the auditor which could not be recouped by the company.
Both the plaintiffs are claiming damages. The second plaintiff has particularized his claim as being loss of $201, 338.61, being part of his fixed deposit and accrued interest pledged by him to the bank to secure the facilities granted to Ikumene and guaranteed by the second plaintiff, and $47,000, being loss of his investment in the capital of Ikumene. Thus, the second plaintiff`s claim arose from his being: 
 
 
(1) a guarantor under the guarantee dated 30 March 1981 in favour of the bank, and 
 
(2) a member of Ikumene holding 47,000 shares of $1 each at par value.
  
 
 
On the second plaintiff`s claim arising as a result of his being the guarantor, on the authority of 
 Caparo 
`s case2 this head of the claim is not within the scope of duty owed by an auditor to a shareholder of the company as it is a wholly independent transaction, having no connection with the second plaintiff`s shareholding in Ikumene. Lord Bridge in 
 Caparo 
`s case2 said, at p 581: 
 
... the loss in the case of the sale would be of a loss of part of the value of the shareholder`s existing holding, which, assuming a duty of care owed to individual shareholders, it might sensibly lie within the scope of the auditor`s duty to protect. A loss, on the other hand, resulting from the purchase of additional shares would result from a wholly independent transaction having no connection with the existing shareholding.
 
 
 
I believe it is this last distinction which is of critical importance ... . It is never sufficient to ask simply whether A owes B a duty of care. It is always necessary to determine the scope of the duty by reference to the kind of damage from which A must take care to save B harmless: 
 
`The question is always whether the defendant was under a duty to avoid or prevent that damage, but the actual nature of the damage suffered is relevant to the existence and extent of the duty to avoid or prevent it.`
 
 
 
(See 
 Sunderland Shire Council v Heyman
 [1985] 60 ALR 1 at 48 per Brennan J.)
 
 
 
Assuming for the purpose of the argument that the relationship between the auditor of a company and individual shareholders is of sufficient proximity to give rise to a duty of care, I do not understand how the scope of that duty can possibly extend beyond the protection of any individual shareholder from losses in the value of shares which he holds.
On the second plaintiff`s claim for the loss of value of his investment through the 47,000 shares in Ikumene, his interest is, in the words of Lord Bridge, `indistinguishable from the interest of the company itself and any loss suffered by him will be recouped by a claim against the auditor in the name of the company, 
 not by individual shareholders 
` (emphasis added). Thus, this head of the claim should be recouped by a claim through Ikumene. Ikumene, in turn, has to prove that its loss was due to the defendant`s breach of duty.
In 
 JEB Fasteners Ltd v Marks, Bloom & Co (a firm) 
 ,3 the defendants, in 1975, prepared an audited set of accounts for a manufacturing company for the year ended 31 October 1974. The company`s stocks which had been purchased for o11,000 was shown as being worth o23,080, which was the company`s own valuation of the net realizable value of the stock. But the defendants described it as being valued at lower of cost and net realizable value. On the basis of the inflated stock figure, the accounts showed a net profit of o11.25, whereas if the stock had been included at cost with a discount for possible errors, the accounts would have shown a loss of over o13,000. The defendants were aware when they prepared the accounts that the company had liquidity problems and was seeking outside financial support from, amongst others, the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs who manufactured similar products and to whom the accounts were made available had reservations about the stock valuation. But they took over the company for a nominal amount because they would thereby obtain the services of the company`s two directors who had considerable experience in the type of manufacturing carried out by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs` take-over proved less successful than they had anticipated and they sued the defendants for negligence in the preparation of the audited accounts. The plaintiffs` claim was dismissed on the ground that even though they had relied on the accounts, they would not have acted differently had they known the true position. Their reason for the take-over was to obtain the services of the two directors.
In the matter herein, the defendant, in respect of the accounts for the years 1979 to 1981, gave unqualified reports. But the plaintiffs have not shown that the losses were due to their relying on the reports. Neither have they shown that if qualified or adverse reports had been given, the losses could or would have been avoided.
See the second plaintiff`s evidence at p 9 of the notes of evidence: 
 
 
Q: See 2AB33, these were prepared by defendant for up to December 1981 showing a profit of $20,332. See 1AB19 1 item you were happy that the company had turned around? 
 
A: Yes. 
 
Q: What would you have done if company for year ended 1981 did not make profit? 
 
A: I would have caught the first plane to Singapore. 
 
Q: These accounts were made available in November 1982 or October 1982? 
 
A: In November 1982. 
 
Q: What would you do if you had come out to Singapore? 
 
A: I would go through the running and control of the business to see what was wrong. 
 
... 
 
Q: In relation to decisions you would make, what decision would you have made? 
 
A: No, it is not quite possible for me to say that. The whole situation is hypothetical.
  
 
 
See the second plaintiff`s evidence at pp 14-15 of the notes of evidence: 
 
 
A: (To a question by the court): I myself cannot identify the period in which these losses occurred which would have been disclosed by a proper audit. But the experts may be able to do so. 
 
Q: Do you not agree that even if these accounts were accurate, you might still have suffered loss? 
 
A: I don`t agree. A profit has been shown in the 1981 accounts and forecasts in 1982 and 1983 showed increase in business. 
 
Q: So you cannot tell if the losses were attributable to inaccurate accounts? 
 
A: I cannot say that. But I do say that if the accounts had shown the true position I would have taken certain courses of action earlier. The real position of the company only became apparent when I received the letter from Far Eastern Bank. This was terminal. There was nothing I could do. 
 
Q: I put it to you that whatever actions you might have taken if you had known the accounts were inaccurate might have no bearing on the loss? 
 
A: I do not know because I relied entirely on the accounts being accurate. I do not know what I would have done in 1979 if I had known the accounts to be inaccurate. 
 
... 
 
Q: You are in no better position now than what you would have been in 1982 if you had known what the actual profit figure was? 
 
A: I agree.

A perusal of the comparison will show that Ikumene continued to sustain losses even after the defendant ceased to be their auditor.
In 
 Alexander & Ors v Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd & Anor 
 ,4 the auditors of Cambridge Credit Corp Ltd in their annual audit certificate in 1971 failed to note that the balance sheet and other accounts did not show provisions which should have been made. Had the appropriate note been made, it was highly probably that a receiver would have been appointed. The company was put into receivership in 1974. In proceedings for damages against the auditors for breach of contract, Rogers J found that but for the breach of contract by the auditors, the company would have gone into receivership in 1971. He therefore awarded the company $1.45m being the increase between 1971 and 1974 in the deficiency of assets required to meet liabilities. The appeal by the auditors was allowed by the Court of Appeal on the ground that there was no causal connection between the breach of contract and the damage. McHugh JA said, at p 359: 
 
Moreover, Cambridge did not seek to prove that particular losses in respect of particular transactions were caused by the auditors` certificates. It asserted that from the moment that the trustee acted on the auditors` certificates and as a consequence, did not put Cambridge into receivership, the auditors became the insurers of Cambridge`s trading fortunes. The argument went so far as to maintain that even though Cambridge may have prospered for years, the auditors, subject to the Limitation Act 1969, were liable for any ultimate loss made by the company.
 
 
 
In the proved circumstances of this case, I do not think that the issue of the certificates by the auditors constituted a cause of Cambridge`s loss of $145m. The existence of a company, as counsel for Cambridge conceded, cannot be a cause of its trading losses or profits. Yet that is what the case for Cambridge comes to. Except in the sense that the issue of the certificates induced the trustee not to take action against Cambridge and thereby permitted Cambridge to exist as a trader, the issuing of the certificates was not one of the conditions which were jointly necessary to produce the loss of $145m. To assert in these circumstances that the issue of the certificates was a cause of the loss in my opinion is to depart from the common sense notion of causation which the common law champions.
The plaintiffs have not shown that the loss was due to the defendant`s breach of duty, neither have they shown that the loss could have been avoided but for the breach. In fact, even after the letter of demand of 18 August 1983 from the bank for payment of $193,623.98, Ikumene carried on trading. It has not even been satisfactorily established that the losses claimed for were attributable to the period for which the defendant owed a duty as the auditor of Ikumene.
Accordingly, I dismiss the plaintiffs` claim with costs.

On 22 April 1989, police from the gambling suppression branch arrested the respondent at the Bukit Turf Club. The police recommended to the management of the club that the respondent should be prohibited from entering the club. This recommendation was accepted, and the club`s deputy general manager issued a prohibition notice prohibiting the respondent from entering the club for a period of one year from that date. The notice was served on the respondent, who said that he could speak and understand English. The respondent read out the contents of the notice, word by word, after which he said that he understood the notice. However, he refused to sign on the original notice to indicate receipt, or to accept a copy of it. He was then handed back to the police and subsequently ejected from the club.
The club is a private club but members of the public may be and are admitted under rule 7.1 of the club`s constitution. Rule 7.2 further provides: `The management committee reserves the right to refuse admission to any person without assigning any reason therefor, and the management committee shall have the right to require any person to leave the club`s premises on refunding the amount of the admission charge, if any, paid by such person ... .`
The prohibition notice served on the respondent pursuant to this rule read: 
 
This notice is served to you under rule 7.2 of the constitution of the Bukit Turf Club. You are to leave the club immediately. You are not permitted to re-enter or be admitted to the club under any circumstances whatsoever with effect from today for a period of one (1) year. You should also not attempt to gain entry by purchasing an admission ticket. Should you be found within the club before the expiry of the prohibition period, we reserve the right to prosecute you for criminal trespass.
 
 
 
This notice stated in clear terms that the accused was not permitted to enter the club for a year. Moreover, the reference to criminal trespass indicated the stern view taken by the management in relation to re-entry in disregard of such a notice. It was undoubtedly a warning to the respondent of the serious consequences which might befall him if he disregarded the notice.
However, the accused was yet again arrested in the club some four months later, on 27 August 1989. He had been observed by a detective to be approaching persons and whispering to them before and after each race, and was arrested on suspicion of being involved in illegal bookmaking. However, no charges in this respect were eventually preferred against him. Instead, he was charged for criminal trespass under s 447 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (`the Code`) as follows: 
 
You,
 
 
 
Ker Ban Siong, m/24 years
 
 
 
NRIC No: 1729425-C
 
 
 
are charged that you, on or about 27 August 1989, at about 3.20pm at the first tier Old Grand Stand of Bukit Turf Club, Turf Club Road, Singapore, did commit criminal trespass, by entering into the said compound, in the custody of the deputy general manager, one Lim Teik Hock, with intent to cause annoyance to the management of the aforesaid compound, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 447 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
At the close of the prosecution`s case, defence counsel made a submission of `no case to answer`. He contended that the vital ingredient of intent to annoy was not proved. He relied on the case of 
 Neo Kim Geok v PP 
 1 in which LP Thean J exercised the High Court`s powers of revision to set aside the accused`s conviction for criminal trespass, despite the fact that the accused had pleaded guilty and was only appealing against sentence. In that case the accused had also been found on the club`s premises in disregard of a prohibition notice.
The submission of `no case` was rejected by the magistrate, who called upon the respondent to enter his defence. The respondent elected to remain silent, but was acquitted.
The public prosecutor appealed against the acquittal. On appeal, the learned DPP drew to the court`s attention the case of 
 PP v Quek Seow Huat 
 ,2 another case in which 
 Neo Kim Geok v PP 
 1 had been followed in acquitting the accused of a charge of criminal trespass. When 
 PP v Quek Seow Huat 
 2 went on appeal to the High Court, Chao Hick Tin J upheld the acquittal. In 
 PP v Quek Seow Huat 
 2 the trial judge said in his grounds of decision: 
 
There can be no presumption that, merely because the accused was found in the Turf Club premises after having been warned by the management not to enter it, he had done so with an intention to annoy the management. 
 Further evidence of such intention must be shown by the prosecution.
 (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In my opinion, it was inaccurate to generalize in this manner and conclude that a conviction for criminal trespass could not be sustained unless there was `further evidence` of an intention to annoy, over and above the fact that the accused had entered in contravention of a notice prohibiting him from entering the club for a year.
The learned DPP also referred the court to the Straits Settlements case of 
Abbass v Tomby
 
[1881] 3 Kyshe 131
 in which the appellant was at first instance convicted of criminal trespass, having been found in the arms of the respondent`s wife in the respon`s house. In setting aside the appellant`s conviction, Wood J said: 
 
The facts of this case clearly shew that the object of the defendant was to have criminal intercourse with the prosecutor`s wife, and not, primarily, to commit any other offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person, except in so far as the effecting of his object might - as it would no doubt, if discovered - insult and annoy the prosecutor. 
 But to justify a conviction under ss 441 and 442 of the Penal Code, it is necessary to shew that the object of the prisoner was, primarily, to annoy and insult.
 In the present case it is obvious his object was to effect his purpose secretly, and so as by concealment, to give the prosecutor no cause for annoyance or insult. To punish the prisoner for this class of offence, was, in effect, to punish adultery in an indirect manner. In matters of this description, 
 the proximate, and not the remote object or intent, must be looked at.
 (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
The learned DPP sought to distinguish this case on the basis that in 
Abbass v Tomby
 
[1881] 3 Kyshe 131
 it was clear that the accused naturally sought to avoid detection, whereas in the present case the respondent was found in the public enclosure. This did not seem to me to be a valid ground of distinction - it could well have been contended that since the accused had entered the club in disregard of a prohibition notice, he would have sought to avoid being identified.
However, I was not persuaded that I should follow 
 Abbass v Tomby. 
 3 This case restricted the offence of criminal trespass to situations where the primary or proximate intent was to cause insult or annoyance. I did not think this was justified by the wording of s 441, which defines the offence of criminal trespass thus: 
 
Whoever enters into or upon property in the possession of another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence, is said to commit `criminal trespass`.
 
 
 
Section 441 simply requires the entry to have been made `with intent ... to annoy`. The requisite intent to annoy under s 441 must usually be inferred from the surrounding circumstances. In my opinion, one could say that a person who entered the club in blatant disregard of a prohibition notice had entered `with intent ... to annoy` the management of the club. It would be wrong and unrealistic to insist on further evidence of such intention before a conviction could be founded, as suggested in 
 PP v Quek Seow Huat. 
 2
While the accused did state on appeal that he had entered the club with the intention of watching the races, he had in fact chosen not to testify in his own defence at trial. The trial judge would have been justified in drawing an adverse inference against him under s 196(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) as to the intention with which he entered the club. What he said before the High Court would obviously not be a statement made under oath which the court could accept as evidence. The court could not ignore the fact that the respondent had been warned in no uncertain terms that his presence on the premises was undesirable, and he had then chosen to disregard that warning. Certainly his presence there called for some explanation - he chose to offer none. In my opinion, the respondent should have been convicted of the offence of criminal trespass. Accordingly, I allowed the appeal against acquittal, convicted the respondent under s 447 of the Code and sentenced him to a fine of $350, in default one month`s imprisonment.
I am fortified in my opinion by 
 Chua Kwee Huat v PP, 
 4 where the accused pleaded guilty to a charge under s 447 of the Code and was sentenced to two weeks` imprisonment. Subsequently, he asked the court to exercise its powers of revision to quash the conviction on the ground that he had not entered the club with the requisite intent to cause annoyance. He claimed that he had gone there with the sole intention of betting on horses. Chao Hick Tin J, then a judicial commissioner, declined to interfere with the conviction though in the related appeal against sentence, the accused`s sentence was reduced to one day`s imprisonment and a fine of $500.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The legal issue addressed in this judgment is in what circumstances an individual`s right to `kiss and tell` can be curtailed (at least on an interlocutory application). It arises from the defendant`s application for the discharge of interim injunction orders which the plaintiffs obtained against her on 5 December 1991.
Three injunctions were issued against the defendant. She was restrained, until further order, whether by herself, her servants or agents or otherwise howsoever: 
 
 
(1) from making use of or disclosing whether directly or indirectly to anyone (other than to the relevant authorities, her solicitors and this court) any information howsoever acquired by her, during her period of employment with the first plaintiffs, on the personal affairs of the second plaintiff including his amorous relationship with any woman including the defendant; 
 
(2) from making use of or disclosing whether directly or indirectly (other than to the relevant authorities and her solicitors) or delivering to any newspaper or periodical within Singapore or otherwise copies of any pleadings and affidavits filed in these proceedings or filed in any other proceedings which may be commenced by the defendant against the plaintiffs or either of them; and 
 
(3) (other than by or through the defendant`s solicitors) from communicating with the second plaintiff whether by telephone or letter or any other means of communication.
  
 
 
When the defendant`s application first came up before me on 8 June 1992, I varied the first injunction order so as to allow the defendant to consult with any of three named pastors and her psychiatrist provided that she notified them in advance of the existence of the injunction. I also decided that as the defendant was not legally represented and the first injunction involved complex questions of law, an 
 amicus curiae 
 should be appointed to enable the legal issues to be fully addressed at an adjourned hearing of the application. Mr Kenneth Tan kindly accepted appointment as 
 amicus curiae 
.
First, a brief account of the facts.
 Factual background
In April 1989, the defendant was employed as a secretary by the first plaintiffs (`the company`), the Singapore incorporated subsidiary of a foreign corporation. In October 1989, she was transferred to a different division of the company as the secretary of the managing director of that division. When the second plaintiff (`AB`) was seconded to the company by its foreign parent in July 1990, the defendant became his secretary. The defendant left the company`s employ at the end of March 1991.
It is common ground that shortly after AB came to Singapore there was a sexual relationship between him and the defendant. This relationship ended in December 1990. The defendant`s contention is that the sexual intimacy between them arose because of harassment on the part of AB as her superior and her belief that if she did not submit to his advances she would lose the job which she enjoyed and on which she depended for her living. She further says that she was forced to resign from her job by AB. AB`s position is that there was no question of any harassment or the exertion of undue pressure on his part: both her intimacy with him and her resignation were completely voluntary actions of the defendant.
What happened from mid-March 1991 to December 1991 has been set out in lengthy affidavits filed by both AB and the defendant. There are numerous exhibits. To summarize: 
 
 
(1) Between 25 March 1991 and 14 November 1991, the defendant wrote some 20 letters and notes to AB. She also telephoned him frequently, attempted to see him on several occasions and did in fact meet with him a few times. On one occasion, in late September 1991, they spent the night together at a hotel. The letters were initially couched in affectionate terms. The defendant`s aim in writing the early letters seems to have been to get her job back. Later, when she did not receive a satisfactory response, many of the letters were explicitly threatening and written in intemperate language, although some of them simply expressed the defendant`s pain and distress at the situation she was in. She continually pressed AB for an explanation of his conduct towards her and gave him several time limits within which to respond. 
 
(2) Sometime towards the end of April 1991, the defendant lodged a report with the police, alleging that AB had raped her. Subsequently in September 1991, she made a further report that he had assaulted her indecently. 
 
(3) Between 2 May 1991 and 27 October 1991 the defendant wrote some five letters to various officers in the foreign parent of the company. In the first of these letters, dated 2 May 1991, she stated that she had been the subject of victimization and asked for a personal meeting to express her grievances. She notified the recipient of the letter that she had already lodged a report with the police and her further action, if necessary, would be to: 
 
(a) report to the president and chairman of the parent company;
  
 
 
(b) make known her grievances to as many people in the parent company as possible;
(c) inform its customers what type of person AB was;
(d) proceed with legal action and publicize the matter in the press. 
 
 
In another letter dated 5 August 1991 addressed to the chairman of the parent company, the defendant made various allegations against AB. She repeated her contention that he had abused her, gave details of AB`s relationship with another woman (`IS`), and accused him of having cheated the company in regard to expenses which he had claimed from the company. In a further letter to the same person in October 1991, the defendant complained that her letter of 5 August had been ignored. She stated that she had been left with no alternative but to turn to the public for attention and that she had given her story to the press. She said that she would follow up with legal action and she would ensure that the name of the company would be `badly shaken once this urgly (sic) news is out in the public`.
  
 
 
 
(4) The defendant wrote several letters to AB`s wife who was residing in her home country and had only spent a few weeks in Singapore after AB`s posting here. In the first letter (15 March 1991), she notified Mrs AB that AB was having an affair with another woman. Subsequently, by a letter dated 20 July 1991, the defendant identified IS and gave Mrs AB further details about her. She also described her own relationship with AB as being `deep and complicated` which words, the defendant believed, would be sufficient to indicate to Mrs AB that she herself had been intimate with AB. In the letter the defendant said that from checking bills of AB and making inquiries, she had ascertained that AB had taken IS on a holiday to Phuket in February 1991; that AB had bought IS expensive gifts; that he spent a lot of money on telephoning IS every month at her foreign home; and that IS had spent time in Singapore with AB in August 1990 and February 1991. Finally, in a letter dated 12 August 1991 but sent out some weeks later, she gave Mrs AB explicit details of the liaison between herself and AB and repeated her stories regarding IS and AB.
  
 
 
 
(5) On 11 May 1991, AB received an anonymous letter from a person subscribing himself as `angry friend`. In this letter AB was accused of having cheated the defendant of money, having cheated the company, having sexually harassed the defendant and having wrongly dismissed the defendant. The writer announced that if he were able to get certain documents from the defendant, he would send them to all the staff in the company and its head office to make sure that AB`s name was blackened. The letter ended with `You better call [the defendant] and check with her needs or see what can you do, or else I`ll going to give you hell. You better watch out.` 
 
(6) In October 1991, the defendant spoke to some newspaper reporters and told them her story, as a result of which an article entitled `Sex row` was published. No names were given. The article detailed the course of the relationship between the defendant and AB from the defendant`s viewpoint. The paper contacted AB but he refused to make any comment. At the end of the article, the defendant was quoted as having said: `I`m so angry, I want to get him.`
  
 
 
 
(7) On 28 November 1991, AB received a second anonymous letter. This one enclosed a draft letter which was stated as being ready to be sent to thousands of people including AB`s family, his superiors, all the staff of the company and its parent, their business contacts, the Singapore Immigration, a named embassy and clubs and others. The proposed circular letter was written in the most intemperate and virulent language. It gave details of AB`s alleged mistreatment of the defendant; his relationship with IS; and his alleged cheating of the company. Also disclosed were AB`s personal addresses at home and abroad, his office address in Singapore and the address of the foreign parent company.
  
 
 
As the plaintiffs` counsel has pointed out, some of the documents referred to above and exhibited to AB`s first affidavit in these proceedings revealed the following: 
 
 
(1) that the defendant had made copies of AB`s personal phone bills, of at least one of his departmental store bills and of his claim for reimbursement from the company of certain expenses; 
 
(2) that the defendant had kept a record of a holiday trip to Phuket which AB had taken with IS in February 1991; 
 
(3) that the defendant had kept a record of personal calls meant for AB in November 1990.
  
 
 
 
 The plaintiffs` claim
 
On 4 December 1991, the plaintiffs responded to the various actions of the defendant by filing the suit herein and making an application for an ex parte interim injunction. By the statement of claim indorsed on the writ, the plaintiffs claimed various reliefs against the defendant, including: 
 
 
(a) a declaration that she was not entitled to make copies of various documents specified in the statement and an order for delivery up of these documents; 
 
(b) an injunction restraining the defendant from making use of or disclosing to anyone information acquired by her during her employ with the company on the personal affairs of AB; 
 
(c) an injunction restraining the defendant from contacting AB; 
 
(d) a quia timet injunction; 
 
(e) damages for breach of her employment agreement and/or for breach of confidence and/or for intimidation and/or for nuisance.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs assert that the causes of action on which they base their right to ask both for the above reliefs and the interlocutory relief are breach of confidence and the tort of conspiracy to injure. As Mr Tan pointed out, the court, in considering the defendant`s application for discharge, must determine whether these underlying causes of action are available to the plaintiffs. He then raised a constitutional issue.
Mr Tan argued that the right of free speech enshrined in art 14 of the Constitution might have the effect of overriding the common law of confidence and tort of conspiracy to injure. If this argument is accepted, then there would be no legal basis for the first and second interim injunctions and they would have to be discharged forthwith. I will therefore deal with this point first.
 Effect of art 14(1)(a) of the Constitution
In so far as is material, this article provides as follows: 
 
 
(1) Subject to clauses (2) and (3) - 
 
(a) every citizen of Singapore has the right to freedom of speech and expression;... 
 
(2) Parliament may by law impose - 
 
(a) on the rights conferred by clause (1)(a), such restrictions as it considers necessary or expedient in the interest of the security of Singapore or any part thereof, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality and restrictions designed to protect the privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence;
  
 
 
Mr Tan submitted that as a citizen of Singapore, the defendant has the right of freedom of expression and her claim to say what she wants to say about AB falls within this article. He pointed out that the courts of Singapore have accepted that the constitutional liberty of freedom of speech is in itself a sufficient reason to justify the denial of prior restraint where a person making defamatory remarks intends to justify the truth of his statements: see 
Lawrence Kwek Juan Bok v Lim Han Yong
 
 
[1989] 3 MLJ 210
 
Mr Tan agreed that the freedom granted by art 14(1)(a) is not absolute. Article 14(2)(a) permits Parliament to restrict a citizen`s right of free speech if Parliament deems such restriction necessary or expedient in the interest of, inter alia, public order or morality. The relevant words read: `Parliament may by law impose ... such restrictions ...`. The legal issue that arises is whether by reason of these words there has to be an Act of Parliament specifically restricting the freedom of expression granted in sub-art 1(a). If so, then because there is no statute on the Singapore statute book which protects confidential information or prohibits conspiracy to injure by means of disseminating information, the two causes of action on which the plaintiffs rely cannot be sustained and the defendant`s freedom to say, either alone or with others, what she wants to say about the plaintiffs is unfettered. The plaintiffs` only remedy would, in that instance, be an action for defamation which would not succeed if the defendant is able to justify.
The foregoing issue was dealt with in two recent cases cited by Mr Tan. In the Malaysian case of 
 Lee Kuan Yew v Chin Vui Khen & Anor 
 ,2 a recent decision of Siti Norma Yaakob J, the learned judge considered art 10 of the Malaysian Constitution which, as far as relevant to these proceedings, is in pari materia with our art 14.
In that case, the plaintiff sued the defendants for defamation in connection with two articles which the defendants had published in their newspaper, the 
 Sunday Star 
 . In their defence, the defendants pleaded, inter alia, justification, and the protection of art 10 of the Malaysian Constitution guaranteeing freedom of expression. The plaintiffs applied, successfully, to strike out the defence based on art 10.
In contesting the application to strike out, the defendants` submission had been that except for the law of criminal defamation in the Malaysian Penal Code, the Malaysian Parliament had not passed any other written law under art 10(2)(a) restricting free speech by stating or defining the law against defamation. They had further contended that the Malaysian Defamation Act, being a pre-independence statute, could not be construed as a law imposed by Parliament on the right of freedom of speech to provide against defamation. The learned judge dealt with this argument as follows [at p 502]: 
 
It is true that Parliament has not, under art 10(2)(a), enacted any law against defamation and I consider that it is not necessary for it to do so as, at Merdeka Day, there were already laws in existence against defamation.
 
 
 
These are found in s 3(1) of the Civil Law Act 1956 that allows the courts, in the absence of any written law, to apply the common law of England relating to civil wrongs of all kinds including defamation, libel and slander, subject to such qualifications as local circumstances render necessary. In 1957, the common law of defamation was modified by the Defamation Act 1957, which came into force on 1 July 1957 and despite art 10(2)(a), that Act continues to have the force of law to this very day as Parliament has not repealed it. This is so as it is not unconstitutional, as it was enacted by the body, that is the predecessor of the Parliament that we know of today. It is also not inconsistent with any provision of the Constitution, in particular art 10(1)(a). Moreover, art 162(1), preserves all existing laws (which has been defined by art 160(2) to include both written and common law) in operation in the Federation immediately before Merdeka Day.
It is clear that, read with art 162(1), art 10(2)(a) does not have the effect of eliminating the existing laws in operation prior to Merdeka Day. On the contrary, it complements art 162(1) as by its very provision, Parliament is empowered by art 10(2)(a) to make laws restricting the right to freedom of speech and expression in situations where there are no existing laws providing for such restrictions. In this respect, if one looks closely at the first few words of art 10(2)(a), what it states is that `Parliament 
 may 
by law impose ...` (emphasis is mine) and by that very expression, the mandatory obligation to impose by enactment is absent as the need to legislate only arises when the occasion demands, ie to fill in any lacuna in the law.
Thus as at Merdeka Day, there were already defamation laws in existence and in force which render the need to legislate under art 10(2)(a) redundant.
In the same way, it can be contended that at the time the Singapore Constitution was adopted, there were already laws in force relating to confidence and to the tort of conspiracy and therefore there was no need for any legislation to be passed under art 14(2)(a). This is because art 162 of the Constitution expressly states that `... all existing laws shall continue in force on and after the commencement of this Constitution ...`, and the definitions of `existing law` and `law` under art 2 make it clear that existing law includes the common law in so far as it was in operation in Singapore at the time the Constitution was adopted.
The local case of 
 Jeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew 
 3 shows that the operation of the common law in Singapore was not overridden by the adoption of art 14 of the Constitution. Mr Jeyaretnam, the defendant in the action, having been sued for defamation, applied for leave to amend his defence by adding a new paragraph thereto in the following terms: 
 
This action of the plaintiff seeks to restrict the defendant`s constitutional right given to him by art 14(1)(a) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore and is therefore an unlawful interference of the defendant`s fundamental rights contained in the said article and for that reason not maintainable.
 
 
 
His application was dismissed and his appeal against the decision was also dismissed. In delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, Wee Chong Jin CJ stated that the defendant`s contention that the right of freedom of speech and expression conferred by art 14(1)(a) was unrestricted and wholly free of any restraint was clearly untenable. The Chief Justice held that such constitutional right was unarguably restricted by the laws of defamation. In enacting the DeAct, the legislature had clearly intended that the common law relating to defamation, as modified by the Act, should continue to apply in Singapore. He added [at p 65], and this is significant for the present purpose: 
 
Moreover, the definition of law in art 2(1) of the Constitution includes `the common law in so far as it is in operation in Singapore`. In our view, it is manifestly beyond argument that art 14(1)(a) is subject to the common law of defamation as modified by the Act and, accordingly, does not, in itself, afford a defence.
 
 
 
Whilst Mr Chen did not go so far as to say that it is manifestly beyond argument that art 14(1)(a) is subject to the common law actions for breach of confidence and conspiracy, he did submit that, at the very least, there is a serious question to be tried on this important legal issue. I agree. This issue is not one which can disenfranchise the plaintiffs at this interlocutory stage. In at least two recent cases (viz 
 Federal Computer Services Sdn Bhd v Ang Jee Hai Eric 
 4 and 
 Haw Par Brothers International Ltd & Anor v Jack Chiarapurk & Ors 
 5) Singapore courts have acted on the basis that the law of confidence is part of the law of Singapore. Much legal advice has also been given on the same premise. For my part, whilst I should not be taken as deciding the issue now, I am of the view that the contention that these two restrictions on freedom of speech embodied in the common law have been preserved rather than overridden by the Constitution is difficult, if not impossible, to rebut.
I must now examine the two causes of action put forward by the plaintiffs in order to determine whether on the facts before me the injunctions granted should be maintained in whole or in part. In doing so, I note that the principles to be applied are those established in the well-known decision in 
 American Cyanamid Co v Ethicon Ltd 
 .6
 Applicability of confidence
A plaintiff who founds his claim on the law of confidence can do so in one of two ways: 
 
 
(1) He can rely on the contractual agreement between himself and the defendant whereunder a duty of confidence has been expressly or impliedly imposed; or 
 
(2) he can invoke the equitable jurisdiction of the court to protect the obligation of confidence that the defendant owes him.
  
 
 
The plaintiffs in this case take both the above courses. An examination of paras 3 to 7 of the statement of claim indicates: 
 
 
(1) The company is relying on the contract of employment between themselves and the defendant. This contract did not contain any express duty of confid, so they contend that it was subject to the following implied terms: 
 
(a) that the defendant would not disclose or make public any professional or trade secret or confidential information which she learnt by reason of her employment;
  
 
 
 
(b) that the defendant would not use to the detriment of the company any information which she obtained in the course of or as a result of her employment; 
 
(c) that the defendant should not use, except for the purpose of her employment, opportunities which the employment gave her of gaining information. 
 
(2) Secondly, the plaintiffs contend that the relative positions of the defendant and AB in the company, ie that he was her direct superior and she was his secretary, imposed the following obligations on the defendant: 
 
(a) not to use, except for the purpose of her employment, the opportunities which the employment gave her of gaining information; 
 
(b) not to obtain any information by dishonest means or tricks; 
 
(c) not to use information which might have come into her possession by dishonest means or tricks; 
 
(d) not to disclose any such information other than to the relevant authorities.
  
 
 
It is clear from the statement of claim itself and the affidavits filed on the plaintiffs` behalf that the defendant has not disclosed to any third party information on the trade or business of the company. Her disclosures were related solely to the activities of AB. In these circumstances, it is not seriously arguable on behalf of the company that the defendant has breached any duty of confidentiality which she owed them under para 4 of the statement of claim. Neither can it be contended that the defendant has any intention of breaching this duty of confidentiality in the future.
The plaintiffs` right to a continuance of the first two injunctions thus rests on the assertion of confidentiality contained in para 5 of the statement of claim, ie that arising from the position of the defendant and AB vis-a-vis each other. As there is no contractual relationship between AB and the defendant, this assertion relies on the equitable obligation of confidence.
The oft quoted case of 
 Coco v AN Clarke (Engineers) Lt 
 
 d 
 7 sets out the elements that have to be satisfied if a plaintiff is to succeed in an action for breach of confidence where there is no contract involved. These are: 
 
 
(1) the information to be protected must have the necessary quality of confidence about it; 
 
(2) that information must have been imparted in circumstances importing an obligation of confidence; 
 
(3) there must be an unauthorized use of the information to the detriment of the party who originally communicated it.
  
 
 
In order to determine whether the plaintiffs have, at the least, a seriously arguable case that these elements (which I shall call `the confidence elements`) are present in this case, one must first examine the allegedly confidential information. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the statement of claim reveal that the plaintiffs object to the disclosure of information on: 
 
 
(1) personal telephone calls made by AB in September and December 1990 and January and March 1991; 
 
(2) a personal purchase made by AB; 
 
(3) AB`s trip to Phuket in February 1991 with IS; 
 
(4) AB`s relationship with IS generally; 
 
(5) AB`s claim against the company for reimbursement of entertainment expenses in November 1990.
  
 
 
Essentially, therefore, protection is sought for two categories of information: (a) AB`s adulterous relationship with IS; and (b) his alleged cheating of the company. Each of these categories must contain the confidence elements.
 
 
(a) Adulterous relationship
  
 
 
 
Stephens v Avery & Ors
 
[1988] 1 Ch 449
 is authority for the proposition that information relating to a person`s sexual conduct can be the subject matter of a legally enforceable duty of confidentiality. The reason for this is, as Browne-Wilkinson VC stated [at p 454]:
 
 
 
To most people the details of their sexual lives are high on their list of those matters which they regard as confidential. The mere fact that two people know a secret does not mean that it is not confidential. If in fact information is secret, then in my judgment it is capable of being kept secret by the imposition of a duty of confidence on any person to whom it is communicated. Information only ceases to be capable of protection as confidential when it is in fact known to a substantial number of people.
 
 
 
The first confidence element is satisfied here.
The plaintiffs have some difficulty with the second element. In the S 
 tephens v Avery 
case8 the plaintiff had imparted the information to the defendant under an express imposition of confidentiality. Here, AB did not tell the defendant about his relationship with IS: the defendant discovered this for herself by examining his personal phone bills and making investigations, through which she learnt AB had frequently telephoned IS, and of their trip to Phuket. The plaintiffs` contention is that it was because of her position as AB`s secretary that the defendant had access to documents which enabled her to carry out her detective work. They submit that the information which a secretary receives about her superior`s private life and her access to his personal documents are covered by the duty of confidence, ie that such information has come to her knowledge only because of the position of confidence which she occupies and that accordingly, it should be treated as having been disclosed to her in circumstances in which the obligation to respect confidentiality is imposed. The defendant`s contention, on the other hand, is that she was not employed as a `confidential` secretary as that word does not appear anywhere in her employment contract or in the statement of claim, and thus no duty of confidence arises. Mr Tan contended that she could, additionally, argue that telephone and department store bills are not of themselves confidential documents.
The plaintiffs also submit that, in addition to the confidence imposed by her position, the defendant can be restrained from disclosing private information acquired by dubious means.
In the 1913 case of 
 Lord Ashburton v Pape 
 9 Swinfen Eady LJ said [at p 475]: 
 
The principle upon which the court of chancery has acted for many years has been to restrain the publication of confidential information 
 improperly or surreptitiously obtained
 or of information imparted in confidence which ought not to be divulged. (Emphasis added.)
 
 
 
In that case, the judge granted an injunction to restrain the use of privileged documents acquired by deception. A similar approach was followed in the modern case of 
Francome v Mirror Group Newspapers Ltd
 
[1984] 2 All ER 408
[1984] 1 WLR 892
 Here the defendant newspaper company had acquired, from an undisclosed source, tapes of a number of telephone conversations between the two plaintiffs who were husband and wife. It was alleged that these tapes revealed breaches by Mr Francome, a jockey, of both jockey club rules and the criminal law. The tapes were the result of unauthorized tapping of the plaintiff`s telephone. The Court of Appeal granted an interlocutory injunction restraining the defendants from publishing the contents of the tapes. It accepted the plaintiffs` argument that users of the telephone are entitled to regard their conversations as confidential and anyone overhearing those conversations knows that that is the position. It is therefore idle for an eavesdropper and a person obtaining information on the conversations from the eavesdropper to contend that they did not know that the conversations were confidential. Both such parties would be under a duty to preserve the confidentiality of the plaintiffs` private conversations. This case also indicates that the second element is not limited to information being imparted in confidence. It will satisfy the second element if the information is received or learned in such circumstances that it is clear that a duty of confidentiality arises.
In the present suit, not only did the defendant have access to certain documents and information because she was AB`s secretary but she also used such information in order to learn more about his personal activities. Whilst telephone and shop bills may not have the degree of confidentiality of a personal diary, there is no doubt that these documents are the property of AB and the defendant had no right to make use of them in any way without his authorization.
In my view, there is a serious question to be tried as to whether the information was gained while she was in a position of confidence and/or was private information which the defendant had obtained by surreptitious or underhanded means, thus affording it the protection of the confidentiality law.
The third element, that of disclosure to the detriment of the plaintiffs, is obviously fulfilled in this case in relation to AB though not in relation to the company. Whilst there may be cases where stories about an employee`s private conduct could cause damage to his employer, I do not believe that this is the case here.
 
 
(b) Cheating allegation
  
 
 
Here, again, the information was obtained because the defendant was AB`s secretary. It is, arguably, confidential information and publication thereof would harm AB, though probably not the company. Mr Tan drew my attention to a possible argument in aid of the defendant, viz the defendant may be able to assert that publication cannot be restrained because of the operation of the rule established by Wood VC in the phrase: `there is no confidence as to the disclosure of iniquity` [see 
Gartside v Outram
 
[1857] 26 LJ Ch 113
 at p 114]. This rule requires the court to balance the competing public interests in maintaining confidentiality and in ensuring that wrongdoing is not concealed.
In 
Initial Services Ltd v Putterill
 
[1968] 1 QB 396
[1967] 3 All ER 145
 the plaintiff laundry company tried to obtain an injunction to prevent their ex-employee from disclosing that they had agreed with other laundries to keep up prices in breach of the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1956 and that their circular to their customers stating that increases in their charges were mainly to off-set an employment tax was misleading. The injunction was refused. Lord Denning MR held that the obligation implied in the contract of employment of every employee to keep confidential information or documents received in confidence during that employment, is subject to exceptions. One of these exceptions was where the employer was guilty of a crime or fraud or of misconduct of such a nature that it ought, in the public interest, to be disclosed. However, this does not mean that disclosure to all and sundry is permissible. The disclosure must be, to quote the words of Lord Denning MR: `to one who has a proper interest to receive the information`.
The 
 Francome 
case10 exemplified the above situation. There the defendants argued that as the tapes in their possession indicated offences on the part of Mr Francome, the iniquity rule would operate to allow them to publish the information. Their contention that such publication was in the public interest was rejected, it being held that the public interest would be equally well served if, pending the trial, the tapes were disclosed only to the police and the jockey club.
In this case, too, I do not see that public interest requires full-scale publication of AB`s alleged cheating. The only persons who need to know of the information at this stage are the company and the police. The company has already been informed and the first injunction order permitted the defendant to deal with the relevant authorities. In regards to the cheating allegation therefore, no objection can be made to the injunctions on the basis of public interest in disclosure.
 
 
(c) The balance of convenience
  
 
 
The plaintiffs have satisfied me that in relation to the two categories of information discussed, there is a seriously arguable case for breach of confidence. I am also satisfied that damages would not be an adequate remedy for the plaintiffs. The loss of reputation can never be adequately compensated for with cash. On the other hand, the defendant would not be harmed by her inability to disclose the information pending the trial. Finally, the balance of convenience in this case lies with the plaintiffs. If the information is confidential, it should be kept so. If it is not, the truth can come out after the trial. No harm will be done by keeping the information away from the public at large till then.
 
 
(d) Personal relationship
  
 
 
The statement of claim does not specify information on the personal relationship between AB and the defendant as being one of the items covered by the duty of confidentiality. As Mr Tan pointed out in the course of argument, it is highly questionable whether a personal relationship would be considered information which has been communicated on the basis of confidentiality. In 
Stephens v Avery
 
[1988] 1 Ch 449
 Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson VC doubted the premise that between unmarried sexual partners there is no duty of confidentiality and both parties are free to discuss the matter with the whole world, though, for the purposes of that case, he accepted that submission to be correct. In my judgment, the submission reflects the law. Counsel for the plaintiffs was unable to cite a single case to support a duty of confidence in such a situation. That the obverse is the true position was clearly indicated as long ago as the early nineteenth century when the Duke of Wellington, the vanquisher of Napoleon, was told he could avoid being mentioned in the memoirs of the celebrated courtesan Harriet Wilson by giving her money. He declined either to be blackmailed or to make a futile application for an injunction. Instead, he robustly proclaimed: `Publish and be damned!`
As the plaintiffs cannot rely on the law of confidence to justify the gag on the defendant disclosing details of her relationship with AB, I must next consider whether the tort of conspiracy to injure assists them.
 Conspiracy to injure
The plaintiffs` claim that the defendant is part of a conspiracy to injure them is set out in paras 8 and 9 of the statement of claim. These read as follows: 
 
 
(8) The defendant has repeatedly and with intent to injure the first plaintiff and/or the second plaintiff threatened on diverse dates in her letters to the second plaintiff and other persons to publish or cause to be published in the newspapers in Singapore and in [the second plaintiff`s home country] information obtained by her pursuant to para 6 in breach of the implied terms set out in paras 4(a) and (b) and of the obligations set out in para 5 as well as information of her personal and/or working relationship with the second plaintiff.
  
 
 
 
 
 
Particulars 
(a) Letter to the second plaintiff`s wife dated 20 June 1991. 
(b) Letters to the chief executives dated 5 August 1991. 
(c) Letters to the chief executives dated 24 October 1991. 
(d) Letters to the chief executives dated 27 October 1991. 
(e) Letter to the second plaintiff dated 8 October 1991. 
(f) Letter to the second plaintiff dated 14 November 1991. 
(9) Further or in the alternative the defendant and person or persons whose name or names are unknown to the plaintiffs on diverse dates unknown to the first plaintiff and the second plaintiff and/or on or about 28 November 1991 wrongfully and/or with the intent and/or with dominant or paramount intent to injure the first plaintiff and/or the second plaintiff conspired or agreed together to intimidate and/or publish and/or cause to be published the information which the defendant obtained pursuant to para 6 above including information on the personal relationship of the second plaintiff with IS and her personal and/or working relationship with the second plaintiff and real and substantial damage will ensue to both the plaintiffs if the defendant is not restrained by an injunction of the court.
 
 
 
The defendant prepared and filed her own defence on 13 December 1991. She did not therein deal directly with the allegation of conspiracy. Paragraphs 8 and 9 of the defence which purport to reply to this allegation simply state: `The second plaintiff has betrayed his own principles. The defendant has on several occasions considering burying the hatchet but the second plaintiff always challenge her(sic).` In her submissions at the hearing, however, the defendant stated that she had not conspired with anyone and the two anonymous letters had been written without her instigation. In her affidavit of 27 January 1992, the defendant referred to the two anonymous letters in separate paragraphs and on each occasion stated that she should not be held responsible for the actions of the other people, thus implying that she had nothing to do with such actions.
As stated in 
 Clerk & Lindsell on Torts 
 (16th Ed) at para 15-24, the tort of conspiracy to injure is one which is regarded by the English House of Lords as `a highly anomalous cause of action` but one that is `too well established to be discarded` (see 
Lonrho Ltd v Shell Petroleum Co Ltd (No 2)
 
[1982] AC 173
 ). The anomaly arises because the acts which the conspirators conspire to carry out are lawful acts which could not be complained about if done by any one of them acting on his own. The tort requires two elements: 
 
 
(a) a combination of two or more persons to do certain acts; 
 
(b) that the predominant or sole purpose of the combination be to injure another rather than to protect one`s own legitimate interest.
  
 
 
When these two elements are established, the victim of the conspiracy can sue for damages and/or apply for injunctive relief to prevent the conspirators from acting in pursuance of their conspiracy.
So far as I am aware, there are only two reported English decisions to date which deal with the plaintiff`s right to an injunction when the method by which the conspirators intend to injure the plaintiff is the dissemination of information about the plaintiff. The first of these cases, and the only one in which an injunction restraining the proposed dissemination of information was granted, is 
 Gulf Oil (Great Britain) Ltd v Page & Ors 
 .14 The facts there were that Gulf, an oil company, had an exclusive supply agreement with the defendant brothers who owned and operated several petroleum-filling stations. Disputes arose between them, and in an action by the defendants against Gulf claiming damages for breach of contract, the judge held that Gulf, by failing to deliver, had for a short period been in breach of contract. Both sides appealed. While the appeals were pending, the brothers circulated leaflets to several of Gulf`s customers, giving an account of the litigation and judgment. In March 1987, while Gulf was entertaining customers at the Cheltenham racecourse, the defendants flew a light aircraft over the racecourse displaying a banner with the words `Gulf exposed in fundamental breach`. Gulf, founding its case on conspiracy to injure, sought an injunction restraining the defendants from publishing those words by the airborne sign or otherwise howsoever. The Court of Appeal granted the injunction, save that it was limited to exhibition by airborne sign and to the duration of the then current Cheltenham race meeting.
The main judgment in the appeal was delivered by Parker LJ. He noted that the defendants` counsel had contended that if interim relief were granted in the case, it would reverse the long standing `libel principle`, ie that the court would not grant an injunction to restrain the publication of defamatory matter where the defendants alleged that the words complained of were true. The judge stressed, however, that the documents before the court gave clear evidence of a combination between the defendants to display the airborne sign over the Cheltenham race course where it could be seen, and in order that it should be seen, by the maximum number of people, the vast majority of whom would have no interest whatsoever in the supply of fuel to retail filling stations. As the appeal and cross-appeal from the judgment were then pending and the supply agreement had been terminated, his Lordship found [at pp 332-333]: 
 
The defendants had ... at that time, no immediate interest of their own to protect against Gulf and no interest of their own to further as against Gulf. In these circumstances there is, in my view, a strong inference that the purpose of the display was simply to inflict upon Gulf the maximum possible damage in its business by way of revenge. There is thus not merely a serious question to be tried but a strong prima facie case in conspiracy to injure. It may be that that case will not in the event succeed, but, unless the libel principle is a complete answer to the claim for interlocutory relief, this is a plain case for the grant of such relief on the principles enunciated in [the 
 American Cyanamid
 case]. Indeed, this was not seriously disputed.
 
 
 
Parker LJ then detailed the cases establishing the libel principle and referred to 
Fraser v Evans & Ors
 
[1969] 1 QB 349
 wherein Lord Denning MR, explaining the reason for the rule, had said [at pp 360-361]: 
 
The reason sometimes given is that the defences of justification and fair comment are for the jury, which is the constitutional tribunal, and not for a judge. But a better reason is the importance in the public interest that the truth should out. As the court said in [ 
 Bonnard v Perryman
 (1891)] at p 284: `The right of free speech is one which it is for the public interest that individuals should possess, and, indeed, that they should exercise without impediment, so long as no wrongful act is done.` There is no wrong done if it is true, or if it is fair comment on a matter of public interest. The court will not prejudice the issue by granting an injunction in advance of publication.
 
 
 
He went on to establish the rationale for the grant of the injunction in the 
 Gulf Oil 
case14 in the following words [at p 333]: 
 
It is true that there is no wrong done if what is published is true provided that it is not published in pursuance of a combination and, even if it is, there is still no wrong unless the sole or dominant purpose of the combination and publication is to injure the plaintiff. If, however, there is both combination and purpose or dominant purpose to injure, there 
 is
 a wrong done. When a plaintiff sues in conspiracy there is, therefore, a potential wrong even if it is admitted, as it is in the present case, that the publication is true and thus that there is no question of a cause of action in defamation. In such a case the court can, and in my view should, proceed on the same principles as it would in the case of any other tort.
 
 
 
In agreeing that the appeal should be allowed, Ralph Gibson LJ stated that as Gulf had made out an arguable case that the aerial display had been part of a concerted plan to inflict deliberate damage upon the plaintiffs without any just cause, they were, due regard being given the principle of free speech, entitled to the limited injunction granted by the appeal court.
The third member of the Court of Appeal, Sir Nicholas Browne-Wilkinson VC agreed with the foregoing judgments. He had his opportunity to develop the law further and analyse the effect of the 
 Gulf Oil 
 decision14 when deciding the second case on the issue, 
 Femis-Bank (Anguilla) Ltd & Ors v Lazar 
 .16 There the defenhad published a series of allegations against the plaintiffs who were bankers and investors, maintaining that they were financially unsound and dishonest in the conduct of their business. The documents relied on by the defendants did indicate improprieties in the carrying on of the business, but there were grounds for suggesting that there was a major malicious motive in the defendants` conduct. The plaintiffs alleged a conspiracy by the defendants and sought an interlocutory injunction restraining the publication of the defamatory statements pending trial of the conspiracy action.
Browne-Wilkinson VC refused to grant the injunction. The Vice-Chancellor pointed out in his judgment that to obtain an injunction, the plaintiffs would first have to establish an arguable case that there was a conspiracy, the sole or paramount intention of which was to injure them. After considering the affidavits before him, he held that there were substantial grounds on which it could be argued that there was a major malicious motive in the conduct of the defendant, Mr Lazar. Though he had substantial doubt whether at trial the plaintiffs would be able to establish that Mr Lazar`s sole or paramount purpose was simply to injure without lawful justification, he marginally reached the view that there was an arguable case on the point. Having found that damages would be an inadequate remedy to the plaintiffs, he then turned to consider how he should exercise his discretion. It appeared to the Vice-Chancellor that the important questions in the case were questions of public interest rather than private rights. One of these, which he called `the wider public interest` related to the preservation of freedom of speech and the other, the `narrower public interest`, related to permitting allegations to be made alerting investors and regulatory authorities to the possibility of malfeasance in a financial institution.
Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that on the basis of the 
 Gulf 
 O 
 il 
case,14 the wider public interest was not a relevant matter for the judge to take into account where the claim was based on a conspiracy to injure. The Vice-Chancellor analysed the judgment of Parker LJ in the 
 Gulf Oil 
 case14 and rejected the plaintiff`s contention. He stated: 
 
I do not see any ground for suggesting that the 
 Gulf Oil
 case [1987] decided that the public interest in freedom of speech was irrelevant in exercising the discretion to grant an injunction ... . Even if the case is brought in conspiracy, the question remains: `should the injunction be granted as a matter of discretion?` and in exercising that discretion the fact that the injunction will interfere with freedom of speech was an important factor to be taken into account. I would expect that only in the very clearest cases such as existed in the 
 Gulf Oil
 case would the interference with that public interest be justified by the grant of an injunction.
 
 
 
He then considered the narrower public interest and stated: `If the allegations were wholly unsupported by collaborative material and 
 it was manifest that what was being done was mere spite 
 then it might be appropriate to grant an injunction but there is at least some support for what Mr Lazar is saying.` (Emphasis added.) And the judge concluded: `This is a case where in the exercise of the discretion, I should not preclude Mr Lazar from exercising his right of free speech, since there is an element of public interest in those factors being known, and the case, on balance, is not a very strong one against him.`
In my view (and I have here been assisted by Mr Chen`s able submissions), the principles established by these two authorities are: 
 
 
(1) Where an interlocutory injunction is sought to prevent publication of inpursuant to conspiracy to injure, the court should bear in mind that the interlocutory injunction would, if granted, interfere with the freedom of speech. Accordingly, whilst in an appropriate case an injunction can issue, the court will be very careful in delimiting the extent of the injunction. 
 
(2) Where the plaintiffs can establish a strong prima facie claim for conspiracy to injure as in 
Gulf Oil
 
[1987] 1 Ch 327
 then the court would grant the injunction to prevent the continuation of an actionable wrong as in such a clear case it is justifiable to interfere with the public interest in the freedom of speech. It would be noted, however, that in this case only the most flagrant publication of the information was restrained. 
 
(3) If the plaintiffs` claim for conspiracy to injure is only arguable in that there is some doubt as to the dominant purpose being an intention to injure, the public interest in freedom of speech would prevent the issue of a `gagging` injunction. In the 
 Femis-Bank 
 case16 the plaintiffs had only an arguable case since (a) the publication was to persons who had an interest in receiving the information, thus negativing paramount intent to injure, and (b) the information published were matters of public concern as a bank was involved.
  
 
 
Mr Chen asserted that in the present case, the evidence before the court clearly establishes spite and paramount intention to injure as well as the combination. Information on AB`s personal relationships with women are not matters of public interest, although they may be interesting or titillating to the public, and the public has no legitimate interest in receiving such information.
In my judgment, the plaintiffs have succeeded in establishing that there are serious questions to be tried in this case on the tort of conspiracy to injure. First, the anonymous letters exhibited contain a wealth of detail which could only have been disclosed to the writer(s) by the defendant herself. They threaten the plaintiffs with unpleasant repercussions should they not treat the defendant properly. The timing of the letters is also significant. They were sent at times when the defendant herself was very upset with the plaintiffs: the first letter arrived less than two weeks after the defendant`s first police report, and the second after the defendant, in her penultimate letter (dated 8 November 1991) to AB, had said: `My main objective is to bring up my grievances and to tell the whole world exactly what type of person you are. I also want our story with photographs to be published in all the newspapers.` In her submissions, the defendant admitted that the anonymous letters had been written by a third party but contended that she had not instigated their composition. Whilst at the trial the defendant may be able to establish that she did not in fact conspire with the writer(s) of these letters, at this stage the plaintiffs have satisfied me that there is a question to be tried as to the existence of a combination against them.
On the issue of intention, it appears from the cases cited above that where a defendant has a real interest in the disclosure of the information, then the inference of paramount intention to injure can be negatived. Mr Chen submitted that even if the defendant`s version is true and she was the victim of sexual harassment, she has no interest in disclosing the details of her relationship with AB since, as the law stands, she has no recourse against him or the company. Whilst it might be correct that the defendant cannot bring a lawsuit against the plaintiffs (though I express no decided opinion on this issue), if the defendant has been mistreated, she obviously has an interest in exposing the perpetrator of the mistreatment to public opprobrium. This, given the state of the law, might in fact be her only recourse to obtain satisfaction for any wrong that may have been done to her. There would also be a public interest in the disclosure of information on morally and socially unacceptable conduct so as to deter others from replicating such conduct. In a country such as Singapore where women make up more than a third of the labour force and there is a continuing economic need to tap the expertise and abilities of the female population, it is important that sexual harassment of women workers is actively discouraged.
On the other hand, it is clear from the defendant`s actions and letters that spite and a desire for revenge have played a large part in motivating her. She has disseminated information not only on AB`s personal relationship with herself, but also on his relationship with IS and his alleged cheating of the company. Additionally, the language of some of the letters indicates that the defendant, far from being the victim of harassment, was, as AB alleges, a willing participant in a love affair who was angered by the end of that affair. Whilst the defendant has an explanation for such language, at this interlocutory stage the court is neither required nor in a position to decide which version is correct. Accordingly, I conclude that there is a serious question to be tried on the issue of intention to injure. As regards the threatened disclosure to the public at large, business contacts of the plaintiffs, embassies and clubs who have no interest in the matter at all, it is clear that the element of spite dominates.
Here, again, damages would not be adequate recompense to the plaintiffs. On the other hand, the damage which a continuation of the injunction prohibiting the defendant from speaking about her personal relationship with AB might inflict on the defendant, can be contained by narrowing the width of the injunction. The defendant`s complaint that the original injunction harmed her in that she was banned from seeking the help and consolation both of professional advisors and family is a valid one. Further, as pointed out by Mr Tan, when the defendant talks to her close friends, counsellors and family about her personal relationship with AB, the paramount intention must be to seek comfort and assistance rather than to injure the plaintiffs. If the injunction is so worded as to allow the defendant such solace, however, the postponement of her right to tell the world what was done to her till after the trial of the action would be an inconvenience rather than anything more serious and, at the same time, the public interest in preserving freedom of speech would be catered to.
Having given due consideration to the various elements involved and the competing interests of the parties, it is my opinion that having due regard for freedom of speech, the defendant should not be permitted from now till the trial to publicly disseminate information about her personal relationship with AB and that therefore, the first two interim injunctions should be continued, though in a modified form.
 The third injunction
Although during the argument neither party dealt specifically with the third injunction order, ie that restraining the defendant from contacting AB, as the defendant`s application is for a total discharge of all the injunction orders made, I have also to consider whether this order should be continued. The affidavits of AB and the defendant herself made clear that she had telephoned him, written to him and tried to see him very frequently. There is obviously a serious question to be tried on the tort of nuisance. No argument can be made in favour of discharging the third injunction at this stage.
 Conclusion
For the reasons given above, I therefore order that the first and second injunction orders granted on 5 December 1991 be varied so as to provide that until trial of this action or until further order: 
 
 
(1) the defendant, whether by herself, her servants or agents or otherwise howsoever, be restrained from disclosing, whether directly or indirectly, to anyone (other than the relevant authorities, her solicitors and this court) any information howsoever acquired by her during her period of employment with the first plaintiffs on the personal affairs of the second plaintiff excluding his relationship with the defendant; 
 
(2) the defendant, whether by herself, her servants or agents or otherwise howsoever, be restrained and is hereby restrained from disclosing to any newspaper or periodical or other media (whether within or outside of Singapore) or to the employees of the first plaintiffs or its parent company or otherwise publishing for public dissemination (disclosure to the relevant authorities not to be regarded as public dissemination) any information on the relationship between the defendant and the second plaintiff.
  
 
 
The costs of this application are reserved to the trial judge.
Finally, I would like to record my thanks to Mr Kenneth Tan for his lucid and meticulous analysis of the law. [lt ]6[gt ]

The accused, Chota bin Abdul Razak (the accused), in the district court in DAC 2754 of 1987 pleaded guilty to the following charge against him: 
 
You, Chota bin Abdul Razak (m/28), I/C No 1410767-C, are charged that you, on or about 26 March 1987, at about 4.45pm at the void deck of Block 637, Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention with one Tan Chuan Ten (m/27), I/C No 2183701-F, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class B of the First Schedule of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, by transporting 2.6kg (net) of cannabis in motor pick-up GD 8441D from Ang Mo Kio Street 61 to the car park in front of Block 637, Ang Mo Kio Ave 6, without authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 
 
 
He was convicted and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years and three strokes of the cane. Against the sentence of imprisonment, this appeal is now brought.
The facts as admitted by the accused before the learned district judge were briefly these. On 26 March 1987 at about 4.30pm, a motor pick-up was seen by a party of narcotics officers entering the car park in front of Block 637, Ang Mo Kio Ave 6; these narcotics officers had prior to the time taken up their respective positions in the vicinity. In the motor pick-up were the accused and one Tan Chuan Ten (Tan). The motor pick-up stopped at a parking lot in front of Block 637, and the accused alighted from the vehicle and went to the first floor of the block of flats, while Tan waited at the void deck. The accused was carrying a polythene bag when he went to the first floor. A few minutes later the accused came down, still carrying the polythene bag. He placed the bag on the front passenger seat of the motor pick-up and then joined Tan. A short while later the accused went across to Block 635 where he was seen standing at the telephone stand. When the accused went back to join Tan, he and Tan were arrested. The polythene bag was seized and found to contain 2.6kg of cannabis.
The main arguments of counsel for the accused have been centred on the rather unusual circumstances in which the accused pleaded guilty to the charge, and it is necessary to recount briefly the events leading to his plea and conviction, which have been set out quite fully in the grounds of decision of the learned district judge. The accused was arrested on 26 March 1987 and was produced in the district court and charged. He was released on bail on 4 April 1987. Subsequently, his case was mentioned on three occasions and eventually was fixed for hearing on 9 May 1988. On that day, the case, for some reason, was not heard, and was further mentioned on two other occasions, and on the second occasion it was fixed for hearing on 13 March 1989; five days were allocated for hearing this case.
In the meanwhile, on 22 December 1988 the accused was arrested in connection with two offences of trafficking in and possession of drugs alleged to have been committed on 2 September 1988. On 23 December 1988, he was produced in court and charged for these two offences in DAC 13751 of 1988 and DAC 13752 of 1988; no bail was granted and he was remanded in custody.
The case in DAC 2754 of 1987 was not heard on 13 March 1989 as fixed. It is not clear from the record what happened on that day in relation to this case. Presumably, the accused intended to plead guilty to this charge and it was agreed or decided that all the three charges against the accused should be brought up and dealt with together. On 10 May 1989, the accused appeared before the district judge, Mr Yong Yung Sui; he was represented by counsel. He pleaded guilty to the three charges in DAC 2754 of 1987, DAC 13751 of 1988 and DAC 13752 of 1988 respectively. However, the accused disputed certain facts presented by the prosecution in connection with the charge in DAC 2754 of 1987. I was told, and this was not disputed by the prosecution, that what the accused disputed was the complicity of Tan in the commission of the offence. He admitted that he did traffic in the amount of cannabis as charged. So, in effect, he disputed that there was a common intention subsisting between him and Tan. With reference to the two charges in DAC 13751 of 1988 and DAC 13752 of 1988, there was no dispute on the facts presented by the prosecution. However, his pleas of guilty to the three charges were not accepted and the hearing of all the three cases was adjourned. The reason for this is not clear. Probably the learned district judge was of the view that as all the three cases concerned the same accused they should be dealt with together, and he adjourned the hearing to enable the prosecution and the defence to resolve their differences on the facts in relation to the charge in DAC 2754 of 1987.
Strangely enough, seven days later, on 17 May 1989, the accused appeared before another district judge, Mr Colin Chai, to answer only the charges in DAC 13751 of 1988 and DAC 13752 of 1988. The charge in DAC 2754 of 1987 was not brought up for disposal then. The reason for this is again unclear. The accused was still represented by counsel. There was nothing on record to indicate that counsel had asked for an adjournment of the hearing of the two cases or asked for the case in DAC 2754 of 1987 to be brought forward so that all three of them could be dealt with together. Be that as it may, the accused pleaded guilty to the two charges and was convicted and sentenced, in respect of the charge in DAC 13751 of 1988, to a term of imprisonment of three years and three strokes of cane, and in respect of the charge in DAC 13752 of 1988, to a term of imprisonment of one year, the two terms of imprisonment to run consecutively, with the first term to commence on 23 December 1988.
There remained the charge in DAC 2754 of 1987, which was not brought before the court until about 11 months later. On 20 February 1990, the accused appeared before the district judge, Mr FG Remedios. On that occasion he pleaded guilty to the charge and admitted the statement of facts and also additional facts which clarified the statement; there was then no dispute of any fact. He was convicted and sentenced to a term of five years` imprisonment and three strokes of cane, and the sentence of imprisonment was ordered to commence on that day pursuant to s 234(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC).
The main complaint of the accused has been directed at the manner in which the proceedings in respect of DAC 2754 of 1987 had been conducted in the district court. It was submitted by his counsel that when the accused appeared before the district judge, Mr Yong Yung Sui on 10 May 1989 and pleaded guilty to this charge and also to the two charges in DAC 13751 of 1988 and DAC 13752 of 1988 respectively, the learned judge should have accepted his pleas and sentenced him accordingly on that day. The accused admitted committing the offence of trafficking in the quantity of drugs as alleged in the charge; what he did not admit, and in fact disputed, was the complicity of Tan in the commission of the offence, ie the common intention alleged to be subsisting between him and Tan. As the accused had admitted that he himself committed the offence, so far as he was concerned, the element of common intention was no longer an essential ingredient of the charge against him. Therefore, the learned judge, it was submitted, should have disregarded this dispute of common intention which had become immaterial. If the learned judge had accepted his plea of guilty to this charge, he would also have dealt with the accused`s pleas of guilty to the other two charges and passed the appropriate sentences on the accused in respect of all the three charges. In those circumstances, it would be likely that two of the sentences would have been ordered to run concurrently and the first sentence would have been ordered to commence from 23 December 1988. However, as the events had turned out, so counsel submitted, the accused was not convicted and sentenced in respect of the charge in DAC 2754 of 1987 until 20 February 1990, and his sentence then could commence only from that day, as he was then serving a sentence of imprisonment. His position therefore had been prejudiced. These arguments raise two questions: (i) whether the learned judge was right in not accepting the accused`s plea of guilty on 10 May 1989 in view of the dispu te on the facts, and (ii) if the learned district judge was in error, whether the accused`s position, in respect of the sentences, has really been prejudiced.
I now turn to the first question. The procedure governing the conduct of the proceedings before the district court in the event of an accused pleading guilty to the charge preferred against him is set out in s 180 of the CPC, which, so far as relevant, provides:
The following procedure shall be observed by magistrates` courts and district courts in summary trials:
 
 
(a) when the accused appears or is brought before the court, a charge containing the particulars of the offence of which he is accused shall be framed and read and explained to him and he shall be asked whether he is guilty of the offence charged or claims to be tried; 
 
(b) if the accused pleads guilty to a charge whether as originally formed or as amended, the plea shall be recorded and he may be convicted on it:
  
 
 
Provided that before a plea of guilty is recorded the court shall ascertain that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him;
There is no express provision in the CPC requiring an accused to admit a statement of facts presented to court before his plea of guilty can be accepted. The only requirement is that contained in the proviso to para (b) of s 180, namely, that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him. However, a practice has developed in which, before a plea of guilty by the accused is accepted by the court, a statement of facts setting out the circumstances in which the offence is alleged to have been committed is read to the accused by the prosecution and the accused is required to admit such statement. Several decided cases have stressed the importance of a statement of facts being recorded and admitted by the accused. In 
 Palan v PP 
 
 [1939] MLJ 124 
, where the accused was convicted of the offence of voluntarily causing grievous hurt to one Anggamah, the record merely stated: `Accused in person. Convicted on plea. Sentenced to six years` R1.` Murison CJ said: 
 
As an appeal court I think we ought to have some evidence taken by the trial judge to indicate the nature and quality of the criminal act for which the sentence is given. Without that evidence we cannot be in a position to say whether the sentence is fair or not.
 
 
 
In
 Re Mohamed Miskin Son of Kader Bacha 
 
 
[1939] MLJ 289
 , the accused pleaded guilty to a charge of causing mischief by cutting a cable belonging to the Posts and Telegraphs Department and was convicted and fined. Upon a criminal revision, Poyser CJ set aside the conviction and held that the accused`s statement was in effect an admission that he was responsible for the cutting of the cable and there was no indication in the statement that he intended to cut the cable or knew that he was likely to do so. He said, at p 290: 
 
To establish a charge of mischief it must be proved that the accused intended to cause wrongful loss or damage or that he committed an act with the knowledge that he was likely to cause such loss or damage.
 
 
 
The legal position was not explained to the accused when he pleaded guilty to the charge, his statement was in effect an admission that he was responsible for the cutting of the cable but there was nothing in his statement to indicate that he intended to cut the cable or knew he was likely to do so.
Probably the accused`s conduct was negligent, but negligence is not necessarily mischief, and although the accused might be held liable in civil proceedings for damages I do not think the facts disclosed justify a conviction under the Penal Code.
In 
 Cheng Ah Sang v PP 
 
 
[1948] MLJ 82
 , the accused pleaded guilty to the charge of keeping or using a house as a gambling house. On his plea the magistrate proceeded to take a summary of the facts alleged. He then questioned the accused on those facts and found that the accused did not admit the gaming was for money. He then altered the plea to one claiming trial. Laville J had this to say, at p 82: 
 
This procedure is open to criticism in that it elicits the prosecution evidence before the court has satisfied itself as to whether the accused`s plea of guilty is acceptable. A magistrate should satisfy himself by questioning the accused that he does really understand the charge and admits each ingredient that goes to make it up, before he records a plea of guilty by the accused and should record that the accused understands the charge before entering his plea of guilty
 
 
 
More to the point is the decision of Jobling J in 
 Chin Ball Keat v R 
 
 [1949] MLJ 297 
. In that case the accused, through his counsel, pleaded guilty to a charge of accepting an illegal gratification, an offence punishable under s 161 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (PC). After a statement of facts had been given the accused was convicted. On appeal, Jobling J held, inter alia, that neither the charge nor the statement disclosed the nature of the official act alleged to have been done by the accused. He said, at p 297:
It is clear that neither the charge nor the statement discloses the nature of the official act alleged to have been done by the appellant and the question is what effect this has on the plea of guilty to a contravention of s 161 of the Penal Code.
Later, he said, at p 298: 
 
An appeal does, however, lie on the question of sentence and as I have already stated I am of opinion that the facts are not set out fully enough to show the circumstances in which the offence was committed. It is, therefore, impossible to consider the adequacy of the sentence imposed and the case must go back to the lower court to have the facts fully recorded.
 
 
 
When recording the facts the magistrate will also have to record the accused`s admission or denial of them and if the facts admitted do not constitute the offence charged the magistrate will then have to consider whether to discharge the accused or enter a plea of not guilty and proceed to trial.
In the circumstances I think the only practical course is to deal with this matter on revision and order a retrial.
Mr Conaghan has asked for directions whether after a plea of guilty evidence should be led as to the facts alleged or if they should be merely stated by the prosecuting officer.
This is a matter of practice which must be left to the presiding magistrate. The aim of the court is to record the facts alleged by the prosecutor and admitted by the accused and to satisfy itself that they constitute the offence charged.
In most cases this can be satisfactorily achieved by a statement by the prosecuting officer followed by an admission by the accused but in cases of doubt or difficulty it may be advisable to have evidence led as to the facts. The course adopted in each case must be left to the court`s discretion.
The practice of the prosecution presenting to court a statement of facts setting out the circumstances in which the offence was committed and the accused admitting such facts undoubtedly enables the court to ascertain, which it is required to do under s 180(b) of the CPC, hat the accused (i) understands the nature of his plea of guilty, and (ii) intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him. In so far as the second limb is concerned, what is required is the admission by the accused of the offence without qualification. It is therefore essential that what the accused admits in the statement of facts contains all the ingredients that constitute the offence with which he is charged. It is not essential, however, that the accused should admit every iota of facts contained in the statement. If what he admits contains all the ingredients that constitute the offence and what he disputes or does not admit is irrelevant or immaterial to the offence, such an admission, in my opinion, is sufficient for the purpose of s 180(b), and the court should accept his plea of guilty. Such an admission is an admission without qualification of the offence alleged against him. If there is any doubt as to the adequacy of an admission, then, as Jobling J held in 
 Chin Ban Keat v R 
, evidence may be led as to the facts. That is a matter for the court to decide.
I now return to the facts of the instant case. The accused admitted before the district judge on 10 May 1989 that he did traffic in drugs of the kind and quantity, in the manner and at the time and place as specified in the charge. What he disputed or did not admit was the complicity of Tan in the commission of the offence; in effect, he was disputing the existence of the common intention with Tan in furtherance of which he was alleged to have committed the offence. Since he admitted committing the offence of trafficking in drugs, it is immaterial whether or not there existed the common intention between him and Tan. In such a case, it is not necessary to rely on or have recourse to the concept of common intention as provided in s 34 of the PC. Section 34 does not create a substantive offence; it lays down only a rule of evidence to infer joint responsibility for a criminal act performed by a plurality of persons: see 
 Ratanlal & Dhirajlal`s Law of Crimes 
Vol 1 at p 86. In my opinion, that admission would be sufficient for the purpose of s 180(b) of the CPC, and the learned district judge ought in those circumstances to have accepted his plea of guilty and dealt with the three charges that were preferred against the accused.
I now turn to the second question. It is the argument of counsel for the accused that, had the accused`s plea of guilty in DAC 2754 of 1987 been adopted, then the term of imprisonment of five years imposed for the offence in that case would have been ordered to run concurrently with the two terms of imprisonment of three years and one year in DAC 13751 of 1988 and DAC 13752 of 1988 respectively, which were ordered to run consecutively. The net result would have been a term of imprisonment of five years taking effect retrospectively on 23 December 1988. That argument is based on the assumption that the learned district judge on 10 May 1989 in dealing with the three charges would have passed the same sentences as were passed on 17 May 1989 and 20 February 1990 and would have ordered the latter sentence to run concurrently with the two earlier sentences. The learned district judge, however, might have ordered longer terms of imprisonment in respect of the charges in DAC 13751 of 1988 and DAC 13752 of 1988 and might have adopted the following permutation in the treatment of the sentences: the terms of imprisonment in DAC 13751 of 1988 and DAC 13752 of 1988 to run concurrently and the term of imprisonment in DAC 2754 of 1987 to run consecutively with the other two terms. In such a case, the term of imprisonment in totality would be not less than eight years taking effect from 23 December 1988. I therefore find myself in agreement with the learned district judge, Mr Remedios, that it would be difficult to say, and it would not be right to speculate, what the court would have ordered if it had dealt with the three cases together on 10 May or for that matter on 17 May 1989. It therefore cannot be said that the accused`s position in terms of the sentences passed on him had been seriously prejudiced by the events that had occurred.
I now turn to the next argument of counsel. It was argued that the learned district judge in imposing the term of five years` imprisonment took into account the recent amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) whereby, inter alia, the punishment for trafficking in cannabis was enhanced. This argument I accept. The accused ought to be punished in the circumstances which then existed and in accordance with the legislation then in force, and it is not correct to take into account subsequent legislation. The learned district judge ought not to have been influenced, as he appears to have been influenced, by the subsequent legislation enhancing the punishment for the offence.
I now turn to the last question whether I ought to disturb the sentence passed on the accused. The minimum term required to be imposed by statute at the time was a term of imprisonment of three years and three strokes of cane. I am in entire agreement with the learned district judge that this would not be an appropriate case for imposing only the minimum term of three years. The amount of cannabis that was transported by the accused was 2.6kg, which was a large amount. In addition, while he was on bail pending his trial on this charge he committed two other offences, namely, trafficking in drugs and possession of drugs. These are the two offences in respect of which charges were brought against him to which he pleaded guilty, and he was convicted and sentenced. These, of course, are not his previous convictions, but nonetheless they show the attitude of mind and the conduct of the accused; he was not as remorseful as he claimed to be. In the circumstances, the term of imprisonment of five years imposed by the learned district judge, though on the high side, cannot in the circumstances be considered as manifestly excessive as to warrant an intervention by an appellate tribunal. Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.

You, Tan Choon Huat are charged that you, on or about 9 October 1986 at about 1.15am, at National Stadium East Entrance, Stadium Road, Singapore, which is a public place, were found in the company of Goh Chong Chi m/27 yrs and Low Keau An m/23 yrs, who had in their possession an offensive weapon, to wit, a knife each, in contravention of s 6(1) of Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65) in circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that you knew that the said Goh Chong Chi and Low Keau An had in their possession such weapons, and thereby committed an offence punishable under s 8(1) read with s 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65).
 
 
 
Section 6(1) of the Corrosive and Explosive Substances and Offensive Weapons Act (Cap 65) (the Act) reads: 
 
Any person who in any public road or place carries or has in his possession or under his control any offensive weapon otherwise than with lawful authority or for a lawful purpose shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than six strokes.
 
 
 
Section 8(1) of the Act reads: 
 
Any person who consorts with, or is found in the company of, another person who is carrying or has in his possession or under his control any offensive weapon in contravention of s 6, in circumstances which raise a reasonable presumption that he knew that that other person was carryor had in his possession or under his control any such weapon shall, unless he shall prove that he had reasonable grounds for believing that that other person was carrying or had in his possession or under his control any such weapon for a lawful purpose, be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to the like punishment as that other person with whom he was consorting or in whose company he was found.
 
 
 
The appellant and the other two persons, namely, Goh and Low, referred to in the charge were tried jointly. The appellant was charged under s 8(1) read with s 6(1) of the Act whereas Goh and Low were charged only under s 6(1) of the Act for being in possession of a knife each without lawful authority. As it happened, after the prosecution closed its case, Goh and Low decided to plead guilty and were convicted and sentenced to four months` imprisonment and were given six strokes of the cane each.
The prosecution`s case against the appellant was that the appellant and the other two persons (the said Goh and Low) were apprehended at about 1.15am on 9 October 1986 near the east entrance of the National Stadium. They were seen by the police to be behaving in a suspicious manner and the police saw one of them, Low, throwing away a knife which he had with him. In the ensuing search by the police, it was found that the other person Goh had a knife tucked in his waist. The appellant did not have any offensive weapon on him. The weapons seized were kitchen knives.
In the event, they were all taken to the Beach Road Police Station where they were interrogated, and insofar as is material to this appeal, a statement was recorded from the appellant under s 122(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC) at about 4.30pm on the same day (about 15 hours later).
The admission of the said statement was objected to at the trial on the grounds that it was not given voluntarily. It was alleged that it was obtained under vigorous and continuous interrogation of the appellant between 10.48am and 3.05pm on 9 October 1986 without lunch, the police knowing full well that the appellant had not taken his breakfast that morning; he was denied sleep and rest for over 15 hours before his statement was recorded; he had been assaulted, ill-treated and threatened during the interrogation; he was told that he would be remanded for seven days if he did not make a statement; he would be taken to his flat handcuffed but if he were to sign the statement he would not be jailed and was promised that the court would be asked by the police to be lenient. The appellant was also not allowed an opportunity to make any amendment, alteration or addition to the statement recorded and that considerable pressure was brought to bear upon the appellant, then only 18 years of age.
After a somewhat spirited trial within a trial, the learned magistrate admitted the statement and held that he was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the statement was given by the appellant voluntarily without any threat, inducement or promise held out to the appellant. The material part of the statement thus admitted reads as follows: 
 
3 On 8 October 1986, I was not working. I was at the rented room at 1200 hrs. On the same day at about 10.30pm my room-mates, namely, Suah Yee (refers to Goh Chong Chi) and Lau Shu (refers to Low Keau An) came home. They bought some beers. I then joined them in the drinking session. Three of us drank about eight cans of beers. Whilst drinking I don`t know who started to discuss about the topic of committing robbery. At that time I was rather drunk. I remembered that I agreed to join them in the robbery. At about 1am three of us left the rented room and walked to National Stadium. If I am not mistaken I think I heard Lau Shu suggesting going to National Stadium. So three of us went to National Stadium. Halfway walking along Lorong 6 Geylang junction, Lau Shu and Suah Yee told me that both of them carried a knife but they did not showed (sic) it to me. From then I know they are carrying a knife as I believed them. At about 0115 hrs whilst walking along National Stadium, I saw a police patrol car approaching and it shone its headlight on three of us. The policemen then say to Lau Shu what he had throwed (sic) and I saw the uniform policeman picking up a knife which I believed was thrown away by Lau Shu. The other policeman then searched me and Suah Yee. The policeman did not find anything on me but I saw the policeman found a knife from Suah Yee. Three of us were thus placed under arrest and subsequently brought back to Beach Road Police Station.
 
 
 
 
(4) I admit that I followed the two of my friends, namely, Lau Shu and Suah Yee as three of us intends (sic) to commit a robbery around National Stadium.
  
 
 
It is unfortunate that the learned magistrate seemed to have dealt with the defence objections summarily. He did not refer to or indicate anywhere in his grounds any aspects of the evidence given at the trial within a trial nor did he give any reasons why he chose to accept the version of the prosecution as against the defence though there were several unsatisfactory features in the prosecution evidence. Many an answer from the police witnesses was less than satisfactory and in some instances, glaringly perfunctory. There was uncontroverted evidence that the 18-year-old appellant was interrogated without rest or respite from 10.48am and was given no lunch even till 4.50pm on that date when he was supposed to have given a statement under s 122(5) of the CPC. The denial of lunch to the appellant is all the more troubling particularly when his interrogators knew that he did not consume his breakfast though the non-consumption had nothing to do with the police.
The statement thus recorded purportedly under s 122(5) of the CPC does not show that the appellant knew the charge against him nor does the record show anywhere that the appellant was invited to make any alteration, correction or amendment to the statement recorded.
It is settled law that a confession cannot be admitted unless it was made voluntarily and the elements of voluntariness must be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. This is provided for under ss 24 and 105 of our Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed). The expression `satisfied beyond reasonable doubt` would remain an elusive abstraction unless the court trying the contested issue sets out in its grounds some basis for its conclusions. An appeal court is generally disinclined to interfere with the finding of a trial court since the trial court has the advantage of hearing evidence and observing the demeanour of witnesses. But if the conclusion reached by the trial court is against the weight of evidence or that the inferences drawn by the trial court could not find support from the primary facts on the record, an appeal court would in the interests of justice intervene.

 .
Quite apart from the unsatisfactory features of the evidence of the prosecution witnesses as to voluntari, the statement recorded did not even conform with standard procedures usually adopted by the police in investigations of this nature. The investigating officer (PW3) said in answer to a question that he did invite the appellant to make amendments or alterations if the appellant so desired. But when it was put to the investigating officer that the statement recorded by him made no mention that he invited the appellant to make any alteration, amendment or correction, his answer was: `at the end of each statement, I would normally ask the accused whether he wanted to make any alteration.` By `normally asked` it does not necessarily mean that it was in fact asked in this case and that is what was required to satisfy the provisions of the law. The cumulative effect of all the unsatisfactory features tends to cast serious doubt on the prosecution`s evidence as to the voluntariness of the statement. The statement should not have been admitted.
Was the learned trial judge therefore wrong in calling the defence of the appellant? Even without regard to the said statement, the prosecution had placed before the court the following evidence:
 
 
(a) that Low and Goh were in possession of offensive weapons, ie a knife each without lawful authority in a public place in contravention of s 6(1) of the Act; 
 
(b) the appellant was found in their company; 
 
(c) they were all found at 1.15am at the entrance of the National Stadium where courting couples frequented; and 
 
(d) the three of them were behaving suspiciously and one was seen to be throwing away a knife.
  
 
 
Upon reception of such evidence, the question that remained to be answered by the court under s 8(1) of the Act was whether in the given circumstances, it was reasonable to presume or suppose that the appellant knew that either one of his companions had in his possession an offensive weapon. In the given circumstances, the evidential presumption that the appellant knew that his companions had with them those offensive weapons for unlawful purposes is compelling and calling the defence was therefore a logical sequence pursuant to s 180(f) of the CPC.
As the events unfolded, after the defence was called, the appellant elected to give evidence on oath. In his defence, the appellant said that on the night of 8 October 1986, he had been drinking beer after having earlier taken a sleeping tablet which he got from Low. After the drinking session, he joined Goh and Low for a walk. When the three of them reached a 24-hour coffee shop, Low suggested that they go to the National Stadium. They did so and when they reached the entrance of the National Stadium, Low told the appellant that he had a knife on him. Within minutes of Low telling him about the knife, a police patrol car appeared and they were all apprehended. The main plank of the appellant`s defence was that he did not learn about the knife until a few minutes before the police came and apprehended them. The appellant said that he did not have a clear picture of what was going on because of the effect of the drinks.
The learned magistrate in the result found the appellant guilty and his principal conclusions were as follows: 
 
In this case, at its best the defence might succeed in proving that when the accused left his quarters with Goh and Low he did not know about the knives. What the defence had to do next was not the rebuttal of the presumption that the accused knew about the knives, but to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that whilst he knew about the knives which he admitted he did he had reasonable grounds for believing that his companions had them in their possession for a lawful purpose, for example, that they had intended to use the knives to open up durians which they were going to purchase. This the defence did not do.
 
 
 
Instead, the accused`s purported defence was that he learnt about the knives too late for him to dissociate himself from his companions. He was too shocked on learning about the knives, too drunk, and had too little time to react in a manner which a reasonable person would if circumstances had not been so adverse. By reason of the foregoing, this defence, even if it were believed, fails for as soon as the accused knew about the knives he must have reasonable grounds for believing that his companions` possession of them was (sic) for a lawful purpose. And anything short of that meant that he had the mens rea for the offence under s 8(1) of the Act. This, in my opinion, is the position in law with regard to the defence which the accused tried unsuccessfully to raise.
Many grounds were advanced by counsel for the appellant on appeal but the main point of contention was that the analysis of s 8(1) of the Act by the learned magistrate was erroneous and that the prosecution had not proven guilty intent on the totality of the evidence.
The learned magistrate`s analysis of s 8(1) of the Act and the reasons for his conclusions are somewhat delphic. The learned magistrate was in error as to what the defence had to do to rebut the prosecution`s case. Section 8(1) of the Act does not, in any way, limit the right of an accused to cast a reasonable doubt on any of the ingredients of the offence. The accused is entitled, apart from the statutory defence available to him, to negative the prosecution`s case, if he could, by placing some evidence acceptable to the court for it to conclude that he did not know or could not have suspected that the others were in possession of offensive weapons.
But the appellant`s evidence or explanation in defence came nowhere near raising any reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case. The appellant was plainly unable to offer any plausible explanation why he was at the entrance of the National Stadium at 1.15am amidst armed companions. Worse still, his excuse for not withdrawing from the group soon after he learnt that one of them had a knife is wholly unsatisfactory. To my mind, the appellant has not raised any reasonable doubt on the prosecution`s case.
It, however, remains for me to consider a residuary legal aspect of the appeal, that is, whether the errors of the court below warrant or justify my setting aside the appellant`s conviction.
Section 261 of the CPC provides that: 
 
No judgment, sentence or order of a District Court or Magistrate`s Court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
Section 396 of the CPC provides that: 
 
Subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained, no finding, sentence or order passed or made by a court of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered on account of -
 
 
 
(a) any error, omission or irregularity in the complaint, summons, warrant, charge, judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any inquiry or other proceeding under this Code;
 
 
 
(b) the want of any sanction required by s 129; or
 
 
 
(c) the improper admission or rejection of any evidence,
 
 
 
unless the error, omission, improper admission or rejection of evidence, irregularity or want has occasioned a failure of justice.
 
 
 
In addressing the question whether there was any failure or miscarriage of justice or whether the conviction is unsafe or unsatisfactory, I asked the subjective question whether I am content to allow the verdict to stand as it is or whether there is not some lurking doubt in my mind which makes me wonder whether an injustice had been done. This is a reaction which may not be based strictly on the evidence as such but it is a reaction which can be produced by the general feel of the case as experienced by the court (vide Widgery LJ (as he then was) in 
 R 
 
 v Cooper 
 
 (Sean) 
 (1968) 53 Cr App R 82; [1969] 1 All ER 32 at p 86). See also

 (1968) 67 Cr App R 291 at p 298 and 
 Stafford v DPP 
[1973] 3 WLR 719
; [1973] 3 All ER 762. Notwithstanding the errors in the court below, I am satisfied that those errors did not occasion a failure or justice to the appellant. There was without doubt ample evidence against the appellant as to his guilt. The appeal against conviction is therefore dismissed.
On the question of sentence, it is noted that the appellant, a Malaysian, is 18 years of age and has no antecedents. His companions, Goh and Low, who were charged under s 6(1) of the Act were given four months` imprisonment and the minimum mandatory six strokes of the cane. It was said that the appellant was at that stage under the influence of drinks and was led into the escapade by his other two companions who were older than him. However, having regard to the nature of the offence, the circumstances of the case and the fact that the appellant is a foreign national not resident in Singapore, a probation order appears to be wholly inappropriate. Taking into consideration all relevant factors, I am of the view that a sentence of one month`s imprisonment and six strokes of the cane would be an adequate punishment. The sentence is varied accordingly.

At about 7am in the morning on 20 July 1983, the first plaintiff and Chua Peung Young (the deceased) were two of the nine passengers travelling to work at the back of their employer`s motor pick-up, which was driven by another employee, the defendant, along Jalan Ahmad Ibrahim towards Tuas when the pick-up overturned. The first plaintiff was injured and the deceased was killed.
According to the police investigation officer who arrived at the scene at 8.25am and prepared a sketch plan of the scene, the weather was fine, the stretch of road was straight, the road surface was dry, visibility was clear and, at that time, the traffic flow was moderate. The pick-up was lying overturned on the centre lane of the three-lane highway. There were no brake marks, but there were two scratch marks, both running within the centre lane and leading to the pick-up; the left scratch mark was 11m 40cm, and the right scratch mark was 7m 60cm in length.
The pick-up was inspected by a mechanical engineer at the Traffic Police Division that afternoon. It was found to be in working condition; it had done about 50,000km, the hand brake and the foot brake systems were in working order, the steering system had no defect and the tyres were in serviceable condition. The damage to the pick-up was listed as front windscreen glass broken; roof badly dented; front bonnet dented; right front signal light broken; right front fender slightly dented; right passenger`s door windscreen glass broken; right side iron railing bent; left passenger door slightly dented; left and right front fenders dented; and both rear view mirrors damaged.
The first plaintiff was unable to recall how the accident occurred because he was dozing off at the time; neither were the other passengers who were seated with him at the back of the pick-up. Also, no other persons responded to the police call for witnesses. The plaintiffs were therefore not in a position on their own to discharge the burden of proof placed upon them by providing any specific acts or omissions on the part of the defendant which would qualify as negligent conduct. However, in this case, the mere fact that the accident happened speaks for itself and, in applying the maxim res ipsa loquitur, the court can draw an inference of negligence against the defendant so as to establish a prima facie case against him. In a much quoted passage in the leading case of 
 Scott v St Katherine Docks Co Scott v St Katherine Docks Co 
 (1865) 3 H & C 596; 159 ER 665
 , 
 Erle CJ said: 
 
There must be reasonable evidence of negligence. But where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.
 
 
 
In the present case, the pick-up was at all times under the control and management of the defendant, and the accident which resulted in the pick-up overturning in the middle of the road could not have happened in the ordinary course of things without negligence on the defendant`s part. A burden is therefore cast upon the defendant, and he must show how the accident actually occurred, and how this was consistent with due care on his part. In other words, he must rebut the inference of negligence raised against him: 
 VVV Menon v Henri Pigeonneau 
 
 
[1957] MLJ 85
 ; 
 Halijah v Velaitham 
 
 
[1966] 1 MLJ 192
 
 . 
The defendant gave evidence on his own behalf. He said that he had only been working for the employer for about a week before the accident. He was not employed as a driver, but as a fitter; his employer, Ching Thiam Wah, had been keeping late nights recently and was tired, and so he had also been driving the pick-up, to help out. On the day of the accident, his employer was seated beside him in the front cabin. Although he had said in his police report that the traffic flow was heavy, he said in his evidence in court that it was moderate. Just before the accident, he was travelling in the centre lane, following a taxi, and there was some other traffic in front of the taxi. He was travelling at between 40 and 50 according to the speedometer, but he could not explain whether this was in kilometres or in miles per hour, and he was not sure if his pick-up had a speed limit indicator. As he was on his way to work, he was afraid he might be late. So when he reached the place of the accident, and he saw that there was no traffic behind him in the right lane, he gave right-turn signal and sounded his horn in preparation to overtake the taxi. He then swerved his pick-up into the third lane, in order to accelerate and overtake the taxi. At that same moment, however, without giving any signal, the taxi also swerved to the right and into his path. It was 3 to 4ft from the front of his pick-up. He applied his foot brakes, without jamming on them, but in doing so he became excited, and he did not know what happened, but somehow he lost control of the pick-up. It veered towards the right and hit the kerb. At that point, he lost consciousness. When he came to, he saw that his pick-up had overturned and was lying in the middle of the road. Under cross-examination, he conceded that he could have turned the steering wheel for a brief moment, but he did not really know. But he could not have mounted the kerb on to the road divider, much less hit the lamp-post or a tree on the divider.
Ching Thiam Wah (Ching), the employer, gave evidence for the defendant. He was seated in the front cabin of the pick-up, beside the defendant who was driving. He did not appear to have been paying much attention to the passage of the pick-up, however, as he said that he had decided to be relaxed from the moment he boarded the pick-up at the start of the journey. He clarified this to mean that he was alternately opening and closing his eyes as they went along. Just before the accident, however, while still relaxing in this manner, he lit a cigarette, and while doing so he noted that there was a taxi in front of them, and other traffic in front of the taxi. At that time the pick-up was 10 to 12ft behind the taxi. The defendant pulled over to the right lane to overtake the taxi and, when the pick-up was already three-quarters on the right lane and the taxi was only 3 to 4ft in front of it, the taxi suddenly swerved into the path of the pick-up. The defendant thereupon swerved further to the right, but hit the kerb, and the pick-up overturned.
The defence then was that the accident was caused by the driver of an unknown taxi, who suddenly and without warning swerved to the right and cut into the path of the defendant just as the defendant was about to overtake him. In order to avoid a collision with the taxi, the defendant was forced to swerve and apply his brake. But, in spite of this, the defendant was unable to avoid colliding with the road divider. The defence therefore was that the taxi driver was solely, or at least partly, to blame.
The accident occurred in July 1983, almost eight years ago, and it is inevitable that the memories of even the most honest witnesses will have become blurred with the long passage of time. The unreliability of such evidence is greater when the witness is an interested party in the proceedings. In 
 Mace v R & H Green and Silley Weir Ltd & Anor 
[1959] 2 WLR 504
; [1959] 1 All ER 655
 , 
 Lord Parker CJ had this to say on the subject at p 506: 
 
This matter arises nearly six years after the event. I am not saying that anybody is particularly to blame but it makes the task of witnesses and of the court extremely difficult. Memories, anyhow, are liable to fail and after six years they are almost bound to fail. Moreover, one is bound to be suspicious of the plaintiff`s claim in those circumstances; one approaches the matter on the basis that it may be something that he has gradually in the course of time conjured up, and one is bound to look at his evidence with great suspicion. Again, from the point of view of the court, it is often impossible in these circumstances to accept the whole of the evidence of any one witness, however honest he is and however much he may be trying to tell the truth. Six years after the event witnesses may with the best will in the world be at fault.
 
 
 
As the evidence unfolded in the present case, I had the greatest difficulty in believing the defendant and his employer, Ching, and in accepting their version of what happened. The employer had at least the excuse that he was dozing half the time, but there was no reason why the defendant should not have been able to explain more clearly what happened. Although he was quite articulate, he avoided direct answers to many questions and I formed the impression that the gaps in his account of the accident were due as much to his not having thought out the detailed answers to possible questions in advance, as to the failure of his memory from the passage of time. I therefore did not accept their version of how the accident happened.
There may well have been a taxi in front of the defendant`s pick-up at some time that morning: indeed, there was other traffic at the time, but in my opinion none of them contributed to the accident. It was put to the defendant in cross-examination that he had been overtaking other vehicles left and right, which he denied. By his own admission, however, he was already travelling at a good speed, but he was afraid that they might all be late for work, and he was therefore not averse to overtaking other vehicles in front of him. Even if there had been a taxi which swerved in front of him and caused the accident in the way that he alleged, he was clearly driving much too closely behind it, when he started his move to overtake it. He should have been a good three car lengths behind the taxi when he pulled over to the right: See 
 The Highway Code 
 , paras 60 and 67. Even at 40 to 50 km/h, he was already travelling at 37 to 46 ft/s, and a collision would have been unavoidable.
In my judgment, however, there was no taxi involved, and for some reason which has not been explained by him, the defendant lost control of the pick-up at that point, as a result of which the pick-up overturned and skidded along the road. He had only been employed by the employer for about a week before the accident, as a fitter and not as a driver, and he was only standing in as a driver that fateful morning. It would be fair to draw the inference that he was not entirely famiwith the pick-up which he was driving. Accordingly, I found that the defendant failed to discharge the burden placed on him, and was solely to blame for the accident.
The first plaintiff survived the accident, but was severely injured. First, his fourth, fifth and sixth ribs were fractured causing a right haemothorax. A chest tube which was immediately inserted on admission to hospital removed a large quantity of blood; it was removed only eight days later. Secondly, the neck of the right scapula was fractured. Thirdly, he sustained a major injury to the right brachial plexus causing total paralysis of his right upper limb. The accident occurred on 20 July 1983. On 9 March 1990, which was the last occasion on which he was medically examined before the hearing of this suit, the medical report showed that the fractures had united and he had no more problem with his chest; but the right brachial plexus injury remained a problem, because there had been no sign of any recovery and by then it could be confirmed that there would never be any recovery. The relevant part of the report of Dr WN Cheng, the orthopaedic surgeon, dated 26 March 1990 was as follows: 
 
The muscles of the right upper limb were wasted from shoulder down to fingers. There was no trophic ulcer anywhere on the skin of his right upper limb.
 
 
 
He was able to bend (flex) his right elbow from 0[deg ] to 100[deg ]. While doing this his right elbow was pulled next to the body and his right forearm supinated turning his palm to face upwards.
The fingers of the right hand including the right thumb and the wrist were completely paralysed. There was not even a flicker of movement. The right elbow was able to flex as described above. The right shoulder was also completely paralysed. Some rotational movements were seen in the scapular.
There was complete sensory loss of the upper limb from shoulder down to the fingers.
What the main injury amounted to in simple terms, as Dr Cheng explained in giving evidence, was that the first plaintiff`s right arm was now functionally useless, all the nerves serving it having been injured, and it could just as well be amputated: it need not be, if he was prepared to live with a useless arm, but even so the arm would wither away.
The first plaintiff is a Malaysian, who was born in 1960. According to him, he went to school in Malaysia in the Malay medium up to Form 2, and did not learn any English. He started working in 1976 at the age of 16 in Butterworth, frying coffee beans for two years. In 1978, he came to Singapore to work as a shop-assistant, because the wages in Singapore were about 50% higher than those in Malaysia. After about two years, he became a fitter and welder in a shipyard. He did not find the job in that shipyard to his liking, however, as he had to climb to a height to do his welding. So he left that job and went over to his new employer, Ching, a few days before the accident. At the new place of work, he was also employed as a fitter and welder, but now the welding was done in a workshop on the ground. His agreed wages with Ching were $30 per day with overtime pay of $5 per hour. On the three or four days working for Ching before the accident, he did overtime work, which made his total earnings about $40 per day. Ching had not got a work permit for him yet, as he had only worked a few days, but he expected that Ching would do so soon.
After his discharge from hospital, he was unable to work as he could not move around. After about a year, as his arm was not improving, he went back to Malaysia to see if he could get his arm treated. In Malaysia, he also could not find work. He used to be right-handed, but his right arm was now useless. He sought employment with goldsmiths and textile merchants, without success. About two years ago, he started working for his sister in her optical shop because he could not find any other work. It was a small shop which sold only frames and lenses, and with only two other employees who cut lenses and fixed them to frames. He helped his sister to look after the shop, showing frames to customers, looking after cash and so on. The other two employees were paid M$600 and M$400 respectively per month. His sister paid him M$300 per month, but she allowed him to stay above the shop, and also gave him his two meals a day.
In 
 British Transport Commission v Gourley 
 [1955] 3 All ER 796 at p 799, Earl Jowitt said: 
 
The broad general principle which should govern the assessment of damages in cases such as this is that the tribunal should award the injured party such a sum of money as will put him in the same position as he would have been in if he had not sustained injuries.
 
 
 
So far as physical injuries are concerned, legal precedents establish a cynical but reasonstandard tariff for injuries to different bones and limbs; but the assessment of loss of earnings is depenon a plaintiff`s circumstances and more often than not extends into what is no more than speculation. In the present case, the speculative possibilities were increased because, in the course of hearing, the question of illegality and its possible impact on either the liability of the defendant or the quantum of damages was raised, as the first plaintiff did not have a valid work permit at the time of the accident. As a rule of public policy, the maxim 
 ex turpi causa non oritur actio 
(no cause of action arises out of a base cause) will apply in the law of contract to prevent a plaintiff founding a claim on an illegal act or agreement. It is clear, however, that the maxim has only very limited application in tort and, in general, the fact that the plaintiff is involved in some wrongdoing does not of itself provide the defendant with a good defence:

 Jackson v 
 
 Harrison 
(1978) 19 ALR 129
 . 
 The only exceptions would appear to be the limited range of cases in which, on the facts of the case, an injury can be held to have been directly incurred in the course of the commission of a crime: 
 Godbolt

; [1980] 3 All ER 870;

 v 
 
 Hunt & Anor 
[1990] 3 All ER 344
 . 
 These decisions would also be in line with the public policy in Singapore which is reflected in the Contributory Negligence and Personal Injuries Act (Cap 54, 1989 Ed) under which a claim will not be defeated by reason of the fault of the person suffering the damage; and in the Workmen`s Compensation Act (Cap 354) which provides that a workman will not be prevented from suing for recovery of compensation even under an illegal contract.
While, therefore, the first plaintiff would not be precluded from claiming against the defendant in this case in spite of his being on his way to work without having a work permit at the time of the accident, the question has to be considered again from the point of view of the quantum of damages to which he is entitled, and in particular, whether and to what extent his illegal earnings in Singapore at the time of the accident might be used as a basis for calculating his pre-trial loss of earnings and his future loss of earnings. As to the effect of illegality on the quantum of damages to be awarded, the case law in Singapore and Malaysia is scanty and not entirely clear. In 
 Kang Bark Teng & Anor v Lee Kwee Lim & Anor 
 
 
 
[1952] MLJ 27
 
 , 
 an unlicensed pork seller was killed in a motor accident. Rogers J in the Singapore High Court, apparently without the benefit of argument or case law on the point, found the deceased`s position to be one of uncertainty, but, as the deceased had been earning $300 per month for some time, he ignored the illegality and fixed the damages for the dependants on that basis. In 
 Tan Chooi Thin & Anor v Teo Whee Hong 
 
 
 
[1953] MLJ 203
 , the deceased was a member of the crew of a motor junk and was alleged to be deriving some extra-curricular income from the illegal business of trading in precious stones in violation of customs legislation. Although there was no evidence, Buhagiar J in the Penang High Court observed obiter that, even if there was reliable evidence as to its nature, he did not think that the profits made from that business could be excluded in reckoning the deceased`s earnings. In 
 Yaakub Foong v Lai Mun Keong & Ors 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 317
 , the plaintiff who was a Malaysian citizen was run down in Johore Bahru. Liability was admitted and the only dispute was on the quantum of the plaintiff`s earnings. The pl aintiff claimed that he worked in Singapore, and admitted that he did not pay any income tax and even performed additional work in contravention of his work permit. Shankar J was of the view that, if there had been cogent evidence as to the precise amount of the tax payable by the plaintiff and of the amount which he had illegally earned in contravention of his work permit, he would have discounted the damages arithmetically due to the plaintiff on both counts.
Rogers J in 
 Kang Bark Teng 
 `s case, Buhagiar J in 
 Tan Chooi Thin 
`s case and Shankar J in 
 Yaakub Foong 
`s case have all accepted that notwithstanding illegality the plaintiff would not start from a hopeless position: by varying degrees they have all accepted that damages would be awarded even though the damages might be discounted for the 
 turpi causa 
 . Presumably, in assessing lost earnings on this basis, the court would have to take into consideration the probability and the length of time that those earnings could have continued, based on the plaintiff`s evidence that he would have continued in that occupation; that being in those cases in which illegality was capable of being legitimized he would have endeavoured to rectify the situation. The burden of proving all this must necessarily rest in each case on the plaintiff.
Miss Lee Yuk Lan, counsel for the defendant, drew my attention, however, to several cases from other common law jurisdictions in which the question of damages for loss of earnings derived from illegal employment or activity has been considered. In the Australian case of 
 Meadows v Ferguson 
[1961] VR 594
 , 
 the plaintiff sued the defendant for damages and loss suffered by him while he was a passenger in a car driven by her which ran off the road and came into collision with an electric light pole. For some ten months before the accident, the plaintiff had been employed as clerk to a bookmaker, and, but for the accident, he intended to continue working in this profession. The loss of earnings during his 12 weeks` incapacity were those which he would have received for aiding and abetting the bookmaker in his business which plainly was unlawful. As the earnings would have been derived from an illegal employment or activity, the court held that on grounds of public policy it should not recognize those earnings as affording a proper basis for the award of damages.
In 
 Burns v Edman 
 
[1970] 2 QB 541
; [1970] 1 All ER 886
 , 
 the deceased was killed in a motor accident and his wife sued under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 and the Fatal Accidents Acts 1846-1959. The evidence showed that he derived his income, to his wife`s knowledge, solely from the proceeds of crime. Crichton J decided that, because she had known, or had not succeeded in establishing that she did not know, that such money as the deceased gave her was from the proceeds of crime, she was not entitled to claim damages as his personal representative under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 on the basis that 
 ex turpi causa non oritur actio 
 applied. Under the Fatal Accidents Acts, she was claiming as a dependant and not standing in the shoes of the deceased. Nevertheless, Crichton J also refused damages under the Fatal Accidents Acts on the same basis. He thought that 
 LeBagge v Buses Ltd 
 [1958] NZLR 630 in which the New Zealand Court of Appeal held that the fact, that the deceased had earned a small proportion of his income by infringing certain regulations relevant to his trade as a milk float driver was of minimal importance, was wholly distinguishable, because in 
 Burns v Edman 
 the whole support given to the dependant flowed directly from criminal offence. He decided that on the facts and circumstances before him, the possibility that the support that the deceased might have provided in the future might not have been from criminal activities was entirely speculative and unproven to the point of impossibility, and damages could not be awarded for speculative possibilities.
In the South African case of 
 Dhlamini en`n Ander v Protea Assurance Co Ltd 
 1974 (4) SA 906(A)
 , 
 the plaintiff who was injured in a motor collision had, for some 20 years before her injury, been earning money from selling fruit as a hawker without a licence, and with the knowledge that a licence was required and that her licence had on a number of occasions been refused despite the assistance of an attorney. The damages that she claimed was for income that she would have earned illegally, but was prevented from earning. The appellate court of five judges, headed by Chief Justice Rumpff, quoted with approval from the decision in 
 Meadows v Ferguson 
 and held that because of public policy the plaintiff could not claim damages for income lost while she did not have a licence to be a hawker. The principles laid down in 
 Dhlamini 
 `s case were applied and extended in two other South African cases: 
 Booysen v Shield Insurance Co Ltd 
 1980 (3) SA 1211 (SE) and 
 MBA v Southern Insurance Association Ltd 
 1981 (1) SA 122 (Tk)
 . 
In my judgment, the assessment of the first plaintiff`s loss of earnings should be based on an estimate, however difficult and imprecise this might be, of what he would have earned in Malaysia had there been no accident to him. The immigration laws and regulations which require work permits to be obtained by foreign workers before they can work in Singapore were not designed merely to raise a little extra revenue, but to implement a basic public policy. To compensate the first plaintiff on the basis of what he might have earned by working illegally in Singapore without a valid work permit would be against public policy and wholly improper. Apart from the first plaintiff`s statement in his evidence that he expected Ching to get a work permit for him soon, there was no evidence whatsoever that an application for a work permit had been or would be made, or, indeed, that an application would necessarily be successful, if made. An examination of his passport showed that, although he made numerous visits to Singapore from 1978 to 1983, he had only been issued with a work permit for two successive three-month periods in 1980 and on all other occasions was in Singapore only on a social visit pass which prohibited employment. It would appear that he had no work permit even in his most recent job as a fitter and welder in another shipyard which he left for Ching only a few days before the accident.
In assessing what he would have earned in Malaysia had there been no accident to him, the court has to take a pragmatic approach to the problem. I have in this case discarded the pay and the other support given to him by his sister, as they appear to me to be in the nature of support by the family rather than wages in an arms-length employment which can serve as a reliable guide. Having regard to the unchallenged evidence that wages in Singapore were about 50% higher than those in Malaysia, the fact that he had little education, and the amount of wages paid by his sister to other workers in her shop, I have awarded him S$300 per month (as the Singapore dollar equivalent of the wages which he would have earned in Malaysia) for the whole of the period of about 94 months between the accident and judgment. Similarly, in calculating his future loss of earnings, I have taken the same figure of S$300 as the multiplicand and, having regard to his age, applied a multiplier of 15 years. I am aware that in such cases the court has a discretion to award the damages in a foreign currency if this is the currency which best expresses the plaintiff`s loss: 
 Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd 
 
[1976] AC 443
; [1975] 3 All ER 801; 
 The Despina R 
[1979] AC 685
; [1979] 1 All ER 421; 
 Hoffman v Sofaer 
 
[1982] 1 WLR 1350
 . 
However, as the damages are being awarded for a tort committed in Singapore and the Malaysian currency has been used only as a means of calculation, I have refrained from departing from the usual practice of the court and have continued to express the damages awarded in Singapore dollars.

The second plaintiffs were the administratrix and co-administratrix of the deceased. One of them, Ong Yan Ten, was the widow. She was 32 when he died, leaving her three children: a son born on 5 June 1974 who was in Primary Three at the time of the accident and is now in junior college; a second son born on 6 January 1977 who was then in a kindergarten and is now in Secondary Two; and a daughter born on 13 September 1979 who is now in Primary Six. Before her marriage, she had worked in a garment factory. She stopped working after her marriage, because of the children, and the family was entirely dependent on the deceased. She was now a baby sitter, earning $470 per month. She and her children live with her mother, who provided them with free accommodation and meals, but she was responsible for the children`s other expenses which came to slightly more than $400 per month.
Before the deceased worked for his present employer, Ching, he had been a foreman with a motor repair company, and then with a cable company. Because of the lapse of time, she could not remember what he earned in these earlier employments, or what he gave her. At the time of his death, he was earning a basic wage of $30 per day in Ching`s shipyard; but he also earned some considerable overtime pay, although she was not sure how much overtime he did or what the rate of overtime pay was. He was also working part-time as a hawker`s assistant for which he was paid $10 per day; the arrangement with the hawker was flexible in that he could turn up later if he had to work overtime at the shipyard. Out of his earnings, the deceased was giving her $800 per month at the time of his death. The amount had been increasing over the years and was sufficient for the needs of the family. At that time, her expenses were more than $700 per month; this figure included about $450 per month for food for the family, and she gave the court a breakdown of various other items of expenditure which, together with food, explained the figure of more than $700 per month. Some four years ago she started living with her mother. This was obviously a great help, but she was afraid that when her younger brother got married, she would not be able to continue to live with her mother any longer.
The evidence of the deceased`s part-time employment as a hawker`s assistant was broadly corroborated by the hawker, Ng Thai Cheng, who employed the deceased. He had a stall in the Boon Lay Hawker Centre, and had occasion to employ the deceased from November 1982 up to the time of his death in July 1983. He employed three assistants to help him at night, and the deceased was the second assistant. Although there was always work to be done at the stall, the deceased did not come to work every night but probably 20 to 22 times per month. On the nights that he came, the deceased would join him at his stall at about 7pm. He paid the deceased $10 for each time that he worked. He did not have to pay Central Provident Fund contributions. He also did not have a licence to employ his part-time workers, because the regulations in those days did not require this.
The agreed bundle of documents included the comptroller`s assessments of the deceased`s income for the years of assessment 1983 and 1984 which were issued after his death to the personal representatives, in this case the second plaintiffs. These assessments showed that in 1982 the deceased had a total assessable income of $13,441 as a sub-contractor; and that in 1983 (presumably for the period up to 20 July 1983 when he was killed) his income from employment was $6,775. The assets schedule under s 38(2) of the Estate Duty Act (Cap 137) attached to the grant of letters of administration to the second plaintiffs also included particulars of an HDB flat and showed that he had a Central Provident Fund account of $14,973.18. Although such evidence cannot be taken too far without further clarification, they lend some credibility to the evidence of the widow of the amounts she was receiving from him. I have discarded the possibility that the widow might remarry, not only because it is about eight years since the deceased died and she has not remarried, but also because as a general observation the remarriage of Asian widows is a rare occurrence.

The two accused were committed to stand trial in the High Court after a preliminary inquiry, for an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act) of trafficking in 21.67g of diamorphine.
When their case came on for hearing, the prosecution amended the charge by reducing the weight of the diamorphine from 21.67g to not less than 10g and not more than 15g. The amended charge reads: 
 
That you, 
(1) Lai Heng Hwa 
(2) Tiong Chwan Jeng
 
 
 
on or about 1 November 1988 at about 8.25pm at the Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet at People`s Park Complex, Singapore, in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) by selling two plastic packets of drugs containing not less than 10g and not more than 15g of diamorphine to one Ting Ming Ling, a narcotics officer of the Central Narcotics Bureau, without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
The effect of the amendment was to avoid the mandatory death penalty for trafficking in more than 15g of diamorphine. The maximum sentence on the amended charge is 30 years imprisonment and 15 strokes and the minimum sentence is 20 years imprisonment and 15 strokes.
Both accused pleaded guilty to the amended charge. They also admitted the statement of facts prepared by the prosecution and were convicted accordingly.
The statement of facts disclosed that on 26 October 1988 an undercover CNB officer, Assistant Narcotics Officer Ting Ming Ling, met the first accused who was believed to be looking for heroin buyers. The first accused told ANO Ting that his price for half a pound of heroin was $5,000. ANO Ting responded that he would accept a price of $4,500. The first accused agreed.
On 1 November 1988 the first accused made contact with ANO Ting and told him that he had the drugs and arranged to meet him at the People`s Park Complex that evening. The two accused met ANO Ting at the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant there. The first accused informed ANO Ting that the second accused was his partner who had brought the drugs into Singapore. ANO Ting asked to check the drugs. The first accused suggested that this should be done in the toilet and called the second accused who was carrying a red plastic bag, to go to the toilet with ANO Ting.
In the toilet the second accused handed the red plastic bag to ANO Ting. ANO Ting opened the bag and found that it contained two polythene packets both containing a brownish granular substance. Subsequently, they left the toilet and returned to the restaurant where ANO Ting negotiated with the first accused on the price. Eventually, ANO Ting agreed to purchase the drug. The second accused handed the red plastic bag to ANO Ting, who paid $2,000 to the first accused.
Other CNB officers moved in and arrested both the accused and seized the bag holding the two polythene packets. The two packets were sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis and were found to contain a granular substance weighing 210.4g containing not less than 21.67g of diamorphine.
The statement of facts also incorporated portions of a statement made by the second accused after his arrest. In the statement, the second accused admitted that he approached the first accused to look for heroin buyers for him and told him that his price was $200 per sachet and $4,200 for half a pound. If the first accused could sell the heroin at higher prices, he could keep the difference. On 27 October 1988, the first accused told him that he had an order of half a pound of heroin. On 30 October 1988, he (the second accused) went to Setiawan with another person and obtained a packet of heroin which he brought back to Singapore on 1 November 1988. When he told the first accused that he had the heroin, the first accused told him that he was meeting a buyer at 7.30pm that day and to get ready half a pound of heroin. The second accused agreed and packed two packets of heroin into a red plastic bag. At 7.30pm the two of them went to the Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant where the first accused spoke with a person. After they talked the first accused told him to show the drug to the person. He went to the toilet with the person who examined the heroin there. After that they returned to the restaurant, and were subsequently arrested.
Counsel for the first accused pleaded in mitigation that the first accused was a first offender. It was the second accused who suggested that he look for buyers for the drugs. Although he himself did not consume drugs, he was tempted by the opportunity to make quick money. Counsel also submitted that the first accused was entrapped by the CNB officers and that he had co-operated in the investigations after his arrest. I sentenced him to a term of 24 years imprisonment, backdated to commence from the date of his arrest, and to 15 strokes of the cane. He has not appealed against the sentence.
With regard to the second accused, the prosecution applied for two further charges to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing. The first charge was for possession of 4.15g of diamorphine at No 19 Jalan Anak Patong, Singapore, an offence under s 8(a) of the Act and the other was for consumption of morphine, an offence under s 8(b) of the Act. The second accused consented to the application, and admitted the two charges.
On his behalf, counsel pleaded in mitigation that the second accused is a first offender and that he has pleaded guilty. He was then 18 years 5 months old, and was 15 years 10 months old when the offence was committed. In the interim period of 2 years and 7 months, he has been in remand. Counsel also submitted that the first accused was the primary actor who undertook the negotiations with the undercover CNB officer on the price, place and time of the transaction, and that there was entrapment by the CNB officers. Counsel submitted that the second accused should be sentenced to undergo reformative training under s 13 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (the CPC), and that if the court was not inclined towards that, that the minimum sentence backdated to the date of arrest, should be imposed on him.
In view of the second accuseds young age at the time of the commission of the offence, I was minded to consider all the alternatives available under ss 55(1), 105 and 106 of the Children and Young Persons Act (Cap 38) (the CYPA) and s 235 of the CPC to the sentences set out for the offence by the Act if the second accused was a young person within the ambit of the CYPA, or a youthful offender under the CPC.
Section 42 of the CYPA states that a young person means a person who, in the absence of legal proof to the contrary, is, in the opinion of the court having cognisance of any case in relation to such person, 14 years of age or upwards and under the age of 16 years.
Section 2 of the CPC provides that youthful offender includes any child convicted of any offence punishable by fine or imprisonment who in the absence of legal proof to the contrary is above the age of 7 and under the age of 16 years in the opinion of the court before which the child is convicted.
It will be noted that neither definition makes clear whether the relevant age is the age at the time of commission of the offence, the time of conviction, or the time of sentencing. The words convicted of any offence in the definition of youthful offender do not imply that the relevant age is the age at the time of conviction. Those words qualify child, so that a youthful offender is a child who has been convicted of an offence. As there are no reported decisions on this issue, I directed counsel to make written submissions. At the same time, I ordered the second accused to be remanded so that a reformative training report can be prepared. The second accused was liable to reformative training whether or not he was a young person or youthful offender. The liability arises under s 13(1) of the CPC, which reads: 
 
Where a male person is convicted by the High Court or a District Court of an offence punishable with imprisonment, then if on the day of his conviction he is not less than 16 but under 21 years of age, and the Court is satisfied having regard to his character and previous conduct, and to the circumstances of the offence, that it is expedient with a view to his reformation and the prevention of crime that he should undergo a period of training in a reformative training centre, the Court may, in lieu of any other sentence, pass a sentence of reformative training.
 
 
 
There are two views on the age-and-punishment issue: The first is that the punishment regime should be determined by the circumstances of the offender, including the age of the offender at the time of commission of the offence, rather than circumstances over which he has no control, such as the time it takes for his case to be heard and for sentence to be imposed. In this regard, the fact that conviction and sentencing may be delayed by the offender claiming trial rather than pleading guilty should not be taken against him, for he is only exercising his legal rights.
The other view is that an offender should be subject to the punishment regime that fits his circumstances when he is due to be punished; that there is no reason to treat an offender as a young person or a youthful offender when he is in fact neither when he is sentenced. The court should determine the punishment against the aims of retribution, reformation, protection and deterrence on the existing circumstances of the offender.
The CYPA offers some guidance on the matter. The provisions of particular assistance are: 
 
 
(58)(1) Where, in a charge for an offence triable under this Act, it is alleged that the person by whom the offence was committed was under or had attained any specified age, and he appears to the Court to have been at the date of the commission of the alleged offence under or to have attained the specified age, as the case may be, he shall for the purposes of this Act be presumed at that date to have been under or to have attained that age, as the case may be, and any order made therein shall not be invalidated by any subsequent proof that the age has been incorrectly stated. 
 
59(1) Where a Juvenile Court is satisfied that an offence has been proved, or where the child or young person admits the facts constituting the offence, the Court shall, in addition to any other powers exercisable by virtue of this Act or any other written law for the time being in force, have power 
 
(a) to acquit and discharge the offender or to discharge him in circumstances not amounting to an acquittal; 
 
(b) to discharge the offender upon his entering into a bond to be of good behaviour and to comply with such order as may be imposed; 
 
(c) to commit the offender to the care of a relative or other fit person; 
 
(d) to order his parent or guardian to execute a bond to exercise proper care and guardianship; 
 
(e) without making any other order, or in addition to an order under paragraphs (b), (c), (d) or (h), to make a probation order placing the offender under the supervision of a probation officer or some person appointed for the purpose by the Court, for a period of not less than one year and not more than 3 years from the date of the order as may be specified therein; 
 
(f) to order the offender to be detained in a place of detention or remand home for a period not exceeding 6 months; 
 
(g) to order the offender to be sent to an approved school for a period of not less than 3 years, and not more than 5 years; 
 
(h) to order the offender to pay a fine, damages or costs; 
 
(i) where the offender is a young person and the offence is proved, or where the young person admits the facts constituting the offence, the Juvenile Court may order the offender to be sent to a Young Offenders Section, as provided i n Part VII, for such length of time as could be awarded by a District Court in respect of a term of imprisonment, if in the opinion of the Court he is of so unruly a character that he cannot be detained in a remand home, a place of detention, an approved school or an approved home, or that he is of so depraved a character that he is not a fit person to be so detained.
  
 
 
and 
 
 
(60) Subject to section 94 no person shall be detained in a remand home, place of detention, an approved school or an approved home after he has attained the age of 19 years.
  
 
 
The reference in s 58(1) to a persons age at the date of the commission of the alleged offence and the presumption that the person was at that date to have been under or to have attained that age indicate that the relevant age is the age at the time of commission.
Sections 59(1)(f) and 60, when read together, also suggest that the relevant age is the age of commission. This is because under s 59 the maximum period that an offender may be detained in a place of detention or remand home will not reach three years. If the relevant age is the age at the time of sentencing, a person will only be treated as a young person if he is below 16 on the day of sentencing; there is no possibility of him being detained at a place of detention or remand home until he is 19. There is no need for an express provision that he should not be so detained after attaining 19. The ceiling is only necessary if the relevant age is the age on the commission of the offence, whereby the person sentenced may be above 16, if he was below 16 when the offence was committed. In this situation, s 60 is necessary to ensure that he is not detained in a remand home or place of detention after he is 19.
The fixing of the age at the time of commission as the relevant age is not without its difficulties. Under s 60, an offender cannot be detained in a remand home, place of detention, approved school or approved home after he has reached 19. If a person below 16 is, for any reason, not apprehended, tried and due to be sentenced until after he is past 19, s 60 will relieve him from being detained in those institutions. It may appear paradoxical that an offender above 19 is not subject to be detained in the manner that a younger offender is liable to be. The reason may be that those institutions are not intended to cater for persons above 19.
After considering these provisions, I am of the view that the intended relevant age for determining whether a person is a child or young person under the CYPA is the age at the time of the commission of the offence. The relevant age of a youthful offender under the CPC would likewise be the age of commission of the offence.
Having arrived at this conclusion, I found on the facts before me that this is not a suitable case for me to remit to the juvenile court for sentencing under s 55(1) of the CYPA, or for me to exercise the powers of a juvenile court under s 105 of the CYPA, or to detain the second accused in a young offenders section under s 106, or to invoke s 235 of the CPC and deal with him in the manner provided by the CYPA.
In the report of the Director of Prisons submitted pursuant to s 13 of the CPC, reformative training was not recommended because the second accused is a Malaysian. If he is to be remanded at the Reformative Training Centre, he will on his release from the centre be repatriated to Malaysia, and it will not be possible for him to undergo supervision as provided by Schedule D of the CPC. As the reformative training provided by s 13 consists of two elements, detention and supervision, I found that such training is not appropriate when the second accused is not able to undergo both phases. Furthermore, reformative training is not suitable for the second accused as he has not only pleaded guilty to trafficking in diamorphine, but has also admitted the two other charges of possession of diamorphine and consumption of morphine.
In the circumstances, I sentenced the second accused to the minimum sentence prescribed by the Act of 20 years imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, and I ordered that the period of imprisonment be backdated to run from the date of arrest on 1 November 1988. The second accused is now appealing against the sentence.

ss 184 & 336(1) Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)
 
The appellant was charged with four charges of voluntarily causing grievous hurt under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), and of criminal trespass, mischief and public nuisance under ss 447, 427 and 268.
His trial was set down for 7-16 April 1992 in the subordinate courts. His counsel was subsequently assigned to a case in the High Court which he anticipated would overlap the appellant`s trial dates. Therefore he applied to have the appellant`s trial dates vacated. On 20 March 1992 this application was to have been heard but the appellant, who was then being remanded at the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre, was not produced in court by the authorities. Accordingly the hearing was adjourned to 3 April 1992.
On 3 April 1992 the appellant was produced in court but his counsel was already engaged in the High Court trial and this matter was mentioned on his behalf by another counsel, who duly applied for the trial dates to be vacated. On this occasion, however, the prosecution applied for the appellant to be discharged, such discharge not amounting to an acquittal. The counsel who was mentioning the matter raised no objections, having received no instructions as to such an application. The district judge granted the prosecution`s application. The appellant appealed against this order and contended that the discharge ought to amount to an acquittal, and in the alternative asked that the matter be reinstated and disposed of expeditiously.
The appellant`s main contention was that he was entitled to be tried and to have the charges against him disposed of finally in one way or another and that it was unjust that he should be left under indefinite apprehension of the recommencement of these criminal proceedings. I dismissed the appeal and now give my reasons for doing so.
It does not appear from the notes of evidence that any reason was given to the court on 3 April 1992 when the prosecution made its application. However, it appears from the district judge`s grounds of decision and also in the prosecution`s submissions before me that the reason for the prosecution`s application was to enable the appellant to complete a course of treatment at the Sembawang Drug Rehabilitation Centre. Undoubtedly there is some uncertainty as to what was said on that day but, in any event, this is the reason now relied upon by the prosecution to support the order for discharge not amounting to an acquittal.
Art 35(8) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore provides: 
 
The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.
 
 
 
Section 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the CPC`) provides: 
 
The Attorney-General shall be the Public Prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code.
 
 
 
When the public prosecutor (`the PP`) decides to inform the court that he will not further prosecute a defendant upon a charge, he does so in the exercise of this discretionary power vested in him by the Constitution and the CPC. There can be no suggestion that the court may interfere with the prosecutorial discretion to make such a decision.
Section 184 of the CPC provides: 
 
 
(1) At any stage of any summary trial before judgment has been delivered, the Public Prosecutor may, if he thinks fit, inform the court that he will not further prosecute the defendant upon the charge and thereupon all proceedings on the charge against the defendant shall be stayed and he shall be discharged from and of the same. 
 
(2) Such discharge shall not amount to an acquittal unless the court so directs except in cases coming under section 177.
  
 
 
Clearly, a discharge per se is no more than a mere release from particular proceedings which are being stayed. It is obvious from s 184(1) that when the PP informs the court that he will not further prosecute a defendant upon a charge, the court has no discretion as to the staying of all proceedings on that charge and as to the discharge of the defendant from and of the same. The court`s discretion arises only as a result of s 184(2), to direct whether or not such discharge shall amount to an acquittal.
The significance of the court`s discretion for these purposes is not merely that an acquittal would entitle the defendant to a plea of previous acquittal under s 239 of the CPC in the future. More immediately, where a defendant is discharged but not acquitted, the prosecution may be seen to have unconstrained licence for indefinite and possibly unconscionable delay, the cost of which will be substantially visited upon the hapless defendant.
I would gratefully adopt the reasoning of my brethren, Lai Kew Chai J in 
 K Abdul Rasheed v PP 
 1 and LP Thean J in 
 Goh Cheng Chuan v PP 
 :2 the words `unless the court so directs` in s 184(2) give the court an unfettered discretion to order that a discharge should amount to an acquittal. This discretion is unfettered in that it is subject only to the usual principles governing the exercise of judicial discretion and to the initial presumption, arising from the way s 184(2) is drafted, that in the ordinary case the order of discharge under s 184 does not amount to an acquittal.
The indefinite apprehension of criminal proceedings being recommenced is inevitable in virtually every case in which s 184 is invoked. In some cases the prosecution might allay such fears by committing itself to a deadline for such recommencement and no doubt this will be a factor affecting the exercise of the court`s discretion. However, in many cases the prosecution is not in a position to give such a commitment and, since it is not required by the statute, it would in my opinion be an unwarranted restriction of the court`s discretion to demand such an assurance. It follows that the indefinite apprehension of criminal proceedings being recommenced cannot be conclusive but is simply a factor to be weighed in the balance with all the other circumstances of the case.
In the present case, there is no reason to think that the prosecution intends to leave matters suspended indefinitely nor that it had any improper motive for making the application. On the contrary, the appellant is presently undergoing a course of treatment which in my opinion ought not to be disrupted. By virtue of the provisions of s 37 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), the period of treatment is finite. In all the circumstances of the case, I did not see fit to interfere with the order made by the learned district judge.

This was a petition for the revision of orders made by the district judge during a disposal inquiry. The inquiry, held on 16 November 1993, was consequent upon the conviction of one Purana Chandran s/o Subramaniam on 24 November 1992 for several burglaries. Purana Chandran had obtained certain items of jewellery during the course of these burglaries and had, thereafter, pledged them with the petitioners and five other shops. The items were recovered upon Purana Chandran`s arrest and formed the subject matter of the disposal inquiry.
At the disposal inquiry, there was little dispute on ownership. With the exception of the fifth petitioner, whose representative claimed ignorance about the identity of the owner, the representatives of the petitioners and the other five pawnshops did not dispute ownership. The petitioners did, however, request a payment of 50% of the pawned value of the jewellery. The district judge ordered that the jewellery be given back to the respective respondents as the owners upon the condition that a certain percentage of the pawned value be paid to each of the pawnshops involved. The petitioners obtained 10% of the pawned value on each of the items pledged by Purana Chandran at their shops. Being dissatisfied with this, the petitioners sought criminal revision of the judge`s decision. I dismissed the petition and now give my reasons.
The matter of disposal of items unlawfully pledged at pawnshops is governed by both the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) and the Pawnbrokers Act (Cap 222) (`the Act`). It is convenient at this juncture to set out the sections relevant for our purposes. Section 386(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code provides: 
 
During or at the conclusion of any inquiry or trial in any criminal court the court may make such order as it thinks fit for the disposal of any document, livestock or other property produced before it.
 
 
 
Where the item has been pawned with a pawnbroker, the situation is modified by s 31 of the Act, which provides:
 
 
(1) ... 
 
(c) If in any proceedings before a Magistrate`s Court or other court it appears to the court that any goods and chattels brought before the court have been unlawfully pawned with a pawnbroker, 
 
the court, on proof of the ownership of the goods and chattels, may, if it thinks fit, order the delivery thereof to the owner, either on payment to the pawnbroker of the amount of the loan or any part thereof, or without payment thereof or of any part thereof, as to the court, according to the conduct of the owner and the other circumstances of the case, seems just and fitting. 
 
(2) The court may also adjourn the proceedings for the attendance of the pawnbroker, and may summon the pawnbroker to attend at the adjourned hearing, and if, after hearing the pawnbroker, the court is of opinion that the pawnbroker has not exercised due care in taking in pawn any stolen property, the court may order the pawnbroker to pay a fine not exceeding $2,000.
  
 
 
Before turning to the queries raised by counsel for the petitioner, I think it appropriate to outline the court`s view on these sections. In my view, the Criminal Procedure Code envisages the disposal inquiry as a fairly informal hearing, where the presiding judicial officer is given a fair measure of discretion to `make such order as it (the court) thinks fit`. Where the items in question are articles falling within the categories defined by s 31(1)(a), (b) or (c) of the Act, the procedure is modified by s 31(1) of the Act, which highlights two issues: ownership of the pawned item, and payment to the pawnbroker. The Act, however, still entrusts a wide measure of discretion to the judicial officer. If ownership is proved, the court possesses the discretion to award the item to its owner if it thinks fit. At the same time, the statute gives the court absolute discretion to decide whether to order payment at all to the pawnbroker, and, if any is ordered, the amount of that payment. As was said by Murray-Aynsley CJ in 
 Ho York Quin v R 
:1 
 
All that need be said is that the court has the fullest discretion as to whether to make an order or not and in the order it makes, if it should decide to make one.
 
 
 
In my view, the disposal inquiry is intended to be an inexpensive and expeditious manner of distributing items produced at trial or found in the course of investigations, and the width of the judicial officer`s discretion underlines this intention. The disposal inquiry is not conclusive as to title, and, indeed, the rightful legal owner can and should assert his rights in a separate civil suit: 
 Hoh Chee Khim & Ors v PP 
. As a result, these inquiries tend to serve merely as a speedy and convenient means to rid the court of items it no longer has use or need for. Of aid in interpreting these provisions is the case of 
 Sem Hin Pawnshop v R 
, where Brown J dealt with the relevant sections of the then Pawnbrokers Ordinance (Cap 216). Regarding the first issue of ownership, he stated at p 165: 
 
The burden is on the owner to prove his ownership, and the magistrate must be satisfied that he has discharged it. In many cases, particularly when the article has been in the owner`s possession for a long time, there may be no evidence except that of the owner who will say: `that is mine. I recognize it.` 
 Such evidence will be quite sufficient if the magistrate believes it
. [
 E
mphasis added.]
 
 
 
On the second issue of payment to the pawnbroker, Brown J stated: 
 
It is at this point that the magistrate`s discretion has to be exercised. Ownership having now been proved, by common law, the owner would be entitled to the article unconditionally, however careless he had been; and the innocent pawnbroker - if he is innocent - would have to suffer without receiving any compensation for the amount of the loan which he has lost. But the section gives the magistrate a discretion to mitigate this hardship, if he thinks fit, after taking into account `the conduct of the owner and the other circumstances of the case`. In a case where the conduct of both parties is free from criticism, I cannot think of any circumstances which would cause the court to order the owner to pay a part of the loan; and the innocent pawnbroker must suffer for having taken a risk which is inseparable from his trade.
 
 
 
It is plain, then, that the court is entitled to come to a decision on ownership merely by the oral testimony of the owner that the article is his. This admittedly almost casual approach is justified by the purpose of the inquiry as a convenient method of disposing of articles which are before the court, and the court`s inability, in any case, to settle conclusively questions of title amongst competing claims. It is plain furthermore that any payment received by the pawnbroker arises out of the court`s discretionary wish to mitigate his loss. The pawnbroker is not entitled, as of right, to a sum as compensation for his loss. The risk is inherent in the business he has chosen: if the item is lawfully pawned, the pawnbroker stands to gain a large profit from his wise speculation; if it is unlawfully pawned, he must bear the loss as part and parcel of his trade. When he accepts a pawn, he has assessed the risk and chosen to take it. He cannot then complain if the deal which he has struck is later shown to be tainted.
With these considerations in mind, I turn now to deal with the two contentions counsel for the petitioners advanced before me. First, counsel for the petitioners contended that the procedure prescribed by the statute had not been followed by the district judge. He referred me to the case of 
 Lam Lock v R 
, a case on the then Pawnbrokers Ordinance. There, it was held that the magistrate should first record evidence as to ownership and the circumstances in which the article was lost and found to ascertain entitlement to possession. The court held further that the pawnbroker`s attendance should be procured and the magistrate should be satisfied that the article had been unlawfully pawned. The findings should then be recorded before the order is made. As these formalities were not complied with in that case, the case was sent for rehearing. Counsel for the petitioners contended that, in the present case, the procedure advocated by Whitley J in 
 Lam Lock v R 
 had not been observed. Commenting that the hearing given by the district judge in the present case was at best perfunctory, counsel contended that the petitioners had not been accorded sufficient opportunity to set out their claims and that the district judge failed to receive sufficient or any evidence at all before making his decision.
I found 
 Lam Lock v R 
 to be of no assistance to the petitioners. In the present case, it was known to all parties that the articles had first been stolen from their rightful owners in the course of several burglaries, and then brought to the petitioners and unlawfully pledged by the person who was convicted of those burglaries. The petitioners were present at the hearing, and they did not at any time dispute the ownership of the respondents. The district judge was entitled, as 
 Sem Hin Pawnshop v R 
 makes clear, to make a decision in favour of the respondents merely on their oral evidence and this he did. Hence counsel`s complaint that the hearing was perfunctory was misplaced; the hearing was of necessity brief owing to the scarcity of issues at hand.
Counsel for the petitioners` second ground of appeal was that the statute necessitated the court to have regard to `the conduct of the owner and the circumstances of the case` before assessing the proper amount of payment to the pawnbroker before it. Counsel contended that the district judge had not been given sufficient information in respect of these two matters and, in consequence, the assessment of 10% was an error. He cited the case of 
 Hoh Chee Khim & Ors v PP 
, a Malaysian case dealing with the (Malaysian) Pawnbrokers Enactment (Cap 85). There, the court first considered the circumstances of the pawning. In that case, two exhibits were taken from the complainant and pawned by the accused. The court held that these exhibits should be returned to the complainant as their ownership had been established and the circumstances justified it. One exhibit was pawned by the complainant herself whilst she was under the influence of the accused. This was returned to the complainant subject to the payment of the amount lent owing to the circumstances of the case. In respect of the other exhibits, ownership was not established as the accused had bought the articles which were the subject matter of the pledge with money dishonestly obtained from the complainant; as a result, the exhibits were delivered to the pawnbrokers. Counsel thus argued that all the parties at the disposal inquiry should have been provided with at least a statement of facts and the notes of evidence of the case in which Purana Chandran was convicted. He contended that if the district judge had cognizance of the circumstances of each burglary, whether each of the owners was negligent, whether the petitioners had reason to suspect that the goods were stolen wares, whether they were informed by the police that these were stolen wares, and so forth, he might have ordered payments to the petitioners on different terms.
I thought it highly impracticable to lay down the requirement, in all such inquiries, for the court to unearth the details of every transaction. Suffice it to say that, in the present case, there was sufficient evidence of the circumstances for the district judge to exercise his discretion. The items were obtained by Purana Chandran in the course of several burglaries and pledged with the petitioners. The facts were far removed from those of the case of 
 Hoh Chee Khim & Ors v PP 
, for Purana Chandran had himself unlawfully pledged these articles and the respondents in the present case could lay direct claims to the pledged articles. No doubt there existed a possibility, or even probability, that each of the respondents had been negligent in keeping their belongings. They were nonetheless the owners and, as such, their right to the items was indisputable. As Brown J pointed out in 
 Sem Hin Pawnshop v R, 
 by common law, the owner is entitled to possession of the article without any payment or compensation. Section 31(1) of the Act allows the district judge the discretion to mitigate the pawnbroker`s loss to a degree if he is minded to do so. However, if a pawnbroker is not awarded the amount he has requested, this is not because he has exhibited signs of misbehaviour; neither is it because the court suspects him of colluding with the person who unlawfully pledged the item. The result merely arises from the nature of his business and his understanding, on his acceptance of a pledge, that, if the pledge were later shown to be unlawful, he would obtain only a paltry sum, if any at all. Hence, in the usual case, it is unhelpful and unrealistic to go into an in-depth examination of the facts. If there are especial circumstances which justify a larger payment, for instance, if the owner conspired with the pledgor to exercise fraud upon the pledgee, then the onus is surely on the pawnbroker himself to raise and establish the exceptional circumstances as these facts would be within his own knowledge. There would be a waste of precious judicial time if in every case the district judge is forced to look to a plethora of evidence to ascertain the history and surrounding circumstances of every pendant, ring, necklace, watch or bangle that he has to distribute at the end of a trial.
In the present case, the essence of the petitioners` complaint was that they felt the 10% compensation given by the district judge to be too low. In deciding upon this figure, however, the district judge was exercising his discretion within the bounds prescribed by Parliament. As this was not a criminal case or matter, no appeal was available to the petitioners (
 Sofjan & Anor v PP 
, 
 Chan Mei Lan v PP 
), and it was for this reason that the case came before me by way of criminal revision. It bears repeating that the disposal inquiry was intended by the legislators to be inexpensive and expeditious in character. No doubt the legislators also surmised that finality of proceedings would further their purpose. In my view, therefore, a court ought to be slow to exercise its revisionary jurisdiction in cases like the present.

The appellant was tried and convicted of the following charge: 
 
You, Maniam s/o Rathinswamy, are charged that you between 2.30pm on 29 November 1992 and 7.30am on 30 November 1992 in a room at No 7 Mandalay Road, Singapore, together with one SS Asokan and in furtherance of the common intention of you both, did commit murder by causing the death of one Tan Heng Hong, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
Against the conviction this appeal was brought, and at the conclusion of the hearing we dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
The material facts which were established at the trial were these. At about 7am on 30 November 1992, a white Nissan Coupe was found badly burnt at Lorong Lada Hitam off Mandai Road. Police later discovered some charred skeletal remains in the boot of the car, which were subsequently identified to be those of a human body. The skeletal remains were taken to the mortuary and were later identified to be those of one Tan Heng Hong (`Ah Hong`). It was not in dispute that the skeletal remains were those of Ah Hong.
The appellant was arrested by the police on 6 January 1993 at about 8.15am at the security counter of Tan Tock Seng Hospital (`TTSH`). At the material time he was employed by ALSA Security Agency and was posted to work as the security supervisor at TTSH. He was on permanent night shift. On Saturday, 28 November 1992 he reported for duty at 7pm and worked throughout the whole of Sunday and went off duty at 7am on Monday, 30 November 1992.
Shortly after his arrest on 6 January 1993, the appellant made a statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (`the s 122(6) statement`). The voluntariness of this statement was not in dispute, and accordingly the statement was admitted in evidence. In that statement, the appellant said that he did not have the intention to commit the offence and that he was forced by his friend, Asokan, to do it. The material part of his statement was as follows: 
 
I have no grudge against `Ah Hong`. Asokan told me that he will bring Ah Hong to 7 Mandalay Rd on 29 November 1992. He asked me to sit at the office at 7 Mandalay Road at Tan Tock Seng Hospital to speak to Ah Hong. He said that after talking to Ah Hong, he will leave the place. On 29 November 1992 morning, Asokan called me and asked me to meet him at 7 Mandalay Rd at 1pm. He told me that he will bring an axe and a knife and keep in the office first. After that he will leave and return with Ah Hong. I was told to wait for him at 3pm.
 
 
 
On the same day at about 3.30pm, I waited for Asokan and Ah Hong at 7 Mandalay Road. Later Asokan and Ah Hong arrived in a white car driven by Ah Hong. I then opened the door to the room and Asokan and Ah Hong went inside with me. Ah Hong and I set [at] a table. We were facing each other. Asokan was standing beside Ah Hong. As I was talking to Ah Hong, Asokan said that he wanted to go and smoke and he walked away. I asked Ah Hong whether he wanted to buy gold from Asokan. Ah Hong asked me what type of gold. I told him that it was normal gold. He said that he wanted to see the gold. I told him that I will arrange the gold for him to see. He said okay.
Suddenly, Asokan came and hit Ah Hong with the axe from behind. I was shocked and panic (sic). Ah Hong fell to the ground and he stood up again. I saw Asokan hit Ah Hong on the head and neck with the axe several times. Asokan then asked me to take the knife from the table drawer and hit him. I pulled out the drawer and took out a knife. Asokan asked me to hit Ah Hong with the knife. I said I don`t want to do. He even asked me to hit him with the axe. Ah Hong was lying on the floor. Asokan then said that either I die or he die. We argued and Asokan walked towards me. He asked me to hit Ah Hong. He said that if Ah Hong don`t die, both of us will be hanged. I walked towards Ah Hong who was already lying on the floor. I stabbed Ah Hong twice on the stomach with the knife. I saw Ah Hong was still moving. Afterward, he stopped moving. I took Ah Hong`s Rolex watch and three rings. I saw Asokan took Ah Hong`s gold bracelet, pager and handphone. I asked Asokan what he wanted to do with the body and he asked me to wait for him and he went out. A while later, he returned with a black coloured long wallet. Asokan gave me cash $1,000. There were a lot of blood on the floor. Asokan told me to leave the body there and lock up the place. He will return later.
He also narrated how he assisted Asokan in carrying Ah Hong`s body and placing it in the car boot. He further said that two days later, Asokan approached him and enquired of the Rolex watch which he had taken from Ah Hong. He gave it to Asokan who sold it and gave him, the appellant, $400. He himself pawned the three gold rings, which he took from Ah Hong, at the pawnshop at Serangoon Road for $400.
On 7 January 1993 at about 3pm, the appellant led the police to Thai Chong Pawnshop at No 74 Serangoon Road to recover the three gold rings. Later, he led the police to the car park situated at the rear of the Administration Building of TTSH at No 7 Mandalay Road; there he pointed to a spot on the ground between the building and the car park where he said that he had buried a Dupont lighter and a gold Dupont pen belonging to Ah Hong. However, when the police dug up that area, nothing was found. He then led the police to the Administration Building of TTSH where he pointed out the following to them:
 
 
(a) the parking lot in the car park directly in front of the main entrance where Ah Hong had parked his white car; 
 
(b) the main entrance where he waited for Asokan and Ah Hong; 
 
(c) the dining room where Ah Hong, Asokan and the appellant were in on the afternoon of 29 November 1992; 
 
(d) the long table in front of which they sat; 
 
(e) the red chair where Ah Hong was seated when Asokan hit him with the axe and the red chair opposite where the appellant sat; 
 
(f) the spot on the right side of Ah Hong`s chair where Asokan stood; 
 
(g) the spot beside the cabinet where Ah Hong lay after the attack; 
 
(h) the tar road behind the back door where Asokan parked Ah Hong`s car which he drove from the main entrance car park; 
 
(i) the top of the kitchen cabinet where Asokan had placed the axe on 29 November 1992; 
 
(j) the table drawer where the appellant had kept the knife; and 
 
(k) the parking lot where Asokan parked Ah Hong`s car after they put Ah Hong`s body inside the boot.
  
 
 
On 12 January 1993, the appellant made a long statement to the police under s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The voluntariness of that statement was also not disputed and the statement was admitted in evidence. In this long statement, he repeated much of what he had said in the s 122(6) statement but in greater detail, and also provided a great deal of background information. He narrated how he first met Asokan and how their friendship developed. He said that it was Asokan who first introduced him to Ah Hong at a dinner in 1992 and that was the only time, prior to 29 November 1992, that he met Ah Hong. Three days before the incident, Asokan spoke to him about a loan from Ah Hong with the appellant as a guarantor; but subsequently, on 28 November 1992, Asokan informed him that he would no longer be required as a guarantor. Asokan then told him that he (Asokan) had secured a very good business deal involving gold and requested the appellant to tell Ah Hong that he too had good business contacts in gold. Thus, according to the appellant, when Asokan brought Ah Hong to see him on Sunday, 29 November 1992, he understood the meeting to be in relation to this gold deal. He continued as follows:
 
 
(11) On the same morning [ie Sunday, 29 November], before noon, I received a call from Asokan. He told me that he is coming down to see me. He asked me to meet him at 7 Mandalay Road at about 11am plus. About 20 minutes later, I took the key to the Administration Hospital at 7 Mandalay Road and walked over there. On my arrival, I saw the security guard Ong Teck Lee on duty at the car park behind the rear door of the building. I told Ong Teck Lee that I will take over his duty and I asked him to return to the security counter. After he had left, I waited for Asokan at the main entrance of the building. 
 
(12) Sometime past 12pm [on Sunday, 29 November], Asokan arrived and I saw him carrying a plastic bag in his hands. I then opened the main door with the key and both of us entered the building. We walked to the dining room behind the printing room. Whilst we were inside the room, Asokan took out one axe and a knife and placed them on the table. I asked him the purpose of bringing the weapons. He said that in case anything were to happen, he will use the axe and that I will use the knife to stab Ah Hong. He then asked me to keep the knife in the drawer of the table. I then kept the knife in the drawer. He said that he will use the axe himself and he placed it on top of the kitchen cabinet. After this, we left the building and I locked up the main door again. He told me that he will call me again to confirm the time of his arrival with Ah Hong. Asokan told me that he was going to meet Ah Hong and I returned to my security office at the main block of Tan Tock Seng Hospital.
  
 
 
He then continued with his narration of the subsequent events that day: that Asokan called him later and informed him of the time Asokan and Ah Hong would arrive; that they came in a car driven by Ah Hong; that he led them to the dining room of the Administration Building, and that inside the room he discussed the sale of gold with Ah Hong. He then proceeded to give an account of how Asokan without warning struck and killed Ah Hong:
 
 
(14) Whilst in the midst of our conversation, I saw Asokan walked away to the nearby cabinet. All of a sudden, Asokan returned and stood behind Ah Hong holding the axe in his right hand. He raised his right hand and slashed Ah Hong`s head with the axe once. Ah Hong tried to get up and at the same time, turned to look behind. Asokan again slashed him on the head with the axe. He stood up and walked a few steps behind and fell to the ground facing downward. I noticed that there were blood flowing out from his head. 
 
(15) At this juncture, I stood up and walked towards Asokan. I saw him bending down and slashed Ah Hong`s head with the axe again. After this, Ah Hong turned around and looked upwards. Asokan gave me the axe and asked me to slash Ah Hong but I refused to hit Ah Hong. He said that if I refused, both of us will have problems. I did not answer him and kept quiet. Asokan said that I could either use the axe or the knife to hit him. Asokan was aggressive and out of fear, I said that I will use the knife to stab Ah Hong in order to satisfy him. I walked to the table where I sat earlier and opened the left drawer. I took out the knife with my right hand. I cannot remember whether the sheath was still attached to the blade or not. I walked back to where Ah Hong was lying and knelt on his left. I then stabbed him once with the knife in the stomach. However, the blade did not penetrate into the body. Asokan asked me to stab again and I did what he said. This time, the blade penetrated halfway into his stomach. After this, I pulled out the knife and stood up. I noticed that Ah Hong`s body was still moving slightly. Asokan and I turned Ah Hong`s body facing downwards. After this, Asokan bend down and slashed Ah Hong`s neck with the axe again.
  
 
 
The appellant went on in his statement to describe how he and Asokan searched Ah Hong and took away the valuables and cash and shared them. He said that Asokan then went to Ah Hong`s car and returned with a long black wallet and shared the money equally with the appellant, each receiving about $1,000. He then locked the door to the dining room. They both left the Administration Building and Asokan went to collect some cloth. The appellant received a call sometime at about 8pm from Asokan and later met Asokan at the main entrance to the Administration Building. Asokan brought a plastic bag with him and left it in the dining room. Sometime past midnight on 30 December 1992, Asokan returned and he went with Asokan to the dining room in the Administration Block, and both of them wrapped Ah Hong`s body with some black cloth which they took from the plastic bag brought there earlier by Asokan. Asokan then drove Ah Hong`s car to an exit to the Administration Building and removed the speakers and other items from the boot. Both the appellant and Asokan then carried Ah Hong`s body and placed it in the car boot. They decided that the best way was to burn the whole car including Ah Hong`s body so that they would not leave any trace of evidence against them. The appellant suggested to Asokan that they should burn the car and the body in Mandai as he knew the place well. Asokan agreed and said that he too knew the place well. Asokan said that he would get someone to drive the car to Mandai and asked the appellant to return to work. Accordingly, the appellant returned to the counter.
The appellant further said that Asokan subsequently called the appellant and informed him that he had driven the car to Mandai, and that their plan had been carried out. Asokan then returned to meet the appellant at TTSH where they both washed away the blood stains on the floor, chairs and walls of the dining room with soap powder and water. Thereafter, Asokan left the place while the appellant returned to work.
Prof Chao Tzee Cheng gave evidence as to the cause of death. His opinion, which was not disputed, was that the death of Ah Hong occurred prior to the burning of the body in the car. He gave two reasons in support. First, he said that in the case of death by fire, a person who is alive when the fire starts will inhale carbon monoxide which will show a pinkish colour in the blood, blood vessels and muscles. In the present case, muscles found in the remains were brownish indicating that Ah Hong was only burnt after he was dead. Secondly, Prof Chao said that if a person is burnt while he is alive, the inhalation of soot created by the fire will result in soot deposits on the palate. In the present case, when the exposed charred tongue was removed, no soot deposit was found on the palate.
Prof Chao also testified that from the photographs produced the blood patterns on the wall of the dining room at No 7 Mandalay Road, where Ah Hong was killed, indicated that they had been caused by arterial bleeding. The pattern of the blood splashes indicated that the deceased was in an upright position and had been slashed in the neck region where the carotid artery had been cut. According to Prof Chao, death would have ensued in about five minutes.
Asokan was not available to give evidence as he was, and still is, in Malaysia facing a charge of armed robbery.
The appellant gave evidence in his defence. His evidence on the main events occurring on 29 to 30 November 1992 was substantially what he had said in the statements to the police. In relation to the alleged gold deal, the appellant maintained that Asokan had asked him to pose as a seller. He admitted that he knew nothing about gold and did not ask Asokan about the price of gold since according to Asokan, he had spoken with Ah Hong and Ah Hong would not be asking about the price. He was to say that he would sell three to four `biscuits` of gold to Ah Hong. The appellant said that for his role in this gold deal, Asokan promised him a commission of $2,000-$3,000.
The appellant explained the purpose of Asokan`s bringing the weapons into the dining room. He did ask Asokan why the weapons were necessary and was told by Asokan that Ah Hong was a member of a secret society, that he would come armed with a knife and with two or three others, and that the axe and the knife were necessary for their own defence. The appellant further said that when he persisted in asking Asokan about the weapons, Asokan said: `Look here, we are only going to have a deal; we are not here to fight or anything else. Don`t worry; I just brought this; we are not going to use it`.
On how Ah Hong met his death, he said that when he was engaged in a conversation with Ah Hong about the sale of gold, Asokan who was standing beside Ah Hong, disappeared. He next saw Asokan all of a sudden walking back to the table very fast and gave a violent blow with the axe on the back of Ah Hong`s head. On receiving this blow, Ah Hong tried to get up from the chair, and when he did Asokan gave him a second blow with the axe (with the same force), also at the back, somewhere near the neck. This time Ah Hong got up and fell against the wall and then fell on the floor. The appellant continued in his evidence thus: 
 
... I was standing there looking at Asokan and thinking to myself, `What sin have I done to you`. Asokan came near to me. He handed me the axe. I refused to accept the axe. When he gave me the axe, he said: `You also give a blow`. He gave the axe again. He said in an angry tone: `If you don`t give a blow, there is going to be a big problem between you and me here`. I told him: `There is nothing between me and Ah Hong. Do not unnecessarily put me in trouble`. He said: `Don`t talk much. I say for the last time. Are you going to take the axe or the knife? Which one you want?` I told him: `I don`t want any of them, as long as you leave me out is enough.` Asokan said: `If I leave you, you will identify me to the police as the one who did it. There is no point to talk to you further. You also do it.` Asokan gave me the knife. ... He told me: `Take the knife from the drawer and stab him`. I then took the knife from the drawer which was in front of me, where I had earlier been seated. I then walked round the table to where Ah Hong was lying on the ground near the wall shown in P88. I went and knelt beside him. Asokan then said: `Stab him with the knife.` I turned my head to the back. I did not see the body of Ah Hong. I slashed my hand side ways. The knife knocked the body. Asokan did not like what I was doing. He said: `Look at him and do it. Stab him properly.` This time I looked at the body and plunged the knife downwards on the stomach of Ah Hong once. The knife did not go in completely. At that time Ah Hong was still alive.
 
 
 
After this Asokan gave a blow with the axe on the neck of Ah Hong. I saw Ah Hong. His body was moving a little. He was breathing. Later, he stopped breathing.
The appellant then gave an account of what transpired thereafter. He and Asokan removed the valuables from the body of Ah Hong; he shared the moneys which Asokan had taken from Ah Hong`s wallet in the latter`s car; he kept the body of Ah Hong hidden and locked in the dining room for several hours; he suggested to Asokan to have the car with the body burnt in Mandai; he assisted Asokan to put the body in the boot of the car; after that, together they washed the bloodstains on the floor, chairs and walls of the dining room with soap powder and water; and finally, they shared the loot.
The trial judge having reconsidered the law of common intention as laid down by the Privy Council in 
 Barendra Kumar Ghosh v Emperor 
1 and 
 Nazir v Emperor 
 made his findings as follows: 
 
Turning to the present case, the evidence I have set out in these grounds of decision amply shows that Ah Hong suffered a horrible death in the hands of Asokan and the accused. There was, in my view, overwhelming evidence of common intention on the part of both of them to murder Ah Hong.
 
 
 
On the law on common intention I have stated, it mattered not that it was not the accused who dealt Ah Hong the fatal injury. So long as his and Asokan`s acts were all done in furtherance of a common intention to commit murder, that was sufficient for the accused to be found guilty of murder. And here, on the items of evidence I have summarized, the acts of the accused and Asokan, their acts before, during and after the death of Ah Hong proved beyond reasonable doubt the common intention on the part of both of them to commit murder.
The appeal before us centred around the issue of common intention as determined by the trial judge. It was submitted by counsel for the appellant that the trial judge had erred in holding that there was a common intention between the appellant and Asokan to murder Ah Hong. Counsel submitted that the trial judge had failed to give any weight or sufficient weight to the numerous exculpatory parts of the evidence of the appellant given at the trial and in the two statements to the police. Counsel relied on the following:
 
 
(1) The appellant was told by Asokan that the latter was arranging a business deal with Ah Hong. Asokan enlisted the help of the appellant to pose as a seller of gold and to gain access to the premises at TTSH and Asokan promised to pay the appellant a sum between $2,000 and $3,000 as commission for the assistance and the appellant agreed to that as he was in need of money. The only inference that could be drawn from this was that the appellant did not have any knowledge of Asokan`s intention. 
 
(2) The appellant did not know that Asokan was going to bring the weapons and had he known he would not have agreed to the deal. When the weapons were brought, he was told by Asokan that the weapons were there for their protection, as Ah Hong was a member of a secret society and might come with other men armed with weapons. Hence, in the appellant`s mind, that was the only purpose for the weapons. Further, Asokan had assured him that they would be having a business deal with Ah Hong, and although he had brought the weapons, they would not be used. 
 
(3) It was not disputed that the fatal injury was caused solely by Asokan and that was the first injury. The intention to cause that fatal injury was solely held by Asokan and was not shared by the appellant. The attack on Ah Hong was sudden and without any prior knowledge of the appellant. The appellant twice rejected Asokan`s call to strike Ah Hong with the axe and he was threatened by Asokan who was aggressive and angry when the appellant refused. As a result of the threat and pressure from Asokan, he stabbed Ah Hong with the knife and that was carried out in a feeble manner. The reasonable inference from this was that the appellant was afraid and acted under duress, and the reason for Asokan insisting on the appellant inflicting injury on Ah Hong was to make the appellant a party to the murder so that he would not report Asokan to the authority. 
 
(4) The conduct of the appellant after the killing of Ah Hong was that of a person trying to cover up an offence and did not suggest that he was in cahoots with Asokan. The disposal of Ah Hong`s body took place only hours after the incident and that was indicative that there was no pre-concerted plan between the two to commit murder.
  
 
 
All this evidence, it was submitted, reflected the state of mind of the appellant and negatived any inference of an intention on the part of the appellant to kill Ah Hong; counsel reiterated that the intention to kill was solely held by Asokan.
We were unable to accept these submissions. The submissions were premised entirely on the exculpatory parts of the appellant`s evidence. It was clear to us that the trial judge did not accept these exculpatory parts of the evidence of the appellant. The trial judge having seen and heard the appellant found him untruthful and disbelieved him. The trial judge as the decider of facts having considered the whole of the evidence was justified in disbelieving him, and he arrived at the following conclusion: 
 
As for the evidence of the accused, I rejected the allegations he made in the recording of his long statement, for they were made by a desperate man in the witness box to exculpate himself. As regards the part he played which resulted in the death of Ah Hong, the account he gave was simply a ludicrous one and I altogether disbelieved him. In any event, his evidence in court was materially different from what he had told the IO in his long statement. In short, my assessment of the accused was that he was a callous and stubborn liar. I was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he and Asokan had in furtherance of the common intention of them both committed murder of Ah Hong.
 
 
 
In the context of the judgment, it was clear to us that this was said with reference to the exculpatory parts of the evidence of the appellant.
The trial judge had called the appellant a `callous and stubborn liar`. True it is that lies alone are not evidence of the appellant`s guilt, but we need hardly say that lies of an accused on a material issue are relevant when the court comes to consider the credibility and veracity of his evidence. In this case, the trial judge, in our opinion, was not relying on the lies the appellant told - whether in court or in the statements - as evidence of his guilt. The trial judge`s reference to those lies was plainly in relation to his evaluation of the appellant`s evidence and the rejection of the exculpatory parts of the appellant`s evidence.
In considering the evidence, we found, as did the trial judge, that, quite apart from the lies the appellant told, the exculpatory parts of the appellant`s evidence with regard to the part he played in the killing of Ah Hong were also simply ludicrous, and, in our judgment, defied belief. First, if the meeting with Ah Hong was intended to discuss a gold deal, there was no reason why such discussion should be conducted in such a surreptitious manner in the dining room of the Administration Building on a Sunday afternoon and why the appellant, who was on the night shift from the previous evening should continue to be on duty that day and relieve the security guard, Ong Teck Lee, from duty at the car park behind the Administration Building just before Asokan arrived. Secondly, again if the discussion was really on a gold deal with Ah Hong, there was no reason for Asokan to bring along earlier to the dining room two deadly weapons. Thirdly, on seeing Asokan suddenly attacking Ah Hong from behind with an axe without any apparent cause, there was no reason why the appellant could not have intervened and prevented Ah Hong from being so attacked or from being attacked further; after all, the appellant himself was seated opposite to Ah Hong and was a security guard himself. Fourthly, if he was so frightened or panic-stricken as he appeared to say he was, it is extremely odd and inexplicable that he could so readily and without any bidding from Asokan participate in searching Ah Hong`s body and removing the deceased`s valuables, and also shared the moneys from Ah Hong`s wallet which Asokan took from the car. Such conduct was wholly inconsistent with that of an innocent frightened bystander who saw a man being viciously and mercilessly hacked to death with an axe. There was also his subsequent conduct, namely: assisting Asokan to dispose of Ah Hong`s body, suggesting that the car including the body should be burned at a place in Mandai and sharing with Asokan the sale proceeds from the sale of the Rolex watch of Ah Hong. Lastly, his explanation for participating in stabbing Ah Hong was that he was pressurized to do so by the threats of Asokan who was very aggressive and angry and that he did so under duress. Having regard to the fact that he was an experienced and senior security guard - he was a security guard supervisor - and also his conduct or behaviour both before and after the killing of Ah Hong, such an explanation could only be considered as preposterous and was wholly incredible.
In our judgment, the trial judge applied correctly the law of common intention to the facts proved before him. In this case, there was no direct evidence of any common intention, but like in most cases, the common intention here was a matter of inference from the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the appellant before, during and after the killing of Ah Hong. In our judgment, there was ample evidence of primary facts to found an inference of a common intention to kill Ah Hong. It is sufficient to recount briefly the following:
 
 
(a) There was a pre-arranged plan between him and Asokan that the latter was to lure Ah Hong to the premises of TTSH and that the appellant was to wait for them at the rear entrance of the Administration Building and to lead them to the dining room. 
 
(b) The appellant was the security guard supervisor of TTSH and he sent away the security guard, Ong Teck Lee, who was on duty at the car park behind the rear entrance to the Administration Building a short while before Asokan arrived to meet the appellant. 
 
(c) Prior to the meeting with Ah Hong, Asokan had brought along an axe and a knife, and the appellant kept the knife in the drawer while Asokan kept the axe on top of the cabinet. 
 
(d) The appellant met both Asokan and Ah Hong when they arrived at the car park at the rear entrance and led them to the dining room in the Administration Building where he knew the deadly weapons were kept. 
 
(e) He engaged Ah Hong in a conversation whilst Asokan armed himself with the axe. 
 
(f) The appellant was present when Asokan struck Ah Hong with the axe, and participated in stabbing Ah Hong twice while the latter was lying on the floor. 
 
(g) While Ah Hong was lying motionless on the floor after being attacked, both the appellant and Asokan searched his body and removed all the valuables from Ah Hong. 
 
(h) The appellant shared with Asokan the moneys the latter had taken from Ah Hong`s wallet from the car. 
 
(i) The appellant kept the body of Ah Hong hidden and locked in the dining room for several hours. 
 
(j) Both the appellant and Asokan worked in concert to dispose of Ah Hong`s body; the plan to burn the car with the body in Mandai was hatched by the appellant himself and executed by Asokan. 
 
(k) The appellant and Asokan washed the blood stains on the chairs, wall and floor of dining room with soap powder and water. 
 
(l) Finally, the appellant shared the loot with Asokan.
  
 
 
In our judgment, on the basis of all these facts, the inference that the appellant and Asokan had the common intention to kill Ah Hong was irresistible, and we could not see what other probable inference that could be drawn.
We are in entire agreement with the trial judge`s finding that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant and Asokan had in furtherance of a common intention of both of them committed the murder of Ah Hong. We accordingly dismissed the appeal.

The appellant was charged in the High Court as follows: 
 
You, Lim Choon Chye, are charged that you on or about 7 July 1992 between 5.42pm and 5.50pm at Block 188, Boon Lay Drive #10-298, Singapore, did traffic in, by offering to sell, give, distribute or deliver, a controlled drug specified in Class `A` of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) to wit, 164 packets and 1 straw of substance containing not less than 1728.87g of diamorphine, which were in your possession at the said premises without any authorization under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you have thereby, by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, committed an offence under s 5(a) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185).
 
 
 
At the close of the prosecution case, the learned trial judge found that a prima facie case had been established against the appellant in respect of the above charge. On being called to enter upon his defence, the appellant elected to testify. The learned trial judge held at the conclusion of the trial that the charge had been proved against him beyond a reasonable doubt and accordingly convicted him. He appealed against the conviction. Having heard submissions from appellant`s counsel we dismissed the appeal and now give our reasons.
 The facts
The facts of the case are as follows. On 7 July 1992 a group of six reservist officers from the Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary were on an anti-crime foot patrol in the vicinity of Blocks 185 to 191, Boon Lay Drive. At about 5.05pm, two of the officers, VC Low Swee Hua (`VC Low`) and SC Bohari bin Mahat (`SC Bohari`), observed the appellant walking across the car park between Blocks 185 and 187, together with another male Chinese. VC Low and SC Bohari testified at trial that the appellant walked towards the main road while the other male Chinese proceeded to a green car parked in the car park. He was seen taking a bag from the front passenger seat of the car, after which he walked towards the main road where the appellant was standing. The two men then walked away and were lost to sight. However the male Chinese returned to the car park moments later, no longer carrying the bag he had taken from the green car. He was stopped by SC Oh Tiong Beng (`SC Oh`) and identified as one Ong Boon Tee. After they had recorded his particulars, the officers released him.
In the meantime VC Low and SC Bohari had caught sight of the appellant again, this time at the corner of Block 188. On spotting the officers, the appellant turned back towards Block 188 with a haste that aroused the suspicions of the officers. They informed SC Oh and also VC Sagayadas s/o Thomas (`VC Sagayadas`) who trailed the appellant to flat #10-298 on the tenth floor of Block 188. The appellant was inside the rear room of the flat, next to a cupboard in the room. When directed by SC Oh and VC Sagayadas to come out of the room, he did so only after some delay and while the officers were checking his particulars with their Operations Room, he suddenly bolted. He was finally arrested on the ground floor of Block 188 after a brief but violent struggle.
Upon the appellant`s arrest, the following items were recovered from the rear room of flat #10-298: a total of 164 packets and one straw containing a powdery/granular substance; a dark blue bag; empty plastic sachets of different sizes; four match boxes; a box of candles; a glass bottle with some papers; a pen knife; and a plastic spoon. The powdery/granular substance found in the packets and in the straw was subsequently discovered upon analysis to be diamorphine. As for the items such as the plastic sachets and the match boxes, evidence was led by the prosecution at trial to demonstrate that these items constituted paraphernalia connected with drug trafficking activities.
The prosecution also adduced evidence at trial from the owners of flat #10-298, one Keow Chye @ Chin Swee Sang (`Keow`) and his wife Lim Ah Kian (`Lim`). They testified that they had rented the rear room of the flat to the appellant and that he had taken possession of it on 1 July 1992. Neither Keow nor Lim knew what the appellant did in the rear room. Both stated that they and their other family members did not enter the rear room after it had been rented out to the appellant.
The prosecution further relied on two statements made by the appellant pursuant to s 121(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (CPC), one on 17 July 1992 (P106) and the other on 18 July 1992 (P107). The appellant contended that the statements were inadmissible, having been made only as a result of various threats and inducements issued to him by the investigating officer and the interrogating officers. The learned trial judge, following a voir dire, admitted both statements as part of the prosecution evidence.
The relevant extracts from P106 ran as follows:
 
 
(20) : During one of the transactions with Ah Boon earlier on, he told me to look for a rented room in the vicinity of Jurong as this was the place Ah Boon operated ... So on 10 June 1992 I responded to an advertisement for renting a room at Blk 188 Boon Lay Drive ... Miss Fui Lin called me and informed me that the flat occupants were (
 sic 
) be in and I could view the room. 
 
(21) : At about 7.45 on that night ... we met a couple and they showed me the rear room which was empty. I was told the rent for the room was $300 per month. I paid a deposit of $100 on that night and told the couple that I would be shifting in the next night. 
 
(22) : On 1 July 1992 ... I went to Blk 188 Boon Lay Drive #10-298 and the couple gave me three keys ... for the iron gate, main door and my room door. I paid an advance of two months` rent ...
  
 
 
In P107 the appellant went on to describe the items which he shifted into the rear room on 2 July 1992:
 
 
(23) : On 2 July 1992 at about 2.30pm I engaged a house remover service to shift my things from the room at Geylang to the new rented flat at Blk 188 Boon Lay Drive #10-298. I paid $50 for the service. The things removed from the store at Geylang were one wooden cupboard with five doors and a small fridge. There was a set of keys for each shelf door. I locked up the second and third shelf doors and kept the keys in my possession. Inside the two shelves were a total of 13 paper bundles of heroin (one pound packing); 7 paper bundles of heroin (half a pound packing); 133 sachets of heroin (7.5 gm); one loose packet of heroin and a long straw of heroin. The last two items were usually used as a sample during the negotiation for a drug deal. The half a pound packing was converted by me under the instruction of Ah Boon just in case some buyers wished to buy half pound of heroin. 
 
(24) : The items were placed in the rear room of Blk 188 Boon Lay Drive #10-298 without the knowledge of the flat occupants. After which I locked the second shelf placed the keys to it inside the third shelf and locked it. I kept the third shelf keys together with the bunch of keys to the said flat as given earlier by the flat`s owner on 1 July 1992.
  
 
 
The remaining paragraphs of P107 elaborated on the appellant`s meeting with Ah Boon on 7 July 1992, this apparently being the male Chinese the officers had seen him with on that day. The appellant stated that he had met Ah Boon upon the latter`s instructions, at about 5pm on 7 July 1992 at Boon Lay Theatre. He described how they had walked across the car park between Blocks 185 and 186 and how Ah Boon had subsequently handed to him a dark blue bag which he told the appellant contained $500 as the appellant`s commission. The appellant returned to flat #10-298 where (in his own words) he `
 used the key to open the third shelf door of the cupboard and placed the ten paper bundles inside it 
`. Having done this, he took the said $500 and left the room, bringing along with him a file folder and a handphone. Upon walking downstairs however, he saw a group of police officers, which led him to turn back to flat #10-298 in the hope of avoiding them. He went back to the rear room of the flat but it transpired that the officers had followed him and he had to come out of the room when they shouted at him to do so. The appellant ended the statement by describing how he had attempted to flee but had been arrested at the common passageway of Block 189 after a violent struggle.
In addition to the above evidence, the prosecution also invoked the presumptions in ss 18 and 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (`the Act`). Section 18(1) provides that if any person is proved to have in his possession or custody or control (inter alia) keys to or anything containing a controlled drug, he shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession. Section 18(2) further stipulates that any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled drug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to have known the nature of that drug. Finally s 17 provides that a person proved to have in his possession (inter alia) more than 2g of diamorphine shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed to traffic in that drug.
Having regard to the above evidence, as fortified by the presumptions of the Act, the learned trial judge was of the view that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case of trafficking against the appellant.
 The appellant`s defence at trial
In his defence, the appellant stated that he had rented the rear room in flat #10-298 on behalf of one Ah Boon. Ah Boon was a friend of a Malaysian named Ah Yong who was known to the appellant. Ah Boon had contacted the appellant sometime in June 1992 and enquired about the renting of a room. The appellant believed that Ah Boon was in the 4-D business with Ah Yong and that they needed a room to conduct that business. Accordingly he rented the rear room in flat #10-298 for Ah Boon. He also shifted an empty cabinet with five shelves into the room in the hope of selling it to Ah Boon, who had requested him to purchase a locker.
On 3 July 1992 the appellant met up with Ah Boon and handed him a duplicate set of the keys to flat #10-298 as well as to the rear room. In the course of the meeting Ah Boon made various enquiries as to the movements of the occupants of the flat and the appellant claimed that he was obliged to return to the flat on 4 July 1992 in order to ascertain the occupants` movements on that day (a Saturday).
Several days later, on 7 July 1992, Ah Boon contacted the appellant again and asked to meet him so that they could go and purchase writing paper for 4-D character lottery. Upon their meeting at 5pm as arranged, Ah Boon directed the appellant to the car park between Blocks 185 and 187 Boon Lay Drive. The appellant became aware, as they crossed the car park, that they were being observed by some Vigilante Corps (VC) officers. Following Ah Boon`s instructions, he walked alone towards Boon Lay Avenue and was joined moments later by Ah Boon, who was by now carrying a blue-coloured bag. Ah Boon gave the appellant the bag which he said contained pieces of clothing, as well as a plastic sachet with white pills in it. The appellant was told to take these to the rented room while Ah Boon would wait for him in the car park.
The appellant did as he was told. According to him, he had not seen the rear room since 4 July 1992 and was therefore surprised upon entering it to discover many more items in it, such as a pillow, a mattress, a feather duster and a few bags on the floor. The cabinet he had placed in one corner of the room had also been moved. At this point the appellant opened the blue bag which Ah Boon had handed him and on finding various pieces of clothing inside, put them away on the bottom shelf of the cabinet which was empty and unlocked. He alleged that there was nothing more on the bottom shelf at this juncture.
It was then that the appellant heard someone hailing him from the front door of the flat. When he went out he saw two VC officers who asked him about the blue bag he had carried back to the flat. The appellant replied that it contained only clothing. After the officers had screened his particulars, they asked him to follow them. At this point the appellant fled from them. The reason he gave for so doing was that he still had on his person the sachet of white pills given to him by Ah Boon, which he had not had the chance to deposit in the room. Unfortunately for him, the officers gave chase and eventually captured him, whereupon he was taken to Jurong Police Station.
The appellant claimed in his testimony that he knew nothing of the drugs or the drug-related paraphernalia found in the rear room of flat #10-298. He denied that they belonged to him or that he had brought them to the room. On being cross-examined he continued to insist that he had rented the room for Ah Boon in the belief that Ah Boon needed such a room to carry out his 4-D business. He admitted not having informed Keow and Lim that someone else would be using the room or that he would be giving that other person a duplicate set of the keys given to him, but asserted that in any event it had never occurred to him that Ah Boon would visit the room without him. He was unable to say, however, whether Ah Boon was the same person as Ong Boon Tee, who had been accosted by the officers in the Boon Lay Drive car park and who had apparently disappeared after being released.
 The trial judge`s conclusions
Having heard the appellant`s testimony and weighed it against the prosecution evidence, the learned trial judge concluded that he disbelieved the appellant`s version of events. He held that on 7 July 1992, the appellant was in possession of the rear room in flat #10-298 where the drugs were discovered; that the appellant was responsible for placing the drugs in the cabinet; and further, that he knew the drugs to be heroin. In short, on the trial judge`s findings, the appellant failed to rebut the presumptions of possession and knowledge provided for in s 18 of the Act. This meant of course that the presumption of trafficking in s 17 prevailed and the appellant was held to have failed in rebutting the charge of trafficking, although apart from the operation of the said presumptions, the learned trial judge also found positive evidence of trafficking in para 23 of the appellant`s statement P107 (in which he admitted to having prepared half-pound samples of the heroin for negotiation in drug deals).
Besides offering his own version of events in his defence, it was also argued for the appellant below that he had suffered prejudice from the charge against him being too widely framed. It was contended that the description of the manner of trafficking allegedly employed by the appellant - `
 by offering to sell, give, distribute or deliver, a controlled drug 
` - failed to comply with the guidelines laid down in 
 Lee Ngin Kiat v PP 
. The argument was rejected by the learned trial judge who stated in his grounds of decision: 
 
I was satisfied that the charge as framed by the prosecution was within the scope and direction enunciated by the Court of Appeal in 
 Lee Ngin Kiat
`s case.
 
 
 
 
 The appeal
 
On appeal before us, nonetheless, the above argument as to defectiveness of the charge was canvassed once more. Counsel contended that 
 Lee Ngin Kiat 
 obliged the prosecution in a case of drug trafficking to aver in the charge the overt act of trafficking allegedly committed by the accused; hence, the particulars of trafficking given in the charge had to be sufficiently narrow in scope and descriptive of the overt act in question. It was argued that the phrase `
 by offering to sell, give, distribute or deliver 
` was so wide in its terms as to prejudice the appellant in the conduct of his defence. Counsel further submitted that the averment of four alternative acts of trafficking rendered the charge duplicitous.
This last submission was, in our view, capable of being answered quite shortly. The phrase `
 by offering to sell, give, distribute or deliver 
` did not amount to a description of more than one offence within the charge. It was still clear from the wording of the charge that the appellant stood accused of one offence, that of trafficking in 1728.87g of diamorphine.
Similarly we found no merit in the contention that the charge, being too widely framed, had occasioned the appellant grievous injustice. Even assuming that the particularization of trafficking employed in the charge against the appellant was somewhat broadly drafted, it was plain to us that the appellant suffered no prejudice whatsoever in the trial below, simply because his defence all along was in any case one of complete denial of possession of the drugs. He was able to offer his own detailed version of what had in fact occurred and he insisted throughout the proceedings that he had no knowledge of the drugs found in the rear room or of how they had been brought there. In short he was in no way disadvantaged in his defence by the particularization of trafficking adopted by the prosecution in the charge.
It was next submitted by counsel that the appellant`s constitutional rights under art 9 of the Constitution had been violated. This was based on the allegation that prior to the recording of his s 121(1) statements, the appellant had been interrogated by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (`CNB`) in connection with drug activities unrelated to the offence with which the appellant was charged. Counsel conceded the CNB officers` legitimate powers of investigations as provided for by the CPC pursuant to s 32 of the Act. Nevertheless it was argued that in interrogating the appellant when he had not been arrested for any offence other than the one he had already been charged with, the officers were indulging in an unlawful exercise of their investigative powers. This, so counsel claimed, amounted to a breach of art 9(1) as well as art 9(3) of the Constitution.
Article 9(1) provides that `(
 n 
)
 o person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty save in accordance with law. 
` Article 9(3) goes on to stipulate that `[
 w 
]
 here a person is arrested he shall be informed as soon as may be of the grounds of his arrest and shall be allowed to consult and be defended by a legal practitioner of his choice 
`. Counsel`s contention, in other words, was that the appellant`s detention was in some way unlawful. Yet it appeared to us that there was some difficulty in explaining exactly where this unlawfulness stemmed from, since clearly counsel did not dispute that the appellant`s initial arrest on 7 July and his subsequent remand were effected in accordance with the provisions of the CPC and the Act. Also, as we have noted, counsel did not dispute that the CNB officers were empowered under the CPC to subject the appellant to questioning; and there is no provision in s 121 of the CPC that such questioning be strictly restricted to an offence with which the person being questioned has already been charged. The real thrust of counsel`s argument in this respect, therefore, appeared to lie in his ancillary submission that the questioning of the appellant in relation to other drug activities constituted an inducement to the appellant, thereby rendering his eventual statements inadmissible. It was said that the interrogating officers represented to the appellant when questioning him about the other drug activities that what he told them would not be recorded and that this representation subsequently induced the appellant to give his s 121(1) statements when he would not otherwise have spoken.
Having considered the relevant circumstances of the case, however, we could see no basis in the above submission. This was a very different situation from that observed in 
 PP v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor 
:2 the inducement referred to there stemmed from the first accused having been specifically told 
 before the recording of his s 121 statements 
 that he was bound to tell all the truth. In the present case, a representation to the appellant in relation to drug activities unconnected with the charge against him was in our opinion too far removed from the subsequent recording of the appellant`s s 121(1) statements to constitute in any way an inducement to the appellant to make those statements. Counsel himself informed us that the questioning of the appellant in relation to the other drug activities was conducted from 7 to 11 July 1992, whereas the s 121(1) statements were recorded almost a week later on 17 and 18 July 1992. It was not suggested on appeal that the appellant received, during the recording of those s 121(1) statements, representations similar to that allegedly made to him when he was being questioned about the other drug activities. We were unable to agree with counsel, therefore, that the said s 121(1) statements were vitiated by an inducement of some sort; and in our view the admission of the said statements could not be faulted.
Counsel`s final argument was linked inextricably to the foregoing submission on the inadmissibility of the appellant`s s 121(1) statement. Counsel claimed that the trial judge had relied on the appellant`s statements to reject his defence and that since those statements had (on counsel`s submission) been wrongly admitted, that reliance was erroneous.
We must point out first of all that it was hardly accurate to depict the learned trial judge as having rejected the appellant`s defence purely on the basis of a preference for what was said in his s 121(1) statements. In fact, no less than ten pages of the learned trial judge`s grounds of decision were devoted to an extensive evaluation of the evidence given by the appellant in his defence, an exercise which was moreover undertaken without reference to the appellant`s statements. The appellant`s evidence was found in crucial aspects to be `
 highly unconvincing 
`, `
 lame 
`, `
 very vague 
` and `
 highly incredible 
 `. The learned trial judge concluded his assessment of the appellant`s testimony by holding that he disbelieved the appellant`s defence. We could not accept the assertion, therefore, that the learned trial judge `
 had relied on the [s 121(1)] statements to disbelieve the appellant 
`.
In any event, as already stated, we disagreed with counsel`s submission as to the inadmissibility of the appellant`s statements. There was thus no error in the learned trial judge placing reliance of some sort on the statements in arriving at his finding of guilt.
Having regard to the above reasons, we dismissed the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The 26 respondents and 34 others were charged before the magistrate`s court with the following offence: that they on or about 19 April 1990 at or about 11.35pm at unit #15-04, Balestier Plaza, Balestier Road, were members of an unlawful assembly, the common object of which was to commit the offence of gaming in a common gaming house, which is an offence punishable under s 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49) and that they had thereby committed an offence punishable under s 143 of the Penal Code. The respondents claimed trial and at the conclusion of the hearing were convicted and fined. The respondents appealed and Karthigesu J allowed the appeal and quashed the conviction against each of them. At the instance of the Public Prosecutor, the learned judge under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) reserved two questions of law of public interest for determination by this court. The two questions are as follows:
 
 
(1) Whether the charge disclosed an offence known to law in that the common object to commit the offence of gaming in a common gaming house constitutes a common object of an unlawful assembly within the meaning of s 141 of the Penal Code. 
 
(2) Whether `an offence` to be an offence within the meaning of s 40(3) of the Penal Code must be an offence which is punishable under any other law with imprisonment to at least six months.
  
 
 
The first question turns on the true and proper construction of the words `other offence` in para (c) of s 141 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). Section 141 provides as follows: 
 
An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an `unlawful assembly`, if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is -
 
 
 
 
(c) to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence ...
  
 
 
Before Karthigesu J it was argued on behalf of the respondents that the offences under the Common Gaming Houses Act, and in particular the offence under s 7 thereof, did not have as an ingredient an element of violence or threatened violence against the government or its servants or against persons or property, and that s 141 of the Penal Code by which an `unlawful assembly` is defined is contained in Ch VIII of the Penal Code under the rubric of `Offence Against The Public Tranquillity` which demonstrated the legislative intent that the common object necessary to render an `unlawful assembly` must be one having as an ingredient an element of violence or threatened violence likely to disturb public tranquillity. It was further argued that the words `other offence` in s 141(c) must be given a meaning consonant with `mischief` and `criminal trespass` both of which by definition were offences against property and both of which have an element of violence or threatened violence as well as in other paras of s 141. The learned judge accepted these submissions. In construing `other offence` in s 141(c), the learned judge referred to the case of 
 Ong Ching Seng & Anor v R 
, where the accused were charged with an offence under s 149 of the Penal Code in that they being members of an unlawful assembly, whose common object was to cause hurt by dangerous weapons, caused the death of one Ong Hock Soon. It was argued that the 
 ejusdem generis 
 rule should apply and that causing hurt with dangerous weapons was not 
 ejusdem generis 
 with mischief or criminal trespass. In rejecting this argument Rose CJ, delivering the judgment of the court, said, at p 35: 
 
It seems to us, however, that this is putting too narrow a construction upon the section. Chapter VIII of the Code, within which s 141 falls, relates to `offences against the public tranquillity`. The commission of an offence by five or more persons whose common object was to cause hurt by dangerous weapons would seem eminently to fall within the ambit of the chapter. It is, moreover, of interest, perhaps, to note the comment of Dr Gour in his book on the 
 Penal Law of India
 (6th Ed) at p 599 where he says: `This clause is not free from avoidable ambiguity. It says that an assembly is unlawful, if its common object is `to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence`. Now, strictly speaking, the other offence must be 
 ejusdem generis
; otherwise the preceding enumeration was unnecessary. But the clause is intended to include all offences both against person and property, and not only mischief, criminal trespass and 
 ejusdem generis
.` He proceeds to cite some Indian authorities for his proposition.
 
 
 
We therefore consider that there is no substance in the point. We would add, although this is not the reason for our conclusion, that there have been other cases before the courts of Singapore in which, (although admittedly the point was not taken) convictions have been recorded in the Assize Courts and upheld on appeal where the common object of the alleged unlawful assembly was similar to that in the current case.
Karthigesu J concurred with this construction of s 141(c). He said: 
 
I respectfully agree that the 
 ejusdem generis
 rule of construction is inappropriate to determine the ambit of the words `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141 of the Penal Code. `Mischief` or `criminal trespass` are used exclusive of each other in para (c). `Mischief` by definition (s 425) deals with the destruction of property likely to cause wrongful loss, or damage to the public or any person. `Criminal trespass` by definition (s 441) deals with the entry upon property with the intent to commit any offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property. The common feature in both is that violence or threatened violence is contemplated. They cannot be said to form a genus or a class or category of offence except in a very broad or loose sense. It is necessary to identify a genus or a category of offence for the application of the 
 ejusdem generis
 rule of construction. The use of the Penal Code offences of `mischief` and `criminal trespass` disjunctively in para (c), in my view, detracts from them forming a category.
 
 
 
The learned judge later came to the following conclusion: 
 
... in my view, it is abundantly clear that the words `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141 of the Penal Code were meant to cover offences which have as an ingredient for their commission an element of violence or threatened violence `which endangered the public peace into offences against public tranquillity`. This I apprehended was the rationale for the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Ong Ching Seng & Anor v R
holding that the common object to cause hurt by dangerous weapons was caught by the words `or other offence` and fell within the ambit of Ch VIII.
 
 
 
Before us both Miss Lee for the prosecution and Mr Kang for the respondents are at one in their contention that in construing the words `other offence` in s 141(c) one must have regard to the legislative intent and a purposive approach should to be adopted. Adopting this approach, Miss Lee challenges the construction given by the learned judge and contends that these words should be given a wider interpretation and that there is nothing in the section to limit the words `other offence` to only offence which has as its component or ingredient an element of violence or threatened violence. Mr Kang, on the other hand, supports the construction given by the learned judge and advanced before us substantially the same arguments as he did before the learned judge.
We agree with both Miss Lee and Mr Kang that a purposive approach ought to be adopted in construing these words. Adopting this approach we must first turn to the context in which s 141(c) is set out. Chapter VIII of the Penal Code which contains ss 141-160 relates to 
 offences affecting public tranquillity 
. This is evident from the heading in this chapter, `Offences Against The Public Tranquillity`, and more importantly, from the provisions of s 141 - leaving aside for the moment para (c) - right through to s 160. A close examination of these sections bears this out. Section 141 defines what is an `unlawful assembly` and an ingredient of an unlawful assembly thereunder is one of the common objects enumerated in paras (a)-(e). Clearly paras (a), (b), (d) and (e) concern or relate to public tranquillity; we shall deal with para (c) in a moment. Sections 142, 144 and 145 deal with involvement or participation in an unlawful assembly, and s 143 provides the punishment for being a member of an unlawful assembly. Section 146 lays down the offence of rioting and ss 147 and 148 provide the punishment for rioting. Section 149 deals with the offence committed by any member of an unlawful assembly in the prosecution of the common object of the assembly. Section 150 prescribes the offence of hiring or conniving at hiring of persons to join or become a member of any unlawful assembly. Section 151 deals with a slightly different situation, that is, where an assembly of five or more persons does not fall within s 141 but is one likely to cause a disturbance of public peace. Sections 151A, 152 and 153 provide for acts which are necessary or contribute to the attainment of the common objects described in s 141. Sections 154 and 155 deal with liability of an owner or occupier of land on which an unlawful assembly is held or a riot is committed. Section 157 relates to harbouring, receiving or assembling in any premises of any member of an unlawful assembly or any person engaged for the purpose, and s 158 deals with persons who are engaged or hired to commit any of the acts specified in s 141. Sections 159 and 160 deal with the offence of committing an affray and the punishment of such offence. All these offences under the relevant sections are offences which, by their very nature, inherently prejudice or affect public tranquillity or offences incidental or collateral to such offences.
We now turn to the object enumerated in s 141(c): `to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence`. The offence of mischief is defined in s 425 as follows:
Whoever, with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to the public or any person, causes the destruction of any property, or any such change in any property, or in the situation thereof, as destroys or diminishes its value or utility, or affects it injuriously, commits `mischief`.
And criminal trespass is defined in s 441 in the following terms: 
 
Whoever enters into or upon property in the possession of another with intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of such property, or having lawfully entered into or upon such property, unlawfully remains there with intent thereby to intimidate, insult or annoy any such person, or with intent to commit an offence, is said to commit `criminal trespass`.
 
 
 
Both these offences could involve the use of violence or threatened violence; but violence or threatened violence is not an essential ingredient in either of these offences. In the case of the offence of mischief, s 425 gives various illustrations of mischief some of which clearly do not involve any violence or threatened violence. Similarly, criminal trespass may be committed in circumstances without involving any violence or threatened violence. In 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
 the accused ignored a letter from the Turf Club prohibiting him from entering the club`s premises and entered the premises primarily to watch the races and perhaps to engage in betting. No violence or threatened violence was contemplated. It was held that the accused by entering the club premises in blatant disregard of the notice prohibiting his entry had entered the premises `with intent to annoy` the management of the club and that the intent was to be inferred from the circumstances of the case. However, it should be noted that the ingredient of the offence there was not merely the entry by the accused in disregard of the notice; there was also present the intent of the accused to annoy the management of the club.
It seems to us that where an assembly of five or more persons gather together with the common object to commit mischief or criminal trespass, the likelihood of causing disturbance to the public or a section of the public is there. Such an offence if committed by such assembly of persons could, depending of course on the circumstances, prejudice or affect public tranquillity. For example, if a sizeable number of persons like Ker Ban Siong gather together and enter and remain in the premises of the Turf Club in blatant disregard of the club`s notices prohibiting their entry, it is highly likely that a commotion or disturbance of the peace in the club would be caused. At any rate, it matters not whether these two offences are ones which by their very nature inherently prejudice or affect public tranquillity, as they are specifically mentioned in s 141 and the plain and unambiguous words must prevail. It is certainly the legislative intent to capture these offences in s 141, and it may well be that the reason for mentioning them specifically in s 141(c) is to obviate any doubt that these offences might not really be ones that by their very nature inherently prejudice or affect public tranquillity.
We now turn to consider the construction of `other offence` in s 141(c). It has been held in 
 Ong Chin Seng & Anor v R 
 that the words `other offence` following `mischief` and `criminal trespass` are not to be construed 
 ejusdem generis 
 with mischief or criminal trespass, as these two offences do not form a genus. This is also the view of Karthigesu J and we respectfully agree with him on that point.
In our opinion, the words `other offence` in para (c) have to be construed in the context of s 141 and also in the wider context of Ch VIII. It is too wide a construction to say that `other offence` means any offence under the Penal Code or any of the offences punishable under any law falling within s 40(3), as contended on behalf of the prosecution. If this indeed is the meaning the words, then the words `mischief` and `criminal trespass` in para (c) would be otiose and it makes no sense to specify `mischief` and `criminal trespass`. It would have been so simple for the legislature to provide in para (c) merely the words `to commit any offence` instead. With these two offences specifically mentioned in para (c) of s 141, it is, in our opinion, difficult to accept a literal and wide construction of the words `other offence` in s 141(c). Furthermore, there are numerous offences which even if committed by five or more persons will not in the least disturb or affect public tranquillity. For instance, an assembly of five or more persons to commit theft would certainly not prejudice or affect public tranquillity, as theft is by its nature a surreptitious act as opposed to robbery. Such is also the case where five or more persons gather together to commit forgery or to commit counterfeit or to provide false information to a public servant or to fabricate false evidence. There are many such or similar examples of offences that can be culled from the Penal Code.
On the other hand, we also do not agree that an offence falling within `other offence` in s 141(c) must have as an ingredient an element of violence or threatened violence as contended on behalf of the respondents. Violence or threatened violence does not always or necessarily go together with disturbance of public peace or tranquillity, although the two often coincide. It is not too difficult to imagine instances in which public tranquillity is prejudiced or affected in the absence of violence or threatened violence. As the learned Chief Justice illustrated to counsel in the course of the latter`s argument before us, a hundred people assemble at Queenstown or elsewhere singing `Stand Up For Singapore` in the early hours of the morning clearly disturbs public tranquillity, and if such an assembly refuses to disperse when lawfully commanded to do so every member of the assembly commits an offence punishable under s 151 of the Penal Code. But such a case does not involve any violence or threatened violence.
Our conclusion is that `other offence` in s 141(c) does not mean any offence under the Penal Code or any of the offences punishable under any law falling within s 40(3); nor does it mean or cover only an offence in which there must be present as an ingredient an element of violence or threatened violence. In our judgment, the `other offence` means an offence which by its nature inherently prejudices or affects public tranquillity. In our respectful view, this construction gives sense to the presence of the offences `mischief` and `criminal trespass` in s 141(c), and at the same time it does not widen unnecessarily the ambit of `other offence` and render otiose the presence of `mischief` and `criminal trespass`. Further, it harmonizes these words with the other provisions in Ch VIII.
We next turn to consider the question whether the offence of gaming in a common gaming house under s 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act is an offence which inherently prejudices or affects public tranquillity. In this connection, s 3 of the Common Gaming Houses Act is highly relevant. That section provides: 
 
Every common gaming house is hereby declared to be a common and public nuisance contrary to law.
 
 
 
By that section, a common gaming house is declared a common and public nuisance, and the mischief of a common gaming house is the same as that of any public nuisance of like nature. The offence of public nuisance is defined in s 268 of the Penal Code as follows: 
 
A person is guilty of a public nuisance, who does any act, or is guilty of an illegal omission, which causes any common injury, danger or annoyance to the public, or to the people in general who dwell or occupy property in the vicinity, or which must necessarily cause injury, obstruction, danger or annoyance to persons who may have occasion to use any public right.
 
 
 
A gathering of five or more persons to commit a public nuisance is, by its very nature, likely to prejudice or affect public tranquillity. Similarly, a gathering of persons to game at a public gaming house must by its very nature inherently prejudice or affect public tranquillity; a common gaming house by the very nature of its business tends to draw a number of disorderly persons to game thereat, and this must necessarily cause annoyance to the public and also disturbance of public peace, and in that sense it affects public tranquillity. It is significant that in moving the second reading of the Common Gaming Houses Bill on 22 February 1961, the Minister for Labour and Law said: 
 
There have been many complaints of the noise and nuisance caused by gaming in coffee shops and places of public resort, and it is known that such places are frequented by secret society members.
 
 
 
For the reasons we have given, we answer the first question in the affirmative.
We now come to the second question, and this turns on the proper construction of s 40(3) of the Penal Code. Section 40 provides as follows:
 
 
(1) Except in the Chapters and sections mentioned in subsections (2) and (3), `offence` denotes a thing made punishable by this Code. 
 
(2) In Chapter IV and VA, and in sections ..., `offence` denotes a thing punishable under this Code or under any other law for the time being in force. 
 
(3) In sections 141, 176, 177, 201, 202, 212, 216 and 441, `offence` has the same meaning when the thing punishable under any other law for the time being in force is punishable under such law with imprisonment for a term of 6 months or upwards, whether with or without fine.
  
 
 
Section 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act provides that: 
 
Any person who games in a common gaming house shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.
 
 
 
On a plain reading of s 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act and s 40(3) of the Penal Code, the offence under the former is not one falling within the latter. An offence punishable with imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months is not the same as one punishable with imprisonment for a term of six months or upwards; it is plain beyond argument that `the quantum` or the length of the sentence of the former is not the same as that of the latter. In our opinion, it is not correct to take the maximum term of imprisonment that can be imposed under s 7 and fit it into s 40(3) and say that therefore it is an offence falling within s 40(3). To do so would give a strained construction to both sections. We concede that an offence punishable with imprisonment of `6 months or upwards` is a grave one, but on the plain wording of s 40(3) only such offence so punishable by any other law falls within that subsection.
On this question, Karthigesu J said: 
 
In my view for an `offence` to be an offence within the meaning of s 40(3) of the Penal Code, it must be such an offence which is punishable under any other law with imprisonment to 
 at least
 six months and not such an offence which is punishable with imprisonment which 
 does not exceed
 six months. If this were not so then the line of demarcation would be meaningless and s 40(3) would be otiose having regard to the structure of the whole of s 40.
 
 
 
We are in entire agreement with him on this point.
Accordingly, we answer the second question also in the affirmative.
(dissenting): The respondents and 34 others were caught together upon premises later conceded to be a common gaming house. They further conceded that they had gathered for the purpose of gaming there. They were charged with being members of an unlawful assembly under s 141 of the Penal Code (Cap 224), the common object of which was to commit an offence of gaming in a common gaming house, which is an offence punishable under s 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act (Cap 49). The respondents claimed trial and were convicted in the magistrate`s court but their appeal to the High Court succeeded. The learned judge, at the instance of the Public Prosecutor, certified two questions of law of public interest under s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) for the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, namely:
 
 
(1) Whether the charge disclosed an offence known to law in that the common object to commit an offence of gaming in a common gaming house constitutes a common object of an unlawful assembly within the meaning of s 141 of the Penal Code. 
 
(2) Whether `an offence` to be an offence within s 40(3) of the Penal Code must be an offence which is punishable under any other law with imprisonment to at least six months.
  
 
 
It will be helpful to set out first the relevant sections of the Penal Code. Section 141 of the Penal Code provides: 
 
An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an `unlawful assembly`, if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is -
 
 
 
 
(a) to overawe by criminal force, or show of criminal force, the Legislative or Executive Government, or any public servant in the exercise of the lawful power of such public servant; 
 
(b) to resist the execution of any law, or of any legal process; 
 
(c) to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence; 
 
(d) by means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to any person, to take or obtain possession of any property, or to deprive any person of the enjoyment of a right of way, or of the use of water or other incorporeal right of which he is in possession or enjoyment, or to enforce any right or supposed right; or 
 
(e) by means of criminal force, or show of criminal force, to compel any person to do what he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do what he is legally entitled to do.
  
 
 
 
 Explanation:
 
An assembly which was not unlawful when it assembled may subsequently become an unlawful assembly.
Section 143 provides: 
 
Whoever is a member of an unlawful assembly, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 6 months, or with fine, or with both.
 
 
 
Section 40 provides:
 
 
(1) Except in the Chapters and sections mentioned in subsections (2) and (3), `offence` denotes a thing made punishable by this Code. 
 
(2) In Chapters IV and VA, and in sections ... 203 ... `offence` denotes a thing punishable under this Code or under any other law for the time being in force. 
 
(3) In sections 141 ... 201, 202 ... `offence` has the same meaning when the thing punishable under any other law for the time being in force is punishable under such law with imprisonment for a term of 6 months or upwards, whether with or without fine.
  
 
 
Section 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act provides that 
 
Any person who games in a common gaming house shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or to both.
 
 
 
Essentially, the case turns upon the interpretation of the phrase `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141 and specifically, how its width is determined by two factors, namely, first, s 40(3), ie the 
 sentence 
 that may be imposed upon the substantive offences in question and second, the 
 nature 
 of those substantive offences.
The learned judge held as follows: 
 
... the 
 ejusdem generis
 rule of construction is inappropriate to determine the ambit of the words `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141 of the Penal Code. `Mischief` or `criminal trespass` are used exclusive of each other in para (c) ... The common feature in both is that violence or threatened violence is contemplated. They cannot be said to form a genus or a class or a category of offence except in a very broad or loose sense. It is necessary to identify a genus or a category of offence for the application of the 
 ejusdem generis
 rule of construction. The use of the Penal Code offences of `mischief` and `criminal trespass` disjunctively in para (c), in my view, detracts from them forming a category ...
 
 
 
... in my view, it is abundantly clear that the words `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141 of the Penal Code were meant to cover offences which have as an ingredient for their commission an element of violence or threatened violence `which endangered the public peace into offences against Public Tranquillity`. This I apprehended was the rationale of the Court of Criminal Appeal in 
 Ong Chin Seng v R 
 holding that the common object to cause hurt by dangerous weapons was caught by the words `or other offence` and fell within the ambit of Ch VIII.
The offence of gaming in a common gaming house under s 7 of the Common Gaming Houses Act is an offence which does not have as an ingredient for its commission an element of violence or threatened violence. It is not and cannot be an offence against the person or property; and it is not such an offence that is likely to endanger the public peace and be an offence against Public Tranquillity ...
In my view for an `offence` to be an offence within the meaning of s 40(3) of the Penal Code, it must be such an offence which is punishable under any other law with imprisonment to 
 at least 
 six months and not such an offence which is punishable under any other law with imprisonment which 
 does not exceed 
six months. If this were not so then the line of demarcation would be meaningless and s 40(3) would be otiose having regard to the structure of the whole of s 40.
In any event, it is my view, that even if an `offence` is an offence within the meaning of s 40(3) it would still not be caught by the words `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141 
 unless 
 it is an `offence` which is likely to cause a breach of the public peace and thus become an offence against the public tranquillity.
The prosecution contended that the learned judge had erred in so holding and supported the widest possible reading of the phrase `or other offence`. It was submitted, first, that para (c) of s 141 is not limited by the nature of the acts which it is the common object of its constituent members to commit; secondly, that that provision is limited exclusively by s 40(3) of the Penal Code, which defines `offence` for the purposes 
 inter alia 
 of s 141 by means of the sentences that may be imposed for those acts; and thirdly, that even that limitation under s 40(3) should be read so as to give para (c) of s 141 the widest operation possible. In so doing, the prosecution contended that a purposive rather than a literal approach to the interpretation of s 141 was to be preferred. While this is in principle undoubtedly true, it was unfortunate that no further assistance was provided to us on this subject since the prosecution subsequently omitted to identify or postulate any purpose which the legislature might have had in enacting s 141.
Counsel for the respondents supported an altogether narrower reading of para (c) of s 141, contending that the generality of the words `or other offence` ought to be limited by reference to the position of s 141 in Ch VIII of the Penal Code, which is entitled `Offences Against The Public Tranquillity`, and thus confined to those offences which in their nature would be prejudicial to public tranquillity.
It is convenient first to consider the interpretation of para (c) of s 141 by reference to s 40(3), ie limiting para (c) of s 141 by having regard to sentence. In this context, it is to be noted that para (c) of s 141 provided for both mischief and criminal trespass to constitute the common object of an unlawful assembly; both offences of mischief (s 426) and criminal trespass (s 447) are punishable with imprisonment `which may extend to 3 months`.
The prosecution contended that s 40(3) included all offences for which, in any particular case, the offender might legally be sentenced by the court to a term of six months` imprisonment, even those offences for which such term would be the maximum prison sentence. The learned judge held that an `offence` within the meaning of s 40(3) of the Penal Code must be one which is punishable under any other law with imprisonment to at least six months and not one which is punishable with imprisonment which does not exceed six months. While I am in agreement that, for the provisions enumerated by s 40(3), the word `offence` must encompass a narrower category of offences than it does in s 40(2), the difficulty inherent in the learned judge`s interpretation of s 40(3) is that it is excessively narrow, for only extremely grave offences are punishable with a minimum six-month term of imprisonment.
Moreover in support of the prosecution`s submission we were referred to the fact that when the provision now seen as s 40(3) of the Penal Code was first introduced in 1871, no mandatory minimum sentence existed for any offence under the Penal Code or any other then existing law. In its original form it read: 
 
And in sections 141 ... the word `offence` has the same meaning when the thing punishable under the special or local law is punishable under such law with imprisonment for a term of 6 months or upwards, whether with or without fine.
 
 
 
It may safely be concluded, therefore, that the phrase `punishable under such law with imprisonment for a term of 6 months or upwards` in that enactment was not to be construed with reference to mandatory minimum sentences. In other words, the phrase could not have been intended to refer to an offence punishable with a minimum of six months` imprisonment.
The subsection was amended to its present form in 1926. Only in 1984 did mandatory minimum sentences come to be enacted. A comparison of the original and amended enactments will show that the amendments made were not material for present purposes. There is nothing to indicate that the construction of the phrase `punishable under such law with imprisonment for a term of 6 months or upwards` in the later amendment ought to be different from the construction of the identical phrase in the original enactment. Thus I conclude that s 40(3) ought not to be interpreted with reference to mandatory minimum sentences. In the result, the second question should be answered in the negative.
I turn to the issue of whether violence or threatened violence is a necessary component of the common object of an unlawful assembly as described by para (c) of s 141, before considering whether an unlawful assembly necessarily involves a breach of the public tranquillity. I have unfortunately found little assistance from the cases on the Indian Penal Code. In 
 Ramchandra Narayan Shastri v Emperor 
, the judges were not agreed on whether s 141 was limited to offences involving violence. More accurately, Mirza J gave no reasons for his opinion that it was not so limited and Baker J did not discuss it at all.
The first indication of the proper interpretation of s 141 is derived from the observation that in that section the words `criminal force, or show of criminal force` are expressly inserted in paras (a), (d) and (e). The implication seems to be that the intention to use criminal force or show of criminal force is not a necessary component of the common object of an unlawful assembly as defined by the paragraphs of s 141 where these words are not included.
The second indication arises from this consideration. It is difficult to make out why mischief and criminal trespass are specifically enumerated before the general words `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141. In the normal case they would be construed, in application of the 
 ejusdem generis 
 rule, as specimens of a single genus of offences referred to so that the general phrase `or other offence` should be similarly circumscribed to that same genus. In this case, however, there does not appear to be any identifiable genus.
In 
 Ong Chin Seng & Anor v R 
, where the common object of the appellants was to cause hurt by dangerous weapons, Sir Alan Rose CJ delivered the judgment of the court, saying: 
 
Learned counsel for the first appellant ... contends that the 
 ejusdem generis
 rule should apply and that causing hurt with dangerous weapons is not 
 ejusdem generis
 with mischief or criminal trespass.
 
 
 
It seems to us, however, that this is putting too narrow a construction upon the section. Chapter VIII of the Code, within which section 141 falls, relates to `offences against the public tranquillity`. The commission of an offence by five or more whose common object was to cause hurt by dangerous weapons would seem eminently to fall within the ambit of the Chapter ... Now, strictly speaking, the other offence must be 
 ejusdem generis 
; otherwise the preceding enumeration was unnecessary. But the clause is intended to include all offences both against person and property, and not only mischief, criminal trespass and 
 ejusdem generis 
.
Here it will be seen that despite mentioning the 
 ejusdem generis 
 rule, the court did not specify any genus for the offences referred to in para (c) of s 141. In denying the application of the rule, the court seems to have intended that although mischief and criminal trespass fall within the rubric of Offences Against Property in Ch XVII of the Penal Code, nevertheless the 
 ejusdem generis 
 rule ought not to be applied so as to limit the words `any other offence` to offences within Ch XVII. The case, read thus, was in my opinion undoubtedly sound, for there is no particular reason why such a categorization should be apt to limit the definition of Offences Against Public Tranquillity in Ch VIII. I do not consider that the court in that case can be interpreted as saying more than that causing hurt with dangerous weapons fell within the ambit of para (c) - it was not the intention of that court to delimit para (c) by any requirement that force or violence should have been contemplated.
Moreover, the definitions of mischief and criminal trespass in the Penal Code contain no express or implied element of violence, threatened violence or criminal force. The mens rea required for criminal trespass under s 441 is an intent to commit an offence or to intimidate, insult or annoy any person in possession of the property trespassed upon. None of these necessitate the use of force, though it is undoubtedly true that force may well be exercised in the course of committing a particular criminal trespass. In 
 PP v Ker Ban Siong 
 it was held that criminal trespass was committed by a man who, ignoring a letter from the Turf Club warning him that he was persona non grata on its premises, entered those premises, primarily to watch the races and perhaps set about a little illegal betting. Violence or threatened violence was not remotely likely, even if a sizeable number of persons had gathered to do the same.
In the same way, the illustrations given in s 425 of the Penal Code of mischief being committed include examples which might conceivably involve no violence or threatened violence at all. In illustration (c), for example, A commits mischief by voluntarily throwing into a river a ring belonging to Z, with the intention of thereby causing wrongful loss to Z.
Thus I can identify no appropriate genus for any sensible application of the 
 ejusdem generis 
 rule to para (c) of s 141. However, insofar as mischief and criminal trespass are offences which, as I have held, do not necessarily involve violence, threatened violence and criminal force, I am of the opinion that the words `any other offence` may not be thus circumscribed either, the more so when I consider that it would have been a simple enough matter for such a requirement to have been expressly included by the legislature in para (c) of s 141 if such had been its intent.
Whether an unlawful assembly necessarily involves a breach of the public tranquillity is another matter. In submitting that the words `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141 were not limited to offences prejudicial to public tranquillity, the prosecution suggested that such a result was supported by ss 145 and 151 of the Penal Code, and s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), ie that these provisions showed that unlawful assemblies were contemplated by the legislature as not being limited to those which were `likely to cause a disturbance of the public peace`. However the whole point of these sections was that an `assembly of five or more persons 
 likely to cause 
 a disturbance of the public peace` is explicitly distinguished from an unlawful assembly, the conspicuous difference being that the members of an unlawful assembly must have a common object falling within the description of one of the paragraphs of s 141. In short, the distinguishing factor between the two is the existence of such a common object, not whether or not they threaten the public tranquillity. Indeed, quite to the contrary, the posing of a threat to the public tranquillity appears to be a 
 common 
 factor, and thus the special care taken to deal with an `assembly of five or more persons 
 likely to cause 
 a disturbance of the public peace` in close proximity with unlawful assemblies in the Penal Code and the Criminal Procedure Code, if anything, emphasizes the perception that the legislature might have seen unlawful assemblies as being objectionable at least partly because they were prejudicial to public tranquillity.
The prosecution then contended that it was intended by the legislature that the mere fact of five or more persons having gathered with the common object of committing any offence should be deemed in itself to constitute an offence against public tranquillity, punishable as an unlawful assembly. I was more in accord with this submission.
What distinguishes the offences under Ch VIII of the Penal Code from other acts which may amount to breaches of the public peace is the necessity for the participation of many as opposed to single persons. This in my opinion is the true harm at which Ch VIII was aimed, namely, the potential for or actuality of alarm, turbulence and destruction caused by the participation of many, and in the case of s 141, a united many. I see nothing inherently abhorrent in saying, for example, that when five people gather to commit theft they commit an offence against public tranquillity by forming an unlawful assembly even though their common object is to prosecute an enterprise which, if prosecuted by a single individual, is inherently surreptitious in nature. Certain offences may by definition be committed with or without causing alarm, turbulence or destruction, depending on the facts of each case. It would cause untold confusion if it were to be decided that, of two actions punishable under the same enactment, for both of which the facts were undisputed, one offence might additionally be susceptible to sanction under s 141 and one might not, depending on whether the court decides that alarm, turbulence and destruction was caused or was likely to be caused in each case. Such a position would provide no certain guidance for our conduct.
For the reasons given, I am of the view that the words `or other offence` in para (c) of s 141 ought to be interpreted to include any offence whatsoever, so long as it conforms with s 40(3). Accordingly the first question is answered in the affirmative.
 Answer to the first question affirmative.

ss 16(1) & (8) Planning Act (Cap 232)
 
On 5 January 1994 the respondent, a company named Choon Nguan Enterprise Pte Ltd, was charged in the subordinate courts as follows: 
 
You, M/s Choon Nguan Enterprise Pte Ltd (Reg No 198305815/N) of 33B Fair Drive, Singapore 1543 are charged that you, on or about 14 October 1993, continue to develop the premises at 3 Lorong 12 Geylang, Singapore 1438, without the written permission of the competent authority, contrary to s 10(1) of the Planning Act (Cap 232, 1990 Ed), to wit: failure to comply with the directions in the Enforcement Notice ENF 211/92 under s 16(1) of the said Act to:
 
 
 
1 cease the use of the premises as a billiard saloon/football club; and
(2) remove all paraphernalia pertaining to the said use from the said premises, and thereby committing a continuing offence for a period of 223 days, from 6 March 1993 to 14 October 1993, punishable under s 16(8) of the said Act.
 
 
 
And further that you, before committing the said offence on 29 July 1992, 11 January 1993 and 28 April 1993 had been convicted by the Subordinate Court 13, 14 and 13N respectively of the offence under s 16(8) of the said Act and fined $600, $300 and $15,120 respectively and that you are thereby liable to enhanced punishment under the said Act.
 
 
 
The respondent was convicted after pleading guilty to the charge. A fine of $15 a day was imposed, the final sum amounting to $3,345 for the total of 223 days. The prosecution appealed against the fine as being manifestly inadequate and I allowed the appeal for the reasons given below.
It should be borne in mind as a preliminary that the respondent was charged with a `continuing offence`, in that, despite having been previously convicted of failing to comply with an enforcement notice issued pursuant to s 16(1), it had continued to defy the enforcement notice. Section 16(8) provides that: 
 
Any person who fails to comply with any direction in an enforcement notice by the competent authority, under sub-section (1), shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000 and, 
 in the case of a continuing offence, to a further fine not exceeding $100 for every day during which the offence continues after conviction
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In the present case the respondent first received the relevant enforcement notice on 18 March 1992. On 27 July 1992 it was convicted under s 16(8) of having failed to comply with the enforcement notice and fined $600. Thereafter it apparently made no effort to comply, for on 11 January 1993, it was convicted of having continued its breach of the enforcement notice and fined $10 a day, the total fine amounting to $300. Yet it did not seem any more concerned to abide by the enforcement notice and another conviction for a continuing offence followed on 18 April 1993. On this occasion, the fine was increased to $80 a day (the final sum totalling $15,210), an increase which to all intents and purposes made no dent in the respondent`s intransigence; for on 5 January 1994, the respondent pleaded guilty to the charge in the present case.
From the foregoing it is plain that this was a case in which a magistrate`s court would be justified in invoking the proviso to s 11(5) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). The proviso empowers a magistrate`s court to award the full punishment authorized by law for the offence of which an accused has been convicted, when the accused`s past record indicates a need for punishment beyond the range of sentencing power accorded to our magistrate`s courts by s 11(5). Having regard to the bold flouting of the law evinced by the above chain of conduct, I agreed with the deputy public prosecutor that the present sentence to a fine of $15 per day was manifestly inadequate. This was particularly so in view of the fact that the fine per day imposed in respect of the respondent`s last conviction was more than five times the amount of the present fine. I should also point out that, in view of the detriment to public security posed by illegal establishments such as that run by the respondent, stiffer penalties are called for to deter their proliferation.
Accordingly, I allowed the appeal and increased the fine to the maximum of $100 per day (totalling $22,300).

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is a claim by the plaintiffs in respect of the alleged conversion by the defendants of Caterpillar spare parts belonging to them. The material facts of the case are as follows.
In 1983, Mohammad Taz Khan (`PW3`) and Ramachandra s/o Ahinoo (`PW4`) were employed by the plaintiffs as security guards at the plaintiffs` warehouse at 14 Tractor Road. PW3 conceived a plan to steal some of the Caterpillar spare parts stored in the warehouse and to profitably dispose of these parts to third parties. He obtained PW4`s agreement to his plan and also enlisted the help of one Doris Liauw Pow Min (`PW5`), then employed by him in a company of which he was the proprietor. PW5 was asked to find someone who could help PW3 find a buyer for the spare parts to be stolen from the plaintiffs` warehouse (though it appears that PW5 was at that point unaware that the goods would be stolen goods). She proceeded to introduce her then husband, Ng Kin Sai (`PW8`), to PW3 as someone with experience in the sale and disposal of spare parts.
The precise details of the thefts are not important. Essentially, it was agreed that the Caterpillar spare parts would be stolen on the nights on which PW3 and PW4 were both on the same night shift. The following morning, PW8 would come in a rented vehicle to the plaintiffs` warehouse in Tractor Road to collect the stolen goods at about 5am. In the meantime, PW8 had been looking for a buyer for these stolen spare parts. He found the defendants listed in the Yellow Pages and approached the defendants` sales director, Jimmy Lim Chee Teck (`DW1`), in an effort to solicit business. PW8 represented himself to DW1 as the director of Unibone Enterprises. He informed DW1 that he had Caterpillar spare parts for sale at competitive prices. There appears to have been one visit by PW8 to the defendants` office at 4 Horne Road as well as several telephone calls by PW8 to DW1 before DW1 agreed to place a trial order with PW8. DW1 testified that, for the first trial order, PW8 gave him a list of the Caterpillar spare parts in his possession. DW1 chose an item from this list which PW8 subsequently produced. After some negotiation, the two of them agreed on the prices the defendants were to pay for these spare parts. The defendants were given an initial 30% discount off the Caterpillar consumer list price, which they ascertained from a copy of the Caterpillar price list book. Both PW8 and DW1 testified that this 30% discount was normal in the trade. On top of this 30% discount, a further discount of 55% was given to the defendants, this reduction being agreed on after some bargaining between the two of them. During the trial it was agreed by both parties that the price paid by the defendants for the Caterpillar spare parts after the discounts given amounted to 31% of the then consumer list price of such parts.
In brief, the manner in which subsequent sales transactions took place between PW8 and DW1 was as follows. DW1 would write down on foolscap paper a list of the part numbers of the Caterpillar spare parts he was interested in buying and hand PW8 a copy of the list while retaining another copy for himself. PW8 would give the list to PW3 who, together with PW4, would then steal as many of the parts as were available from the plaintiffs` warehouse. The stolen parts were collected by PW8 the following morning. PW8 claimed that he then delivered these parts to the defendants` office in Horne Road and presented them to DW1. DW1 would pay PW8 in cash which he took from the defendants` petty cash account or by means of a cash cheque. An invoice in respect of the sale in question would be issued by PW8. At the trial, a total of ten such invoices were produced: they all purported to be invoices of Unibone Enterprises. These invoices were made out `to cash` instead of stating the name of the defendants. On several occasions, PW8 produced items which had not been requested by DW1 but which DW1 was persuaded to buy after PW8 gave him yet another 50% reduction on the price, in addition to the 30% and 55% discounts already granted.
On 31 October 1983, the plaintiffs` store operations manager, David Tan Im Cheng (`PW7`), made a police report at Jurong Police Station stating that as between January 1983 and September 1983, an assortment of Caterpillar spare parts valued at about $500,000 had been discovered missing from the plaintiffs` warehouse at 14 Tractor Road. On 10 November 1983, PW8 was arrested by the police and his accomplices too were arrested later. PW3, PW4, PW5 and PW8 were duly charged in court with the theft of Caterpillar spare parts valued at $500,000. They pleaded guilty to the charges. They were duly sentenced and have served their prison sentences.
The plaintiffs now bring this action against the defendants, claiming that all the Caterpillar spare parts which the defendants bought from Unibone Enterprises (as represented by PW8) were parts that had been stolen from the plaintiffs` warehouse by PW3, PW4, PW5 and PW8 acting in concert; that the entire circumstances surrounding the transactions between the defendants (who were the largest spare parts dealers in Singapore) and Unibone were such that the defendants should have shown prudence and adopted strict precautions to ascertain that they were obtaining a good title, consequently, that the defendants committed conversion in respect of the said goods in dealing with them without the plaintiffs` consent and in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiffs` rights of ownership in these goods. In support of the plaintiffs` claim, counsel referred the court to the following authorities: 
 Hargreave v Spink 
;1 
 Reid v Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis 
; 
 National Employers` Mutual General Insurance Association Ltd v Jones 
; and 
 Commercial & Savings Bank of Somalia v Joo Seng Co 
.
Prima facie, the plaintiffs would appear to have proven that PW3 and PW4 committed conversion in respect of the Caterpillar spare parts of which the part numbers are listed in the ten Unibone invoices. These were parts which had been stolen from the plaintiffs` warehouse by them acting in concert. The question which remained was whether, in buying these stolen parts from PW8 and subsequently reselling some of them to third parties while mixing the remainder with their own stocks in their own warehouse, the defendants were dealing with these parts in a manner inconsistent with the plaintiffs` rights of ownership in the said parts and had also therefore committed conversion.
In their defence, the defendants contended that there was in existence (and perhaps had been for a long time) an open and unconcealed free market in Singapore in spare parts, including Caterpillar spare parts. In the ordinary course of their business, the defendants purchased Caterpillar spare parts from a wide variety of sources, not only from the plaintiffs. These sources included companies in the USA, Europe, Japan and Singapore. In Singapore, these companies included a local spare parts dealer, Unibone Enterprise Co. If they had bought any spare parts of the plaintiffs, they had done so in good faith and without notice of any defect or want of title, and they had paid normal market prices for these goods.
Of course, the tort of conversion itself, as one aspect of wrongful interference with another`s goods, has presented difficulties of definition in its development in English law over the years. Originally called trover, the action for conversion alleged that the defendant had found the plaintiff`s chattels (hence the name `trover`) and had wrongfully converted them to his own use. In a contemporary context, it has been said that to constitute conversion, `there must be a positive wrongful act of dealing with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner`s rights, and an intention, in so doing, to deny the owner`s rights or to assert a right inconsistent with them: 45
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
.
This does not, however, put an immediate end to the matter. It is true that the general rule to be applied in the law relating to the transfer of title to chattels by non-owners is that 
 nemo dat quod non habet 
. At the same time it is pertinent to note that various inroads have been made on this maxim, such that there now exist a number of exceptions whereby a bona fide purchaser of goods from X commits no conversion but actually obtains a valid title to them even though the goods really belonged to Y and Y never intended to allow X to sell them.
Of particular relevance in the context of the present case is the exception of market overt, to which reference was made by both counsel on argument before me and with which they dealt in some detail in their written submissions (although it was not pleaded earlier on by the defendants). In England, under s 22(1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, `(w)here goods are sold in market overt, according to the usage of the market, the buyer acquires a good title to the goods, provided he buys them in good faith and without notice of any defect or want of title on the part of the seller`. The subsection in fact represents the statutory encapsulation of the rule adopted by the common law from mercantile custom: the 
 Case of the Crown Jewels 
. Over time, however, the rule of market overt appears to have died out in the local boroughs and fairs in which it once thrived, save for the city of London, where, `by the custom of the city of London, of which judicial notice is taken, that part of every shop within the city to which the public is admitted without special invitation is market overt, between sunrise and sunset on all days except Sunday and holidays, for the sale by the shopkeeper of such goods as he professes to trade in`: 29
 Halsbury 
.
It is plain from the above that in order for a sale to constitute a sale in market overt in the city certain conditions must be fulfilled. Equally plain is the fact that these conditions were delineated in an era and in circumstances far removed from a contemporary Singapore. It would scarcely be desirable or necessary, therefore, to import wholesale into the Singaporean context the rule of market overt as it has evolved within the English legal system, lest we become entangled with the specific characteristics of markets overt in England, which derive from circumstances alien to us.
That said, nevertheless, it appears to me that the principles underlying the rule of market overt are germane to the circumstances of the present case. The defence of market overt was made available in England simply because of the need to give recognition to the fact that any established and regular market in goods is a living entity, in which the sheer volume of trading transactions in everyday practice not only makes it impossible to afford complete protection to ownership in goods when possession is lost, but also makes it necessary to accord protection to an innocent buyer of goods in the market. Commerce has tended to proceed to a not inconsiderable degree on the assumption that a man in possession of goods and disposing of them in the way of his business is entitled to do so. Thus Coke, in 
 Co 
 Inst 
, remarked: 
 
[T]he common law did hold it for a point of great policie, and behovefull for the common-wealth, that faires and markets overt should be replenished and well furnished with all manner of commodities vendible in faires and markets for the necessary sustenation and use of the people. And to that end the common law did ordaine (to encourage men thereunto) that all sales and contracts of any thing vendible in faires or markets over should not be good onely between the parties, but should bind those that right had thereunto.
 
 
 
In a very real sense, these principles are not unique to the English context although, as the English example has shown, the precise scope of their operation in any particular place may well be constrained by local conditions and habits. The applicability of the principles to trading in goods in Singapore was indirectly recognized by Lai Kew Chai J in 
 Commercial & Savings Bank of Somalia v Joo Seng Co 
 when he said, in passing, at p 102F: `I am satisfied that the defendants did not buy from the market overt`. For over a century Singapore has thrived as a free port and busy trading centre for all kinds of goods within the region, a fact of which judicial notice can be taken. Merchants and traders compete freely with each other to purchase goods from the cheapest sources, and resell them on the market at the most competitive prices. We would materially hamper the transactions of the many established markets existing in Singapore if we refuse to concede the crucial relevance of the principles underlying the market overt rule.
In the present case, the Caterpillar group, like other assemblers of vehicles, heavy machinery and equipment, only manufactured a bare 20% of the parts they used to build their products, and bought the rest from independent suppliers. Evidence, which was not challenged, showed that the defendants bought Caterpillar spare parts not only from Tractors Singapore Ltd (the authorized agent for Caterpillar products) but also from Italian, Japanese and American suppliers. PW8`s own evidence was that in Singapore alone there were about 100 firms selling Caterpillar spare parts, and `you could get them from dealers anywhere`.
Much emphasis was laid by plaintiffs` counsel on the fact that the prices of the sales by Unibone to the defendants came to only about 31% of the Caterpillar customer list prices, and that these large discounts and excessively low prices would have put them on notice. I do not accept this contention. It has not been shown that there was anything furtive about PW8`s initial overtures to the defendants or the sales which followed which should have alerted DW1 to the possibility of the goods being stolen goods. Furthermore, the defendants have been able to show that the prices at which they bought from Unibone were not excessively low, as alleged, but were market prices which apparently fluctuated widely when the market was weak and stale stocks had to be got rid of. They have been able to show purchases from Italian sources at prices lower than the 31% discount at which they bought from Unibone. On one occasion, they even bought from Tractors Singapore Ltd (the authorized Caterpillar agent) Caterpillar spare parts worth about $269,000 according to the Caterpillar customer price list for a mere $5,000.
The existence in Singapore of a regular and open market in such parts is thus obvious from the above evidence, as are the quantity and variety of transactions being conducted in this market. It is clear that great public inconvenience and confusion would result if the rationale of the market overt rule could not operate. Of course, the relative facility of transfer of property in goods may in various instances make a `loser` of the original owner of goods which are converted, but such an `evil` (if indeed one can even call it that) is counterbalanced by the general practical virtues of a system that facilitates the passing of property in goods. It should also be pointed out that in the majority of cases, the original owner of the goods is covered by insurance, whereas it may be difficult for the innocent purchaser to enforce his remedy (and even if he is able to do so, it will be expensive).
In any event, property only passes to a bona fide purchaser for value who has no notice of the owner`s claim, and in the case of the defendants in this case, I find that they acted bona fide in their purchases. There was no reason for them to suspect that there was anything amiss in their transactions with Unibone Enterprises. It is contended that the large discounts given by PW8 should have alerted them and prompted them to question PW8 further as to his sources. I am satisfied from the evidence that, as a matter of fact, the period 1982-1983 was a period of difficulty for the industry and the market for spare parts was depressed, with the result that throughout the spare parts market huge discounts were being given to buyers to get rid of stale or slow moving stock and to raise cash. Furthermore, as pointed out earlier, the defendants were able to demonstrate that they had bought Caterpillar goods from other sources (such as Far East Plant) at prices which were at least as low as those which PW8 was charging them. Therefore, there was nothing inherently suspicious about the discounts that they obtained from Unibone, or indeed about the manner in which the sales transactions took place, which should have put them on notice.
The other point which should be made is that, in more cases than not, goods are stolen at least partly as a result of the carelessness of the owner or his servants, or at any rate their failure to take proper precautions to safeguard property. That this was so in the present case is manifest from the evidence led. The plaintiffs themselves admitted that they had been suffering thefts from their warehouse `from 1972 right up to 1983` (an astonishingly prolonged period) but that, other than the police report made by PW7 on 31 October 1983, no other police reports had been filed. Nor would it appear that the help of the police had been sought in any other way in the period prior to 1983. It was further admitted that the plaintiffs had never carried out stock checks after the occurrence of a theft to determine the exact items stolen. That there had been more than one group of thieves operating is clear. PW7 stated that he suspected employees other than PW3 and PW4 of stealing the plaintiffs` goods. Thus, for example, an attempted theft from the plaintiffs` warehouse was discovered on 24 October 1983, for which both PW3 and PW4 denied responsibility. PW3 himself had on at least one occasion come across evidence of attempted theft by some other groups of thieves. The plaintiffs also revealed during the trial that on average they lost an estimated $700,000 a year in goods missing from their warehouse. In 1983, the figure for the value of missing goods was as high as $1.4m. Yet no analysis had been attempted to discover the portion of goods missing due to theft, as opposed to goods missing due to employee error, etc. In other words, this was a situation in which the plaintiffs were well aware that their goods were being systematically pilfered over a prolonged period of time; in which they suspected that their own employees were responsible for these thefts; and yet in which they unaccountably refrained from taking any action for over ten years. It is true of course that there is no legal duty in general to prevent theft of one`s property. Nonetheless, it has to be said that the plaintiffs` conduct adds no merit to their case.
I should emphasize at this juncture that this court has been conscious throughout of the 
 nemo dat 
 rule and of the justifications for it. Certainly there is no question of allowing the exceptions to the rule to `swallow up` the rule itself; and what has been stated thus far in this judgment should be read in that light.
For the reasons I have given above, I hold that the plaintiffs` claim fails and is dismissed with costs.

Heng Lee Handbags Co Pte Ltd and Hilly Singapore Pte Ltd (`Heng Lee and Hilly`), two associated companies operating from the same address, applied to the court by way of criminal motion to quash three search warrants issued by a magistrate on 31 July 1993 and for the return of the goods seized from them under the said search warrants. The search warrants were issued ex parte by the magistrate when Goodvine Pte Ltd (`Goodvine`) lodged a complaint to the magistrate alleging that their registered trade mark rights had been infringed by Heng Lee and Hilly and that they had committed an offence in contravention of s 73 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Ed) (`the TMA`).
The following background emerges from the affidavits filed on behalf of Heng Lee and Hilly and Goodvine.
 Goodvine and Toscano
Goodvine are the designers and manufacturers of a wide range of fashion products, including bags, handbags, purses and wallets, which are marketed in Singapore and elsewhere. They are the registered proprietors in Singapore of the trade mark TOSCANO and a distinctive `T` device in respect of belts in class 25. There is also a pending application by Goodvine in Singapore to register the mark TOSCANO and the `T` device in respect of bags and wallets in class 18 as of 3 September 1990. All the products thus marketed carry Goodvine`s trade mark TOSCANO and the distinctive `T` device. The word and the device are reproduced below for effect.
 Heng Lee and Hilly and Toscana
Hilly (`the second applicants`) were at all times engaged in the business of designing, wholesaling and distributing handbags and carrying cases whilst its associate Heng Lee (`the first applicants`) did the manufacturing.
In the early part of 1992, Heng Lee and Hilly were approached by one Indonesian company PT Sapta Raya Perdana (`Sapta`) to manufacture some handbags and carrying cases according to their designs. The designs submitted bore the name or mark TOSCANA. Heng Lee had no hand in the design process of TOSCANA and when Heng Lee inquired if Sapta had the authority to manufacture these products, they were told that Sapta were the registered proprietors of the TOSCANA mark in Indonesia. In this respect, Sapta also provided Heng Lee with a letter of authority to manufacture the products for them. Between the time Sapta approached Heng Lee and Hilly and until 2 August 1993 when their premises were raided by the authorities, they had no idea that the mark TOSCANA was a registered trade mark in Singapore. Heng Lee and Hilly further claimed that the order placed by Sapta was a `one-off` event. No further orders were placed by Sapta or by anyone else to manufacture such items and every single item manufactured pursuant to that order was delivered to Sapta. Heng Lee and Hilly did not sell or offer for sale any such items to third parties; nor did they make known to anyone that TOSCANA-marked products were available from them.
Goodvine came to know that there had been some manufacturing activities by Heng Lee and Hilly with regard to Goodvine`s registered trade mark TOSCANO and the `T` device. As a result, Goodvine engaged a firm of private investigators to gather information on the operations and activities of Heng Lee and Hilly. The private investigators confirmed the suspicions of Goodvine and, based on the information, a complaint was lodged by them to the magistrate on 31 July 1993.
The complaint lodged by Goodvine played a central role in this application. The material paragraphs of the complaint made on oath by one Mr Bok Mun Kit before the magistrate reads as follows: 
 
My firm has retained and instructed Commercial Private Investigation and Security of 18B Penhas Road, Singapore 0820, to investigate Hilly Singapore Pte Ltd/Heng Lee Handbags Co Pte Ltd located at Blk 514 Chai Chee Lane, #05-04, #05-09 and #06-01, Singapore 1646, believed to be dealing in products infringing the registered trade mark of TOSCANO.
 
 
 
The investigation firm has confirmed that there were products (handbags and key chains) branded TOSCANA (note the variation in the last letter) infringing the registered trade mark of TOSCANO in the premises known as Blk 514 Chai Chee Lane, #06-01 Singapore 1646.
From the information received, I verily believe that products infringing the registered trade mark of TOSCANO are stored at the said premises and documents relating to the products are stored at Blk 514 Chai Chee Lane, #05-04 and #05-09, Singapore 1646, and an offence under s 73 of the Trade Marks Act has been committed.
...
I believe that the trademark has been infringed by the company Hilly Singapore Pte Ltd/Heng Lee Handbags Co Pte Ltd.
The relevant segment of a statutory declaration filed in support of the complaint by a private investigator engaged by Goodvine reads as follows:
 
 
(3) On 30 July 1993, I went to the locality of Hilly Singapore Pte Ltd/Heng Lee Handbags Co Pte Ltd, where an investigator was working undercover in the firm. The investigator noted that there were handbags and key chains branded TOSCANA infringing the registered trade mark of TOSCANO in the premises of #06-01. The investigator obtained a key chain with the said brand out of #06-01 and I took a photograph of it.
  
 
 
It is in the context of the foregoing facts that Goodvine had gone before the magistrate with their complaint, obtained the search warrants, executed them and seized the goods from the premises of Heng Lee and Hilly. It was evident from the acknowledgement slips produced to the court that the goods seized, amongst other things, included the following: logos, padlocks, bags, waist pouches and key chains all bearing the name TOSCANA with the distinctive `T`.
 Proceedings in Civil Suit No 2038 of 1993
It is relevant to note at this juncture that, after the search and seizure, Goodvine had instituted proceedings in the High Court in Suit No 2038 of 1993 against Heng Lee and Hilly and had also obtained from the court an interim injunction restraining Heng Lee and Hilly from importing, exporting, ordering, purchasing, offering for sale, selling or supplying, distributing, advertising, manufacturing, disposing of or parting with possession of or dealing in any goods, including belts, bags and pouches bearing the name TOSCANO or TOSCANA or any other word or words consisting or comprising the words TOSCANO or the `T` device in any form or manner. The court had also granted a further order that the goods and documents seized from Heng Lee and Hilly pursuant to the search warrants be kept in the safe custody of Goodvine until further order of court.
 Present application
Crying foul and alleging procedural irregularity, lack of particularization and absence of reasonable belief on the part of Goodvine, Heng Lee and Hilly had applied to the High Court to set aside the orders for search and seizure and consequently for the return of the goods seized.
The main contentions of Heng Lee and Hilly could be summarized in the following four paragraphs:
 
 
(a) the magistrate had acted in excess of his jurisdiction in granting the search warrants based on a bare complaint without due enquiry; 
 
(b) the complaint lodged by Goodvine was devoid of particulars and did not disclose specifically what offence had been committed under s 73 of the TMA; 
 
(c) no offence under s 73 of the TMA had been committed; and 
 
(d) on the facts available the complainant did not have and could not have had any valid reasons to believe that an offence had been committed under s 73 of the TMA.
  
 
 
The principal issue before the court was whether the complainant was justified in alleging an offence under s 73 of the TMA. Section 73 of the TMA provides as follows: 
 
Any person who imports, sells or exposes or has in his possession for sale or for any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods or thing to which a counterfeit trade mark is applied or to which a registered trade mark is falsely applied, shall, unless he proves that -
(a) having taken all reasonable precautions against committing an offence under this section, he had, at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, no reason to suspect the genuineness of the mark and on demand made by or on behalf of the prosecution, he gave all the information in his power with respect to the persons from whom he obtained the goods or things; or 
(b) he had acted innocently,
 
 
 
be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for each goods or thing to which the counterfeit trade mark is applied or the registered trade mark is falsely applied (but not to exceed in the aggregate $100,000) or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
 
 
 
 
 Preliminary objection
 
On the day the matter came up for hearing, counsel for Goodvine raised a preliminary objection to the form employed by Heng Lee and Hilly in bringing this application before the High Court. Counsel for Goodvine argued that criminal revision was not available to Heng Lee and Hilly and the correct procedure in matters of this nature was first to apply for leave and then for an order of certiorari, pursuant to O 53 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1990 (`RSC`).
The court noted that the objection as to procedure was raised at the eleventh hour on the day of the hearing. Worse still, this was done without any prior notice to the respondents. Another strange feature was the fact that Goodvine themselves had filed a substantial affidavit in opposition to the application for criminal revision as early as on 20 November 1993.
To support his contention, counsel for Goodvine referred me to various authorities including commentaries by David Feldman in his book 
 The Law Relating to Entry, Search and Seizure 
 (1988); James Fontana in his book 
 The Law of Search and Seizure in Canada 
 (3rd Ed) and also to certain passages in 
 R v Inland Revenue Commissioners, ex p Rossminster 
.
The learning referred to and cases decided, including those in Malaysia and Singapore, did confirm that certiorari would lie for excess or want of jurisdiction or for what is now generally known as jurisdictional error by inferior tribunals: see 
 Mak Sik Kwong v Minister of Home Affairs, Malaysia (No 2) 
 and 
 Re Application by Yee Yut Ee 
.
Was certiorari the only course open to Heng Lee and Hilly? Could not Heng Lee and Hilly apply to the court under the revisionary powers conferred upon the High Court under s 23 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (`SCJA`) read with s 266 et al of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`)?
In the scheme of the SCJA, the revisionary powers of the High Court in respect of criminal proceedings and matters in the subordinate courts are provided for under s 23 to be read in conjunction with the provisions of written law relating to criminal procedure, whereas the High Court`s powers to issue an order of certiorari are provided for under the heading `Additional Powers Of The High Court`, in para 1 of the First Schedule to the SCJA. The procedure for the issue of an order of certiorari is set out under O 53 of the RSC.
Section 266 of the CPC for its part empowers the High Court to call for and examine the record of any proceedings before any subordinate courts for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the correctness, legality or propriety of any finding, sentence or 
 orders recorded or passed and as to the regularity of any proceedings of that subordinate court 
.
It is clear from the foregoing provisions that the powers of the High Court to issue an order of certiorari is additional or auxiliary to the High Court`s powers as provided for under s 23 of the SCJA and s 266 et al of the CPC, save that, in criminal revision, by virtue of the provisions of s 269 of the CPC, no party has any right to be heard either personally or by an advocate before the High Court when exercising its powers of revision. Therefore, the contention that the applicants` only remedy was to apply for an order of certiorari was not well founded.
In the matter at hand, there was yet another little distraction. It was observed that the application for criminal revision was in the habiliments of a criminal motion supported by an affidavit and not, as it ought to be, by way of a petition for revision. In this respect, though the CPC itself does not prescribe the form of application for revision, the mode employed by practitioners in criminal law, had always been by way of petition: see also 
 Mallal`s Criminal Procedure 
(4th Ed), p 479. The present mode adopted by Heng Lee and Hilly also breached another settled rule, that affidavits should not be filed in criminal appeals or upon criminal revision unless so ordered by the High Court: see 
 Lee Boon Gan v R 
.
Although the form used was inappropriate and the steps faulty, the fact remained that a perceived grievance was before the court. The very purpose of revisionary provisions as envisaged under s 23 of the SCJA and s 266 of the CPC was to give speedy relief to the affected and the aggrieved. Dealing with the revisionary provisions in the Indian Criminal Procedure Code, it was observed by the Allahabad High Court in 
 R v Nasrullah 
 at p 568: 
 
... [T]hat the object of this revisional legislation was to confer upon superior criminal courts a kind of paternal or supervisory jurisdiction, in order to correct miscarriage of justice arising from misconception of law, irregularity of procedure, neglect of proper precautions or apparent harshness of treatment, which has resulted on the one hand in some injury to the due maintenance of law and order or, on the other hand, in some undeserved hardship to individuals.
 
 
 
See also 
 Mallal`s Criminal Procedure 
 (supra), pp 480-481. In the circumstances, the court proceeded to consider the substantive issue raised in the application.
 The main issue
Reverting to the substance of the application, counsel for Heng Lee and Hilly contended that there was insufficient material before the magistrate that justified the issue of the warrants under attack. He contended that: 
 
[U]nder s 62(a) of the CPC, the magistrate should have conducted the necessary inquiry of the complainant to determine for himself if there were indeed reasons to believe that an offence under s 73 of the TMA had indeed been committed. Whilst the applicants are not now attributing any blame to the learned magistrate, it would appear that he took the information provided by the complainant unquestioningly and was thus misled.
 
 
 
The fact that the complainant had simply relied on the report made by a third party and not examined for himself the goods in question should have raised an alarm in the mind of the magistrate.
It cannot be gainsaid that s 62 of the CPC requires the magistrate to conduct an inquiry upon information laid before him and only after he was satisfied that an offence had been committed under ss 70, 71, 72, 73 and 74 of the TMA, may he issue such a warrant.
Commenting on the duty of the magistrates at ex parte hearings of such inquiries, David Feldman, in his textbook (supra), states at pp 80-81: 
 
Many provisions require that a magistrate or similar person shall `be satisfied` of certain things or that `it shall be made to appear` to him that a certain state of affairs exists. All these forms of words place an obligation on the magistrate to make sufficient enquiry to satisfy himself of those matters, and at the end he must actually be satisfied, instructing himself properly on any matters of law which fall to be decided in reaching his conclusion. The magistrate is not allowed simply to accept the statement of the informant to the effect that he (the informant) is satisfied of the matters of which the magistrate is to be satisfied. The information must, on a fair reading, taking account of innuendos and inferences, disclose reasonable cause. To allow him to rely unquestioningly on the view of the informant on a question which is given to the justice to answer would be to hold that the justice may discharge the judicial duty cast upon him by acting parrotlike upon the bald assertion of the informant. ...
 
 
 
Now perusing the complaint and the statutory declaration filed in support thereof, it appeared to me that the complaint was in fact sketchy and, if close attention was indeed paid to the complaint, the magistrate might not have issued the search warrants as had been done in the case at hand.
But the matter does not end there. The evidence available appears to confirm that the seized goods had embossed on them the distinctive `T` device. Inasmuch as this `T` device is a registered trade mark in respect of belts in class 25 and also a mark pending registration of bags and wallets in class 18, any endeavour to simulate such a device, resulting in any confusion or deception, would prima facie offend s 73 of the TMA.
Moreover, under our law, the fact that evidence is unlawfully obtained does not affect its admissibility: see 
 Wong Liang Nguk v PP 
 at p 247. In 
 Kuruma v R 
 at p 203, Lord Goddard CJ in giving the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, inter alia, said: 
 
In their Lordships` opinion, the test to be applied in considering whether evidence is admissible is whether it is relevant to the matters in issue. If it is, it is admissible and the court is not concerned with how the evidence was obtained. ...
 
 
 
An additional feature in the contest between the parties is the fact that, after the seizure, Goodvine had commenced an action against Heng Lee and Hilly in Suit No 2038 of 1993, on grounds that Heng Lee and Hilly had offended Goodvine`s trade mark rights. They had also obtained in the said suit an interim injunction against Heng Lee and Hilly after a contested ex parte application on 12 January 1994. The injunction concerns the same goods seized and is still in force.
 Conclusion
In the circumstances, balance of convenience did not favour the quashing of the search warrants which had already been effected for, after all, Heng Lee and Hilly themselves had asserted in their affidavits that whatever goods manufactured by them was a `one-off` operation and no further orders were ever received or executed by them. In my opinion, interest of justice will be served if the goods seized were retained by Goodvine for and on behalf of the public prosecutor until the determination of the issues in Suit No 2038 of 1993 and until the public prosecutor`s decision to prosecute or otherwise in this matter. Consequently, for the reasons stated herein, I made no order on the application.

The appellant was convicted upon the following charge: 
 
That you, Tan Chee Kieng, on or about 24 August 1991 at about 9am, in the car park in front of Blk 8, Jalan Batu, Singapore, did traffic in a controlled drug specified in class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, five packets of substance containing not less than 94.54g of diamorphine without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder and, by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, by transporting the said drug, and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act and punishable under s 33 of the said Act.
 
 
 
At first instance, the appellant was also jointly charged with one Ng Cheng Kiat (`Ng`). Ng was acquitted of the joint charge by the trial judge and the prosecution did not appeal against that decision. The appellant, on the other hand, appealed against his conviction. We dismissed the appeal and, therefore, now give our reasons.
 The facts
The arrest of the appellant arose out of the surveillance CNB officers carried out in relation to a white Mazda, licence plate No QEL 570Z parked in a car park next to Blk 8, Jalan Batu. At approximately 1am on 24 August 1991, two unidentified men drove up to the car in a red Daihatsu. One of them deposited a package in the boot of the Mazda. A group of CNB officers trailed the Daihatsu and later tried unsuccessfully to arrest the two men at Stadium Road.
After the Daihatsu left, a man who was later established to be Lim Poh Liang came out of his flat at #05-07, Blk 8, Jalan Batu, and looked at the Mazda. A group of officers went up to #05-07 and arrested him. When he was asked the whereabouts of the keys to the Mazda, he stated that they were with either the appellant or Ng. In the presence of the officers, he paged the appellant. When the latter called, he told him that the `things`, as planned, were in the boot of the Mazda. The appellant then stated that he would pick up the `things` in the morning. Lim Poh Liang later pleaded guilty to a charge of abetting the appellant and Ng in trafficking in drugs.
On the morning of 24 August 1991, at approximately 9am, the appellant and Ng were seen in a silver Honda. The appellant got out of the Honda and went up to the Mazda, where he opened the boot and retrieved a plastic bag. He brought the bag back to the Honda and handed it to Ng, who put it in the right hand corner of the front passenger seat. Ng then started to drive the car out of the car park. At the same time, the CNB officers moved in to arrest the two men and one of the officers tried to get into the Honda from the back seat. The appellant then told Ng to run, but Ng was, however, arrested by the CNB officer who had entered the car from the rear. The appellant got out of the car and ran into the hawker centre, falling twice whilst doing so. At the hawker centre, he managed to fend off with a chair an officer who had caught up with him. Nevertheless, he was arrested as he was attempting to flee from the hawker centre to the market.
Upon analysis, the packet collected by him from the boot of the white Mazda was found to contain not less than 94.54g of diamorphine. When the appellant`s urine sample was analyzed no morphine was found.
 The appeal
Before us, counsel for the appellant premised his contentions upon the fact that the appellant had been unrepresented. He had refused representation at the trial. Counsel contended that the appellant had given evidence and been cross-examined on other prejudicial evidence not related to the charge against him. For instance, he admitted that he was once the headman of a secret society called `Sio Koon Tong`; he related how he started out in the drug trafficking business; the first occasion he contacted his supplier; how he learnt his illicit trade; he mentioned other drug deals, `settlement talks` and `gang fights`. We noted, however, that the learned trial judge had taken especial care not to rely on any evidence of criminal activity. In his grounds of decision the learned trial judge stated: 
 
I should add that, in reviewing the evidence, I did not consider any evidence that was not relevant to the charge. This included the second accused`s admissions to drug transactions prior to and unconnected with the transaction for which he was charged. I admitted in evidence references to such activities in the statement of 29 August because they formed part of the admission and explanation of the dealings. I also allowed counsel for the first accused to question him on his previous drug dealings because it was relevant to the first accused`s defence as presented. However, when he denied that the drugs in the boot were delivered there for him and claimed that he thought he was collecting festival items that Lim Poh Liang had bought, the evidence of previous illegal activities unrelated to the charge was not relevant to determine whether his explanation was acceptable. Accordingly, although the evidence remained on the record, I did not take it into consideration in coming to my decision.
 
 
 
Accordingly, we were of the view that the evidence of general criminal disposition occasioned no injustice. It should be remembered that, unlike in a trial with a jury, a judge trying a case without a jury is unlikely to be influenced by prejudicial evidence which for one reason or another had been admitted, especially when, as here, the learned trial judge has cautioned himself against being influenced by it.
Secondly, counsel contended that the learned trial judge erred in rejecting the appellant`s explanation that his long statement to the investigating officer, in which he admitted his culpability, contained untruths. He emphasized that the appellant had falsely admitted his guilt thinking that his lies would save his co-accused Ng`s life. In his grounds of judgment, the learned trial judge had queried, and in our view quite correctly, the logical connection between the appellant`s admission of guilt and Ng`s innocence. Before us, counsel for the appellant sought to establish that the appellant`s line of reasoning, although logically faulty, was the most natural assumption made by most untrained laymen. We were not persuaded that this was an assumption which would have been made by an accused person. Indeed, we were of the view that the appellant had admitted his guilt because he had himself come to the conclusion that the prosecution`s case against him was too strong. Of relevance is the following portion of the appellant`s evidence, when he was questioned by the learned trial judge:
 
 
Q: You can both be guilty, you can both be innocent. You can be innocent, he can be guilty. He can be innocent, you can be guilty. 
 
A: 
 But they found so much drugs in my flat, 350g. At that time, I only knew that if I had 15g, I would face the death penalty. 350g is many times more. 
 [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
Counsel`s last contention concerned the statement of facts to which Lim Poh Liang had pleaded guilty. In this statement, he said that the appellant was informed by him that the heroin was in the Mazda and he told the police that the key to the Mazda was with the police. At first instance, Lim Poh Liang stated that these facts were untrue and he had accepted the statement as he had been `scared to die`. The learned trial judge did not accept his evidence. Counsel for the appellant argued that the learned trial judge had erred in so doing. On a review of the evidence, we agreed with the learned trial judge; the oral testimony of Lim Poh Liang was confused, to say the least. In any event, Lim Poh Liang`s statement of facts was not material to the appellant`s conviction. The appellant was arrested after having in his possession the requisite amount of drugs under s 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. The appellant clearly knew that the package contained heroin and intended to have the heroin in his possession: he attempted to flee upon being apprehended by the officers, and, in addition, there were clear admissions in his two statements. In his cautioned statement made on 24 August 1991, he stated `... just before 9am, I transferred the heroin from the boot of QEL 570Z to SBC 1189T ...`. In his second statement he admitted that `I knew that the polythene bag contained five pounds of heroin ...`. In our judgment, the learned trial judge`s conviction of the appellant on the charge preferred was plainly ineluctable; Lim Poh Liang`s evidence for the appellant, even if accepted in its entirety, was simply insufficient in the face of the wealth of evidence to the contrary.
Accordingly, we dismissed the appeal.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This case concerns a claim in tort brought by the plaintiff, a businessman ordinarily resident in Singapore, against the defendant bank (`the bank`) for its malicious prosecution of a bankruptcy petition against him. The plaintiff had taken out an overdraft facility with the bank, which was secured by a legal mortgage over the plaintiff`s property at No 4 Jalan Bahasa, Singapore (`the property`). On 11 August 1986 the bank commenced the bankruptcy proceedings in question against the plaintiff for his failure to settle his outstanding overdraft with it. The plaintiff was adjudged a bankrupt in September 1987, but the bankruptcy notice was rescinded in October 1988 by consent. The plaintiff then brought this action, praying for a declaration that the bank had wrongfully and maliciously failed and refused to sell the property pursuant to its rights as mortgagee in satisfaction of the sums owed by the plaintiff, but had chosen instead to commence bankruptcy proceedings against him maliciously and without reasonable and probable cause thereby damaging the plaintiff`s credit and reputation. The plaintiff suffered pecuniary loss as a result and he sought, inter alia, a declaration, an account and an injunction to restrain the bank from claiming any sums alleged to be due to it including all claims of interest debited to his account after 11 August 1986, as well as damages and interest thereon.
 The facts
I shall first set out the material facts and circumstances surrounding the claim: 
 
 
(1) On 3 November 1980, the plaintiff and the bank entered into an agreement by which the bank granted the plaintiff a credit facility of $550,000 (the facility) for the purpose of financing the plaintiff`s purchase of the property, at an interest rate of 153/4% pa, to be secured by a legal mortgage over the property in favour of the bank. The mortgage was subsequently executed by the plaintiff on 15 December 1980 (`the first mortgage`), upon the bank`s standard form. 
 
(2) On 6 March 1981, the plaintiff notified the bank of his new address, No 29 Greenbank Park, Singapore. 
 
(3) On 31 March 1981, the plaintiff rented the property to one Karel Schutte at an initial monthly rent of $6,000, which increased to $6,500 after a year and to $7,300 after two years. The income generated by this rental was used by the plaintiff to offset the considerable interest which accumulated on the principal sum in the facility. 
 
(4) On 8 September 1981, the property was valued at the request of the bank by Associated Property Consultants Pte Ltd (`APCL`) at $850,000 with vacant possession. 
 
(5) On 22 September 1981, the bank granted the plaintiff an increase of $50,000 in the facility, on the security of a further charge on the property (`the second facility`). Accordingly, on 14 November 1981, the plaintiff executed a further mortgage of the property in the bank`s favour of up to $600,000 plus interest at 17.25% pa (`the second mortgage`). 
 
(6) On 9 November 1982 an updated valuation by APCL showed that the property had increased in value to $920,000 (with vacant possession). 
 
(7) On 16 November 1982, the bank granted the plaintiff`s request to increase the facility up to $750,000, subject to a reduction of $70,000 by four quarterly instalments, and a further charge (`the third facility`). The plaintiff duly executed a further mortgage on 23 February 1983 over the property for a further $150,000 plus interest at 12.25% pa (`the third mortgage`). 
 
(8) . On 31 March 1983, Karel Schutte`s tenancy ended. The plaintiff was unable to find another tenant and the property remained untenanted until May 1985. As at February 1984, the plaintiff`s overdraft stood at $789,000, whereas in accordance with the agreement under which the third mortgage had been made he should have reduced his overdraft to $700,000 by January 1984. 
 
(9) On 14 March 1984, the bank granted the plaintiff`s request for a further increase in his facility to $820,000 (`the fourth facility`), and on 27 April, the plaintiff executed his final mortgage over the property as security for that principal sum plus interest at the rate of 12.5% pa (`the fourth mortgage`). At this point in time the property was thought to be worth about $1.3m. 
 
(10) In May 1984, the plaintiff entered into contracts for the installation of a swimming pool in the property and for the fencing of the pool. 
 
(11) On 12 May 1985, the plaintiff finally managed to get another tenant, Smith Kline & French (`Smith Kline`). The tenancy was to be for two years at a rental of $5,000 per month. Contrary to the express provisions of the mortgage terms, the consent of the bank as mortgagees to the letting was not obtained. The plaintiff alleged that he had made an attempt to obtain the prior consent of one of the bank`s senior managers, Lin Kai Swee (`Lin`), but Lin (DW8) refused and that when the plaintiff informed Lin that he had gone ahead with the tenancy agreement regardless, Lin had become enraged. The occurrence of this alleged event played a vital role in the plaintiff`s case, and was denied by Lin. 
 
(12) On 15 May 1985 the plaintiff`s account stood at $887,560.14; the bank sent him its first letter of demand, requiring him to reduce this overdraft within the next 10 days. In response to the letter, the plaintiff deposited a cheque for $10,000 into his account on 23 May, reducing his overdraft to $877,560.14. 
 
(13) The bank sent the plaintiff its second letter of demand dated 5 June 1985, proposing that he settle the excess by five fortnightly instalments of $13,262, so that the overdraft would be reduced to its permitted limit. The plaintiff made three deposits in the months of June and July totalling $60,000, which was insufficient to reduce his overdraft. 
 
(14) The bank sent him a third letter dated 27 August 1985 (see AB39C), seeking a settlement of the excess of $22,714.77 by 23 September 1985, by way of two equal fortnightly instalments, and a servicing of the accumulated monthly interest. 
 
(15) By the end of September, however, the plaintiff had only deposited $15,000 into his account. The bank sent him its fourth letter dated 5 October 1985 requesting immediate payment of the excess of $15,742.39. At the time, the property was valued by APCL at $980,000 with vacant possession. The plaintiff did not make immediate payment, and on 18 October the bank sent him its fifth and final notice to settle the amount plus the interest for September, within seven days. 
 
(16) On 31 October 1985, the bank wrote to its solicitors, NS Kang, instructing them to issue a demand for the settlement of the entire overdraft sum of $843,083.75. NS Kang duly served a notice dated 2 November 1985 on the plaintiff at 29 Greenbank Park, demanding repayment of the overdraft within 14 days, failing which the bank would exercise its rights as mortgagees or take other legal proceedings. 
 
(17) On 20 November, the bank instructed NS Kang to file a writ against the plaintiff for the overdraft sum plus the interest that had since accumulated; it then changed its instructions and asked NS Kang to auction the property through Knight Frank Cheong Hock Chye & Ballieu (`Knight Frank`) instead in the exercise of its powers as mortgagee. NS Kang then entered into correspondence with Knight Frank to arrange for the auction and sale of the property. On 11 December NS Kang served a notice to quit the property on the plaintiff at 29 Greenbank Park; they advised the bank that the auction of the property should only be effected after vacant possession was obtained. 
 
(18) Accordingly, the bank filed Originating Summons No 1515 of 1985 on 26 December 1985 for payment of moneys due under the mortgages, together with recovery of possession of the property and other ancillary relief. The plaintiff failed to enter an appearance or to attend the hearing of the application, and by order of court dated 17 February 1986 the plaintiff was ordered to pay the bank $858,289.85 and to deliver possession of the property. On 26 February, NS Kang sent the plaintiff a seven-day demand notice to satisfy the judgment debt, failing which the bank would proceed to enforce the possession order. On 11 March 1986, NS Kang was instructed to take possession of the property; on 24 March, the writ of possession was filed, and 11 July 1986 was fixed as the date of execution. 
 
(19) On 25 April 1986, however, Fong Fook Heng (Fong), one of the bank`s credit officers who had been assigned to take charge of the plaintiff`s account, visited the property, and discovered that it was tenanted. The bank asserted (in para 19 of its amended defence) that this was the first time that they learnt of the plaintiff`s tenancy agreement with Smith Kline. 
 
(20) Meanwhile, on 8 May 1986, NS Kang notified the plaintiff that the execution of the writ of possession would be carried out on 11 July 1986. The notice was acknowledged on 15 May; on 25 May the plaintiff allegedly left the country for Canada. 
 
(21) On 10 July 1986, however, the day before the execution of the writ of possession, the bank telexed NS Kang instructing them to withhold execution as the property was tenanted. NS Kang wrote to the tenants at the property on 15 July, informing them that their tenancy was not binding on the bank as mortgagees and requesting a copy of the tenancy agreement. The tenants did not reply. At this time the plaintiff had left Canada for the UK, and on 27 July he asserted that he had returned to Singapore. 
 
(22) On 30 July 1986, the bank instructed NS Kang to proceed with bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff, and to obtain possession of the property against the tenants as well. On 11 August, a bankruptcy notice was issued against the plaintiff in Bankruptcy No 2874 of 1986. 
 
(23) NS Kang asserted that they made three unsuccessful attempts to serve the bankruptcy notice on the plaintiff on 13, 18 and 25 August. The plaintiff stated that he had again left Singapore for the UK on 15 August. As a result, NS Kang made an application for substituted service on 30 August. An order for substituted service by way of advertisement was eventually made on 23 January 1987. 
 
(24) Meanwhile in October 1986, Roy Sharma (DW5) of NS Kang had finally made contact with the tenants, Smith Kline, and obtained a copy of the tenancy agreement with the plaintiff. On 29 October, APCL was appointed Receiver to receive the rents and profits of the property from the tenants. As Receiver, APCL was requested in March 1987 to pay property tax for the property for the first half of 1987; at the time the plaintiff was in arrears of $26,497.85 in property tax. This was eventually paid by the bank, who debited the plaintiff`s account accordingly. 
 
(25) The notice of advertisement of the bankruptcy notice appeared in T
 he Straits Times 
 on 4 February 1987. There was no response. The bank then instructed NS Kang to file the bankruptcy petition. APCL confirmed that the market value of the property as at 18 February 1987 was $870,000 with vacant possession. Accordingly, NS Kang filed a creditor`s petition against the plaintiff on 19 March; the bank being a secured creditor, an accompanying affidavit stating the value of the property given by APCL was also filed. 
 
(26) An order of substituted service by advertisement of the bankruptcy petition was applied for ex parte, and granted on 30 March 1987. The petition was fixed for hearing on 4 September 1987. A notice of advertisement of the petition was duly advertised in the Straits Times on 7 April 1987; again, there was no response. 
 
(27) On 30 April 1987, Smith Kline gave notice to APCL of its intention to exercise the option to renew its tenancy, which was to expire on 31 May 1987, as granted by the plaintiff in the tenancy agreement. The bank discharged APCL as Receiver from 30 June 1987 (see DB292), taking possession of the property by instructing Smith Kline to pay rents to it or its agents instead, and eventually took a decision to enter into a fresh tenancy agreement with Smith Kline on 5 November 1987 for a period of 25 months from 1 June 1987 to 31 July 1989 at a rental of $4,350 per month. 
 
(28) In late August 1987, the plaintiff`s solicitors, Chung & Co, responded to the advertisement of the petition. On 29 August Chung & Co wrote to the bank (AB/PB62) seeking a 14-day adjournment of the hearing of the petition. In reply, the bank instructed NS Kang that it did not agree to the adjournment `for obvious reasons`, and this was duly communicated to Chung & Co. 
 
(29) On 4 September 1987, which was the date of the hearing of the petition, neither the plaintiff nor Chung & Co attended the morning hearing; this was attributed to an oversight by Ms Margaret George, a legal assistant with Chung & Co. As a result, the receiving and adjudication orders (`the orders`) were made against the plaintiff by Thean J. When she realized her mistake, Ms George (PW7) contacted Mr NS Kang the same afternoon and they went to see the judge in chambers, but Mr Kang refused to consent to the setting aside of the orders made, in the absence of which Thean J could not set them aside. 
 
(30) Chung & Co then commenced proceedings to set aside the orders by way of originating motion. Copies of the orders were served on the bank as well as on the Official Assignee on 15 September. Proceedings got underway in 1988 and there were several applications to cross-examine the plaintiff and Lin on their respective affidavits, which were granted. In May 1988, Khattar Wong & Partners took over matters for the bank from NS Kang. 
 
(31) In July 1988, the bank instructed Jones Lang Wootton Property Consultants (`JLW`) to sell the property subject to Smith Kline`s tenancy by public auction. APCL valued the property at $1m with vacant possession; $970,000 subject to the existing tenancy. The auction was advertised four times in 
 The Straits Times 
 and twice in the 
 Lianhe Zaobao 
. On 4 August 1988, the property was auctioned off for $1m to Ho Sian Pte Ltd. 
 
(32) On 27 October 1988, at a hearing before Lai Kew Chai J, parties consented to have the orders rescinded and annulled. Lai Kew Chai J also set aside the bankruptcy notice as being bad ab initio, it being agreed by the parties that as the notice as well as the petition included a claim for costs which had yet to be taxed, in the light of the recent case of 
 Low Mun v Chung Khiaw 
 B
 ank Ltd 
, both must be a nullity as they did not claim a debt for a liquidated sum. Costs were ordered against the bank. 
 
(33) On the same day, the sale of the property to Ho Sian Pte Ltd was completed. After setting off the net proceeds from the sale, the balance of the plaintiff`s debt to the bank was $121,166.36. 
 
(34) On 11 November 1988, the plaintiff`s solicitors received a demand for the remaining debt with further interest thereon. The plaintiff commenced this action on 2 June 1989, and successfully applied for a stay of execution and of all further proceedings under the order made in favour of the bank in Originating Summons No 1515 of 1985. In December 1989 the bank obtained a stay of execution with respect to the order for costs made at the hearing annulling the orders and the bankruptcy notice; Chan Sek Keong J gave his reasons for granting the stay in 
 Re Shaw, ex p Banque Indosuez, 
 a decision upon which the bank relied in its defence to the plaintiff`s claim herein.
  
 
 
 
 The plaintiff`s case
 
The elements of the tort of malicious prosecution are well established and comprise the following: 
 
 
(1) that the prosecution of the claimant had been instituted by the defendant; 
 
(2) that the defendant had acted maliciously and without reasonable or probable cause; 
 
(3) that the proceedings against the claimant had terminated in his favour.
  
 
 
The plaintiff`s case before me was that the bankruptcy proceedings against him had been instituted by the bank at the instance of Lin, one of its senior managers, maliciously, and without reasonable and probable cause, where it would have been far simpler for the bank to have recovered its debt from the plaintiff by selling the property in the exercise of its right as mortgagee, the value of which was at all material times sufficient to satisfy or substantially satisfy the debt. As a result of this, the plaintiff had suffered damage to his reputation and considerable pecuniary loss, for which he claimed compensation.
The plaintiff asserted that Lin had recommended his introduction into the bank in September/October 1980, and that from then on all his contacts and transactions with the bank had been done through Lin. He testified that in April 1984, after his tenancy with Karel Schutte had terminated, he invited Lin to dinner at the Hotel Equatorial, and had confided in Lin his problems with getting another tenant. Lin then advised him to renovate and improve the property and to install a swimming pool so as to attract potential foreign tenants. The plaintiff stated that he took Lin`s advice, and Lin offered him an increase in his facility with the bank of $70,000 to meet the costs of the renovations. The plaintiff then installed a pool and made the necessary renovations.
Despite these efforts, the property remained untenanted until May 1985, when the plaintiff was put in touch with Smith Kline who were interested in renting the property for their Mr Meachem and were willing to pay a monthly rent of $5,000. The plaintiff was aware that he needed the consent of the bank to the letting so he telephoned Lin to get his approval. Lin refused to give his permission to the letting, giving the reason that if the bank wanted to sell the property, it would wish to do so with vacant possession.
The plaintiff then went to see his friend, Stanley Hay (Hay), who was a lawyer, and asked him to telephone Lin to persuade Lin to give his consent. Hay (PW4) telephoned Lin but was unable to persuade him to consent.
Hay gave evidence on behalf of the plaintiff corroborating this to some extent; he stated that around May 1985, the plaintiff had come to see him and told him that he was having problems with his banker, who had refused to give his consent as mortgagee to the plaintiff`s letting of the property to a potential tenant at a very good rental of about $6,000 a month. He then asked Hay to speak to the bank manager on his behalf, giving Hay the bank manager`s name and number. Hay recalled the name as Mr Lee. Hay then said that he telephoned the manager as a favour to the plaintiff as a friend and not in his capacity as a lawyer, and tried to persuade the manager to give his consent to the letting. Mr Lee refused, reiterating that the bank`s position was to sell the property with vacant possession.
The plaintiff was of the opinion that he could no longer afford to keep the property vacant. He had initially bought it as an investment, and was obliged to pay a monthly sum of over $8,000 as interest, compounded monthly, on his overdraft secured over it, but for over a year he had received no rental income from it which he could use to service the high interest payments. He opined that Lin was being very unreasonable in withholding consent, especially since he had spent more than $70,000 improving the property with a view to attracting tenants on Lin`s advice. He decided therefore to go ahead with the tenancy agreement with Meachem without the bank`s consent. So he telephoned Lin the day after the agreement had been signed to inform him of the letting; when Lin heard the news, he became enraged.
The plaintiff asserted that it was then that the trouble with the bank started; three days after his letting of the property to Smith Kline, the bank issued its first letter of demand that the plaintiff regularize his overdraft excesses. The plaintiff stated that after receiving the letter he telephoned Lin and told him that the bank could always sell the property, take back its money and put the surplus in his account; he mentioned to Lin that if the house was sold he did not think it would be worth less than the sum he owed the bank. The bank did not sell the property, and over the next five months sent him several demands for payment, which the plaintiff tried his best to meet.
On 8 May 1986, the plaintiff was given notice by NS Kang to deliver vacant possession of the property to the bank pursuant to a writ of possession to be executed on 11 July. The plaintiff, who was about to leave for Canada and the UK, telephoned Lin again, telling him that he was planning to go to England, and that he should sell the property. Before the plaintiff left, he called Hay and told Hay to inform Lin that he was leaving for Canada and that the bank was to sell the property. Hay gave evidence in support of this, and further asserted that he had indeed called the bank manager to convey the message as instructed.
However, despite the plaintiff`s several instructions to sell the property, the bank did not to do so. It had the execution of the writ of possession aborted a day before it was to be executed, and decided to commence bankruptcy proceedings instead, without any reasonable or probable cause. In an internal memorandum of the bank dated 24 July 1986, written by one of the assistant managers Edmund Teo (`Teo`) to Lin, the deputy general manager Brocato, and the legal department officer Lillian Lim, inquiring whether bankruptcy proceedings were to be instituted, Lin`s reply was `(P)roceed to bankruptcy`. This recommendation was accepted by the management committee of the bank. The plaintiff contended that Lin, who had become enraged with the plaintiff after the plaintiff had defied him in letting the property, had deliberately ignored the plaintiff`s instructions to sell, and had instead used his position in the bank to prosecute the bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff.
To further substantiate this proposition, the plaintiff asserted that there could have been no sound and valid reason for the bank to choose to make the plaintiff a bankrupt instead of realizing its security over the property. It was not disputed that the bank took no steps to enforce their judgment in any other way; for example, the bank was aware that the plaintiff had a substantial shareholding in Vermont Realty Pte Ltd, a valuable company which owned the Tropicana Niteclub at Scotts Road, but it made no attempt to secure those shares by obtaining a charging order.
The bank`s stated reason for aborting the execution of the writ of possession over the property on 10 July 1986 was that it did not wish to sell the property subject to the tenancy, and that it had only realized that the property was tenanted when Fong (DW4) visited it on 25 April 1986.
The plaintiff contended firstly that this was not so since Lin had been well aware of Smith Kline`s tenancy since May 1985. This was directly supported by the visit report made by Fong after his visit to the property (see AB168), upon which Fong stated that the plaintiff had `ceased to deposit rental check` since the bank had instituted the action against the plaintiff. This evidenced the fact that the bank was aware that the plaintiff`s quarterly deposits into his account since May 1985 had come from rental payments, and that accordingly the property must have been tenanted at the time.
Secondly, the bank`s stated refusal to sell without vacant possession could not have been made seriously, since the bank on discovering Smith Kline`s tenancy took no steps to obtain vacant possession from the tenant, which it could have done easily, as it was not disputed that the tenancy would not be binding on the bank. Instead, despite this stated reason, the bank chose to enter into a binding tenancy agreement with Smith Kline on 5 November 1987, which was certain to prevent the sale of the property with vacant possession, and eventually in August 1988 sold the property subject to this encumbrance at a lower price. In the meantime, the plaintiff`s debts due to unserviced interest on the overdraft had been left to escalate steadily.
The plaintiff concluded that the bank could have had no good commercial purpose behind the bankruptcy proceedings. The bank`s suggestion that the plaintiff had serious financial problems and was evading his creditors, in particular the Comptroller of Income Tax, who sent the bank a letter appointing them as agents for the satisfaction of the plaintiff`s income tax arrears, was proved to be fallacious when the plaintiff produced his income tax documents in court, showing that he had in fact received a refund from the Comptroller of Income Tax. Lin`s statement that his objective in prosecuting the bankruptcy proceedings was to persuade the plaintiff to come to the bank and negotiate was equally untrue.
The plaintiff adduced further evidence of the bank`s unreasonable behaviour in its dealings with him in the litigation, which would go towards proving malice on Lin`s part. He asserted that the bank took no real steps to see that he was aware of the bankruptcy proceedings against him; that Lin had been well aware that he had left the country at the time the bankruptcy notice was being served on him, yet was content to let service be effected at 29 Greenbank Park, and then advertised once locally in T
 he Straits Times 
. The bank was also aware that the plaintiff was a director of the Tropicana Niteclub; yet failed to make enquiries of his whereabouts there.
The plaintiff further asserted that the bank`s refusal to consent to the two week adjournment of the hearing of the bankruptcy petition fixed for 4 September 1987 was further evidence of Lin`s malice, especially in the light of Lin`s testimony that Lin`s reason for instituting the bankruptcy proceedings was to open negotiations with the plaintiff. The fortnight`s delay would not have prejudiced the bank in any way. Similarly, the bank`s solicitor`s refusal to consent to the annulment of the orders made in default of the plaintiff`s appearance on the same afternoon evidenced the bank`s unreasonable position and Lin`s malice.
The plaintiff asserted that the bank had probably been negligent and in breach of its mortgagee`s duty to exercise due care in selling the mortgaged property by initially delaying the sale of the property after the proposed execution on 11 July 1986, and in finally selling it subject to a tenancy of its own creation on 4 September 1988. Had the bank exercised its mortgagee`s right of sale earlier, firstly, the compound interest on the overdraft sum would have stopped accumulating and inflating the sum owed by the plaintiff to the bank, and secondly, the shortfall between the sale price and the amount owing would have been far less.
On the second point, the plaintiff referred to a chart marked `A` exhibited in court. This chart listed the amounts of debt owed to the bank by the plaintiff at various dates during the proceedings and compared them against the corresponding values of the property at the material time. Three different values were given by the three valuers called to give evidence; Colliers Goh & Tan and Knight Frank for the plaintiff, and APCL for the bank.
As at 11 August 1986, for example, (the date the bankruptcy notice was filed), the amount of the plaintiff`s debt was $928,403. At that date, the three values for the property (with vacant possession) were as follows: 
 
 
(1) APCL`s valuation (as at 17 February 1986; not updated) - $820,000 
 
(2) Collier`s valuation - $847,000 
 
(3) Knight Frank`s valuation - $850,000
  
 
 
The shortfall would then be some $78,000-$108,000. (Presumably this is also the approximate shortfall that would have resulted had the property been sold pursuant to the writ of possession as properly executed in July 1986.)
At the date of the hearing of the bankruptcy petition (4 September 1987), the shortfall was much less; the plaintiff`s debt was $1,047,943, and the corresponding values of the property were (1) $950,000; (2) $1,150,000 and (3) $1,030,000 - in fact if the valuation in (2) is to be accepted, there would be no shortfall.
At the date the property was actually sold (4 August 1988), the plaintiff`s debt was $1,087,748; the property was sold at APCL`s open market value of $1m, subject to tenancy. The other valuations given were (2) $1,150,000 and (3) $1,100,000 (though these appear to be with vacant possession). The shortfall was more than $87,000-$237,000 since valuation fees and auction expenses had to be paid off first.
I note from the plaintiff`s written submissions that he preferred to use as the yardstick for comparison, the indebtedness ascribed to a previous month say July 1986 (DB967) for August 1986; the evidence was that interest for August was debited on the last day of August, and that the sum specified in `A` for the month of August included the interest for August. The plaintiff`s interpretation is incorrect, as the bank statements (see DB960-1007) clearly show that the amounts due in the course of the specific months stated in `A` included the interest due from the 
 previous 
 month (which was debited on the first day of the specified month) and not the figure for interest in the specified month. Therefore, the amount specified as due for the month of August 1986 included the interest for the month of July, which was debited on 1 August.
The plaintiff asserted in conclusion from `A` that it amounted to damage suffered by him for which he was entitled to claim recompense. He asserted that if the bank had not acted tortiously, the property would have been sold in August 1986, which would have substantially discharged his debt to the bank (or if the bank had acted in September 1987, when property prices were on the increase, the sale of the property would have completely satisfied his debt). The interest which had accrued since August 1986 comprising principal and interest and been compounded, should not be recoverable by the bank after 11 August 1986. In addition, the plaintiff sought an account of the sums debited to his account with the bank, which he contended included what appeared to be the bank`s costs of the bankruptcy proceedings. This would of course be highly improper since the bank was ordered to pay the plaintiff`s costs of the bankruptcy proceedings by Lai Kew Chai J in October 1988.
 The defendants` case
The bank in its defence denied any malice or lack of reasonable and probable cause to bring the bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff. It took the position that it had every right and was at complete liberty to refuse to exercise its powers of sale as mortgagee; as specifically provided in cll 4(19), (20), (25)(a) and (28) of the mortgage, the bank, inter alia, had the liberty to decide whether or not to enforce the mortgage, to appoint a receiver of income of the property, and was only required to give the plaintiff 14 days` notice should it decide to sell the property, while the plaintiff was not entitled to participate in the sale of the property until he paid all the moneys owed to the bank.
It further took issue with the occurrence of the events concerning Lin`s alleged enragement with the plaintiff for having defied him on the letting of the property as narrated by the plaintiff. Lin gave evidence denying that he was the plaintiff`s only point of contact with the bank, asserting that he had over 300 accounts under his supervision and seven officers, who were the ones involved in the day to day management and servicing of each account. He testified that first YK Mok and then Fong had been the credit officers assigned to service the plaintiff`s account, although he admitted that he was personally involved in the supervision of the plaintiff`s account to the extent of dealing with any excesses, and in taking the necessary action for excesses.
Lin admitted to having had dinner with the plaintiff at the Hotel Equatorial, together with Fong, but denied that the plaintiff had discussed his problems in getting a tenant for the property, as well as to having made any recommendations to the plaintiff to install a swimming pool in the property. He denied having offered to grant the plaintiff an increase of $70,000 in the facility so as to finance the building of the swimming pool and renovations, by way of the fourth facility, which was later secured on the property by way of the fourth mortgage. He pointed out that the decision to increase the plaintiff`s facility to $820,000, as evidenced by the plaintiff`s credit application, was dated 13 March 1984, whereas the plaintiff had stated that the dinner meeting and Lin`s alleged offer to increase the facility had taken place in April 1984.
Further, it appeared from the bank`s remarks to the plaintiff`s credit application that that fourth facility which increased the plaintiff`s overdraft by $70,000 to $820,000 had been granted in order to regularize the plaintiff`s overdraft limit, which at the time was still $750,000 but had been exceeded by more than $70,000, and not in order to finance any renovations or swimming pool planned for the property. Lin and Fong were positive that the fourth facility was to cater for the plaintiff`s overdraft excess.
Both Lin and Fong suggested that the plaintiff was confusing the granting of the fourth facility with that of the third facility, granted in November 1982, increasing the plaintiff`s overdraft by $150,000 to $750,000. Fong testified to discussing this increase with the plaintiff over the telephone, and that the plaintiff had informed him that he wanted the additional facility to build additional amenities including a swimming pool on his property in order to attract potential tenants. This reason for requesting the increase was accordingly recorded in the annexure to the plaintiff`s credit application for the third facility, signed by Fong and Lin. Although it was established that the plaintiff had not installed the swimming pool and amenities until 1984, after the grant of the fourth facility, (which went to substantiate the plaintiff`s version of events), Fong and Lin stressed that the purpose given for the plaintiff`s request of the third facility was properly documented in the credit application and could not have been fabricated; and that it was the plaintiff`s prerogative not to use the facility for the stated purpose. It was further established that the payments made by the plaintiff for the costs of installing the swimming pool and other renovations had come out of his account with HongKong and Shanghai bank (HSBC) and not from the additional $70,000 granted in the fourth facility, though the plaintiff asserted that the money had in fact come from the bank and had been transferred to his HSBC account.
Lin also denied receiving the telephone calls from the plaintiff and Hay asking for the bank`s permission to let the property to Smith Kline, as well as the call from the plaintiff allegedly informing him that the letting had gone ahead without his consent. He stated that he did not know Hay at all, and that it was unlikely that he would have entertained discussions about an account with a third party in the manner so asserted since this could have led to a breach of the secrecy provisions of the Banking Act (Cap 19). He stated that from 15 May 1985 to 2 June 1985 he had been away in Hong Kong and China on business and would not have been in the office to receive the plaintiff`s calls. As far as he was concerned, the first time he became aware of Smith Kline`s tenancy was in April 1986 after Fong had visited the property.
Lin further denied receiving telephone calls from the plaintiff and from Hay on behalf of the plaintiff instructing him to sell the property in 1985 and 1986; he stated that the plaintiff had not informed him in 1986 that he, the plaintiff, was leaving Singapore for Canada and the UK.
Lin stated that within the bank, matters such as instructing solicitors, exercising mortgages and general decision making would be taken by the management, and if necessary involved the legal department. The general manager of the bank between 1985-1987 was a Mr Picard, who was replaced in late 1987 or early 1988 by a Mr De Lattre; the deputy general manager, Brocato, was Lin`s immediate superior in the bank. Lin asserted that he had not been involved in any decision of the bank to sell or not to sell the property, and that those decisions had been taken by the management in consultation with the legal department.
He stated that it had been Picard`s decision to enter into the new tenancy agreement with Smith Kline in November 1987, referring to a memorandum dated 15 May 1987 allegedly written and signed by Picard instructing such an action (see exh D4). In the memorandum, Brocato had made a suggestion that if a buyer could be found for the property at $950,000 it would be better to sell the property; however at the time a buyer was not sought. As for the eventual sale of the property in September 1988, Lin asserted that the matters were handled by the legal department as the plaintiff`s credit file had been transferred there from his department in October or November 1987.
Lin stated that the decision to commence bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff was not made by him but by the management, and the final decision had been made by Brocato, although he admitted that he had made a recommendation to the management that bankruptcy proceedings be instituted, and that the management would place weight on his recommendation. In his evidence, Teo (DW7) confirmed that the decision to make the plaintiff a bankrupt had been made by Brocato on Lin`s recommendation. From then on, Lin and Brocato in conjunction with the legal department took the relevant decisions concerning the conduct of the bankruptcy proceedings; Teo in his capacity with the credit administration department participated in some of these decisions.
Lin denied any improper motive or malice on his part toward the plaintiff, and that his role in the bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff had been motivated by such ill-will. In any event, his evidence was that he was not in a position to make, and in fact did not make, the final decisions on behalf of the bank in relation to its instituting and the conduct of, the bankruptcy proceedings, as well as the exercise of its rights of sale as mortgagee.
Lin stated that one of his reasons for recommending that bankruptcy proceedings be taken against the plaintiff was to protect the bank`s interest, to `force him to come to the bank to talk to us`, since the plaintiff had shown no interest in resolving the problems arising from his failure to service his considerable overdraft. Another reason was the tenancy over the property; Lin stated that the bank`s solicitors had advised that the taking of possession and sale be withheld, and that it appeared that vacant possession could not be obtained.
Fong gave evidence that he had ascertained that the property was tenanted on his visit in April 1986. He agreed that he had written on the visit report, `Client has stopped depositing rental cheque into account since we have instituted action against him`, which would indicate that the bank had been aware that the plaintiff had made previous deposits of cheques which came from the letting of the property. It also appeared from the bank`s statements of the plaintiff`s account in 1985 that a deposit of $15,000 was made in June, which could well constitute the rent at $5,000 a month, which was to be paid quarterly, for which Smith Kline was renting the property. In August, another deposit of $15,000 was received. Fong stated that he had not known at the time of the deposits that they were deposits of rental of the property, but that after ascertaining that the property had indeed been tenanted on 25 April 1986, he had examined the plaintiff`s 1985 bank statements and assumed that the sums deposited by him at the time were rent deposits arising out of that tenancy, and that all such deposits had ceased in December 1985 when the action had been instituted against him.
The bank asserted that the steps it had taken in choosing not to exercise its rights of sale in 1986 but instead to make the plaintiff a bankrupt were reasonable and justifiable. It maintained that it had behaved perfectly reasonably toward the plaintiff in not calling in the entire overdraft amount at the outset, which it was entitled to do (and which it would have done had Lin been as enraged by the plaintiff as the plaintiff claimed), but had instead sent the plaintiff five letters over the space of six months asking him to regularize his overdraft and suggesting concessionary payment schemes by which he could most conveniently do so, giving him more time to settle his debts. In his evidence, Lin stated that this showed the bank`s flexible and tolerant attitude toward the plaintiff. The plaintiff, however, had not been co-operative; he had not adhered to the bank`s generous payment instalment plans, nor had he suggested any other scheme of payment, and he had failed to reduce his overdraft excesses or to service the interest on his account in a satisfactory manner.
Eventually, the bank was compelled to commence legal action against the plaintiff in December 1985. Lin gave evidence that at the time the bank was considering selling the property. He testified that the management of the bank, and Brocato in particular, had wanted to sell the property with vacant possession, and that that was also the recommendation of the bank`s legal department. This was one of the reasons why the bank, on discovering that the property was tenanted, had decided not to go ahead with the execution of the writ of possession and the sale of the property in July 1986. Lin stated that the primary reason for the decision not to sell in 1986 was the fact that the property market was depressed and weak from the end of 1985 (because of the recession), and did not pick up again until March 1987, and that a sale at that time would not fetch a good price. He further stated that after March 1987, there was no sale because the outstanding sum had by then increased to the extent that it was higher than the market value of the property, as given by APCL, at all times.
Roy Sharma (Sharma) of NS Kang testified that the bank wanted to exercise its rights and to sell the property as early as December 1985, and that he had been instructed to obtain vacant possession of the property. He sent the plaintiff a notice to quit which was not complied with, and from then on the plaintiff had failed to respond to any further correspondence, notices or orders served on him by NS Kang in the bank`s proceedings to enforce the mortgages and obtain possession of the property. Sharma (DW5) advised the bank in a letter dated 12 December 1985 that the proposed auction of the property could only take place after the bank had obtained vacant possession of the property. However, it was then discovered that the property was tenanted, and vacant possession could not be obtained.
Sharma expressed the view that if the tenants refused to voluntarily surrender possession of the property, the bank would have to institute proceedings against the tenant to recover possession, which, if the tenant chose to defend, would have taken some three to five years to effect, given the lengthy waiting periods for legal action prevalent in the courts at the time. Sharma stated that he saw no reason why the bank could not issue a bankruptcy notice against the plaintiff instead, as it had a monetary judgment against the plaintiff.
The bank asserted that it had not been in breach of its duties as mortgagee in not selling the property in August 1986 and in selling it in September 1988. In August 1986, the property would have fetched about $847,000-$850,000, which would not have been sufficient to meet the plaintiff`s debt to the bank of some $928,403. Further, the price fetched at the time could have been far less than the prices quoted as the sale would have been subject to Smith Kline`s tenancy, assuming that the tenants had refused to hand possession over to the bank. It would have been imprudent for the bank to have sold the property in August 1986, given the fact that the shortfall would have been about $81,000, and given the plaintiff`s lack of communication with them, his failure to settle his debts and their knowledge of the state of his financial affairs. All the bank was required to do in the discharge of its duties was to get the best price reasonably obtainable, and to take reasonable care to obtain the true market value of the property, at the time it chose to sell the property. It was not disputed that the price of $1m at which the property was eventually sold in 1988 was reasonable and not at an undervalue.
The bank raised the further issue of the plaintiff`s financial status at the material time. It asserted that the plaintiff`s failure to find a tenant for the property from April 1984 to May 1985 after Karel Schutte`s lease had expired caused a financial strain on the plaintiff`s resources; during that period the plaintiff was only able to deposit a sum of $60,000 into his account, which was insufficient to service the interest on his overdraft, and leaving his account far in excess of its limit. The bank further asserted that the plaintiff had left Singapore for Canada and the UK in 1986 because of the recession in Singapore at the time; the plaintiff admitted in cross-examination that the economic conditions in Canada and the UK were much better than those in Singapore with regards to his business.
At the time, the plaintiff`s known assets were the property, the premises at 29 Greenbank Park, and his shareholding in Vermont Realty. His financial liabilities were the facility and interest thereon with the bank, and similar overdraft facilities of not less than $550,000 with Overseas Union bank (OUB) which were secured by a mortgage of 29 Greenbank Park. Eventually OUB sold off 29 Greenbank Park in a mortgagee sale in 1988 and the plaintiff had to meet a shortfall of $100,000 between the sale proceeds and the amount owing to OUB. Upon the cessation of rent generated from the letting of the property, the plaintiff`s only source of income between 1986 and 1988 would be dividends from Vermont Realty, as confirmed by the plaintiff in cross-examination.
As shown from the plaintiff`s tax documents, the dividends received in 1986 were $50,149 and in 1987 and 1988, they were $42,000. It was on the strength of this income alone that the plaintiff had supported himself and his family in Canada and the UK for two years, put his daughter through public school, and dealt in shares and unit trusts in Hong Kong. It was argued that the plaintiff must have been under severe financial constraints; the plaintiff himself had admitted that he would have had to sell his house in the UK in order to pay any shortfall to the bank if the property had been sold in 1986.
The bank thus submitted that it was entitled to surmise that the plaintiff was in dire financial straits; especially after receipt of the letter from the Comptroller of Income Tax stating that the plaintiff was in arrears of some $10,276 in his income tax, and after the plaintiff`s failure to pay property tax on the property of $26,498.95 from 1985-1988, which the bank had to pay. The bank suggested that these considerations would reasonably lead to a decision to institute bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff.
On the question of the bank`s failure to do more to notify the plaintiff of the bankruptcy proceedings, the bank asserted that it was entitled to effect service on 29 Greenbank Park and substituted service by advertisement in the manner that it did, and that any unreasonable conduct could not be inferred from this. Rule 18 of the bank`s Rules and Regulations, which had been signed by the plaintiff, stated that all communications sent to the last address of the customer registered with the bank, in this case, 29 Greenbank Park, were to be deemed duly delivered to the customer. The plaintiff had left the country by this time, and it was for him to ensure that his mail was properly and regularly sent on to him at his overseas addresses. The bank asserted that it had not been told that the plaintiff had left the country, and even on the plaintiff`s assertion to the contrary, the plaintiff had admitted that he had not given Lin his overseas addresses. The plaintiff had also admitted that mail sent to him at 29 Greenbank Park had been forwarded to him in England, at least up to February 1987.
As for imputations of unreasonable conduct from the bank`s refusal to consent to the 14 day adjournment and the later refusal to consent to the setting aside of the orders, the bank`s case was that its refusals were completely reasonable under the circumstances. In his evidence, Teo stated that there was no justification in consenting to the adjournment, given the fact that the plaintiff had failed to respond to any communications from the bank or their solicitors, leading the bank to believe that he was avoiding settling his account. Teo opined that if the plaintiff was now to come to the bank to seek its indulgence in granting him an adjournment, he should have made reference to some arrangement or repayment schedule to settle the outstanding debt. Sharma gave his professional opinion that the adjournment was refused because it was an eleventh hour application that had been made without a reason, and especially with no indication that it was requested because the plaintiff was considering settling the debt.
 The findings
Counsel for the plaintiff in his written submission urged me to make the following findings of fact: 
 
 
(1) that Lin was the plaintiff`s sole point of contact with the bank; 
 
(2) that Lin was in a position to procure the bank to institute bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff; 
 
(3) that the events as narrated by the plaintiff as to the requests made to Lin for his consent to the tenancy to Smith Kline be accepted; 
 
(4) that thereafter Lin used his position to try to ensure that the plaintiff was made a bankrupt; 
 
(5) that the bank had no commercial reason for refusing to exercise its powers of sale in 1986; that although it stated that it had done so because it could not get vacant possession of the property, first, it had in fact had knowledge that the property was tenanted, second, it took no steps to obtain vacant possession of the property after allegedly discovering that it was tenanted, and third, it finally sold the property subject to a tenancy of its own creation; 
 
(6) that the bank had no commercial reason for making the plaintiff a bankrupt; it could have realized its security over the property, it could have sought to enforce the judgment it had obtained, but it did not. The allegation that the plaintiff was badly in debt was proved to be untrue; 
 
(7) that the bank had acted unreasonably in its conduct of the legal proceedings against him.
  
 
 
From these seven issues of fact, the plaintiff sought to make out his case of malicious prosecution - that Lin was in a position to have the bankruptcy proceedings instituted by the bank and in fact did so, that he did so out of a motive of malice against the plaintiff, which had arisen out of the events found in para (3) above; and that there had been no reasonable and probable cause for having the proceedings brought against the plaintiff, in the light of (5) and (6) above. I shall proceed to deal with the issues of fact in their contexts with the relevant issues of law.
I accept Lin`s evidence that he played no part in the day to day servicing of the plaintiff`s account, leaving that aspect of things to the credit officer assigned to that account and merely playing a supervisory role. However, I do not doubt that from the plaintiff`s point of view, Lin was his point of contact with the bank; it was Lin who initiated his relations with the bank, and whom he stated he contacted when he wanted the increases in his overdraft facility. From the relevant documents, it certainly appears that Lin was the senior bank officer who recommended and proposed the second, third and fourth increases, along with his junior credit officer, Mok initially, and then Fong. I accept that it would be quite natural for the plaintiff to regard the most senior officer as his point of contact with the bank. In this regard I presume it makes it more likely that the plaintiff would have telephoned Lin personally and spoken to him about his problems with meeting payments on his overdraft, but otherwise I think nothing much turns on this issue.
 Proceedings brought by the defendants
Of more relevance and importance is the issue of whether Lin was in a position to procure the institution of bankruptcy proceedings on behalf of the bank, and whether he in fact did so in this instance. Lin had testified that the decision to make a debtor a bankrupt was one taken by the management of the bank, but one towards which he would be in a position to make a recommendation, which would be given weight by the management. In this instance it appears that the bank`s deputy general manager, Brocato, was responsible for the final decision to make the plaintiff a bankrupt, to whose actions and motives of course no question of malice attaches. It would also appear, though, that Lin was in a senior position in the bank in which his views and recommendations would be given importance, and I am of the opinion that, on the balance of probabilities, he would be in a position of influence, at least, in the procuring of the institution of bankruptcy proceedings against the plaintiff. Having decided that, Lin`s admission to having so recommended in this instance would be tantamount to having in fact so done in this case.
I am of the view, though, that the fact of Brocato`s acceptance of Lin`s recommendation would place some weight on the existence of some reasonable and probable cause of bringing the petition, since I cannot assume that Lin`s influence was to such an extent as would convince the deputy general manager of the bank to decide on instituting a completely useless and unreasonable course of action. Not having had the benefit of Brocato`s testimony, however, I am unable to place much weight on this surmise.
 Malice
I now turn to the question of the events leading up to the plaintiff`s renting of the property to Smith Kline. I am unable to accept the plaintiff`s contention that the construction of the swimming pool and the renovations to the property had been suggested by Lin in April 1984, and that Lin had then offered to increase the plaintiff`s facility with the bank by $70,000 to finance these proposals. This flies in the face of the clear documentation of the third and fourth facility, which I have no reason whatsoever to believe have been fabricated. From these documents, I am satisfied that the third facility had been granted to the plaintiff on the strength of the reasons mentioned, ie for the construction of a swimming pool and additional amenities, and having regard to the circumstances surrounding the granting of the fourth facility, I am similarly convinced that that granting was done for the purpose of regularizing the plaintiff`s account, and not for the purpose stated by the plaintiff. Also, it appears that the fourth facility was mooted and granted a month before the meeting at Hotel Equatorial in April 1984.
Although the swimming pool seems to have been constructed in 1984, and not in 1982 in accordance with the granting of the third facility, I do not think that the inference that the fourth facility had been granted to finance the swimming pool should be drawn. The plaintiff had asserted that he had used the credit granted in the third facility to purchase his house in England, and I see no reason to disbelieve him, but this would not have precluded him from proposing a different usage of the facility when applying to the bank for its grant. In any event, the financing of the swimming pool construction was shown to have come from the plaintiff`s HSBC account.
I next turn to whether the telephone conversations between the plaintiff and Lin concerning the bank`s consent to the tenancy to Smith Kline had in fact taken place. Given the plaintiff`s relationship with Lin and his knowledge that the tenanting of the property required the bank`s consent, I would have thought it likely that the plaintiff would have tried to obtain Lin`s consent before proceeding with the tenancy. From an objective standpoint, however, I see no reason why Lin would have refused to consent to the plaintiff`s letting of the property in May 1985. Admittedly, the bank seems to have been consistently concerned about being able to sell with vacant possession, and at the time there seems to have been consternation in all quarters as to the state of the plaintiff`s overdraft, but in May 1985 there had been no sign that matters had reached such a critical state that the bank was contemplating selling the property. It seems more likely to me that the bank would have been delighted that the plaintiff had been finally able to obtain a satisfactory tenant, since this would mean that the plaintiff was in a better position to service the interest payments on his account. This would also be more consistent with the position of flexibility and accommodation which the bank had maintained with regard to the plaintiff.
I also doubt that the first letter of demand, which was admittedly written a few scant days after the alleged confrontation over the telephone between the plaintiff and Lin, and co-signed by Lin, was issued in a furious response to that confrontation. If Lin had become as furious as the plaintiff had asserted by the confrontation, it was likely that he would have issued something far more drastic than the politely-worded letter noting the bank`s `disappointment` that the plaintiff had not reduced his overdraft excesses, and seeking his `co-operation` to reduce them within the next ten days so that the matter need not be referred to the bank`s solicitors. Certainly, if the plaintiff had indeed gone ahead and entered into a tenancy agreement which he was not entitled to do under the mortgage, and then had informed the bank that he had done so, Lin would have had a more justifiable cause of rage than a sense of having been personally defied, for the plaintiff would have been in breach of contract with the bank. The most natural response would have been for the bank to have expressed outrage, called in the overdraft immediately, and taken action for possession of the property as against both the plaintiff and the tenant, especially if the bank had been so concerned with maintaining vacant possession as regards the property to the extent that it refused to consent to the letting of it to a lucrative tenant. It would most certainly not have sent the plaintiff five letters in as many months, proposing schemes of payment and giving him every opportunity to settle his overdraft.
On the other hand, I did take into consideration the fact of Fong`s having stated in the April 1986 visit report that the plaintiff had stopped depositing the `rental cheque`. The plaintiff referred to this as evidencing the fact that the bank must have known that the property had been tenanted, and invited me to draw the inference that the only way this knowledge could have come about would have been from Lin, who had been told this by the plaintiff in the events alleged. I agree that this inference is compelling, certainly on a plain reading of the words used in the visit report. However, Fong`s explanation that he had surmised that the plaintiff had made earlier deposits of rental by going back and checking the plaintiff`s account statements, as independently supported by Lin in his testimony later, seems to me to be not unreasonable, and in the light of what I have said earlier, I accept it.
I also considered the evidence of Hay, which did corroborate the plaintiff`s version of events at material points. However, I had doubts as to the accuracy of his recollection of the events, which had occurred eight years prior to his testimony in court, and which had taken place, as asserted by him, in the casual situation of his doing a friend a favour, rather than a solicitor representing his client. For example, he had stated that the person he had spoken to was a Mr Lee, `the manager`; he could not remember the description of the property or of the proposed tenant, and could not even remember the name of the bank. Further, he had originally testified that he had never done any legal work for the plaintiff, and then it was subsequently discovered that he had in fact acted for the plaintiff in early 1985, in a proposed letting of the property to McDermott SEA Pte Ltd, and had drafted a tenancy agreement in this respect (McDermott later aborted the transaction). Hay could not now remember the details of this matter, and the file which he opened in accordance with it has since been destroyed. I think it not unlikely that he had confused his acting in this matter in early 1985 with the alleged telephone call to the bank manager who had refused to give the plaintiff his consent to the letting of the property in May 1985, and that he may well have made a telephone call to a bank manager in order to get consent for the letting to McDermott or to some other proposed letting. I have similar doubts regarding Hay`s evidence that he had telephoned Lin in March 1986 on the plaintiff`s instructions to tell Lin that the plaintiff was leaving the country and for the bank to sell the property.
Accordingly, I find that it was more likely than not that the alleged telephone conversations and refusals had not taken place. I am also of the opinion that it was not likely that the plaintiff had informed Lin to sell the property, and that he had told Lin that he was leaving for Canada without even being asked to leave a contact address.
In the light of the foregoing, I think it most unlikely that Lin had used his position in the bank to make the plaintiff a bankrupt out of malice. In this context I take malice to refer to an improper and wrongful motive. I see nothing in the plaintiff`s evidence to indicate that Lin had acted in any way that was motivated by personal enmity or malice against the plaintiff as alleged. When Lin was cross-examined on the point, he gave as his personal motive for bringing the bankruptcy petition his desire to have the plaintiff come to negotiate with the bank, and to co-operate with it in finding some way to pay off his debts, hardly evidence of ill-will towards the plaintiff.
Further, as I have already mentioned, the bank seemed to show, certainly before the proceedings began in earnest, an attitude of accommodation and flexibility towards the plaintiff. I also saw nothing unreasonable in its conduct of all the legal proceedings against the plaintiff. I find the plaintiff`s suggestion that the bank should have tried to serve the bankruptcy notice on the plaintiff in some other way than by advertisement unreasonable and impracticable, given the fact that the plaintiff had left the country without informing the bank and without even giving his address to members of his own family. As for the bank`s refusal to consent to the adjournments and the like, I find its stand entirely reasonable and in keeping with a sensible and cautious attitude, in the light of the non response of the plaintiff in the past, to all legal proceedings.
 Want of reasonable and probable cause
Counsel for the plaintiff cited the case of 
 Johnson v Emerson and Sparrow 
 in support of his proposition that malice may be inferred from the absence of reasonable and probable cause for presentation of the petition. This inference is of course a natural one, but it does not detract from the principle of law that the requirements of malice and of reasonable and probable cause are separate issues and must both be proved for the plaintiff to succeed. In the words of Salmond and Heuston on the 
 Law of Torts 
 (20th Ed) at p 411: 
 
So long as legal process is honestly used for its proper purpose, mere negligence or want of sound judgment in the use of it creates no liability; and, conversely, if there are reasonable grounds for the proceedings ... no impropriety or motive on the part of the person instituting these proceedings is in itself any ground of liability.
 
 
 
In this context, I take want of reasonable and probable cause to mean want of genuine belief, based on reasonable grounds, that there were good grounds in law for presentation of the bankruptcy petition at the time it was presented, upon an alleged act of bankruptcy.
On the issue of reasonable and probable cause, counsel submitted that in discharging the onus of proof as to the absence of reasonable and probable cause for presentation of the petition the plaintiff need only adduce slight evidence of the fact, since he is required to prove a negative proposition. In support of this contention, he cited the authority of 
 Cotton v James 
. He then stated that since it was accepted that the bankruptcy notice on which the petition depended was bad ab initio, there could not have been reasonable and probable cause for presenting a petition in the absence of a valid available act of bankruptcy.
Dealing with the second contention first, this argument seems to me flawed in principle. It was not in dispute that the bankruptcy notice in this case was bad ab initio 
 because 
 it included a claim for untaxed costs, which was not a liquidated sum, as established in the case of 
 Low Mun v Chung Kiaw 
 B
 ank Ltd 
, and that accordingly, the notice was rescinded by consent and the proceedings terminated in favour of the plaintiff, satisfying the last criterion of the tort of malicious prosecution. However, the mere fact that the bankruptcy notice upon which the plaintiff`s act of bankruptcy was based contained a technical flaw does not automatically make any petition then brought as one brought without reasonable and probable cause.
This is clear from the case of 
 Johnson v Emerson 
 itself. In that case, a bankruptcy notice was served on the plaintiff debtor, who applied to have it dismissed. The court on hearing the application granted the plaintiff a stay of proceedings, ordering that he execute a bond with sureties within seven days, and an action be brought to try the debt. The defendant then filed a bankruptcy petition, stating as the act of bankruptcy the plaintiff`s failure to pay the debt claimed within seven days of the presentation of the bankruptcy petition. This was obviously flawed in the light of the stay previously granted, and no act of bankruptcy was available. However, as was held by Kelly CB and Cleasby B, the defendant would only be liable if he either knew that the act of bankruptcy was untrue, or at least did not bona fide believe it to be true.
Similarly, in 
 Horner v Irwin & Sons Ltd 
, in an action for maliciously executing a writ of fieri facias, a plaintiff sued his judgment creditor for permitting the plaintiff`s property to be sold by public auction when the judgment debt had already been paid off. Gibson J held that the plaintiff had not proved that the defendants had been aware that the judgment debt had already been paid at the time they had the writ of fieri facias executed, and therefore were not liable.
In the instant case, I am certain that the bank had no idea that the bankruptcy notice as issued was technically flawed by reason of the rule in the 
 Low Mun 
 case.1 The fact therefore that there was no valid act of bankruptcy committed by the plaintiff in this case does not mean that it was brought without reasonable and probable cause.
As for the point on the onus of proof, I do not think the decision in 
 Cotton v James 
 detracts from the established position that the burden is on the plaintiff to prove lack of reasonable and probable cause. As Bowen LJ said in the leading case of 
 Abrath v North Eastern Railway Co 
 at p 457: 
 
In an action for malicious prosecution the plaintiff has the burden throughout of establishing that the circumstances of the prosecution were such that a judge can see no reasonable or probable cause for instituting it. In one sense that is the assertion of a negative, and we have been pressed with the proposition that when a negative is to be made out the onus of proof shifts. That is not so. If the assertion of a negative is an essential part of the plaintiff`s case, the proof of the assertion still rests upon the plaintiff. The terms `negative` and `affirmative` are after all relative and not absolute. In dealing with the question of negligence, that term may be considered either as negative or affirmative according to the definition adopted in measuring the duty which is neglected. Wherever a person asserts affirmatively as part of his case that a certain state of facts is present or is absent, or that a certain thing is insufficient for a particular purpose, that is an averment which he is bound to prove positively.
 
 
 
In 
 Cotton v James 
, at the end of the plaintiff`s case, the defendant chose to claim nonsuit. The jury found for the plaintiff. The defendant appealed, claiming that the plaintiff had not adduced sufficient evidence to prove the lack of reasonable and probable cause for the prosecution. The appeal was dismissed; the court held that the slight evidence presented by the plaintiff was sufficient for the jury to have found for him since this evidence was uncontradicted by the defence.
It would follow from this that since the bank in the instant case has put forward ample evidence in support of its contention that it had reasonable and probable cause to bring the bankruptcy proceedings, it is for the plaintiff to prove on a balance of probabilities that that was not so.
Although I have found as a fact that Lin on behalf of the bank had not acted maliciously in bringing the bankruptcy petition against the plaintiff, I do not think I should stop there, but should go on to consider whether the bankruptcy proceedings were brought with reasonable and probable cause, since counsel for both sides have addressed me at length on both the legal and evidential points in this issue, and because an inference of malice may be drawn from the absence of a reasonable and probable cause.
In particular, counsel for the bank drew my attention to the dicta of Chan Sek Keong J in 
 Re Shaw, ex p Banque Indosuez 
, where he granted the bank`s appeal for a stay against the order for costs of the bankruptcy proceedings made against it by Lai Kew Chai J until after this case had been decided. He stated at p 281G: 
 
The debtor cannot succeed in Suit No 1056 of 1989 unless he can prove the creditor`s malice and 
 the absence of a debt due by the debtor to the creditor at the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings
. Emphasis mine.)
 
 
 
Counsel for the plaintiff contended that this is an incorrect statement of law which is inconsistent with both principle and authority. The existence or absence of a debt should be irrelevant as the proper question for the court to decide is whether the creditor had acted without reasonable and probable cause.
While I understand the plaintiff`s objection to Chan Sek Keong J`s statement, I am of the opinion that the learned judge did not mean to substitute the requirement for the absence of a debt with that for the want of reasonable and probable cause. I believe that he was in fact making the statement in the context of reasonable and probable cause; ie that it is only the absence of a genuine debt due by debtor to creditor that there would be a lack of reasonable and probable cause for the bringing of a creditor`s bankruptcy petition.
In 
 Clerk & Lindsell on Torts 
 (16th Ed) at p 1063 para 19-39, the following pronouncement is made: 
 
A judgment creditor instituting bankruptcy proceedings was under no duty to inquire into the solvency or otherwise of the judgment debtor nor to exhaust other methods of execution before serving a bankruptcy notice under the Bankruptcy Act 1914. That Act conferred upon the judgment creditor the right to present a bankruptcy petition if the debtor failed to comply with the bankruptcy notice. Consequently it could only be said that a judgment creditor had no reasonable and probable cause for instituting bankruptcy proceedings where either (i) there was evidence that the judgment itself had been obtained by fraud, or (ii) there is evidence that subsequent to the judgment the defendant discovered methods which did or should have led him to believe that the judgment was wrongly obtained.
 
 
 
As authority for this proposition, Clerk & Lindsell cited the unreported case of 
 Radivojevic v LR Industries 
, a decision of the English Court of Appeal (Civil Division) on 22 November 1984.7 The case concerned a plaintiff`s action against the defendants, his judgment creditors, for maliciously bankrupting him. The defendants had obtained judgment against the plaintiff for a sum which the latter had always maintained that he never owed them; on his failure to pay, the defendants issued a bankruptcy notice on the judgment debt which was not complied with, and in due course the plaintiff was made a bankrupt. It was then established that in his conduct of those proceedings for the plaintiff, the plaintiff`s solicitor had been grossly negligent and dishonest, and the plaintiff succeeded in his suit for damages against his solicitors. He then applied to have the bankruptcy petition annulled on the ground that he had committed no available act of bankruptcy because he did not owe the money under the judgment debt, and this was granted for reasons not appealed against. The plaintiff then brought the malicious prosecution action against the defendants, which was dismissed; he appealed to the Court of Appeal.
The court was unanimous in dismissing his appeal, and in rejecting his counsel`s submissions that the defendants had been wrong to bring bankruptcy proceedings against him as they had no reason to believe he was insolvent, and without first exhausting other methods of execution. O`Connor LJ said: 
 
It seems to me that where a judgment creditor has a valid judgment in a court of competent jurisdiction, then he is entitled to give a bankruptcy notice on it, and that the only way in which it can be said that he has no reasonable and probable cause for believing that he was justified in serving a bankruptcy notice, would be to prove either that the judgment had been obtained by fraud, or that after the judgment he had discovered matters that did or should have led him to believe that that judgment had been wrongly obtained. It is necessary to do that because, short of that, he had reasonable and probable cause to believe that he has the right to serve a valid and good bankruptcy notice.
 
 
 
Slade LJ said: 
 
I turn briefly to consider the alleged lack of reasonable and probable cause in relation to the facts of the present case. Under the Bankruptcy Act 1914 a debtor commits an act of bankruptcy if a creditor has obtained final judgment against him, for any amount, and execution of it not having been stayed, has served on him in this country a bankruptcy notice and the debtor does not within the time limited either comply with the requirements of the notice, or satisfy the court that he has a counterclaim, set-off or cross-demand which equals or exceeds the amount of the judgment debt, which he could not set up in the action in which the judgment was obtained.
 
 
 
...
[T]he Bankruptcy Act 1914 conferred on any unpaid judgment creditor ... in a specified sum of Â£50 or more, a statutory right to present a bankruptcy petition if the debtor ... had committed an act of bankruptcy within three months of the presentation of the petition. It conferred on the court a corresponding right to make a receiving order on any such petition.
In the light of this statutory background, it is clear on the facts of the present case that the defendants had a perfectly good right to issue their bankruptcy petition ...
The learned judge then considered the analogy with the company insolvency laws at the time, and concluded: 
 
Similar principles apply, in my opinion, in bankruptcy. A judgment creditor in a sum exceeding the specified amount, after a bankruptcy notice has been duly served and not complied with in the specified time, is entitled to launch his bankruptcy petition without first resorting to execution, even if he believes that the debtor may be fully able to pay his debts.
 
 
 
I would respectfully adopt the decision and reasoning of their Lordships, especially Slade LJ`s interpretation of the rights given to judgment creditors under the Bankruptcy Act 1914, which for our purposes is almost identical to our Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20) (`the Act`). As long as the conditions and time periods in ss 3(f) and 5 thereof are satisfied, the Act confers an absolute right to a judgment creditor to present a bankruptcy petition against a debtor without first resorting to execution, and without having to ascertain his solvency. Further, I am of the opinion that this principle extends to judgment creditors who are secured creditors, who arguably have by realizing their security a more natural and convenient way of recovering the judgment debt, since express provision is made for them in the bankruptcy process; for example in s 5(2) of the Act. The presence or absence of other means of execution might be relevant to the question of motive, but cannot take away the judgment creditor`s right to present a bankruptcy petition upon a judgment properly and honestly obtained.
Upon this authority, it is clear that there can be no question of the bank not having reasonable and probable cause to bring the bankruptcy petition by reason of their judgment debt. There was no doubt that the debt was owed to them by the plaintiff in the originating summons action or that the judgment in that action had been properly and bona fide obtained. Similarly, there is no doubt in my mind that the bank had the bona fide belief that the conditions in ss 3(f) and 5 of the Act were satisfied. Therefore, any argument that the bank had no reasonable and probable cause to bring the bankruptcy proceedings as it should have first realized its security over the property or resorted to other means of execution before bringing the proceedings cannot be sustained.
As for any inference of malice toward the plaintiff to be drawn from the bank`s failure to sell the property and to exhaust other means of execution, I accept Lin`s evidence that he was not directly involved in the decisions to sell the property and to create the new tenancy over the property. In any case, in the light of my finding that the bank was unaware of the tenancy to Smith Kline until April 1986, the bank`s aborting of the process of taking possession and sale of the property was a reasonable reaction. I do not think the bank`s subsequent shelving of the plans to sell was done with the express malice and intent to let the plaintiff`s debts accumulate, although this was the result of the failure to sell. Perhaps the bank`s decisions in postponing the sale of the property and collecting the rental from Smith Kline while engaging in protracted bankruptcy litigation with the plaintiff, and then having to sell the property encumbered with the tenancy and with a greater shortfall, were errors of judgment, but in my view the bank had reasons for doing this at the time and that these were genuine and not unreasonable given their proper context.
In making these decisions the bank relied on the valuations given by APCL, which were lower than the retrospective valuations made by Colliers and Knight Frank for the plaintiff. I was invited to make a finding on the different and competing valuations as arrived at, and was especially urged by the plaintiff to reject the valuation given by APCL for the defendants; however, given my finding of law on the point of want of reasonable and probable cause, I do not think it is necessary to enter into a detailed comparison of their valuation methods and their testimony. It is enough for our purposes to conclude that, as stated by the valuer (Lydia Sng) for Knight Frank in her evidence, any differences in valuation within a 10% margin would be acceptable and not unreasonable, and I see nothing in the evidence that would indicate that the bank`s valuations were flawed.
I also make no finding as to the issue of whether it was reasonable for the bank to conclude that the plaintiff was in financial difficulties, given the direction that this is not relevant to the question of want of reasonable and probable cause in the 
 Radivojevic 
case,7 and since neither Lin nor any other officer of the bank actually raised this point as one of their reasons for having the bankruptcy proceedings instituted against the plaintiff.
Accordingly, I find that the plaintiff has failed to prove his case on the issues of malice as well as lack of reasonable and probable cause for bringing the petition, he is not entitled to the reliefs he has claimed, and I dismiss his action with costs.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This is an action by a client against a firm of solicitors claiming damages on account of professional negligence. The action is only against those solicitors who were at the material times the partners of the defendant firm, namely, Liu Ming Yuen (Liu), B Ganeshamoorthy and Lim Hong Kan. It is Liu`s alleged negligent omission which formed the subject of this action. Liu has since 1 November 1989 ceased to practice in Singapore. On that date he assumed the office of a Senior Crown Counsel in Hong Kong. He is still holding that office.
 Background and plaintiffs` case
The plaintiffs are property developers and were during the period 1982 to 1987 developing a project known as Rainbow Gardens on Lot 3660 of Mukim 5, off Toh Tuck Road.
On 29 April 1983 the plaintiffs entered into an agreement to sell unit #03-03 of Rainbow Gardens to one Lee Kok How (Lee) at a price of $480,000. On 17 May 1983 the plaintiffs entered into another agreement to sell unit #03-05 of the same development to one Neo Hiam Huat (Neo) at the same price. In both these sales and purchases M/s Chee & Teo acted for both the developers and the purchasers. For completeness I should add that at about the same period of time the plaintiffs had also sold three other units to three friends of Lee and Neo.
In 1985 recession hit Singapore. There was a significant downturn in the property market. Both Lee and Neo wanted to give up the purchase of the two units. So did their three friends. They were prepared to let the plaintiffs forfeit the 20% of the purchase price which they had already paid. Pursuant to discussions between Kwok Wai Hoi (Kwok), the managing director of the plaintiffs, and Lee, Neo and their three friends, the plaintiffs agreed to reduce the purchase price of each unit by $80,000, from $480,000 to $400,000. But `the reduction (was) to be applied only to the last progress instalment payable.` At that point in time, only the foundation for the construction of the units in question had been completed.
On 7 January 1986 Lee granted an option to three persons, Sim Loo Lee, Sim Baba and Tan Kim Lan, or their nominees (hereinafter referred to as `the three sub-purchasers`), to purchase unit #03-03 from him at the price of $290,000. The option was duly exercised. Following the sub-sale, by a letter dated 26 May 1986 Lee authorized and directed the plaintiffs to enter into a fresh agreement with the three sub-purchasers for the sale and purchase of unit #03-03, to rescind the agreement between the plaintiffs and Lee dated 29 April 1983 and to credit all moneys paid by Lee to the three sub-purchasers. Lee confirmed that henceforth he would have no claim or interest whatsoever in the unit. Accordingly, on the same day a fresh agreement was entered into between the plaintiffs and the three sub-purchasers. In the fresh agreement, the sale price remained at $480,000.
On 27 January 1986, Neo similarly gave an option to Wong Mun Choi Johnny and Lui Cheng Geok (hereinafter referred to as `the two sub-purchasers`) to purchase unit #03-05 at the price of $290,000. On 27 June 1986 Neo gave a similar letter of authorization and direction to the plaintiffs as that given by Lee. A fresh agreement was also entered into by the two sub-purchasers with the plaintiffs in respect of unit #03-05.
In the meantime on 10 May 1986, before the sub-sale by Lee to the three sub-purchasers was completed, M/s Chee & Teo, who were acting for both the plaintiffs and Lee, wrote to the plaintiffs (DB23) as follows: 
 
... we are informed by the sub-purchasers` solicitors that they require your confirmation that you will accordingly not proceed against the sub-purchasers for the sum of $80,000.00. This is because in your sale of the abovenamed units to the original purchasers you have agreed to reduce the sale price of $480,000 to $400,000. In addition you have also further agreed to enter into a fresh sale and purchase agreement with the sub-purchasers at the price of $480,000.
 
 
 
In the premises, please let us have your confirmation that you will not claim from the sub-purchasers the sum of $80,000.
On 20 May 1986 the plaintiffs gave the following confirmation to M/s Chee & Teo (DB25): 
 
We are pleased to confirm that we have agreed to give the purchasers of the abovementioned units a reduction in the sale price of $480,000 to $400,000. This reduction is also applicable to their subsequent sub-sales.
 
 
 
Please note, however, that the reduction of $80,000 can only be applied and deducted from the last progress payment.
Sometime in June/July 1987, after the project had been completed and the last instalment paid by the sub-purchasers, Lee and Neo asked the plaintiffs for the refund of the $80,000 reduction which the plaintiffs had agreed to give in respect of each of the two units. On 7 July 1987, the plaintiffs made a payment of $40,000 to Lee on the advice of their solicitor, Mr Patrick Chee. The plaintiffs also paid Neo a sum of $38,400 on 10 July 1987, though Kwok claimed that this payment was made by Patrick Chee without his direction. Subsequently, both Lee and Neo asked for the balance. Kwok told Lee that he was not going to refund the balance because Lee had sub-sold the property and was not entitled to the reduction which was only to be applied to the last instalment. Kwok also refused to pay the balance to Neo.
On 9 September 1987 the plaintiffs received two letters of demand under s 254(2) of the Companies Act written by M/s Tan Lee & Choo on behalf of Lee and Neo claiming the payment of $40,000 and $41,600 respectively, within 21 days. A week later, on 16 September 1987, Kwok went to consult Liu and wanted the latter to act for the plaintiffs on the two notices. Kwok gave to Liu an account of how the matter arose and asked for his advice. Liu said he needed the relevant files before he could advise.
The next day, Kwok despatched two files of the plaintiffs to Liu. He also, by way of a separate letter, requested M/s Chee & Teo to release the relevant solicitors` files to Liu. Kwok claimed that he saw Liu a second time on either 18 or 19 September 1987. It was at this second meeting that Liu gave the opinion that it would not be prudent for Lee or Neo to file a winding-up petition without first obtaining a judgment. He also advised Kwok that Lee and Neo did not have a clear case to obtain judgment; there was a fair case of dispute. As will be apparent later, Liu disputed that there was such a second meeting on either 18 or 19 September 1987.
Kwok also told the court that at the second meeting with Liu the latter expressed the view that the payments of $40,000 to Lee and $38,400 to Neo were made under a mistake of fact and law. This was because by virtue of the sub-sales, both Lee and Neo had lost the benefit of the reduction and that the plaintiffs could commence proceedings against Lee and Neo to recover the two sums paid by mistake. Liu further said that he would be writing to M/s Tan Lee & Choo to explain the nature of the dispute in order to prevent the presentation of a winding-up petition against the plaintiffs. Kwok agreed with Liu and instructed Liu to do the same. Liu promised to extend copies of his replies to M/s Tan Lee & Choo to the plaintiffs for information. There is a dispute as to whether Kwok had specifically instructed Liu to reply to the two notices.
Kwok said that after a few days, having failed to receive copies of Liu`s replies to M/s Tan Lee & Choo, he asked his secretary, one Jennifer, to call and remind Liu. Jennifer reported that Liu said he had written and would forward the copies to the plaintiffs.
Kwok was away in London from 26 September 1987 to 2 October 1987. He was accompanying his son who was going for further studies. He said that in a telephone conversation with Jennifer from London he did again enquire if copies of the replies to M/s Tan Lee & Choo had been received and Jennifer answered in the negative. As a result he again asked Jennifer to call Liu.
I should mention here that Kwok has explained to the court that he could not call Jennifer to testify because she is now living in Australia and as her application for permanent resident status is still under consideration, she could not leave Australia without jeopardising her application. Kwok tendered a fax letter which he said he received from Jennifer. Defence counsel objected to the admissibility of that letter which did not even have an address. However, I accept Kwok`s oral evidence that he spoke to Jennifer who told him why she could not come to Singapore to testify. As will be apparent later, this aspect of the matter is quite immaterial to the crux of this action.
In the meantime, on 25 September 1987 Chee & Teo forwarded some 11 documents to Liu. The documents were received by Liu on 28 September 1987. The covering letter was copied to the plaintiffs. Kwok did not call Liu to ascertain the position when he returned from London on or about 2 October 1987.
On 12 October 1987 the plaintiffs were served with a winding-up petition filed by Tan Lee & Choo on behalf of Lee. Kwok called Liu who answered that he had not sent out the letters to Tan Lee & Choo. In that conversation, Kwok did not ask Liu why he had not sent out the letters. Kwok`s explanation for that omission was that he was panicky. As requested, on either 13 or 14 October 1987, Kwok sent his office attendant to deliver the petition to Liu. Either on the same day or the next, Kwok himself also went to see Liu. When questioned by Kwok why he did not send the reply to Lee`s notice, Liu said that it was not necessary and would serve no purpose. When asked to send the letter then, Liu said it was too late and that he would prepare an application to have the petition dismissed. At that point Kwok`s main pre-occupation was to have the petition dismissed which Liu said he would do.
The petition appeared in T
 he Straits Times 
 and the Gazette on 23 October 1987. It appeared in the Chinese press the next day. On 23 October 1987, one of the plaintiffs` bankers, Oversea-Chinese Banking Corporation (OCBC), wrote to freeze the plaintiffs` account. On 27 October 1987 the Bank of China suspended the plaintiffs` account. Still later on 17 November 1987 Malayan United Bank Bhd froze the plaintiffs account and refused to release funds against architect`s certificates on a project of the plaintiffs at Geylang.
On 26 October 1987 Kwok came to Liu`s office to affirm an affidavit in support of the application to dismiss the winding-up petition. Liu also asked him to request Patrick Chee for the balance of the documents as Liu felt that Patrick Chee had not given him all the documents. It would seem that Kwok was also at Liu`s office the day before to work with Liu on a draft affidavit.
On the same day, after the affidavit had been affirmed by Kwok, Liu wrote a letter to the plaintiffs, the relevant portion of which reads: 
 
We also enclose xeroxed copy of a case 
 Re Nima Travel Sdn Bhd
 
 
 
[1986] 2 MLJ 374
  to show that when there is a bona fide dispute between you and the petitioner, winding-up procedure should not be used. What the petitioner should have done was to issue a writ for judgment, and not a winding-up petition.
 
 
 
In any event, after perusing the papers, we are of the view that you have a fair case to dispute the petitioner`s claim. Indeed, we could advise you to file in a writ to recover the sum of $40,000 paid by you earlier to the petitioner. Please let us know.
The important point to note in the winding-up proceeding is that winding-up court is not the forum to decide whenever there is a bona fide claim. When you have a dispute with another party, it does not mean that you are insolvent. These are quite different matters. You should impress your bankers on this, by showing them the affidavit of Mr Kwok Wai Hoi together with this letter and the case enclosed. Should they require any further clarifications, please let us know. Alternatively, you may ask them to contact us direct.
It seems to me clear that this letter was written by Liu on Kwok`s request in order that the plaintiffs could show it to their bankers. It would be recalled that OCBC had frozen the plaintiffs` account on 23 October 1987.
Again, on that same day, pursuant to a request made by Kwok, Liu belatedly wrote to Tan Lee & Choo with regard to the statutory notice of Neo. After stating that the earlier payment of $38,400 to Neo was made under a mistake of fact and law, that the reduction was on the condition that Neo would complete the purchase, and as Neo had sold the unit before completion he had lost the benefit of the reduction, Liu continued: 
 
Our clients hereby caution your client for any more attempt to wind-up our clients as our clients see that such move is totally unjustified.
 
 
 
Our clients will resist such a move at all costs and will claim for all damages that they may suffer should such a step to wind-up is taken.
Neo never filed any petition to wind-up the plaintiffs. He only brought an action in the district court to claim for the balance of $41,600. Here, I may add that I do appreciate the point made by Liu that in view of the petition already filed by Lee, there was really no need for Neo to file a petition even if Neo was quite determined to wind up the plaintiffs. Neo could just be a supporting creditor. In this way Neo would not have to incur the costs of filing a petition.
The application to have the petition dismissed came up before the winding-up court on 30 November 1987. Following an adjournment, the plaintiffs took objection to the learned judge hearing the application on the ground of possible bias because there was then a pending dispute between the plaintiffs and a company in which the learned judge had an interest. The plaintiffs, following a discussion with Liu, decided to appoint a senior counsel, Mr AC Fergusson, to address the judge on the question of disqualifying himself. Having heard the submissions, the learned judge decided not to hear the matter further and adjourned it to enable the Registrar to fix it before another court. For the services of Mr Fergusson, the plaintiffs paid a fee of $1,500.
On 29 December 1987 the winding-up petition was withdrawn by Lee following an understanding reached with the plaintiffs whereby the latter would provide a banker`s guarantee to Lee for the sum claimed and Lee would in turn bring an action against the plaintiffs to seek recovery of the same. Accordingly, on 7 January 1988 a district court action (DC 80/1988) was commenced by Lee against the plaintiffs to recover the $40,000.
Earlier, on 11 November 1987, Liu requested the plaintiffs to pay $2,000 towards costs. No payment was however made. On 30 December 1987, following the withdrawal of the petition by Lee, Liu tendered a bill to the plaintiffs for $6,771.60 for work done on the winding-up petition, consisting of $6,000 for fees and $771.60 for disbursements. On 21 January 1988 Liu informed the plaintiffs that another $40 should be added to disbursements claimed as a stamp fee of $40 was inadvertently left out. On 12 February 1988 the plaintiffs paid only $2,771.60 in respect of that bill.
From January to March 1988 Liu was further engaged by the plaintiffs to contest DC 80/1988. Because the plaintiffs refused to pay the balance of the bill on the winding-up matter, relationship between Liu and Kwok became strained. In March 1988 Liu threatened to take out a summons to recover the balance. Kwok wanted the bill taxed. In April 1988, Liu applied to be discharged from acting for the plaintiffs in DC 80/1988 on the ground of non-payment of fees. On 12 April 1988 Liu got the order authorizing his firm to cease acting for the plaintiffs. Accordingly, the plaintiffs appointed Chong Yeo & Partners in place of Lim Ganesh & Liu.
Thereafter, there was correspondence on the question of the transfer of the files between Lim Ganesh & Liu and Chong Yeo & Partners. On 15 April 1988, Chong Yeo & Partners gave an undertaking to the defendants to preserve the defendants` lien of costs yet the defendants refused to release the files. This undertaking on costs was confirmed by M/s Chong Yeo & Partners on 27 April 1988. Because of the refusal of Liu to release the files, the plaintiffs had to ask for adjournment on two occasions on an O 14 application by Lee in DC 88/1988, resulting in the plaintiffs having to pay costs to Lee fixed at $300. Furthermore, summary judgment was obtained by Lee against the plaintiffs in DC 80/1988, which judgment was later set aside by Thean J, who gave the plaintiffs leave to defend that action. In respect of the refusal to release the files, a complaint was lodged by the plaintiffs against Liu to the Law Society, which after due inquiry imposed a fine of $2,000 on Liu.
On 22 August 1988 Lim Ganesh & Liu raised a bill in relation to work done on DC 88/1988. Another bill was raised in respect of the district court action taken out by Neo. On 25 August 1988 the plaintiffs wrote, inter alia, `we reject your bills and would rather have them taxed`.
On 27 August 1988 Lim Ganesh & Liu commenced an action in the magistrate court (MC 9978/88) claiming for the balance of the fees due in respect of work done on the winding-up petition. Judgment by O 14 was obtained. The question of professional negligence or the liability of the plaintiffs to pay was not raised by the latter.
Eventually a total of seven bills of costs of Lim Ganesh & Liu were taxed and paid by the plaintiffs.
When asked why did he retain Liu after the receipt of the winding-up petition, Kwok explained that as the time factor then was crucial he kept Liu to continue with the work. Furthermore, Liu had assured him that he could have the petition dismissed.
Again he kept Liu for DC 80/1988 because Liu was familiar with the matter. That action was eventually settled in November 1992 with the plaintiffs paying $25,000 to Lee. The action brought by Neo was also settled. Kwok said he accepted the advice of M/s Chong Yeo & Partners to settle as there were complex issues of law involved in the matter.
 Defence case
Two witnesses were called for the defence - Lee and Liu. Lee told the court that at the time when he made the sub-sale to the three sub-purchasers, Kwok told Lee that Kwok could not give the $80,000 discount as yet until completion of the building and the new buyer had paid up all the instalments. This is contrary to what was to be the arrangement as stated in DB23 and 25. Lee claimed that after the development was completed in May/June 1987 he had difficulties getting in touch with Kwok. Eventually when they met, Kwok told Lee that he had no money and asked for one week`s grace to pay $40,000, with the balance of $40,000 to be paid one or two weeks after that. Lee agreed. When Kwok refused to pay the balance of $40,000, he consulted Tan Lee & Choo who advised him that he could go by way of a winding up petition if the plaintiffs should still fail to respond to a statutory notice of demand. He understood that this would be the fastest way to getting back his money.
Lee said that one or two days after the petition appeared in the newspaper on 23 October 1987 Kwok called Lee to inform him that because of the advertisement, the plaintiffs` business had to stop and the bank had frozen their account. Kwok complained that he had suffered a great loss and asked Lee to withdraw the petition. Lee said Kwok was prepared to give him a banker`s guarantee. Eventually he accepted a banker`s guarantee as a condition for his withdrawing the petition; with the guarantee he need not worry that he could not get his money if he should succeed in the action.
Lee initially asserted that whatever might be the legal grounds which could have been put up by the plaintiffs` solicitors, if the plaintiffs did not pay up within the 21-day period given in the notice, he would proceed with the filing of a petition and that nothing would stop him.
Lee admitted that he did not know the risk of filing a winding-up petition without judgment. He claimed that his solicitor Mr Kelvin Lim advised him that there was a 70% chance to win. He did not know of the controversies surrounding the two documents in DB23 and 25. Finally he had to admit that if his solicitor had advised him that the petition would be dismissed he would not have proceeded with it.
Lee also claimed that from his dealings with Kwok he had come to realize that the plaintiffs were in a very tight financial position. To his mind three incidents show that. First is the inability of the plaintiffs to pay him the $80,000 discount in one lump sum. Second, Lee said that at the meeting to discuss the discount Kwok made another suggestion: that the plaintiffs would be prepared to sell to each of them another unit at a much reduced price of $200,000 but on condition that the $200,000 was paid in one lump sum up front. Third, there was an occasion when he was late in making progress payment, and upon Kwok contacting him on a Saturday, he told Kwok that he would bank the cheque into the account of the plaintiffs on the following Monday. But Kwok insisted that he bank in the cheque right away.
I do not think any of these three instances, either separately or combined, necessarily suggest that the plaintiffs were insolvent. Regarding the first incident, Kwok explained that he agreed to pay half the amount following discussion with Patrick Chee even though he did not think Lee was entitled to it. What I would observe is that it was never put in cross-examination to Kwok that the plaintiffs did not pay the full amount because the plaintiffs were unable to do so. With regard to the offer of Kwok to sell each additional unit at $200,000, this was again never put to Kwok. I seriously doubt it was stated quite that way. If something like that did in fact take place, I would not be surprised if it was stated in rhetorical terms in the course of arguments to determine what was the appropriate discount to give to each of the buyers. As regards the incident involving the banking in of a cheque on a Saturday, I do not see why Lee should complain and draw any adverse conclusion against the plaintiffs when he himself was late in making payment. The plaintiffs were entitled to insist that Lee bank in the cheque immediately, lest something should happen between then and Monday.
Liu`s evidence was that on 16 September 1987 Kwok came to see him pursuant to an appointment. That was the first time Liu had dealt with Kwok on a professional basis. After Kwok had given him a brief account of the matters relating to the two notices, Liu advised Kwok, in a general sort of way, that if he had a bona fide dispute with a prospective petitioner, winding-up procedure would not be an appropriate remedy for the petitioner to seek. A judgment would have to be first obtained. The winding-up court should not be used as a means to compel payment which was under dispute. Liu stated all this is trite law. He advised Kwok to let him have all the files, including those from Chee & Teo, so that he could study the matter. He admitted that he had also advised Kwok that it would be unlikely that Lee and Neo would have a clear case to obtain judgment by way of an action and less so to obtain a winding-up order against the plaintiffs.
Liu said that he perused the two files, which the plaintiffs sent him on 17 September 1987, a day or two later. However, he waited for the files from Chee & Teo as he felt that the documents in the solicitors` files would be more complete. Liu insisted that he never saw Kwok on 18 or 19 September 1987. Neither did he tell Kwok that he would reply to the two notices and to explain to Tan Lee & Choo of the dispute.
Liu claimed that before receiving the 11 documents on 28 September 1987 he called up Patrick Chee to remind him that he needed the conveyancing files soon as the 21-day statutory notice was running out. Having studied the 11 documents, of which only two were not found in the files of the plaintiffs, Liu felt that there were gaps. Thus on either that day or the next, he spoke to the secretary of Kwok telling her that the documents from Chee & Teo were not complete. He did consider whether to respond to the two statutory notices but `decided not to in view of the fact that (he had) already told Kwok of his opinion in the matter on 16 September 1987.` Later Liu corrected himself on this; he admitted that it was necessary to reply to the two notices but due to an oversight on his part he failed to do so. More will be said about this in a moment, as it is central to this action.
Liu said he did not see Kwok on either 13 or 14 October 1987. However, when Kwok spoke to him on 12 October 1987, Kwok did ask him why he did not reply to the two statutory notices. To that, Liu answered he overlooked. There was no emotional outburst from Kwok. Liu insisted that Kwok did not specifically instruct him to reply to the two statutory notices. He did not get all the files from Chee & Teo until 28 October 1987. But he admitted that the general care of the matter was left in his hands. He had the general conduct of the case and was to get the files from M/s Chee & Teo and assess the merits.
 Issues
What the defendants contend is that the presentation of the winding-up petition was not caused by Liu`s omission in responding to the two statutory notices. In the alternative, the defendants aver that the single omission could not amount to negligence or lack of reasonable care. Further, it could not have been a term of the retainer that the defendants were to prevent or forestall the presentation of a winding-up petition.
On the question of damages, it is submitted for the defendants that the plaintiffs have not proven that they have suffered any loss. Furthermore, even if there were such losses, they were not foreseeable; or at least some of the losses were not foreseeable.
 Did Liu fail in his duty?
The first question to examine is whether Liu had failed in his professional duty when he did not reply to the two statutory notices, in particular that issued by Lee. As indicated above, there is a dispute of fact as to whether Kwok did see Liu on 18 or 19 September 1987. Liu admitted that he received the two files from Kwok on 17 September 1987. He did not read them immediately. He said he read them one or two days later. This is certainly consistent with what Kwok said that he saw Liu on 18 or 19 September 1987, thus necessitating Liu to look into the two files.
In any event, I do not think this question of fact, whether there was a second meeting, is really that crucial or material. The fact is that as of 16 September 1987, based on an oral account given by Kwok to Liu, the latter was able, on the facts as so related, to offer a view (no doubt tentative) that there was a dispute between the plaintiffs on the one hand and Lee and Neo on the other, and it would be wrong for them to present any winding up petition when there was a bona fide dispute on the claim. All that make a lot of sense. What troubles me is the view Liu expressed that there was no need to reply to the two statutory notices. I think I should quote what he said in cross-examination: 
 
Q: Are you saying that the necessity of replying to the notices did not arise at the meeting?
 
 
 
A: It did not arise.
 
 
 
Q: Did you not think that a reply was needed to forestall a winding-up petition?
 
 
 
A: On 16/9/87, I did not think it was necessary.
 
 
 
Q: How were Tan Lee & Choo to know about the disputes?
 
 
 
A: That was why I asked for Chee & Teo`s files.
 
 
 
Q: It must surely follow that a reply was a necessity. You asked for the files?
 
 
 
A: It was not necessary. I asked for the files to verify what PW1 said to me orally was true.
 
 
 
Q: You got his files on 17/9/87 and with the two additional documents from Chee & Teo on 28/9/87 you were able to prepare the affidavit on 26/10/87?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: Were you not able to reply along the same lines to the two statutory notice as in the affidavit affirmed on 26/10/87?
 
 
 
A: I could have.
 
 
 
Q: Was it not a necessity to inform the claimant`s solicitors of the dispute having regard to the principle in 
 Re Nima
?
 
 
 
A: No.
 
 
 
Q: You still said it was not necessary?
 
 
 
A: Yes.
 
 
 
Q: How were Lee`s solicitor to know about the dispute?
 
 
 
A: They would not know.
 
 
 
Q: According to you it was not necessary to tell them?
 
 
 
A: That is right.
 
 
 
From the foregoing evidence two points are pertinent: (i) the necessity of replying to the notices did not arise at the meeting; (ii) to Liu`s mind there was no need to reply to the notices. When confronted with para 3(d) of the defence, which reads as follows: 
 
Liu also expressed his opinion to Kwok that based on his instructions from the discussions in the conference there was no need to reply to the two notices. Liu further advised Kwok that a reply to the two notices would not stop the said Lee and the said Neo from commencing winding-up proceedings if they chose to do so. Kwok agreed and accepted the opinion and advise of Liu and promised to arrange for all the files to be forwarded to the defendants as soon as possible,
 
 
 
he agreed that the question of replying to the two notices did arise and that he had advised Kwok not to reply to the two notices; there was no need to explain to Tan Lee & Choo of the dispute. He said that even had he replied there was nothing to stop the claimant from presenting the petition. Liu further explained as follows (NE 86-87): 
 
At that time I did not think it was necessary. There was no bona fide claim by the claimant. Of course now looking back in hindsight I would say I should have replied. Looking back I should not have taken up the case. It must be borne in mind that at that time that was my first dealing with him. I did not know his character finance and personality. Second, I could not rely on a lay client`s file to reply as solicitor. I need to verify. I did not and do not want to write based on client`s oral instructions alone without verification. Of course on hindsight, I agree that I should have written. But at that time 16 or 17 September 1987 there was no need to reply.
 
 
 
Liu claimed that Kwok accepted his opinion that there was no necessity to reply. He said that when Kwok first came to see him on 16 September 1987, Kwok was concerned about the need to pay the balance sums to Lee and Neo rather than the procedural aspects of winding up proceedings. Liu`s mind was preoccupied with the defences to the two claims. Eventually he agreed that a reply to the statutory notices was necessary. He clarified: 
 
When I said this morning that it was not necessary to reply, I meant to reply right away. If I did not think it was necessary to reply at all then why should I ask for the documents from Chee & Teo. In the midst of obtaining these documents there was a gap of time. When Chee & Teo`s relevant documents came on 28/9/87 it was almost time up. The point of replying promptly slipped my mind although I have been chasing PW1 and Chee & Teo on the documents. I had the general conduct and I did not realize the time had passed so fast and Lee had filed the petition. During all these times I was concentrating on drafting the defence and the counterclaim for client. After I got the winding-up petition from PW1 there would have been no need to write the letter anymore. When I saw PW1 on 25/10/87 the situation was explained to PW1 and he understood. We sat down and decided to write the letter to Neo. I was looking after the file. I did not intend to expose the plaintiffs to that kind of risk ...
 
 
 
It was necessary to reply. But at that time I thought I should get all the material in hand to make a proper reply.
So the real position is that when the time came, the matter of giving a reply slipped Liu`s mind though he was waiting for further material. He was concentrating on the merits of the two claims. He admitted he did not make a note in his diary. Giving a reply was within the scope of his retainer. There were merits in the plaintiffs` case. However, while accepting that it was a slip on his part not to have sent a reply, he maintained that the slip did not amount to negligence.
Liu laid stress upon the fact that since he filed the affidavit on behalf of Kwok on 27 October 1987, no complaint was heard from Kwok. Their relationship remained cordial right up to the time when the petition was withdrawn by Lee following the compromise. Relationship only began to cool after Liu sent his bill for costs to the plaintiffs. Indeed, in all further proceedings there was no complaint by Kwok that Liu had not discharged his duties deligently as a solicitor in relation to the two statutory notices or the winding-up petition; not even in the magistrate court action where the defendants claimed for the balance of the fees due for handling the winding-up petition.
In my opinion, the need to reply to the two statutory notices is obvious. A client comes to see a solicitor precisely to get his advice and assistance to prevent any harm from arising. Liu quite clearly stated that he had the general conduct of the matter and that would, I think, include advising and doing all that was necessary to protect the interest of the plaintiffs. The 21-day notice expired on 30 September 1987 and that should be the last day on which a reply should have been given. Not only did Liu fail to respond by 30 September 1987, he failed to respond up to 7 October 1987, the date on which the petition was filed.
As far as I can see, there is no reason why Liu could not have replied by 30 September 1987. After all he drafted the affidavit for Kwok to affirm on 26 October 1987 based on the documents which were in the plaintiffs` files and the 11 documents sent by Chee & Teo. He had all those documents by 28 September 1987. He could and should have replied to the two statutory notices by 30 September 1987 or at any time before 7 October 1987 when Lee filed his petition. The truth of the matter, as Liu admitted, is that there was an oversight on his part. Liu knew the law as stated in 
 Re Nima Travel Sdn Bhd; Sun Soon Heng Coach Works v Nima Travel 
 that a creditor cannot use winding-up proceedings to compel payment where there is a bona fide dispute on the claim.
With respect, I am unable to follow the logic of the argument of Liu when he said that a mere oversight to reply to the statutory notices does not amount to negligence. Counsel for the defendants made a similar submission in his closing address. Then what is it? `Negligence` has been described in 
 Cordery on Solicitors 
 (8th Ed) to be `the omission to do something which a reasonable man would do, or the doing of something which a reasonable man would not do.` A solicitor is expected to use reasonable care and skill in giving such advice and taking such steps as the facts of the particular case demand and the standard of care and skill required is that of a reasonably competent and diligent solicitor. By not writing to explain why the plaintiffs had refused to pay Lee, Liu had failed to take the necessary steps to protect the interest of the plaintiffs. In the circumstances a reply was really imperative. Liu foresaw the risk of not replying (NE 106D). There is clearly negligence.
In 
 Fletcher & Son v Jubb, Borth & Helliwell 
 a solicitor was held to be guilty of negligence when he overlooked time and allowed his client`s claim to be time-barred under the Public Authorities Protection Act 1893. The Court of Appeal held that it was the duty of the solicitor to know the provisions of that Act. I cannot see any difference between the oversight in that case and the oversight in the present case.
 Cordery on Solicitors 
 (at p 140) listed the following acts or omissions as being matters for which the solicitor could be liable: 
 
... in matters of practice and procedure a solicitor is liable for ignorance of or for 
 overlooking
 familiar points, eg for not filing writs, of which personal service could not be effected, to save the Statute of Limitations; for not taking proceedings within the period prescribed by statute; for failing to make an application for review on behalf of an injured infant workman within six months of his attaining the age of 21; for delay in obtaining his client`s discharge from prison; for not inserting the proper notices of meetings of creditors, so that his client was forced to pay debts in full that would otherwise have been barred; for not giving the proper notices in conducting an appeal against a magistrate`s conviction; for proceeding under the wrong section of a statute; for pursuing an improper course of defence before the magistrates so that no appeal would lie; for taking proceedings in a court without jurisdiction, or one not provided with adequate machinery, or in the High Court where it is clear that the sum to be recovered would only carry costs on the county court scale, unless his client, having been warned of the consequences, so instructs him; and generally where there are two ways of doing a thing, and one is clearly right and the other doubtful, for doing it in the doubtful way.
 
 
 
It is true that on the evidence there is a dispute as to whether Kwok did, in fact, instruct Liu to reply to the two statutory notices. But I do not think it matters whether Kwok did so specifically instruct Liu. It was Liu`s duty to advise Kwok. A solicitor should advise his client of a step that ought to be taken. He should not wait for client`s specific instructions if it was a necessary step to take. In 
 Otter v Church, Adams, Tatham & Co 
 it was held to be the duty of a solicitor to advise a client whose life was in danger that he should execute a disentailing deed or make a will without delay.
I would stress that what happened here is not an instance of an error of judgment. I do appreciate that a solicitor is not expected to be faultless in his judgment. I am conscious of the words of Lord Cottenham LC in 
 Hart v Frame 
 at p 210: 
 
Professional men, possessed of a reasonable portion of information and skill, according to the duties they undertake to perform, and exercising what they so possess with reasonable care and diligence in the affairs of their employers, certainly ought not to be held liable for errors in judgment, whether in matters of law or discretion.
 
 
 
Indeed earlier in 
 Godefroy v Dalton 
, the court laid down the obligations of a solicitor in a contentious business as follows: 
 
It would be extremely difficult to define the exact limit by which the skill and diligence which an attorney undertakes to furnish in the conduct of a cause is bounded; or to trace precisely the dividing line between that reasonable skill and diligence which appears to satisfy his undertaking, and that crassa negligentia or lata culpa mentioned in some of the cases, for which he is undoubtedly responsible. The cases, however, which have been cited and commented on at the bar, apppear to establish, in general, that he is liable for the consequences of ignorance or non-observance of the rules of practice of this court; for the want of care in the preparation of the cause for trial; or of attendance thereon with his witnesses, and for the mismanagement of so much of the conduct of a cause as is usually and ordinarily allotted to his department of the profession. Whilst on the other hand, he is not answerable for error in judgment upon points of new occurrence, or of nice or doubtful construction, or of such as are usually entrusted to men in the higher branch of the profession of the law.
 
 
 
This reference to the higher branch of the profession was obviously in reference to the work of a barrister who would not be held to be negligent just because of an error of judgment in the opinion he renders either in or outside court.
In some of the older cases, eg 
 Purves v Landell 
, 
 Baikie v Chandless 
, the court seems to be more indulgent to legal practitioners, and had identified lack of reasonable skill and care with `gross negligence` or `crassa negligentia.` Perhaps, that was the court`s way of saying a solicitor or barrister should not be made liable for errors of judgment. Whatever the previous position might be, I hold that the correct test is what a reasonably competent legal practitioner would do having regard to the standards normally adopted in his profession.
I would hasten to add that a solicitor cannot escape liability by merely labelling a mistake as an error of judgment. It depends on the nature of the mistake. I would like to quote the speech of Lord Fraser in 
 Whitehouse v Jordan 
 at 281: 
 
Merely to describe something as an error of judgment tells us nothing about whether it is negligent or not. The true position is that an error of judgment may, or may not, be negligent; it depends on the nature of the error. If it is one that would not have been made by a reasonably competent professional man professing to have the standard and type of skill that the defendant held himself out as having, and acting with ordinary care, then it is negligent.
 
 
 
In the light of the facts of the case and the law as to the duty of a solicitor as outlined above, I have no doubt whatsoever that Liu was guilty of negligence. Due to an absence of mind, he failed to take a necessary step, an obvious step, which should have been taken.
 Causation
I come next to the question of causation. There is no doubt that the statutory notices required an answer. Though Lee initially said in evidence that a reply from the plaintiffs` solicitor would not have deterred him from filing a petition, he admitted that if his solicitor should advise him not to, he would follow the advice.
The failure to reply to the statutory notice would convey to Lee and his solicitor the impression that the plaintiffs had no defence to the notice and that the plaintiffs were just being difficult or unreasonable in refusing to pay the sum claimed. In those circumstances, I cannot see what other conclusion any reasonable person or solicitor could have drawn. It was really inevitable that Lee, on the advice of his solicitor, decided to file the petition. There was simply no reason for him not to proceed.
Liu has suggested in his evidence that even if a reply had been given there was no guarantee that Lee would not file his petition. In answer to that I would make these observations. Firstly, in civil litigation what needs to be shown is on a balance of probabilities, not certainty. Secondly, having been negligent in discharging his duties as a solicitor, which negligence I have found caused Lee to file the petition, I think the burden shifts to the defendants to show that even if there was no failure, Lee would still have proceeded to file the petition. Lee said he would act on the advice of his solicitors. Mr Kelvin Lim, the solicitor of Lee, was not called upon by the defence to testify. Thirdly, Liu himself said that there were merits in the plaintiffs` defence to the claim and that following the principles laid down in 
 Re Nima 
, a winding-up petition was not the proper procedure to recover a debt which was in dispute. What is there to suggest that Mr Kelvin Lim would not have been an equally competent and reasonable solicitor and see the point which Liu himself saw?
The argument here is similar to that advanced in 
 Heywood v Wellers 
 where the solicitors were alleged to have failed to take certain steps to protect the client. Denning MR rejected that argument as follows (at p 459): 
 
It was suggested that even if the solicitors had done their duty and taken the man to court he might still have molested her. But I do not think they can excuse themselves on that ground. After all, it was not put to the test: and it was their fault that it was not put to the test. If they had taken him to court as she wished - and as they ought to have done - it might well have been effective to stop him from molesting her anymore. We should assumethat it would have been effective to protect her, unless they prove that it would not.
 
 
 
In my opinion, in the absence of any evidence from Mr Kelvin Lim as to his views on the disputed claim, both as to fact and law, I do not think that there is any basis for Liu to assert, or for me to hold, that whatever explanations may be offered by Liu, Kelvin Lim would nevertheless advise Lee to proceed with the filing of the winding-up petition. Even now in court Liu has not said that the advice he tendered to Kwok as to the merits of his defence is wrong. It is a solicitor`s duty to safeguard the interest of his client. Liu has failed in that. On the evidence before me, I do not think it is open to the defendants to say that even if Liu had replied, it would not have made a difference.
 Damages
I now turn to the question of damages. From the pleadings it seems to me (though not entirely clear) that the plaintiffs are proceeding against the defendants in contract, though recent authorities would suggest that a client could also sue in tort, eg 
 Midland Bank Trust Co Ltd v Hett, Stubbs & Kemp 
. However, for the present purposes of determining what losses suffered by the plaintiffs should be allowed, I do not think it makes any real difference whether I treat the case as one in contract or in tort. In order to succeed on any item of loss, not only must the plaintiff establish that the loss was caused by the defendants` negligence or breach of duty, but that it was also foreseeable, in contract as at the date of the contract and in tort, as at the date the tort was committed: see 
 Victoria Laundry (Windsor) Ltd v Newman Industries Coulson & Co 
 and 
 The Wagon Mound; Overseas Tankship (UK) v Morts Dock & Engineering Co 
. In the statement of claim the plaintiffs claimed for three specific sums, namely, $15,507.70, being the costs paid to the defendants on three bills of costs, $300, being the costs incurred and paid by the plaintiffs in DC 80/1988 on account of adjournments and $1,500, being the fee paid to Mr AC Fergusson, and an unquantified claim for damages for `negligence and breach of duty as solicitor.`
In my view the following items of claim satisfied both the tests and should be compensated by the defendants: 
 
 
(i) Bill of costs No 1451/89 being solicitor and client bill of the defendants for work done for the plaintiffs in the winding-up petition (as taxed) 8,174.20 
 
(ii) Bill of costs No 1450/89 in relation to MC Suit No 9978/88 taken out by the defendants against the plaintiffs for the remainder of the fees claimed by the defendants for the work done on the winding-up petition (as taxed) $1,904.50 
 
(iii) Costs incurred and paid for the adjournments in DC 80/1988 300.00 $10,378.70
  
 
 
Of these three items, (i) relates to the work done in getting the winding-up petition dismissed/withdrawn. Following from what I have said above, this work would not have been necessary had Liu replied to the two statutory notices explaining the dispute in question. Item (ii) is so closely linked to (i) and should be allowed. This item need not have been incurred if only Liu would have his bill for the work done on the winding-up petition taxed as requested by Kwok. Instead, Liu instituted MC 9978/88. What I am effectively saying is that Liu is not entitled to be paid for the work he did on the winding up petition and those directly relating to or flowing from that. As regards item (iii), it arose essentially because Liu refused to release the files though an undertaking on costs was given by Cheong Yeo & Partners. The defendants attempted to rely on a telex sent out by Cheong Yeo & Partners to the defendants dated 1 June 1988 where it was stated `in order to avoid any complications on the matters, we shall be obliged if you could let us have the relevant documents immediately as the matter will be coming up for 
 mention 
 on 2.6.88.` The reference to `mention` is wrong. The date 2 June 1988 was to be for the hearing of the O 14 application. But the costs which were awarded against the plaintiffs and are now claimed by them were in respect of the adjournments in April and May 1988. They do not relate to the hearing of 2 June 1988.
As regards the fee of $1,500 paid to Mr AC Fergusson I entertain some difficulties on it. While that expense might be said to arise from Liu`s breach I have some doubts whether it was foreseeable. Liu could not reasonably have foreseen that a situation like that could have arisen which required the engagement of a senior counsel.
Similarly, I do not think the plaintiffs are entitled to claim as damages for costs paid by them to the defendants in relation to work done in DC 80/1988, DC 4884/88 and DC 9295/87 instituted by Lee, Neo and a third person Neo Teck Huat, respectively, to recover what they claimed. Those costs were not incurred as a result of Liu`s negligence or breach of duty in failing to reply to the two statutory notices. All the three district court actions had nothing to do with Liu`s failure to reply to the statutory notice of Lee. They arose because of the disputes between the plaintiffs and those purchasers on account of the reduction plaintiffs had agreed to give them and which was to be deducted from the last instalment. Indeed, had Liu replied to the two notices, he would be asking Lee and Neo (and the others too) to establish their individual claim by way of an action.
I now come to a more difficult item of claim for damages. There is some evidence to indicate that the plaintiffs` Geylang project was delayed by approximately two months on account of the petition being filed. The plaintiffs could not use the overdraft granted by Malaysian United Bank to pay for progress payments. The plaintiffs allegedly had to borrow from moneylenders at 5% per month; but there is no proof of such borrowings. The plaintiffs` suppliers stopped giving them credit in relation to material required for the project. As a result, the progress of work at the Geylang project slowed down. An example was given: 12 days were taken to complete the structure of the second storey whereas it took 24 days to complete the third storey.
Furthermore, after the petition was advertised, the purchasers of the Geylang project refused to pay. Kwok instructed his solicitors, MPD Nair, to demand payment. However, MPD Nair replied to say that the purchasers were not in a position to release any further progress payment to the plaintiffs until the petition was discontinued or withdrawn.
The distinction between general and special damage is neatly described in 
 Bullen & Leake on Precedents of Pleadings 
 (12th Ed) at p 60 as follows: 
 
General damage is such as the law will presume to be the natural or probable consequence of the defendant`s act. It arises by inference of law, and need not, therefore, be proved by evidence and may be averred generally. Special damage, on the other hand, is such a loss as the law will not presume to be the consequence of the defendant`s act, but such as depends in part, at least, on the special circumstances of the particular case. It must therefore be always explicitly claimed on the pleading, as otherwise the defendant would have no notice that such items of damage would be claimed from him at the trial.
 
 
 
This is an action for negligence or breach of duty as a solicitor. The losses suffered by the plaintiffs in consequence thereof should be particularized. I accept that the plaintiffs` accounts had been frozen by their bank and that the purchasers of the Geylang project had refused to pay so long as the petition was pending. But no specific figures have been proved to show the losses which the plaintiffs had in fact suffered on those accounts. Furthermore, there is the serious question of remoteness. There is no evidence that Liu knew that the plaintiffs were also engaged in the Geylang project or any other project. This was the first time that Liu dealt with the plaintiffs. In the circumstances, I make no award for these unspecified claims.
Counsel for the plaintiffs sought general damages for the injury caused to the fair name of the plaintiffs as a result of the petition being advertised in the media.Two authorities are relied upon:
 Quartz Hill Consolidated Gold Mining Co v Eyre 
 and 
 Wilson v United Counties Bank Ltd 
. Counsel conceded that these two cases are not similar to our present case but he urged me to apply the principles decided in those two cases by analogy. In 
 Quartz Hill 
, the English Court of Appeal held that an action for malicious prosecution could lie even though no pecuniary loss or special damage to the company could be proved because the presentation of a winding-up petition was, from its very nature, calculated to injure the credit of the company. The appeal court reversed the decision of the first instance judge who held that the action would not lie without proof of special damage. In Wilson the plaintiff sued the bank for damages for negligence in discharging its duties resulting in the plaintiff being adjudicated a bankrupt. There, the court granted Â£7,500 as damages for the injury caused by that negligence to the plaintiffs` credit and reputation.
In my view 
 Quartz Hill 
 is obviously a different kind of a case. In 
 Wilson 
, a bankruptcy order was in fact made. In the present case, the winding-up petition was withdrawn. By the omission in sending out the reply to the statutory notice of Lee, Liu did not intend to injure the reputation or credit of the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs are only entitled to compensation for the losses and expenses they have actually incurred on account of the omission. Accordingly, other than the specified losses suffered by the plaintiffs which I have allowed above, I have serious reservations that the plaintiffs are entitled to any amount by way of general damages and I would refrain from making such an award.
In the result I hold that the plaintiffs are only entitled to damages in the sum of $10, 378.70.
One final point before I conclude this judgment. It is alleged that the plaintiffs should be precluded from making any claim for any loss since they continued to engage Liu even after discovering the omission and they did not question the defendants` entitlement to the costs of the winding-up petition in MC 9978/88. All that the plaintiffs asked was to have the bill taxed and that was also their stand in MC 9978/88. However, counsel for the defence in his final submission has only made some general remarks on estoppel or res judicata without elaboration. No authorities were cited by him in support thereof although in his opening statement he referred to the case 
 Shook Lin & Bok v Yeo Kian Teck & Anor 
 where some aspects of the fact situation are similar to our present case but where the liability to pay fees for work done was not in dispute. Neither did counsel for the plaintiffs address me on it in his closing submission. I need only say this. In MC 9978/88 the defendants were claiming for their fees for work done on the winding-up petition. In the present action the plaintiffs are claiming for damages for professional negligence, an issue which has not been determined before. They are separate causes of action. While the plaintiffs could have raised the question of professional negligence in MC 9978/88, I do not think they are thus precluded from doing so now.
As regards costs, the defendants have submitted that if the amount of damages awarded by this court should come within the jurisdiction of the subordinate courts, costs should be taxed on that scale. I accept that submission. Accordingly, there shall be judgment for the plaintiffs in the sum of $10,378.70 with costs to be taxed on the subordinate courts scale. The judgment sum shall carry interest at the rate of 8% from the date of the writ.

s 30 Whether Court of Appeal in overruling a previous interpretation of Evidence Act (Cap 97) gave any such procedural right
 
In this criminal motion the applicant sought the leave of this court on two issues, first to adduce fresh evidence and, secondly, to make further submissions on s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 30), both of which arise from Criminal Appeal No 4 of 1993. We took the view that we had no jurisdiction to hear the matter and accordingly dismissed the application. We now set out our grounds.
The background to this application was as follows. In Criminal Case No 6 of 1992, the applicant and one Abdul Rahman Bin Awang (`Awang`) were charged with abetting one Abdul Rashid bin Mohammed (`Rashid`) in trafficking by transporting 76.3 g of diamorphine from Woodlands Checkpoint to the car park at Block 4A Woodlands Centre Road on 21 March 1990. The drugs were found in a motor car NL 4807 driven by Rashid alone. All three were jointly tried. Awang was acquitted at the end of the prosecution case and the applicant and Rashid were convicted on 29 January 1993 as charged and sentenced to death. The trial judge`s grounds of judgment are reported in 
 PP v Abdul Rashid & Ors. 
1 Their appeal to this court was heard and dismissed on 9 November 1993 and this court`s grounds of judgment are reported in 
 Abdul Rashid & Anor v PP. 
2 Their petitions for clemency were rejected by the President and the sentence of death was due to be carried out on 10 June 1994. However, on 7 June 1994, three days before their final hour, Rashid informed the applicant that his long statement made to the investigating officer of the case as well as his testimony in court, both of which implicated the applicant, were a total fabrication. As a result, the applicant informed his counsel and thus the present application to adduce Rashid`s retraction as fresh evidence. We first turn to the question of this court`s jurisdiction to receive and hear fresh evidence 
 after 
 an appeal has been disposed of.
 Jurisdiction
Mr Suppiah was not alleging any lack of due process or irregularity in the criminal proceedings which culminated in the dismissal of the applicant`s appeal on 9 November 1993. Rather, he conceded that he was asking this court to assume jurisdiction to re-open the appeal after it had already been heard and disposed of. He began by referring us to s 55(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) (`the Act`) which reads as follows: 
 
In dealing with 
 any
 appeal, the Court of Appeal may, if it thinks additional evidence is necessary, either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken by the trial court. [
 emphasis added.
]
 
 
 
Mr Suppiah argued that the word `any` before the word `appeal` in the section should be given a liberal interpretation so as to embrace any matter before this court, including this criminal motion, provided justice so demands. In his submission, although s 55 is to be found in Part V of the Act (entitled `Criminal Jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal`), the use of the words `any` did not limit the workings of that section to Part V. Additionally, he argued that the provision which bestowed jurisdiction upon the Court of Appeal to hear further appeals, as well as for appeals disposed of to be reopened, was s 29A(4) contained in Part IV of the Act which reads as follows: 
 
The Court of Appeal shall for the purposes of and subject to the provisions of this Act, have full power to determine 
 any
 question necessary for the purpose of doing justice in 
 any
 case before the Court. [
 e
mphasis added.]
 
 
 
Mr Suppiah contended that the reference in s 29A(4) to the determination of `any question` by this court in `any case` was a general provision which allowed the Court of Appeal to do justice in any situation and was not confined to appeals alone.
Our attention was also drawn to the position in England. Mr Suppiah conceded that, while the English position as stated in 
 R v Pinfold 
 3 is that the English Court of Appeal has no jurisdiction to entertain additional evidence in a situation where it has disposed of the appeal, the English Court of Appeal could comfort itself in the mechanism provided by s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 which allows the Home Secretary to make a reference to it in such situations.
Like its counterpart in England, the Court of Appeal of Singapore is a creature of legislation and its jurisdiction must necessarily be defined solely by and limited to the provisions of the Act. In this regard, the relevant provisions are to be found in ss 29A(2), 44, 59 and 60. Section 29A(2) of the Act sets out this court`s jurisdiction in criminal matters: 
 
The criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall consist of appeals against any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought.
 
 
 
Section 44 provides: 
 
 
(1) ...[Repealed] 
 
(2) An appeal by a person convicted shall be either against the conviction or against the sentence or against both: Provided that where an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted on such plea, there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence. 
 
(3) An appeal by the Public Prosecutor shall be either against the acquittal of an accused person or against the sentence imposed upon an accused person by the High Court. 
 
(4) An appeal may lie on a question of fact or a question of law or on a question of mixed fact and law. 
 
(5) The Court of Appeal shall also have jurisdiction to hear and determine matters brought before it in accordance with section 59 or 60.
  
 
 
Section 59 provides that the Court of Appeal has jurisdiction for the purposes of determining any question reserved by the High Court or the public prosecutor in a situation where a person has been convicted by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction. Section 60 provides that, where an appeal from a decision of a subordinate court in a criminal matter has been determined by the High Court, the High Court may, on the application of either party (but where the public prosecutor is the applicant, shall) reserve for decision of the Court of Appeal any question of law of public interest, the determination of which by the judge has affected the event of the appeal.
Where, however, the Court of Appeal has heard and disposed of an appeal, as it has in this on 9 November 1993, it is 
 functus officio 
 in so far as that appeal is concerned. There is no express provision which affords the Court of Appeal the jurisdiction to hear fresh evidence, thereby re-opening the case 
 after 
 it has heard and disposed of the appeal. We are unable to agree with Mr Suppiah`s submission that this enabling provision can be found in ss 29(A)(4) or 55(1).
In our view it is ss 29(A)(2), 44, 59 and 60 which set out the criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal. Section 29A(4) is merely concerned with the Court of Appeal`s power in a situation where it already has jurisdiction to hear a particular matter. This interpretation is borne out by the concluding words of s 29A(4), `... in any case before the Court` which assumes a situation where the Court of Appeal is already seised of the matter by virtue of ss 29A(2), 44, 59 and 60. The word `jurisdiction` is used in the sense to denote the types of subject matter which the Court of Appeal may deal with and in relation to which it may exercise its powers. It cannot exercise its powers in matters over which it has no jurisdiction. Therefore s 29A(4) does not assist Mr Suppiah.
As for s 55(1), we cannot agree that it allows the Court to Appeal to receive fresh evidence at any time. Were that the case, there would be no finality to any appeal, as the appeal although disposed of could be re-opened each time a new matter arose. The answer can be found in the preceding and subsequent provisions (ss 45 to 58) which deal with the machinery and effect when an appeal is set in motion as well as the powers which this court may exercise on the hearing of such an appeal. Section 55(1) is such a provision which gives the Court of Appeal power to receive additional evidence where it already has jurisdiction over the matter. We are fortified in our interpretation of s 55(1) by its words `in dealing with any appeal`, which clearly sets out the context in which the additional evidence is to be received. It can by no stretch of the imagination be said that the present application is an appeal.
Admittedly, the position in England is different by virtue of s 17 of the Criminal Appeals Act 1968, which allows the Home Secretary to refer the whole case to the Court of Appeal, such that the case `shall be treated for all purposes as an appeal to the Court by that person` or alternatively to refer a point arising out of a case for the determination of the Court of Appeal. Section 17 is an express and unequivocal provision which allows for matters arising after the disposal of an appeal to be brought to the attention of the Court of Appeal, subject to the discretion of the Home Secretary. As the English Court of Appeal also derives its criminal jurisdiction from statute, Parliament in England has deemed fit to enact express legislation to enable it to re-hear the matter, deeming such a re-hearing as an appeal. We do not have a similar provision in our Act. The main function of the Court of Appeal as set out by the jurisdictional provisions of the Act is a supervisory one, to review and correct the decisions of the lower courts; with the additional function of determining questions of law of public importance. Parliament has not defined the function of the Court of Appeal so as to maintain continuous supervision over convicted persons or to act after the event because of a change of circumstance. That being so, we would clearly be acting 
 ultra vires 
 the Act to assume jurisdiction in the present case.
Even if we were unable to assume jurisdiction on the matter, Mr Suppiah urged us to make a recommendation to the President for clemency as was done in 
 Kuruma v The Queen 
 ,4 
 Mohamad Kunjo s/o Ramalan v PP 
 5 and 
 Ong Ah Chuan v PP 
. 6
However, those were cases wherein the Privy Council after hearing the matter on appeal, saw fit on the merits to make a recommendation to the executive. In the present case, where we were unable to assume jurisdiction on the matter, and were thereby not going into the merits of the case and hearing fresh evidence, we were unable to see what sort of recommendation we could possibly make.
 Further arguments on s 30 of the Evidence Act
Mr Suppiah`s complaint on this was that he was not heard pursuant to s 54 of the Act on the question of this court`s decision not to follow its earlier decision in 
 Ramachandran v PP 
 on the interpretation of s 30 of the Evidence Act. The chronology of events is important in addressing this submission. The applicant was tried with Rashid and Awang from 11 January 1993 to 29 January 1993 when he was convicted. This court heard and dismissed his appeal on 9 November 1993. By that time, this court had already delivered its grounds of judgment in 
 Ramachandran 
`s case7 on 9 July 1993. However, on 17 May 1993, this court had heard 
 Chin Seow Noi & Ors v PP 
 and dismissed the appeal on the same day. The grounds in
 Chin`s case 
 (which chose not to follow 
 Ramachandran`s case 
 on the interpretation of s 30) were delivered on 27 November 1993 and the grounds in the applicant`s case, which adopted 
 Chin`s case 
 on the interpretation of s 30, were delivered four days later on 1 December 1993. Mr Suppiah`s submission amounted to this. He was not aware that, after hearing the arguments in 
 Chin`s case 
, this court had intended to adopt a wide reading of s 30, thereby departing from its previous position in 
 Ramachandran`s case 
. As a result, Mr Suppiah was deprived of the opportunity to make submissions on why 
 Ramachandran`s case 
 should be followed.
This submission had little to commend it. The issue in 
 Chin`s case 
 was whether s 30 allowed a co-accused`s confession to be treated as evidence against an accused. The interpretation of s 30 by this court certainly did not create any procedural rights in favour of Mr Suppiah`s client which allowed him to make further submissions where the appeal had already been heard and disposed of. Section 54 of the Act merely provides that the Court of Appeal at the hearing of an appeal, `shall hear the appellant or his advocate and solicitor`. Mr Suppiah was most certainly heard at the applicant`s appeal on 9 November 1993. When the applicant`s case came on appeal, s 30 was in fact an issue at the heart of the appeal. Mr Suppiah had specifically argued that the trial judge erred in law and relied on 
 Ramachandran`s case 
 for his submission. His submission, if acceded to, would be to impose a requirement on this court to serve notice on all affected parties with pending appeals whenever it intends to review the law in a particular area. How a court can do this when the grounds or judgment have not even been finalised remains a mystery to us. As there is no provision in the Act which would have allowed us to hear Mr Suppiah on this matter, we dismissed his application to make further submissions.

The applicant in the present case was charged in the High Court with having trafficked in 164 packets and one straw of substance containing not less than 1728.87g of diamorphine on 7 July 1992, between 5.42pm and 5.50pm, at Block 188 Boon Lay Drive #10-298, Singapore. Having been found guilty of the said charge and sentenced to death, he appealed to the Court of Appeal. His appeal was dismissed by this court on 15 March 1994 after it had heard the submissions of counsel. A report of the grounds of judgment is at 
 
 
[1994] 2 SLR 517
 . Subsequently the applicant filed this application seeking leave to adduce fresh evidence despite the fact that he had earlier appealed unsuccessfully. We heard the application on 11 July 1994 and having given full consideration to the issues raised by counsel, we dismissed the application. Our reasons are given in the grounds set out below.
The full facts of the applicant`s case are not germane to the present application but it may be helpful, as a preliminary, to set out the background to the case. The applicant was arrested on 7 July 1992 by officers from the Vigilante Corps and the Special Constabulary who had trailed him to the rear room of flat #10-298 on the tenth floor of Block 188 Boon Lay Drive, after first observing him in the car park between Blocks 185 and 187. Upon the applicant`s arrest, discovery was made in the rear room of 164 packets and a straw containing a powdery/granular substance. This was confirmed on analysis to be diamorphine. Besides the drugs, various items representing drug-related paraphernalia were also discovered in the room.
Although the applicant gave the police two statements in which he acknowledged the existence of drugs in the room, at trial he denied that he had been aware of any drugs placed in the room. He maintained that he had rented the room on the instructions of one Ah Boon whom he claimed was the Chinese male the officers had seen accompanying him in the Boon Lay Drive car park on 7 July 1992. The applicant asserted that the drugs found in the room must have been brought there by the said Ah Boon, although under cross-examination he was unable to give any real details of Ah Boon`s true identity or even his full name.
At the conclusion of the trial the trial judge below held that he disbelieved the applicant`s defence and convicted him on the charge of trafficking preferred. On appeal counsel did not attempt to challenge the trial judge`s refusal to believe the applicant`s version of events. Instead arguments were raised concerning the validity of the charge as it had been framed in the court below, as well as the voluntariness of the applicant`s statements which were admitted as evidence in the trial below. Having heard the submissions of counsel we could see no basis to either set of arguments and accordingly dismissed the appeal.
The present motion was filed on 31 May 1994. The applicant stated in his affidavit (dated 31 May 1994) that on 21 March 1994, after the dismissal of his appeal and while awaiting execution at Changi Prison, he had a chance meeting with one Leong Wing Kong (`Leong`), known to him only as `Prisoner 539`. Leong too had been convicted of drug trafficking in an unconnected case. His appeal having been dismissed by the Court of Appeal in February 1994, he was, like the applicant, awaiting execution of the death sentence. Leong allegedly imparted to the applicant certain information on 21 March 1994 which (so the applicant claimed) substantiated the defence the applicant raised at trial. Essentially Leong claimed to have accompanied a man known to him only as `Ah Boon` to a flat `
 somewhere in Jurong 
` on 7 July 1992. The applicant sought to adduce as fresh evidence the facts and matters bespoken in the various affidavits, notably that of Leong`s which included a statement recorded from him by counsel for the applicant on 30 May 1994.
Before us counsel conceded that the motion was unusual since the applicant`s appeal against conviction and sentence had been dismissed by the Court of Appeal on 15 March 1994. Section 55 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (`the Judicature Act`), which empowers the Court of Appeal to hear additional evidence, is couched in terms clearly envisioning the reception of the new evidence at the hearing of an appeal, at a stage before any decision has been pronounced. The primary question which arose for our determination thus concerned the jurisdiction of this court to allow the introduction of fresh evidence in relation to an appeal already disposed.
It is important to note at the outset that there has never been any suggestion of any defect in the trial of the applicant below, nor for that matter in the hearing of his appeal; and indeed counsel himself admitted as much. The focus of the applicant`s case rested therefore on the provisions in the Judicature Act in which the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal is delineated, specifically s 29A(2) and s 29A(4): 
 
 
(2) The criminal jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal shall consist of appeals against any decision made by the High Court in the exercise of its original criminal jurisdiction, subject nevertheless to the provisions of this Act or any other written law regulating the terms and conditions upon which such appeals may be brought. 
 
(4) The Court of Appeal shall, for the purposes of and subject to the provisions of this Act, have full power to determine any question necessary to be determined for the purpose of doing justice in any case before the Court.
  
 
 
It did not appear to us that the above two subsections in themselves took the applicant`s case very far, since there is no indication in them of Parliament`s intention to allow an appellant an indefinitely extended right of appeal in the sense of being able to pursue a second appeal even after his first has been duly heard and dismissed. As a matter of procedure, once the Court of Appeal has rendered judgment in an appeal heard by it, it is functus officio as far as that appeal is concerned. Counsel insisted, nonetheless, that the Judicature Act itself did not explicitly state the number of appeals that could be brought by an appellant. We were referred to the English authority of 
 R v Pinfold 
 in which the English Court of Appeal considered the issue of the number of appeals an appellant might bring, having regard to the provisions of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968.
Section 1(1) of that Act provides that `(a) person convicted of an offence on indictment may appeal to the Court of Appeal against his conviction`. In 
 Pinfold 
 the accused was convicted of murder in the High Court and his appeal was subsequently dismissed by the Court of Appeal. At trial crucial evidence was given by a prosecution witness who testified to having assisted in the murder (as well as in five other murders). Several years after the appeal, the same witness claimed to have lied in his evidence at trial and stated furthermore his willingness to give new evidence which would help exculpate the accused in regard to the murder he had been convicted of. An application was made by the accused for leave to appeal out of time against his conviction on the ground that a fresh point was to be raised. The Court of Appeal, in refusing his application, stated in its judgment that although there was no provision in the Criminal Appeal Act which expressly provided that one appeal was all that an appellant was allowed, yet one must read those provisions against the background of the fact that it is in the interests of the public in general that there should be a limit or finality to legal proceedings ... We have been unable to discover, nor have counsel been able to discover any situation in which a right of appeal couched in similar terms to that, has been construed as a right to pursue more than one appeal in one case.
We were somewhat bemused by counsel`s reliance on the above case since it seemed plain that its 
 ratio 
 was against him. Nevertheless counsel asserted that 
 Pinfold 
 was in fact cited for the purpose of contrasting the English system of criminal appeals with our own, his contention being that the two were structured so differently that any decision by the English Court of Appeal as to its own jurisdiction to hear fresh evidence in an appeal previously disposed of could not be of much persuasive authority in the context of our own experience. In particular, counsel stressed, the English appellant has recourse, in s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act, to executive intervention in the form of reference by the Home Secretary of any case to the Court of Appeal. Such reference is possible even after the time for appealing against conviction has expired or after an unsuccessful appeal has been made. Counsel argued that since no equivalent of the English s 17 is to be found in our Judicature Act, we should not be constrained by the position in England whereby a right of appeal is construed to mean a right to one appeal in one case.
We could not, however, accept the above reasoning. Counsel`s argument was premised on the assumption that an unsuccessful Singaporean appellant desirous of adducing fresh evidence in his case after the dismissal of his appeal will find himself with no further recourse or remedy. That is in fact inaccurate. For such an individual, a petition for clemency lies to the President of the Republic, pursuant to s 8 of the Republic of Singapore Independence Act. We could not agree either that the rationale of the decision in 
 Pinfold 
 was irrelevant to the workings of criminal justice in Singapore, since undeniably the need for finality and stability of legal proceedings is common to all legal systems and not confined to the English.
It appeared clear to us, therefore, that no legal basis existed for construing the word `appeal` to mean `more than one appeal` in the context of the Judicature Act; and that accordingly this court could not claim for itself jurisdiction to allow yet another appeal against conviction in a case where an appeal has already been heard and dismissed. Counsel attempted to persuade us that there had in fact been an exercise of such a jurisdiction by the Court of Appeal in 
 Ng Teo Chye v PP 
 (unreported). A close scrutiny of the circumstances in which the abovementioned motion was brought satisfied us, however, that the court`s decision in 
 Ng Teo Chye 
 was of no relevance to the present motion, being based on facts quite removed from those of the present applicant`s case. In 
 Ng Teo Chye 
 the applicant was one of five accused who stood trial in the High Court for charges of drug trafficking. All five were convicted; and, as in the normal course of events, notices of appeal were filed on behalf of all of them. Shortly afterwards however, Ng Teo Chye filed a notice to the effect that he did not intend to pursue the matter of his appeal any further. Following the successful appeal of one of his former co-accused sometime later, Ng apparently changed his mind and sought leave to bring an appeal out of time, pursuant to s 50 of the Judicature Act. In other words, no appeal from Ng was heard by the Court of Appeal prior to the making of the application in Criminal Motion No 3 of 1994; and we could not agree with counsel, therefore, that in granting Ng`s application on 15 March 1994, the court thereby permitted him to mount a further appeal against his conviction. The circumstances of Ng`s case may be contrasted with those of the present applicant`s. His appeal was heard by the Court of Appeal and the arguments of his counsel accorded careful consideration before the appeal was dismissed.
Having regard to the above reasons, we were of the considered opinion that this court had no jurisdiction to allow the present application; for, as was said in 
 Wong Hong Toy & Anor v PP 
, the Court of Appeal is a creature of the Judicature Act and has no powers other than those conferred by that Act. Accordingly we dismissed the application.

The respondent was charged in the subordinate court as follows: 
 
You, Iris Tan Khee Wan, f/27 years, NRIC No 1762733-C, are charged that you on 1 January 1994, at about 12.30am, at #05-00 Parkway Parade Office Tower, Singapore, being the licensee of public entertainment licence bearing serial number 188382, did infringe the licensing condition of: `Entertainers should not make any vulgar gestures, actions, or remarks during their performance`, by allowing one Ng Sing Chor, a performer, to cut his pubic hair and expose his buttocks, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 18(1)(c) of the Public Entertainments Act (Cap 257).
 
 
 
The respondent having claimed trial, the case was heard on 18 April 1994. At the close of the prosecution case, the district judge, holding that the prosecution had not proved the essential ingredients of the charge against the respondent, acquitted and discharged the respondent without calling for her defence. In her written grounds of decision, the district judge pointed out that the public entertainment licence specified in the charge was in fact stated to be valid only for the period 25 to 31 December 1993, whereas the charge preferred against the respondent alleged that she committed the offence in question on 1 January 1994. In the words of the district judge: 
 
Since the licence was no longer in force or had expired at midnight on 31 December 1993, there was no licence or licensing condition to infringe on 1 January 1994. The accused cannot be considered to be a licensee on 1 January 1994.
 
 
 
The present appeal was brought by the prosecution against the order of acquittal amounting to a discharge granted by the district judge.
On appeal it was clear, from the evidence before me, that the respondent had intended all along to apply for a licence which would cover the period 25 December 1993 to 1 January 1994. The assistant licensing officer responsible for processing the respondent`s application, one Ng Lay Ching (`Ms Ng`), confirmed in her statement that for her part she had intended to issue the respondent with a licence which would be valid for the period specified in the application, ie as from 25 December 1993 to 1 January 1994. The fact that the licence eventually issued was valid only up to 31 December 1993 was a genuine mistake due to Ms Ng`s oversight. It was argued by the deputy public prosecutor on appeal that, in view of the parties` intentions, the district judge should have held the licence to be valid on 1 January 1994. I could see no merit in such an argument, since it seemed to me totally irrelevant what the parties might have intended, so long as the licence on its face clearly expired on 31 December 1993. The crux of the appeal lay, in my opinion, in the question of whether, having noted the absence of a valid licence on 1 January 1994, the district judge should have amended the charge against the respondent accordingly.
In her grounds of decision, the district judge stated that, if there had been any offence committed at all by the respondent, it might be one of providing public entertainment without having a valid licence on 1 January 1994, this being an offence under s 18(1)(a) of the Public Entertainments Act. She explained, however, that she had chosen 
 not 
 to amend the charge accordingly because in her view, `
 The accused had in fact applied for a licence up to 1 January 1994. The mistake, if any, in the issue of the licence lied 
 [sic] 
 on the part of the Public Entertainment Licensing Unit 
`.
Counsel for the respondent urged this court to uphold the above reasoning, pointing out that the district judge bore no duty as such to amend the charge. Counsel submitted also that the onus lay on the prosecution in any case to decide what the real complaint against an accused was and to frame the charge or to submit amendments accordingly. In the present case, so counsel claimed, the prosecution had failed to ask the district judge for an amendment of the charge against the respondent and should not be allowed to argue on appeal that such amendment should have been effected. Two authorities were relied on by counsel: 
 PP v Heng You Nang 
 and 
 R v Cheah Teow Peng, 
 both judgments of Spenser-Wilkinson J.
In both cases, it was stressed that the 
 primary 
 duty in respect of the drawing up of charges was that of the prosecution`s; and further, that a trial judge was not himself obliged to `
 search the law for offences which an accused person may have committed 
`. Neither principle is in much dispute, but they really have no direct bearing on the case at hand. The fact remains that even though the prosecution in this case did not request an appropriate amendment of the charge, the district judge herself possessed the discretion to effect such amendment once she noted the strong possibility of another offence arising on the facts (an observation which, moreover, she articulated in her written grounds). Indeed, given that the evidence available pointed so obviously to the offence of providing public entertainment without a licence, she should have exercised her discretion so as to amend the charge accordingly, unless the proposed amendment prejudiced the respondent: see 
 R v Newcastle-upon-Tyne JJ, ex p John Bryce (Contractors) Ltd. 
 I must add at this juncture that it seems to me most counsel who cite the above two judgments of Spenser-Wilkinson J patently fail to note that in both instances the learned judge was of the opinion that `
 in a clear case, a president or a magistrate ought to alter a charge to fit the proved facts 
`.
In the present case it was not disputed that the respondent was the licensee of the entertainment licence No 188382. The subject of the licence was the provision of public entertainment in the form of an event billed as `Artists General Assembly`, to be held during the period 25 December 1993 to 1 January 1994. The licence as issued expired on 31 December 1993 but it was not disputed that on 1 January 1994, at about 12.30am, the respondent, in her capacity as licensee, allowed a performance by one Josef Ng Sin Chor to take place as part of the event. Clearly, there existed on the agreed facts a prima facie case of the respondent having committed an offence of providing public entertainment without a licence. The district judge`s reason for refusing to amend the charge appears to have derived from the view that an amendment would have been unjust to the respondent, the invalidity of the licence on 1 January 1994 being due only to a clerical error by the assistant licensing officer.
Having examined the circumstances of the case, it appeared to me that the clerical error of Ms Ng in itself would not have caused an amendment of the charge to be unjust vis-a-vis the respondent. The fact of the error would have gone only to the respondent`s defence or, more appropriately, towards the matter of mitigation. It did not detract from the facts which made up the essential ingredients for an offence of providing public entertainment without a licence. In any event I could not agree with the district judge`s view that the `fault` lay entirely with the public entertainment licensing unit. Granted that the licensing officer involved was careless, but the respondent herself was no less careless in failing to check that the licence issued conformed with the details she had given in her application. She was, after all, the party responsible for submitting the application as well as for collecting the licence when it was issued; and on collecting the licence she did read it, as was obvious from the notes of evidence. To depict the public entertainment licensing unit as the only negligent party in the whole affair, therefore, would hardly be accurate.
Counsel for the respondent submitted in the alternative that an amendment of the charge would have prejudiced the respondent in the sense that she had already prepared her defence to meet the original charge preferred. The short answer to this is, of course, that any possibility of such prejudice could have been resolved by allowing the defence an adjournment; and in fact a short adjournment would very probably have sufficed, since the trial of the original charge itself took but one day.
Having regard to the above reasons, I allowed the appeal of the prosecution and, in the exercise of the powers conferred on the High Court by s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code, remitted the case to the district judge for the accused to be called to enter upon his defence on an amended charge of providing public entertainment without a licence.

The three respondents were members of the same family, the second respondent Ng Ah Mui being the wife of Choo Thiam Hock the first respondent, and the third respondent Choo Kok Seng being their son. (In this judgment, when referring to the respondents individually, I shall refer to them respectively as the husband, the wife, and the son.) They were jointly tried in the district court on the following amended charges: 
 
First Charge:
 
 
 
You, Choo Thiam Hock, male 38 years, NRIC No 0677186 F
 
 
 
are charged that you, on or about 18 June 1990, between 5.30pm and 6pm, at Blk 864, Tampines Street 83 #04-438, Singapore voluntarily caused grievous hurt to one Lolita Purok, female 37 years, to wit, by punching her on the face, and kicking her on the ribs thus causing the fracture of the 6th, 7th and 8th ribs and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 325 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).

At the conclusion of the trial, all three respondents were acquitted of their respective charges, except the husband who was convicted on the second charge against him of using criminal force and was fined $500 which has been paid. The public prosecutor being dissatisfied with the acquittals on the other charges lodged these three appeals.
 Facts
On the evening of 18 June 1990 the complainant, a Filipina maidservant by the name of Lolita Purok arrived at Punggol Point Restaurant with her employer`s family, being the three respondents. A short while after they were seated, she suddenly left their table and crossed to a table of strangers asking for help, to no avail. The husband came over and took her forcefully by the hand but she resisted and continued to ask for help. Another stranger, Sam Peterson (PW3), who was having dinner at another table with some friends, went over to investigate the commotion. The husband told him to mind his own business as it was a family matter. The complainant, however, clutched at Mr Peterson`s legs and pleaded for help. He and his friends took her to their table, where she told them that she had been beaten up by the respondents. Mr Peterson testified that she had blood on her lips and that her palms were red. When she complained that her side was hurting her, Mr Peterson and his friends decided that she was indeed in pain. He called the police, who came and summoned an ambulance, which took her to Tan Tock Seng Hospital where she was examined and warded for three days. Eventually she was found to have a minor head injury and the following fresh injuries: 
 
 
(1) Small and superficial laceration of the right lower lip 
 
(2) Bruises over the bilateral cheek area 
 
(3) Multiple bruises over the left upper arm proximal and lateral aspect 
 
(4) Group of bruises over bilateral thighs 
 
(5) Small bruise over left thumb lateral aspect 
 
(6) Complete fractures of the right 6th, 7th and 8th ribs - the bones were broken through and through and no longer in alignment
  
 
 
She was also found to have several injuries a few days old: 
(7) Multiple small bruises over right chest area and right and abdomen 
(8) Bruise over left dorso aspect of chest
 
 
 
The allegation against all three respondents which was the basis of the main charges was that, in the early evening of 18 June 1990, the family had converged upon the complainant in her room and assaulted her together, the husband and son kicking her body and the wife punching her face. The complainant said that she had lost consciousness for a while and thereafter had obeyed instructions to wash and change before accompanying the family out to dinner, as she usually did. She was unable to suggest a precipitating cause for this attack.
The main injuries suffered by the complainant were the fractures of her ribs, which formed the basis of the first charge against the husband. The respondents suggested to her that she might have broken her ribs falling from a stepladder around 3pm that afternoon, while cleaning an airconditioner. She denied that she had fallen from a stepladder that day, and said that she had in fact cleaned the airconditioners in the morning, as was her usual routine after mopping the floor. Other objective evidence went towards the cause of the complainant`s broken ribs. The evidence of the radiologists for both the prosecution and the defence was that the fractures were consistent both with an impact with a ladder as well as with a kick, even a barefoot kick, at the ribs. They were aligned and the distance between the 6th and 8th ribs, from end to end of the fractures, was about 41/2 inches. The 6th rib fracture had a maximum displacement of 1/2 inch. It was common ground that to cause these fractures, the force of impact had to be fairly great; if she hit part of the ladder, the government radiologist said she would have had to fall on it from a great height. The fractures were closed, ie the skin was unbroken. The radiologist who gave evidence for the defence testified that it was more unlikely that the fractures were caused by a kick because the shape of the foot was not congruous with the shape of the ribs there. Presumably this meant that a kick to that part of the ribs would have been less likely to cause fractures that were aligned. However, he also said that in order for such fractures to have been sustained by a fall from a ladder, the complainant would have had to have fallen in such a way that the three ribs landed upon a straight edge, either the step or the side of the ladder, that was vertical in relation to her body, not horizontal. He also said that the edge of an aluminium ladder was more likely to cause an open fracture than a kick, and that these particular fractures must have been very painful.
Upon hearing the prosecution`s medical evidence, the evidence of witnesses to the incident at Punggol Point Restaurant and the evidence of the complainant, the district judge called upon the respondents to enter upon their defence. They all elected to give evidence.
 The defence
The respondents gave the following collective account. They had found the complainant an unsatisfactory employee. She had become unhappy and wanted to go home to the Philippines, but the husband had refused to buy her an air ticket as he was not contractually obliged to do so. It was suggested by counsel for the respondents in cross-examination that the complainant had been aggrieved by this; in short, that the complainant had broken her own ribs accidentally in falling from a stepladder while cleaning the airconditioners, or had had them broken by the son in an incident which I will describe later, had not sought medical attention and, in her vexation at the husband`s earlier refusal to send her home to the Philippines, used the chance opportunity presented by the occurrence of her untended injury to embarrass the respondents utterly by feigning desperation in public and creating a public scene.
The respondents asserted that none of them had used force on her on any occasion except once: the son said in court that on the morning of 18 June 1990 he had seen her in the next room squeezing dirty water from a cleaning cloth into a cup of Milo which he had asked her to make for him and from which he was to drink. He said both his parents had been in the room then. Upon his challenging her, the complainant had swung a chair at him and in retaliation he had punched and kicked her in the region of her right chest or shoulder, before his father managed to stop the fracas. His father had noticed no physical injury on her. The respondents continued to suggest therefore that the complainant might have broken her ribs falling accidentally from a stepladder around 3pm that afternoon, while she had been cleaning the airconditioners. Yet when they went out to dinner she had created the embarrassing scene described.
 Court`s findings
The district judge weighed the complainant`s account against that of the respondents and concluded that he had serious doubts about the complainant`s veracity. He took the view that she had a tendency to exaggerate to the point of untruthfulness and that her account of the relationship between herself and the respondents was unsatisfactory. Secondly, the district judge held that the fractures were more consistent with an impact with the side of an aluminium ladder. Finally, he found that the respondents could have had no motive to assault the complainant because they could easily have had her replaced by the agency. He said: 
 
The Choos, especially Mrs Choo (who appeared very mild and frail in court) did not strike me as violent people. If indeed Lolita was assaulted it seemed unlikely that all three Choos would join forces in an enclosed room to do so.
 
 
 
With respect, this was clearly a wrong finding when the son himself had admitted to having punched and kicked a female servant over the Milo incident. At any rate, for these reasons, the district judge felt in the end that, despite the undisputed evidence of the complainant`s injuries and the acute distress she displayed at Punggol Point Restaurant, it was unsafe to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the respondents were the responsible parties, and so he acquitted them all.
 The appeal
Given that there were only the respondents` and the complainant`s accounts of events to choose from, the inherent plausibility of their respective accounts was crucial in determining their credibility as witnesses. The undisputed and objective evidence was also a very strong indication of the true course of events. I have therefore considered very closely the evidence in the record, the arguments of counsel and the district judge`s grounds of decision. These were mainly targetted at the question of the complainant`s veracity. They were based not so much upon her demeanour as a witness but upon inferences made from the content of her evidence. This being so, an appellate court is of course in no worse position than the trial court to assess the same material. Having done so, I would agree with the prosecution that the conclusions of the trial judge on the complainant`s veracity, with respect, were not altogether supportable upon the evidence. In other words, the matters which he held to be adverse indications of the complainant`s credibility ought not to have had any such effect, even taken collectively.
The complainant`s employment in the respondents` home started ordinarily on 30 March 1990, but degenerated quickly and suddenly in the month of June 1990, to the point where, she alleged, the respondents had assaulted her on various occasions on the days preceding the incident at Punggol Point Restaurant. One factor which assumed a disproportionate importance in the evidence and later in the district judge`s grounds was that of the complainant`s sleep deprivation. Under cross-examination, she said that because of the work she had been made to do she had had only two to three hours` sleep every night since she started working for the respondents, yet despite being exhausted she had managed to wake each day at 5.30am without an alarm clock. However, there had been no prior intimation in her earlier evidence of this allegation of ill-treatment by way of sleep deprivation. Indeed, her evidence tended to go the other way. In examination-in-chief she had said only this: 
 
I started working for them on 30 March 1990 ... The first two months were okay. In the first week of June 1990 there was an incident ...
 
 
 
She also said that the respondents took her out for dinner whenever they went out for dinner, paid for those dinners, and were very kind to her for the first two weeks.
Unfortunately, just as the deputy public prosecutor had not introduced this allegation of sleep deprivation in the course of the complainant`s examination-in-chief, he did not see fit to re-examine her on it. This turned out to be a crucial aspect of the conduct of the case because the impression left by the complainant on the district judge, in the absence of either prior explanation or subsequent rehabilitation, was distinctly unfavourable. It formed one of the main reasons why the court regarded her as a witness upon whose sole direct evidence the respondents could not be safely convicted, even though the charges against them were strictly unrelated to this secondary issue.
It must be said that the respondents` evidence did not tally in several respects. For example, the son said that on the morning of 18 June 1990 his parents had been in the room when he challenged the complainant upon seeing her squeeze dirty water into his cup. However, both his parents denied that they were there at the beginning. His father said he had been woken up by the noise of their fight and therefore only arrived at the scene some time after it had begun. His mother said she had been asleep when she heard her husband`s voice, but when she went to look she only saw her husband talking to the complainant and her son shaking hands with her thereafter, clearly in the aftermath of the alleged fight. Furthermore, the son gave several different versions of that same alleged event. In his police statement of 21 June 1990 he voluntarily recounted that he had finished his drink and handed the cup to the complainant without incident. Subsequently, he said that he had seen her pour dishwashing detergent into the cup and had confronted her about this, although why he should have confronted her about such an apparently natural and even desirable action is impossible to fathom. In further demonstration of his own curious logic, he said he had asked her accusingly if she wanted him to die. Then she had refused to smell the cup, upon his asking her to, and instead had had the temerity to swing a plastic chair at him; in retaliation he had punched her in the face and kicked her in the stomach. He was then no more than 15 years old. This incident of unaccountable violence was voluntarily recounted by the son to the police officer investigating the case. The complainant denied that any such incident had occurred.
The complainant`s conduct at Punggol Point Restaurant held particular interest. When a sane adult person, of no more than common courage, and in what must with regret be acknowledged as a socially disadvantaged position, initiates a commotion in public, approaches complete strangers for help, clutches at their legs, and physically resists all requests or commands to return to his own company, indeed resists to the point of falling or crouching down, this is altogether indicative of the desperation that is born of fear, which is entirely inconsistent with an injury sustained in any accidental manner.
The complainant`s conduct at Punggol Point Restaurant was also incompatible with the district judge`s finding that she had lied about previous assaults on the ground that she had had ample opportunity to seek help in respect of them but had not done so. Furthermore, the alleged earlier assaults took place only on 16 and 17 June 1990. The complainant had called the agency which managed the employment contract only the month before from a public telephone instead of from the telephone in the respondents` apartment. If at that time, when no alleged assaults or even serious dissatisfaction had yet occurred, she had not felt free to use the telephone in the respondents` apartment, it was not to be expected that she would have been more forward when she had undergone actual assaults. In my opinion, her failure to seek earlier help ought not to have weighed against her credibility.
The husband testified that the ladder in their flat was four to five feet high and made of aluminium. Thus it could not have been heavy. The airconditioners were just beneath the ceiling. The complainant was about five feet tall. Given the ceiling height of the HDB flat, which was agreed to be eight feet, it was impossible that the complainant could have been on the top step of the ladder when cleaning the airconditioners. At most she was halfway up. It was unlikely that she could have lost her balance and fallen from such an altitude. Even if she had fallen, bringing the ladder down upon herself, it seems to me a very remote possibility that the force generated by the impact of a mere five foot aluminium ladder tipped over in this manner could have been sufficient to break three ribs.
Moreover, the complainant could not then have known what injury she had sustained. As the medical evidence agreed that the pain must have been very great, the agonising pain was all she could have been certain about. For all she knew, the injury could have been life-threatening. These were not circumstances in which concoction of an allegation against her employers might be anticipated. Besides, there was undisputed evidence that she had sought medical attention earlier in the period of her service with the respondents, when her hands had bled. She had telephoned the agency which managed the employment contract from a public telephone. Upon hearing of this from his young daughter, the husband had taken the complainant to the agency and had then paid for her treatment. Whatever the reasons for this, one would conclude from this event that the complainant was unlikely to have suffered real and acute pain in total silence. I need hardly comment on the wife`s evidence that, after her fall from the ladder, she went back to read the books in her room.
The complainant had had ten years of education and was giving evidence in a language that was not her first. The notes of evidence do show that there were occasions on which she apparently contradicted herself, although it must also be said that counsel rather unashamedly exploited her linguistic disadvantage. The district judge also considered as being important the fact that the complainant had described the wife as having once `pierced` her head with a steel can opener, when the complainant had no marks upon her head to bear this out. She explained in court that the opener had no sharp edge, an explanation which the district judge thought too glib. However, it appears from the notes of evidence that the explanation was not her own; it was counsel who put the explanation to her in cross-examination. When she volunteered information not suggested by counsel, it was in fact information that was consistent with the objective evidence as shown at p 36 of the notes of evidence: 
 
Q: Was there a sharp edge to the can opener?
 
 
 
A: No ...
 
 
 
Q: Any bleeding?
 
 
 
A: No. It was a bit swollen.
 
 
 
In sum, it is my opinion that the use of the word `pierced` by the complainant in examination-in-chief was explained rather than contradicted by her in this passage in cross-examination. Accordingly it was not a factor which ought to have weighed against her credibility.
Other matters were also taken into account by the district judge as being adverse to the complainant`s credibility. The district judge said that the earlier incidents in which the complainant had alleged that violence had been used upon her were all incidents in which the respondents were able to find fault with her. He thought it very strange that she was unable to suggest why the respondents might have attacked her on the evening of 18 June 1990. This seems to me of small moment. The `faults` found with the complainant in the previous alleged incidents were these: 
 
 
(1) she had failed to switch off the electric kettle - the husband had punched her in the face; 
 
(2) she had failed to switch off the light in a bedroom - the son had punched her in the stomach; 
 
(3) she had been accused falsely of scratching the kitchen cabinet - the wife had assaulted her with a can opener; 
 
(4) someone had dropped a biscuit on the floor after she had cleaned it - the husband had dragged her by her hair to the spot.
  
 
 
For immediate purposes, it is irrelevant whether or not these incidents truly happened, for we are concerned solely with the district judge`s reasoning. If these instances, assuming they had occurred, were indicative of the `fault` which the respondents felt to justify violence of that nature, can it really be said that the alleged attack of the evening of 18 June was, relative to these earlier incidents, strange because it was apparently unprovoked?
The district judge also took the point that originally the respondents had faced charges which named the time of the causing of hurt as being between 4.30 and 5.30pm. Then, when the husband and the son provided alibi evidence that they had not yet come home, the charges which were actually brought alleged that the time of the incident was between 5.30 and 6pm. The district judge said that this development struck him as evidence from someone who kept changing her mind about the incident. However, the time when something happens is often more difficult to remember or ascertain than the fact of its happening. In fact, the complainant`s evidence (at p 16) was simply that the incident occurred in the late afternoon; she could not indicate the time because she had no watch. I am not at all convinced that the time differential in this particular case could have been at all indicative either of material uncertainty or mendacity.
Finally, the district judge was unfavourably disposed to the complainant`s failure to explain other injuries that were found upon her. He said that it seemed likely that she had injured herself and thought it possible that the recent injuries were work-related. I am completely unable to see how the allegations of previous violent incidents were not an attempt to explain those less recent injuries. Moreover, the concentration of fresh injuries was such that, even if the complainant had been somewhat accident-prone, and thus sustained the older injuries, she must have had the most unbelievable bad luck to sustain all the recent injuries together.
Taken all together, I consider this a rare instance in which it would appropriate for me as an appellate judge to interfere with the district judge`s finding as to the credibility of the complainant. He did not base that opinion merely upon her demeanour in the witness box but quite rightly looked to the content of her evidence - unfortunately, in my opinion, he drew what appear plainly to be incorrect conclusions from his examination of that content. I am of the opinion that the reasons he gave for doubting the complainant`s veracity were unsound.
For all the reasons given, including the complainant`s conduct at Punggol Point Restaurant, the great improbability that her ribs were broken by impact with the ladder, and the fact that her credibility ought not to have been affected upon the grounds stated, I am of the opinion that her account of the events in the late afternoon on 18 June 1990 should have been preferred over those of the three respondents and that all the charges should have been found to have been proved beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly I am of the view that the prosecution`s appeal ought to be allowed, the acquittals set aside and the respondents convicted of the three remaining charges against them. Before sentence, I would like to hear addresses by counsel.

The appellant was convicted in the High Court of the murder of CNB Officer Insp Rajab bin Mohammed (the deceased), between 10pm on 8 March and 5am on 9 March 1993 at Blk 151, Serangoon North Ave 2, #02-41. He has now appealed against this conviction.
The deceased`s widow, Mdm Masita Sanoesi (Mdm Masita), testified that on 8 March at about 8.40pm, the deceased had telephoned CNB Officer Toon Ah Oon and requested him to inform the CNB Operations Room that he was going to meet an agent in Serangoon North, before he left his home at Blk 106, Towner Road, #08-446, taking his service revolver with him, which he tucked in his waist; he was driving his Daihatsu Charade SBF 7715U. The deceased was the supervisor and officer-in-charge of CNB Cpl Ey Hock Chin (Cpl Ey). Cpl Ey stated that, at or about 9.05pm on 8 March 1993, while he was on duty at the Keppel Railway Station, the deceased called him on the telephone to enquire as to who were the officers on duty at the railway station. When Cpl Ey informed him that there were three of them on duty there, the deceased told Cpl Ey and the others to stand by to await for his further call. The deceased did not state for what reason they were to stand-by. Cpl Ey paged the deceased at about 11.30pm but there was no reply. Cpl Ey then left for home at about 2am. At about 7am on 9 March 1993, Cpl Ey learnt from the CNB that the deceased had not returned home that night. He himself had not heard from the deceased. Mdm Masita made a police report on 9 March 1993 at 4.27pm that the deceased had not returned home or called her since leaving home at about 8.40pm on 8 March 1993.
The appellant was arrested on 9 March 1993 at about 8.45pm by CNB officers, but not in connection with the murder of the deceased. The investigations were initially carried out by Cpl Goh Beng Huat in relation to the missing persons report filed by Mdm Masita. On 10 March 1993, the investigations were handed over to Insp T Maniam (Insp Maniam) of the CID, the investigating officer of the case, who instructed Cpl Yee Fook Chung to place the appellant on arrest on the charge of murder of the deceased.
On 11 March 1993, the appellant led Insp Maniam to the deceased`s body which was bundled unceremoniously in cloth and hidden by cushions and newspapers in the back seat of his Daihatsu parked at the car park of Blk 492A, Tampines Ave 9, Street 45. A black waist pouch belonging to the deceased was also recovered from the back seat of the car.
Dr Wee Keng Poh (Dr Wee) was the forensic pathologist who examined the deceased`s body on 12 March 1993. He found the post-mortem changes present consistent with death having occurred about three days previously, ie on or about 8 March 1993. He found the following external injuries: 
 
 
(1) Group of two lacerations, measuring 1.5cm and 0.5cm and 1 x 0.5cm with surrounding bruise over the mid forehead. 
 
(2) Laceration, 2 x 0.5cm, left forehead just above and lateral to the left eyebrow. 
 
(3) Laceration, right temporoparietal scalp, measuring 3 x 0.5cm and with surrounding bruise. 
 
(4) Laceration, over right eyebrow laterally and with underlying compound comminuted fractures of the right orbital margins. 
 
(5) Laceration, 4 x 0.5cm, left parieto-occipital scalp. 
 
(6) Extensive oblique bruise with underlying haematoma, measuring 16 x 10cm with a small oblique laceration over the right parieto-occipital scalp, measuring 3.5cm x 0.5cm. 
 
(7) Oblique bruise across bridge of nose, the left cheek to over the left mid mandible. 
 
(8) Small laceration left lower lip laterally, measuring 0.5cm x 0.25cm.
  
 
 
The top of the deceased`s skull had suffered a near complete circumferential fracture.
His right third to fifth ribs were fractured anteriorly with intact parietal pleura.
Dr Wee stated that injuries (1) to (5) were caused by several blows with a heavy object inflicted with considerable force and that injuries (1) to (4) were inflicted from the front. He said that it was unlikely that the injuries were inflicted accidentally. Dr Wee was unable to say how many blows were involved but he opined that there must have been more than one. He elaborated that the circumferential fracture could have been caused by blows to the front, sides or back of the head, with more blows from the front. He disagreed with defence counsel`s suggestion that the injuries could have been caused by a fist or for that matter by the deceased falling down from a standing position. He proffered the opinion that they could have been caused by the mortar recovered from the appellant`s flat. The net effect of these five injuries was that the top of the skull suffered a near complete circumferential fracture such that death would have occurred in a matter of minutes and that immediate medical attention would not have saved the deceased`s life. He confirmed that the skull fracture was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. There were no defensive injuries found on the deceased.
On 12 March 1993 at about 11.35am, the appellant led Insp Maniam to Blk 466, Ang Mo Kio 10, #10-1032 (the appellant`s mother-in-law`s home at the material time), where he seized an `Old Spice` blue handbag (blue bag) which contained the following items: 
 
 
(1) a Smith & Wesson revolver NO CNB 222 in a holster with five rounds of 0.38 ammunition; 
 
(2) a Tag Heuer wrist watch; 
 
(3) a shorthand notebook and three exercise books; 
 
(4) a pair of spectacles and holder; 
 
(5) two keys and a key pouch; and 
 
(6) a dagger and a metal rod in a sheath.
  
 
 
On 12 March 1993 at Blk 151, #02-41, Serangoon North Ave 2 (the scene of the killing specified in the murder charge), Insp Maniam directed police photographer Teo Kay Huat to take photographs of, inter alia, blood stains on the floor in the sitting room next to the main door of the appellant`s flat.
In his medical report on the appellant dated 3 May 1993, Dr Wong Weng Yew stated that he attended to the appellant on 12 March 1993 at about 3pm. The appellant claimed that he had been punched and complained of pain over the abdomen and the left ear. Dr Wong`s examination revealed that the appellant was comfortable, conscious and alert. The appellant had two linear scratch marks measuring 0.3cm long on the upper back. These scratch marks were crusting at the edges and were about a day old. Dr Wong opined that the scratch marks could have been caused by any sharp object, such as the sharp edge of a ruler. The appellant also had four small bruises about 2cm on his left wrist. Dr Wong was of the view that these were as a result of the handcuffs. There was a small ulcer on his lower right lip. Dr Wong disagreed with defence counsel, under cross-examination, that the ulcer could have been caused by a punch, as there was an absence of a resolving bruise adjacent to the ulcer. The abdomen was soft and there was no tenderness on palpation, indicating no sign of injury to the abdomen. There were no other injuries discovered on the appellant.
After this examination, the appellant gave the following cautioned statement on 12 March 1993 pursuant to the charge of murder which was admitted as evidence and unchallenged by the defence: 
 
I hammered Rajab with a mortar inside my flat on his head. I did not have the intention to kill him. But when he retaliated and tried to pull out his revolver from his waist pouch, I hit him again with the mortar on his body. He used his hands to press against my neck. Then I hit again with the mortar on his head. I stopped hitting him when he became motionless. I wrapped him in a piece of cloth and carried the body to his car and drove and abandoned the car with the body inside at Multi Storey Car Park in Tampines.
 
 
 
On 11 September 1993, the appellant gave a cautioned statement in relation to a charge for being in unlawful possession of a revolver and five rounds of ammunition. The statement, which was admitted without challenge read as follows: 
 
The said revolver does not belong to me. It belongs to the deceased Tuan Rajab. I found the revolver in his blue handbag. Later, I placed it in a plastic bag and kept it at my flat at Blk 151, Serangoon North Ave 2, #02-41. After abandoning the body of the deceased in Tampines, I returned home. Sometime in the afternoon, I brought the revolver, which was in the blue handbag, to my mother-in-law`s flat at Blk 466, Ang Mo Kio Ave 10. I do not know the unit number of this flat. I had no intention to use it.
 
 
 
The appellant testified that he had known the deceased since 1990. The appellant was an informer of the CNB and they shared the payments which he received from the CNB. They saw each other socially. Documentary proof consisting of entries in exercise books were produced to show that the deceased and the appellant were involved in horse betting activities. Punters would place bets with them and they would also bet against each other. The appellant claims that, over the years, he had made loans to the deceased totalling $40,000.
On weekends, they would gamble against each other at the Turf Club. In the normal course of events, these betting debts would be settled on the following Monday or Tuesday. On the weekend of 6 and 7 March 1993, the appellant lost $4,730 to the deceased. The deceased telephoned him on 7 March 1993 and asked for the money to be paid that same night. The appellant was unable to do so and requested time to pay up. The deceased said that he needed the money as he was also losing, presumably to others. The deceased told the appellant to get the money by that night, and that he would call again the following day. The appellant tried to get the money that night and the following day but was unsuccessful. At 6pm on 8 March 1993, the appellant told the deceased who had paged him that he had been unable to raise the money. The deceased told the appellant to get the money by that night. That evening, the appellant was painting his flat; his wife had left to stay with her mother for the night. He continued painting until 8 or 9pm, when someone knocked on the door. It was the deceased. The appellant invited him in and they discussed the question of the $4,730. The appellant said that he would try to get the money and would get in touch within a day or two. That was not good enough for the deceased who wanted the money that same night. The deceased wanted the appellant to stop painting the flat and go out to look for the money. The deceased suggested that he borrow from an illegal moneylender. The appellant refused, saying that if his other creditors could wait, why couldn`t he as well. The deceased disbelieved the appellant that he did not have other sources for raising the money. The appellant suggested setting off the $4,730 against the loans which the deceased had borrowed from him. The deceased refused, saying that the loans were a separate matter.
The turning point came when the deceased took off his wrist watch and placed it on the coffee table in the living room. The deceased told the appellant that he was causing him trouble. The appellant then stood up (he had been seated all this while) and said that he refused to borrow from an illegal moneylender and that he did not have other debtors at that time. The deceased became furious and used his hand to assault the appellant, saying at the same time that the appellant was causing him trouble and putting him into difficulties. The deceased kept assaulting the appellant. The appellant told him to desist. The appellant claimed that he was punched in the face, mouth, head and ears. The punch to his mouth had caused his lower lip to be cut and bleed. His left ear was throbbing. Suddenly, the deceased kicked him on his abdomen. The kick felled him such that his legs were in the living room but his upper body was in the kitchen. At that moment he happened to see a mortar on the kitchen floor. He picked up the mortar and stood up. The deceased was coming at him, trying to unzip his waist pouch to get at his service revolver which was inside. The appellant swung the mortar in a state of confusion and panic, hitting the deceased on the body. The deceased retaliated by pushing the appellant back. The appellant sensed that the deceased was about to launch another attack and he moved away; still holding the mortar, he backed towards the wall. The deceased used his left hand to choke the appellant. The appellant could not breathe and he responded by using the mortar to hit him on the head. The deceased was successfully pushed back; holding his head he assumed a `sitting position`. As the appellant was trying to regain his breath, he noticed that the deceased was lying on the floor. He also noticed the deceased`s revolver lying on the floor. He picked up the revolver. The main door was ajar. The appellant closed it. He noticed that the deceased was bleeding and the blood was `flowing towards the front door of the flat`. The appellant tried to rouse him but there was no response. He cut the waist pouch and took the pouch out from his body and retrieved the car keys from the pouch.
He wrapped the body with a bed sheet. The appellant went downstairs, located the deceased`s car and parked it near the staircase of his block. The appellant was unable to carry the deceased. In the end, he managed to persuade his wife to return home to help him. He went downstairs to the car and cleared the contents of the boot but noticed that the boot of the car was too small and that the back seat was spacious. The couple then carried the deceased with the appellant pushing the body and his wife pulling him by the legs. At the edge of the stairs, they dropped the body accidentally. Finally, they managed to carry the body down and place it in the back seat. The appellant covered the body with newspapers, drove the car to Tampines, locked the car and threw away the car keys. Upon returning to his flat, he removed all signs of blood. At the car park where he had earlier parked the car, he noticed a blue bag under a tree. Inside were a notebook and three exercise books. He took the blue bag up to the flat and placed the deceased`s watch, a dagger from his room and the deceased`s revolver inside. He then went to his mother-in-law`s flat and kept the blue bag there. He resolved to keep the bag there rather than throw it away lest someone found it. Later, when events had cooled off, he resolved to hand the revolver over to the police.
The whole gamut of defences available on a charge of murder was raised at the trial. None of them succeeded before the trial judge. Before us, however, the appellant`s counsel confined himself particularly to contending that the appellant`s defence ought not to have been called and, in any event, the defences of the right of private defence of person (exception 2 to s 300 of the Penal Code) and sudden fight (exception 4 to s 300 of the Penal Code) had been made good by the appellant`s evidence, his being the only direct evidence at the trial. The defence of grave and sudden provocation (exception 1 to s 300 of the Penal Code), which was one of the defences taken at the trial, was not pursued before us. We will now deal with these contentions.
A submission of no case to answer was made at the close of the prosecution`s case. The trial judge ruled that the appellants` cautioned statement, which had been admitted in evidence as part of the prosecution`s case, was an admission that the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a mortar and that the pathologist`s evidence was that the deceased`s death resulted from multiple fractures of the skull caused by blows from a heavy object and, accordingly, the prosecution had proved a sufficient case on the murder charge for him to call upon the appellant to enter upon his defence. Before us, appellant`s counsel argued that the prosecution had failed to show a prima facie case of an intention on the appellant`s part to cause the fatal injuries to the deceased and that the medical evidence did not in fact disclose that the skull fractures were what caused the deceased`s death. We see no merit in this submission. In our view, the appellant`s cautioned statement was indeed an admission that he had hit the deceased on the head with a mortar. Admittedly, parts of the cautioned statement were exculpatory in nature. However, it is now settled law that the exculpatory parts of a cautioned statement will be considered at the end of the trial and not at the close of the prosecution`s case. The medical evidence left no room for doubt as Dr Wee`s evidence was that the skull fractures were unlikely to be accidental and could have been caused by the mortar recovered from the appellant`s flat. On the question that the medical evidence did not in fact disclose that the skull fractures were what caused the deceased`s death, Dr Wee was clear in his evidence that the skull fractures he saw on the deceased would have, in the ordinary course of nature, caused his death. He was also of the view that immediate medical attention would not have saved the deceased`s life. The fact that he could not discern brain injury which is what in fact causes the death due to the liquefaction of the brain is neither here nor there. Dr Wee conducted the post-mortem examination on the deceased`s body three days after death had occurred. We are satisfied that the trial judge correctly called upon the appellant to enter upon his defence on the charge of murder, as, in our judgment, the prosecution had made out a case which, if unrebutted, would have warranted his conviction.
The main thrust of the appellant`s defences of the right of private defence of person and sudden fight was that he did not have the intention to kill the deceased. In our judgment, he had laid the foundation for these defences as early as the recording of the cautioned statement under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which was recorded on 12 March 1993. Although he was taken into custody on 9 March 1993 by CNB officers, it was only on 10 March 1993 that he was handed over to Insp Maniam of the CID, who then investigated into the murder of the deceased which resulted in the appellant taking Insp Maniam to the deceased`s body on 11 March 1993, which he had disposed of in the back seat of the deceased`s Daihatsu parked at the car park of Blk 492A, Tampines Ave 9, Street 45. In that cautioned statement he said: 
 
... I did not have the intention to kill him. But when he retaliated and tried to pull out his revolver from his waist pouch, I hit him again with the mortar on his body. He used his hand to press against my neck. Then I hit him again with the mortar on his head. I stopped hitting him when he became motionless ....
 
 
 
In our judgment, the appellant`s account of the events that occurred in his flat, from the moment the deceased arrived there on 8 March 1993 to the appellant realizing that he had killed the deceased, as given by him in his evidence and which was tested by cross-examination, is not inconsistent with his cautioned statement in material particulars. Of course it lacked the detail but, in our view, a cautioned statement recorded under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code, which requires such a statement to be recorded on being charged with an offence or on being officially informed that he may be prosecuted for it, does not require the accused person to minutely detail the defence he will be relying on at the trial. All that is required is that a material fact which will be relied on at the trial must be stated in the cautioned statement or else it is less likely to be believed if that fact is raised at the trial for the first time. The words of the caution contained in s 122(6) are: 
 
... If there is any fact on which you intend to rely in your defence in court, you are advised to mention it now. If you hold it back till you go to court, your evidence may be less likely to be believed and this may have a bad effect on your case in general ... .
 
 
 
The material facts stated by the appellant in his cautioned statement are: 
 
 
(1) that he did not intend to kill the deceased; 
 
(2) that he hit the deceased on the body with the mortar when the deceased tried to pull out his revolver from his waist pouch; 
 
(3) that the deceased used his hand to press against the appellant`s neck; 
 
(4) that the appellant hit the deceased again on the head with the mortar; 
 
(5) that the appellant stopped hitting the deceased when he became motionless.
  
 
 
It will be noted that the foregoing material facts were stated in the cautioned statement in the same sequence as listed above.
In his grounds of judgment, in evaluating the evidence, the trial judge noted: 
 
In his cautioned statement in answer to the murder charge, there was no reference to Insp Rajab (the deceased) assaulting him and causing him to fall onto the ground before he struck the inspector with the mortar for the first time. From the statement, he started the exchange by hitting the inspector on the head with the mortar.
 
 
 
It seems to us that the trial judge inferred from the opening sentence of the cautioned statement - `I hammered Rajab with a mortar inside my flat on his head` - that the first thing the appellant did during his encounter with the deceased was to hit him on the head with the mortar. In our judgment, this is not a reasonable or correct inference to draw from the cautioned statement as it completely overlooks the rest of the cautioned statement, from which it is clear that the first blow with the mortar was to the deceased`s body.
Next the trial judge noted: 
 
On reviewing the evidence, I did not find evidence of a fight as described by the accused. There may have been some physical exchange between the accused and the inspector, perhaps a scuffle and some pulling and pushing as suggested by the minor injuries found on the accused, but I did not accept his claim that the inspector had punched and kicked him in the abdomen, and strangled him by the neck and was pulling out his revolver.
 
 
 
The basis of this finding as stated in the grounds of judgment was that although the appellant had told Dr Wong Weng Yew at the Alexandra Hospital on 12 March 1993 that he had been punched and complained of pain over the abdomen and left ear, which the doctor had noted in his medical report, the appellant had not complained `of having been choked by the neck, nor did he complain of any resultant pain or discomfort from being choked`. Further the trial judge noted in his grounds of judgment that although the appellant, at the trial, had testified that he told the officers who had interrogated him after his arrest that he had pains in his stomach, chest and head, he had not said `that he told them that Insp Rajab choked him by the neck, or was pulling out a revolver,` and this had not been put to the officers although they were witnesses or were available for cross-examination at the trial.
With all due respect to the trial judge, the inferences which he drew from his evaluation of the evidence as a whole, as discussed above, were neither strong nor irresistible, and, in our judgment, not sufficient to discredit and render worthless the evidence of the appellant, which, as we have said, is not inconsistent with his cautioned statement or so incredible as not to be worthy of belief. The conclusions and reasonable inferences, to draw from the appellant`s evidence, were that the deceased was the aggressor; that the deceased had punched and kicked at the appellant in a fit of fury when the appellant had refused to borrow money from an illegal moneylender to pay the deceased his winnings from gaming the weekend before; that the appellant had been felled by a kick on his stomach; that he fell at the doorway of the kitchen, where he saw the mortar and picked it up to defend himself with and stood up; that the deceased approached him trying to unzip his waist pouch to get at his revolver; that the appellant swung the mortar at the deceased`s body hitting him there, with a view to disarming him; that the deceased nevertheless advanced towards the appellant and pushed him back and held him at the throat with his left hand; and that the appellant then struck the deceased on the head with the mortar.
On the question of the deceased trying to pull out his revolver from his waist pouch, which was what the appellant said in his cautioned statement as well as in his evidence in court, the trial judge found the evidence `unsatisfactory` because, as the trial judge noted in his grounds of judgment, the appellant, in his cautioned statement recorded in connection with the unlawful possession of firearms and ammunition, had said - `I found the revolver in his [deceased`s] blue bag` - and, further, the deceased`s widow had said in evidence that when the deceased left his home that night on 8 March 1993, he had tucked his revolver in his waist. The inference which the trial judge drew was that the deceased could not have been reaching for his revolver in his waist pouch.
The question of the revolver requires further consideration as the nub of the defence of the right of private defence of person in this case is that the appellant was in fear for his life when he saw the deceased approaching him, trying to unzip his waist pouch to get at his revolver. The appellant explained in his evidence that he had been misunderstood, or what he had said had been misinterpreted when the cautioned statement in question was recorded. What he had said or what he had meant to say was that he had kept the revolver in the blue bag (meaning that he kept it there after picking it up from the floor after the incident) and not found it in the blue bag. In fact, the revolver was recovered by the appellant from the floor of his flat after the encounter. The uncontroverted evidence of the deceased`s widow was that he left the flat that night with the revolver tucked in his waist. Whether at the time of the incident the deceased had the revolver tucked in his waist or whether he had it in his waist pouch is an irrelevant consideration. The appellant could well have been mistaken when he saw the deceased`s hand go to his waist, that he was trying to unzip the waist pouch or reach for the revolver tucked in his waist, which, it is reasonable to assume, was hidden from view underneath his shirt. The appellant, no doubt, had assumed that the deceased was armed. In our view, this is not an unreasonable assumption on the part of the appellant as he knew the deceased was a CNB officer with whom he had a long standing working relationship as the deceased`s informer on drug trafficking activities, and knew or must have known that the deceased normally carried his revolver with him. The appellant`s evidence explaining his cautioned statement, on 11 September 1993, in connection with the charge of being in possession of fire arms made six months after the alleged murder of the deceased seems to us to be a credible explanation that there was some misunderstanding and confusion as to whether the appellant had found the revolver in the blue bag or whether he had kept it in the blue bag after he retrieved it from the floor in the flat after the incident. It seems to us a reasonable deduction from the evidence that the deceased had his revolver on his person and that the appellant interpreted the deceased`s hand movements as going for his revolver. We can find no reason to hold otherwise. Hence, there is greater credence of his evidence and his defence of the right of private defence of person than the learned judge was prepared to accord to the appellant.
The appellant, in his cautioned statement, said that he had no intention to kill the deceased. Counsel also submitted before us that the killing of the deceased was not premeditated. He further submitted that had the appellant pre-planned to murder the deceased, he would have used the dagger instead of the mortar to assault the deceased with, which was an unwieldly weapon to handle on account of its weight and configuration. It will be remembered that there was a dagger in the flat which the appellant put away with the revolver in the blue bag which he later took to his mother-in-law`s flat. We find that there is substance in this argument which was not considered by the trial judge. From a reading of the trial judge`s grounds of judgment, it appears to us that he proceeded on the basis that the killing was premeditated, which arose from his assumption that it was the appellant who `started the exchange of hitting the inspector on the head with the mortar`. We have alluded to this earlier in our judgment. From a reading of the whole of the evidence and our understanding of it, this assumption of the trial judge was erroneous.
In our judgment, this was not a premeditated killing. However, that alone is not sufficient to make good either of the two defences relied on, that of the right of private defence of person or sudden fight. Amongst other things, it must be shown that, in the former, there was no intention of doing more harm than was necessary for the purpose of such defence and, in the latter, that the appellant had not taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. The standard of proof required to make good both these defences is on a balance of probabilities. See 
 Soosay v PP 
, where this court discussed both these defences fully.
Both these defences are exceptions to s 300 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). Exception 2, which deals with the defence of the right of private defence of person, reads: 
 
Culpable homicide is not murder if the offender, in the exercise in good faith of the right of private defence of person (or property), exceeds the power given to him by law, and causes the death of the person against whom he is exercising such right of defence, without premeditation and without any intention of doing more harm than is necessary for the purpose of such defence.
 
 
 
Exception 4 which deals with the defence of sudden fight reads: 
 
Culpable homicide is not murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
 
 
 
It is pertinent to note that the defence of the right of private defence of person under s 100 of the Penal Code, quite rightly, was not raised as a defence. The facts of this case could not have sustained the defence of the right of private defence of person under s 100 of the Penal Code.
In the view the trial judge took of the evidence, he summarily dismissed the defences of the right of private defence of person and sudden fight, saying of the former: 
 
He [the appellant] did not satisfy me that he was exercising a right of private defence in good faith when he struck Insp Rajab [the deceased] on the head with the mortar. To the contrary, I found that he had intended to cause more harm than was necessary in the circumstances.
 
 
 
And of the latter by saying: 
 
The accused failed to satisfy me that there was a fight of the ferocity described by him and he failed to bring himself within the exception as it was not his case that he acted in the heat of passion when he struck the deceased.
 
 
 
However, on our analysis of the evidence, we are satisfied that the appellant was exercising the right of private defence when the deceased had felled him with a kick to the abdomen and advanced towards the appellant, going for his revolver at his waist, either tucked in there or in the waist pouch. The appellant had then stood up after taking hold of the mortar which he saw on the kitchen floor. He had fallen in the doorway to the kitchen with the upper part of his body inside the kitchen. We are satisfied that the first blow struck by the appellant with the mortar was at the body of the deceased and that it was in the exercise of the right of private defence, because he thought that the deceased was going for his revolver. His evidence on this was: `When I noticed that he was trying to get his pistol from the pouch, I hit him on his body. I hit him in order to ward him off from me.`
The deceased was not repulsed by being hit on the body by the mortar but came right back at the appellant. This is what the appellant said in his evidence: 
 
I used the mortar to hit him on the body and at the same time I used my hand to push him. When he pushed me, I retreated a few steps backwards. He attacked me. I tried to move away from him by moving backwards. He continued to attack me and used his hand to choke me.
 
 
 
After a few questions from the trial judge to clarify where all this was taking place, the appellant continued: 
 
He pushed me and started to attack me. I retreated backwards until I reached the wall. At the time, I was near the wall. He suddenly used his hand and put it on my throat and choked me. When he did that, I found difficulty to breathe. He continued to choke me and at the same time I noticed that his right hand was somewhere at his waist. His right hand was at his waist level, maybe at the pouch he was wearing. I am not sure. When I found difficulty in breathing, I started to hit him with the mortar two or three times ... I then took his hand and pushed it away, sir. He then started to put his hands on his head and then he was in the sitting position as if in pain. He was crouching down in pain. At that time, I was trying to get my breath back. Then I saw him on the floor and I had the impression that he was in pain.
 
 
 
To a question whether the appellant had hit the deceased again after he fell down, the appellant said: 
 
No, I did not. At that time when I was holding my hands to my throat, I sat down. At that time, when I wanted to sit down, the mortar was still in my hand. When I sat down, I released the hold on the mortar. I noticed that the deceased was already on the floor, lying down. He was in pain. After that he was motionless. He was quiet. He was quiet, motionless.
 
 
 
Our analysis of this evidence is that the appellant had first hit the deceased on his body with the mortar, in good faith in the exercise of the right of private defence as he thought the deceased was going for his revolver. We have already said that the appellant`s belief that the deceased was armed with a revolver was a reasonable assumption and that it was also a reasonable assumption that the deceased was going for his revolver when the appellant noticed the deceased`s hand going to his waist. Instead of being repulsed, the deceased advanced on the appellant, pushing him and attacking him whilst the appellant retreated backwards until he could retreat no further. His back was against the wall and the deceased had now put his hand on the appellant`s throat and was choking him with one hand. The appellant noticed the deceased`s other hand go up to his waist and it was at this moment, being choked with one hand to the point of having difficulty to breathe and still in fear that the deceased was going for his revolver, that the appellant launched the blows on the deceased`s head with the mortar which he still held in his hand. The impression we get from a reading of the appellant`s evidence is that the assault on him was relentless and he was fearful for his life, of being strangled and shot as well. We see no reason for not accepting the appellant`s evidence of the sequence of events as narrated by him. In the absence of other evidence, it is not so incredible to be rendered unworthy of credit. As we have already said, the appellant`s evidence is not inconsistent with his cautioned statement. We have no doubt that the deceased, who, we were told from the bar, was of a stronger physique than the appellant (which we have no reason to doubt), had overpowered the appellant and had had him at his mercy when the appellant struck him on the head with the mortar.
On his own evidence, the appellant struck the deceased two or three times on the head with the mortar. Only then, as he said, was he able to push the deceased`s hand away. We are unable from the medical or other evidence to draw the inference that the appellant 
 intended 
 to do more harm than was necessary for the defence of the right of private defence. It does seem to us, however, that although the appellant acted in good faith in the exercise of the defence of the right of private defence and without premeditation, he did exceed his right of private defence when he struck the deceased on the head with the mortar, which, after all, is a solid and weighty object, more than once.
On our analysis of the evidence, we are satisfied that there was a sudden fight between the deceased and the appellant and that it arose out of a sudden quarrel over the payment of the $4,730 by the appellant to the deceased. What we have said in relation to the defence of the right of private defence to person equally applies to the defence of sudden fight. We are unable to say that, in all the circumstances which we have discussed above, it can be said that the appellant had taken undue advantage of the situation or had acted in a cruel or unusual manner.
For the foregoing reasons, the appellant`s conviction for the murder of the deceased cannot be sustained. The conviction of murder will be quashed and, in its place, the appellant will be convicted for culpable homicide of the deceased not amounting to murder, and we will sentence him to imprisonment for a term of ten years under para (b) of s 304 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
At the same trial, the appellant was also convicted on two counts of unlawful possession of arms and ammunition vide s 3(1) of the Arms Offences Act (Cap 14), for which he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of six years and six strokes of the cane on each charge, the sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently with effect from 9 March 1993. There has been no appeal against those convictions or the sentences imposed. Accordingly, the sentence of ten years` imprisonment hereby imposed will run consecutively to the terms of imprisonment for the convictions of the offences under the Arms Offences Act.

 The facts
 
The appellants were the landlords and the respondents, the tenants, of units 01-16/17 of Wisma Atria (the premises) under a three-year lease dated 24 January 1986 (the lease). Sometime between 15 and 17 July 1986, the tenants took possession of the premises; renovation and interior decoration of the premises amounting to $49,682 were subsequently effected by the tenants. On 15 August 1986, water leaked from a fire hose-reel adjacent to the premises and, as a result, flooded the premises, causing damage to the tenants` property. The tenants had taken out insurance which included the risk of `bursting or overflowing of water tanks/pipes`. The tenants gave notice of the flooding damage to the insurers and made a claim on them. The claim was met by their insurers, who subsequently instituted an action in the district court against the landlords in the name of the tenants in exercise of their right of subrogation. The thrust of their claim was that the flooding was caused by the landlords` negligence.
The claim was resisted by the landlords. First, they denied that the flooding was caused by their negligence or that of their servants or agents. Secondly, they maintained that even if the flooding had been so caused, the contractual effect of cl 10(a) (`the insurance clause`) of the lease was that the tenants assumed the risk of such damage and consequently had no claim against them. As the tenants had no right of action against the landlords, their insurers, likewise, were unable to pursue such an action.
 Decisions below
In the district court, the trial judge found that the landlords` negligence had caused the damage. He further held that the tenants had not assumed the risk of damage by flooding by virtue of the insurance clause. The insurance clause was construed by the trial judge in the light of cl 11(a) of the lease, which released the landlords from all claims and demands by the tenants unless they resulted from the landlords` negligence. Further, the trial judge also relied on cl 21(h) of the lease, which excluded any term from being implied into the lease, and held that, by reason thereof, it could not be implied into the insurance clause that the tenants assumed the risk of damage by the landlords` negligence. He allowed the claim of the tenants and gave judgment to them in the sum of $41,916 with interest and costs.
On appeal to the High Court, Punch Coomaraswamy J agreed with the trial judge`s finding that the landlords had been negligent and also held that, on its true construction, the insurance clause did not protect the landlords against any damage caused by their negligence. He found that since the insurance clause was merely a `covenant at large`, the tenants could not be sued even if they had failed to effect any insurance. Thus, the learned judge held that the insurance effected by the tenants was not for the benefit of the landlords. Accordingly, he held that the landlords were not absolved from their liability in negligence. He dismissed the appeal with costs. [See 
 
 
[1993] 3 SLR 781
 .]
 The appeal
Against the decision of the learned judge, this appeal has been brought. Before us, the landlords appealed on two main grounds. Firstly, they averred that the learned judge had erred in finding that the landlords were negligent, and secondly, that the learned judge had erred in holding that the insurance clause did not absolve the landlords from their liability in negligence. The first is a question of fact, and the second a question of law.
 Negligence
Before us, it was submitted on behalf of the landlords that they had not been negligent and had not breached any duty of care owed to the tenants. They contended that the standard of care imposed on them by the courts below was akin to an absolute duty, when what the law required of them was only the standard of reasonable care and skill of a landlord.
To deal with this issue, it is necessary to rehearse in some detail the evidence relating to the flooding that took place. On 15 August 1986, at about 10.15am, the tenants` managing director, Leong Loon Wah (Leong), received information that their premises had been flooded. He proceeded to the premises to check the extent of damage and also called for his insurers` surveyor. The insurance surveyor, Phee Thian Chye (Phee), a mechanical engineer with ARIECS Pte Ltd, arrived at the premises at 11am the same morning and investigated the damage. He discovered that the premises were flooded with water up to two inches above the ground, and calculated that there must have been at least 5200 cubic litres of water in the premises. He also discovered that there was a fire hose-reel adjacent to the premises, and that there was a slit of about 4cm on the hose at a point, about 7-8cm from the metal drum end of the hose. Phee`s evidence was that there were two linings in the fire hose, an outer lining and an inner lining, and that the slit on the outer lining of the hose was smooth and that on the inner lining was rough. He opined that there must have been initially a smooth slit on the outer lining of the hose and water pressure within the hose must have pushed through the inner lining to meet the slit on the outer lining, thus allowing water to escape and cause the flooding.
The landlords called an expert witness at trial, Ng Kok Yan, a senior scientific officer with the Singapore Institute of Standards and Industrial Research, who agreed that probably the slit was initiated from outside and it was the water pressure that had caused the inner slit. There was no evidence as to what caused the outer slit.
Evidence was also adduced by the landlords that, on 27 May 1986 and 2 June 1986, officers from the Fire Safety Bureau inspected the fire fighting equipment, including the hose-reels, for the purpose of issuing a clearance temporary occupation permit. Major Choy Marn Khoon (Choy), head of inspection and enforcement branch of the Fire Safety Bureau, gave evidence. He said that the checking of hose-reels was carried out at random. He could not say if the hose-reel in question was checked. However, stop cocks and stop valves were checked to see if they were in a closed position; if they were in an open position, they would not pass the test. Choy, in the course of his testimony, brought to the court`s attention cl 8.5.4.1. of the `Code of Practice Regulating the Use and Maintenance of Hose-reel`, which provides as follows: 
 
When the tests in sub-cll 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 have been satisfactorily completed, the system should be restored to its normal operating state. Reels should never be left under pressure and, where practicable, hoses should be drained prior to being returned to drum.
 
 
 
He further testified that if a stop valve was left in an open position, there would have been water in the hose and this would lead to deterioration of the hose tube.
At the material time, the maintenance of the building was under the charge of 2M Property Consultants Pte Ltd, whose maintenance manager was Raymond Choo (Choo). Choo arrived at the scene at about 8am on the day of the incident, and he prepared a report of his investigation to the landlords. In it, he described the events leading to the discovery of the flooding. According to his report, two security guards were on patrol at about 4am on 15 August when they heard water sounds as they were walking down from the second to the first storey. They discovered that water was flowing from the hose-reel adjacent to the tenants` premises, and that the stop valve in the open position. This was immediately closed by the guards. The guards then informed the security officer who then contacted Johnny Chua (Chua), the duty mechanic at the Fire Command Centre. Both men then proceeded to investigate the cause of the flooding.
The Fire Command Centre in the building housed the fire alarm panels and the building automation system, which was designed to monitor the starting and stopping of equipment, including water pumps. Whenever a water pump was activated (ie when water is flowing out of a hose-reel), this information would be printed on the computer. The computer, however, would not identify the exact hose-reel from which water was flowing, and a physical check was necessary, and the person on duty in the Fire Command Centre would then either have to search for the defective hose personally or alert the security guards to do so. According to Choo, the activation of the pumps had been recorded on the printout from the computer in the Fire Command Centre. But he could not say the time that was on the printout.
Chua`s version of the facts was that he had heard the buzzer alarm indicating the activation of the pumps, and he had alerted the security guards to do a physical check. According to Chua, he was informed of the exact location within 10 minutes by the security guards. The trial judge rejected Chua`s evidence as he found it unbelievable that more than 5200 cubic litres of water could flow out of a 4cm slit in merely ten minutes. The trial judge found that it was the security guards who had informed Chua of the leak on the first storey. The trial judge also found that even though Chua was on duty at the Fire Command Centre, he had failed to note the activation of the pumps, and had not taken immediate steps to locate and stop the leak. In effect, the trial judge found that Chua, as the landlords` servant, was negligent in not reacting to the leakage within a reasonable time. It was his duty to deal with such activation of the pumps, but he had failed to take action to remedy the situation, even after an alarm was received indicating the flow of water from one of the hose-reels.
It was common ground that the water that caused the flooding and damage to the premises emanated from the slit in the hose, and that, for such large quantity to have flowed out of the slit hose, the stop valve must have been in an open position. The learned trial judge found that the hose-reel and the stop valve were in the control of the landlords and their servants. The stop valve was supposed to be in a closed position whenever the hose was not in use. The trial judge held that the landlords had failed to put in place a system for checking and ensuring that the stop valves were closed when the hose-reels were not in use and this failure had contributed to the occurrence of the flooding, and accordingly they were negligent. He said: 
 
It was my finding that, initially, there was a smooth split on the outer lining of the hose. Water pressure in the hose as a result of water entering the hose due to the stop valve being left in an open position had resulted in water pushing through the inner lining to meet the split on the outer lining and the water had then flowed out of the hose to cause the damage in the plaintiffs` premises. The hose and the stop valve were in the control of the defendants [the landlords] and their servants. Whenever the hose was not in use, the stop valve was supposed to be in a closed position. It was clear that the defendants had not put in place a system for checking and ensuring that the stop valves were closed when the hose-reels were not in use and this had contributed to the occurrence of the flooding. It was my finding that the defendants were negligent.
 
 
 
Before us, counsel for the landlords attacked this finding of the trial judge. He submitted that there was no evidence as to what had caused the 4cm slit in the hose, and that the landlords had exercised sufficient care and skill in the purchase and installation of the fire hose-reel. He also argued that the slit in the hose could not have been noticed or discovered by the landlords even upon reasonable examination. Thus he contended that imposing a duty on the landlords to ensure that there was no slit in every single hose would be akin to imposing an absolute duty on them. Counsel cited the case of 
 Haseldine v CA Daw & Son Ltd & Ors 
 for the proposition that they had exercised sufficient care by employing and relying on the competence of their several architectural and engineering consultants in the purchase and installation of the fire hose-reels.
In this case, the landlords` negligence was not with regard to the purchasing and installation of the fire hose-reels, but the absence of an established system for detecting and ensuring that all the stop valves of the fire hose-reels were in the closed position when the hose-reels were not in use, which had been the cause of the flooding. It is true that the landlords would not have been able to discover slits in the hoses unless they unwound each and every hose-reel and examined them closely. But the leaving of the stop valve in the open position was the real cause of the flooding. If the stop valve had not been left in that position, there would not have been any water pressure present to push through the inner lining to meet the slit on the outer lining. Even if there had been a slit on both lining, the volume of water that would have flowed out of the hose would have been limited if the valve was closed. It certainly cannot be said that requiring the landlords to devise a proper and adequate system of ensuring that the stop valves were closed would be akin to imposing an absolute duty on them. In any case, the landlords knew, or ought reasonably to have known, that one of the criteria required by the Fire Safety Bureau for passing of safety inspection was that the stop valves must be in the closed position.
Apart from that finding of negligence, the trial judge also found that the landlords` employee, Chua, was negligent in not reacting to the leakage within a reasonable time. If he had reacted promptly, the extent of the damage on the tenants` property would have been considerably minimized. Indeed, he could or might even have prevented the damage from being caused to the tenants` property.
Accordingly, we agree with Punch Coomaraswamy J and affirm the trial judge`s findings of negligence.
 Insurance clause
The second defence raised by the landlords is more complex. It turns on the construction of cl 10(a) and other provisions of the lease. It is convenient at this juncture to set out the provisions of that clause which are as follows: 
 
Tenants to insure: The tenants shall insure the demised premises and all tenants` property therein for their full insurable value against all risks commonly insured against in respect of premises of a similar nature including, but not limited to, public liability and fire risks.
 
 
 
The thrust of this defence is that, under the insurance clause, the tenants have a legal obligation to insure both the premises and the tenants` own property therein. The intention was that the insurance effected by the tenants would enure to the benefit of both the parties; otherwise, the insurance clause would have no substance or subject matter as it would then be an obligation entered into by the tenants only for their own benefit. Pursuant to that clause, the risk of damage to the premises, including damage caused by the negligence of the landlords has been covered by the insurance, and, accordingly, the tenants have no claim against the landlords for negligence; and it follows, therefore, that the tenants` insurers have no claim against them by way of subrogation. In support of this defence, numerous authorities were relied upon.
The first is 
 Ross Southward Tire Ltd v Pyrotech Products Ltd 
. In that case, the tenant of a building was obliged under the lease to pay all `insurance rates`, and, pursuant to the lease, the tenant paid to the landlord the amount required for the premium. The latter took out an insurance policy covering, inter alia, fire damage to the building. The building was subsequently destroyed by a fire occasioned by the negligence of the tenant`s employees and it was rebuilt with the insurance moneys. The insurer claimed against the tenant the amount paid under the policy by way of subrogation of the landlord`s rights. It was held by the Supreme Court of Canada, by a majority, that the risk of loss by fire, including the risk of loss by reason of the negligence of the tenant or its employees, passed to the landlord under the provisions of the lease which obligated the tenant to pay `insurance rates`. Laskin CJC said, at p 251: 
 
Counsel for the appellant did not urge (indeed, he stated that it was not necessary to his position) that the landlord was in breach of a covenant to insure and that the covenant should have embraced risk of loss by fire resulting from the tenant`s negligence. Rather, it was his contention that under the provision of the lease respecting payment of insurance rates by the tenant, the risk of loss by fire passed to the landlord, at least upon the presentation by the landlord of the insurance bill, and that the matter thereafter was between the landlord and its insurer. I agree with this contention. Applying to the lease and to the provision in question the ordinary test of reading it reasonably and in a business sense, I see no other meaning that can be given to the lease short of reading the relevant words out of it.
 
 
 
Clearly, the decision was predicated on the tenant`s covenant to pay the insurance premium and the payment thereof by the tenant. The policy as taken out by the landlord covered the risk of the loss occasioned. The learned Chief Justice, after having referred to some cases cited by the landlord, said, at p 252: 
 
I do not find these cases of any assistance in determining the present case, which is concerned not with an attempt to shelter under a landlord`s undertaking to pay insurance premiums but with an assertion of a claim by a tenant to benefit from its payment for insurance pursuant to the terms of its lease. In this respect, the tenant may be said to have qualified its obligation to repair beyond the normal exception of not being liable for accidental fire. It has paid for an expected benefit, as between itself and its landlord, which any standard fire policy would reflect in providing indemnity to the landlord and which the policy taken out in this case did reflect. It follows, in my opinion, that it may make a difference whether, as in the 
 Huston
 case, the landlord undertakes to pay insurance premiums and whether, as in this case, it is the tenant who covenants to pay them.
 
 
 
The Supreme Court of Canada in the subsequent case of 
 T Eaton Co Ltd v Smith 
 went even further. In that case, the tenant leased two contiguous properties from different landlords. The buildings on which the two properties stood were destroyed by a fire caused by the negligence of an employee of the tenant. Both the leases contained, inter alia, covenants by the landlords to insure the property against fire damage and covenants by the tenant to repair, to repair on notice, and to leave the premises in good repair. But there was no covenant by the tenants to pay any premium for the insurance. On the other hand, each of the leases also contained a clause giving to the tenant an option to purchase the premises, which provided, inter alia, that, until completion of the purchase, the risk of the premises remained with the landlords. That clause, so far as relevant, was in the following terms: 
 
The said premises shall be and remain at the risk of the lessor until closing. Pending completion of the sale, the lessor will hold all insurance policies and the proceeds thereof in trust for the parties as their interests may appear and, in the event of damage to the said premises, the lessee may either have the proceeds of the insurance and complete the purchase or may cancel the agreement of sale and purchase.
 
 
 
After the insurers had paid the amounts of the fire damage to the landlords, they sought to recover both the amounts from the tenant in exercise of their right of subrogation. It was held, again by a majority, that they were precluded by the terms of the two leases from claiming against the tenant having regard to the fact that the landlords had in each case covenanted in the lease to insure the premises against fire. The majority judgment was again delivered by Laskin CJC. His basic propositions were stated as follows, at pp 428-429: 
 
It is settled law that the exception of fire in a repairing covenant does not exculpate a tenant from liability for a fire caused by its negligence or that of a person for whose negligence it is vicariously liable. If it can escape this liability in the present case, it can only be on the basis that the landlord`s covenant to insure is a covenant that runs to the benefit of the tenant, lifting from it the risk of liability for fire arising from its negligence and bringing that risk under insurance coverage.
 
 
 
Had the landlord insured without giving a covenant to that effect in the lease, the tenant`s risk of liability for fire resulting from negligence would be unquestionable; and if the landlord collected from his insurer, the latter would have an equally unquestionable right of recovery from the tenant in a subrogated action. The contention of the respondents [the landlords] is that the insuring covenant in the present case does not alter the result because, as I understand the submission of the respondents, the covenant to insure has subject-matter without relating it to coverage against the risk of fires caused by the tenant`s negligence. The appellant [the tenant], ... urges that where the covenant to insure is not at large but is, as in this case, a covenant 
 with the lessee 
 that the landlord will keep the buildings on the premises insured against loss by fire, it must be given effect against liability for fires arising from the tenant`s negligence because otherwise, as a covenant expressly running to the benefit of the tenant, it would have no subject-matter.
The learned Chief Justice then referred to 
 Pyrotech Products 
 and said that he accepted the argument advanced on behalf of the tenant, and continued, at p 429: 
 
In my opinion, the resolution of the issue in this case depends on whether the option to purchase provisions of the Smith and Tuck leases provide a sufficient explanation of the reason for the insuring obligation assumed by the landlords to leave the risk of fires on the tenant under the repairing covenants where the fires are the result of its negligence.
 
 
 
The learned Chief Justice (at pp 430-431) found that the option clause, which protected the tenant as purchaser from bearing the risk of loss by fire (which would otherwise have passed to the tenant on the exercise of the option), fortified his view that the tenant was to have the benefit of the insurance.
The third case is 
 Marlborough Properties Ltd v Marlborough Fibreglass Ltd 
, which is a decision of the Court of Appeal in New Zealand. There, the plaintiffs leased to the defendant a factory for the manufacture of fibreglass products. The lease by cl 3 provided: 
 
The lessee will, at all times, duly and punctually pay all premiums and other moneys necessary ... and [keep] the demised premises insured in the name of the lessor against fire and earthquake to its full insurable value under a replacement policy to the full replacement value thereof.
 
 
 
Pursuant to that clause, the requisite insurance against fire and other risks was taken out by the defendants in the name of the plaintiffs alone. Subsequently, the factory was severely damaged by fire and the plaintiffs reinstated the factory by the use of the insurance moneys and brought an action against the defendants claiming that the fire was occasioned by the negligence of the defendants. It was held by the Court of Appeal, also by a majority, that the insurance effected by the defendants (at their cost) was intended to cover the plaintiffs against the risk of loss by fire, whether accidental or occasioned by negligence, and it could not have been intended that the plaintiffs should be entitled to recover under the policy which was paid for by the defendants and should also be entitled to pursue a separate claim for damages against the defendants. It was implicit that the parties agreed that, to the extent of the cover provided in the insurance, the risk of loss by fire, whether or not due to the defendants` negligence, passed to the plaintiffs. Richardson J said, at pp 469-470: 
 
It is obvious that the fire insurance paid for by the lessee covered the lessor and was intended to cover the lessor against the risk of loss by fire whether accidental or occasioned by negligence, including negligence of the lessee. I cannot accept that the parties intended that the lessor (and the insurer can be in no better position than the insured) should be entitled to recover under the policy paid for by the lessee and should also be entitled to pursue a separate claim for damages against the lessee. I think it is implicit that the parties agreed that, to the extent of the cover provided by that insurance, the risk of loss by fire, whether or not due to the lessee`s negligence, passed to the lessor. Given the nature of the lessee`s undertaking, it was obviously sensible for the parties to agree in advance as to how the risk of loss or damage to the demised premises would be met. They entered into the covenants to repair. In addition, and not unreasonably, they decided on the provision of insurance cover at the expense of the lessee. They agreed that the lessee would select the insurer and arrange the insurance. That insurance cover protected the lessor against loss of rents and against loss of damage to the demised premises `to its full insurable value under a replacement policy to the full replacement value thereof`. Once the lessee had paid the necessary premium the lessor was indemnified against the risk of loss by fire. In those circumstances, it would not be consistent with the intentions of the parties as expressed in the lease to allow the lessor to make a separate and second claim against the lessee in respect of the same subject-matter.
 
 
 
We now come to the decision of the English Court of Appeal in 
 Mark Rowlands Ltd v Berni Inns Ltd 
. There, the defendant was the lessee of a part of a building in Leeds for a term of 30 years, and, by cl 3(3) thereof, the defendant covenanted as follows: 
 
To pay to the landlord a sum or sums of money equal to the amount or amounts ... which the landlord shall from time to time expend in effecting or maintaining the insurance of the demised premises and being a fair proportion ... of premiums paid in respect of insuring the landlords premises in their full rebuilding value ... against loss or damage by fire ... and such other risks as the landlord shall from time to time during the said term reasonably deem necessary ...
 
 
 
and the landlord by cl 4(2) covenanted as follows: 
 
To keep the landlord`s premises, including the demised premises, insured against loss or damage by the insured risks and to lay out any moneys received under such insurance in rebuilding and reinstating as quickly as possible the demised premises or such parts thereof as shall be destroyed or damaged.
 
 
 
The lease also contained, inter alia, provisions to the effect that if the demised premises were destroyed by fire, the tenant would be relieved from its obligations to repair under the lease. The landlord insured the entire building solely in its name against fire and other risks. The entire building was destroyed by a fire occasioned by the negligence of the tenant. The insurer paid the landlord the cost of rebuilding and reinstating the building and thereafter exercised its rights of subrogation and initiated proceedings against the tenant claiming damages for negligence. It was held by the High Court that the insurance was taken for the joint benefit of the landlord and tenant and the insurer could not, by way of subrogation, claim against the tenant. On appeal, the decision was affirmed by the Court of Appeal. The court followed the two Canadian cases discussed above and also some American cases. Kerr LJ, who delivered the main judgment of the court, held that it was clear from the terms of the lease that the parties intended that the insurance effected by the landlord should enure for the benefit of both of them and that, in the event of fire, regardless of whether it was due to accident or the tenant`s negligence, the landlord was to recoup its loss from the insurance moneys, and, in that event, it had no further claim against the tenant. Since the landlord could not maintain an action against the tenant, the insurer did not have any right of subrogation against the tenant as well. Kerr LJ said, at p 484: 
 
An essential feature of insurance against fire is that it covers fires caused by accident as well as by negligence. This was what the plaintiffs agreed to provide in consideration of, inter alia, the insurance rent paid by the defendants. The intention of the parties, sensibly construed, must therefore have been that, in the event of damage by fire, whether due to accident or negligence, the landlords` loss was to be recouped from the insurance moneys and that, in that event, they were to have no further claim against the tenants for damages in negligence. Another way of reaching the same conclusion, on which counsel for the defendants also relied, is that, in situations such as the present, the tenant is entitled to say that the landlord has been fully indemnified in the manner envisaged by the provisions of the lease and that he cannot therefore recover damages from the tenant in addition, so as to provide himself with what would in effect be a double indemnity.
 
 
 
It is clear to us that in each of these cases, the court held that, on the true construction of the insurance clause and other relevant provisions of the lease, the insurance was taken out for the joint benefit of the tenant and the landlord and that it was the intention of both parties that the landlord, in the event of a destruction of the building by fire, whether or not caused by the negligence of the tenant, was to recoup its loss from the insurance moneys. In 
 Ross Southward Tire 
, 
 Marlborough Properties 
 and 
 Mark Rowlands 
, the relevant terms giving rise to such intention were clearly the covenant by the landlords to insure the premises in question and the covenant by the tenants to pay the insurance premiums, although the policies taken out were in the sole names of the landlords, and, in each of those cases, the tenant did pay the premiums required. The covenant by the tenant and payment of the insurance premiums were plainly crucial in the determination of that issue in those cases. In 
 T Eaton Co 
, there was a covenant by the landlord to insure, and although there was no covenant by the tenant to pay the insurance premium, there was an option clause in each of the leases which expressly provided that the risk of the building would remain with the landlords.
 Construction of the insurance clause
The insurance clause at hand is materially different from the relevant insurance clauses in the four cases. It obligated the tenants to insure (i) the demised premises and (ii) all the tenants` property therein, against all risks commonly insured against in respect of premises of a similar nature. This clause by itself is not sufficient to relieve the landlords from their liability to the tenants for negligence. None of the authorities which we have considered have laid down that the mere covenant or undertaking to insure, by itself, in a lease or tenancy agreement is a sufficient indication of such an intention to relieve the other party, whether such party be the landlord or the tenant, from the liability for negligence. In 
 Marlborough Properties 
, Richardson J said, at pp 468-469: 
 
The mere fact that there is a fire insurance cover on the demised premises does not relieve the lessee of its prima facie obligation, stemming historically from the tenant`s liability for voluntary waste, to make good damage resulting from a fire caused by its negligence. Nor is it sufficient that the lease recognizes the existence of an insurance cover. It is obvious enough, too, that the parties may agree, either expressly or by necessary implication, that the lessee will not be liable to the lessor for fire damage due to the negligence of the lessee. There is no express provision to that effect in this lease, so the question is whether the provision for insurance is explicable only on the basis that the parties intended thereby to discharge the lessee of liability for negligently caused fires. That is a matter of construction of the insurance provision in its context in the lease.
 
 
 
In 
 Leisure Centre Ltd v Babytown Ltd 
, the lessor covenanted to insure the demised premises and to apply the proceeds of insurance in reinstatement. The demised premises were damaged and the lessor claimed that the damage was caused by the negligence of the lessee. It was held by the Court of Appeal that the lessor`s covenant to insure and reinstate did not affect the lessee`s liability for negligence. The parties made no express agreement on the question and there was no sufficient basis for implying a term exempting the lessee from liability. Cooke J in the concluding part of his judgment said, at p 323: 
 
Consistently with cl 9, the parties could have gone on to agree expressly that the lessee would not be liable for negligence. But with equal consistency, they could have agreed expressly that the lessee would be so liable. Neither solution would have been unreasonable. In fact, they made no express agreement on the point. I see no sufficient basis for implying an exemption term.
 
 
 
Reverting to the case at hand, we are unable to find any trace of an indication in the lease that the parties intended that the insurance taken out under cl 10(a) was to enure to the benefit of both the landlords and the tenants, and that, as between them, the risk of loss or damage to the premises and the tenants` property therein was to be covered solely by the insurance taken out, and that, as a result, the tenants would have no claim against the landlord even if the loss or damage was caused by the latter`s negligence. On the contrary, we find in cl 11(a) a clear indication that the landlords would be and remain responsible to the tenants for damage caused by their negligence. Clause 11(a) provides: 
 
The tenants agree to occupy, use and keep the demised premises at the risk of the tenants and hereby release, to the full extent permitted by law, the landlords and its agents, servants, contractors, invitees and employees 
 in the absence of any negligence on the part of the landlords
 from all claims and demands of every kind in respect of or resulting from any accident damage or injury occurring in the demised premises and 
 in the absence of any such negligence
 as aforesaid the landlords shall have no responsibility or liability for any loss damage or injury suffered by the tenants (whether to or in respect of the tenants` person or property of the business conducted by the tenants) as a result of any breakage, leakage, accident or event in the demised premises. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
If the insurance clause is to be construed to put the risk on the tenants, the words `in the absence of any negligence on the part of the landlords` in cl 11(a) would be rendered meaningless. The presence of cl 11(a) clearly shows that when the parties entered into the agreement, they intended that the tenants would only bear the risk of damage as far as the landlords or their servants were not negligent.
Before us, counsel for the landlords contended that Punch Coomaraswamy J had failed to consider three authorities which supported his contention that even if the negligent party had not paid for or contributed to the insurance premiums, the insurers would still be unable to recover from the negligent party. The three authorities cited were: 
 James Archdale & Co Ltd v Comservices Ltd 
; 
 Norwich City Council v Harvey & Ors 
; and 
 Scottish Special Housing Association v Wimpey Constructions UK Ltd 
. The facts in those cases were too far removed from the case at hand to be of any assistance. There is a crucial distinction between the relevant clauses in those cases and the insurance clause at hand. The clauses in the three cases consisted of two different parts: the first part specified that the risk of the damage was to be borne by one party, and the second part imposed on the same party an obligation to maintain adequate insurance against that risk. For example, cl 20[C] in 
 Norwich v Harvey 
 stated: 
 
The existing structures ... owned by him or for which he is responsible and the works ... 
 shall be at the sole risk of the employer
 [ie the building owners] as regards loss and damage by fire ... and 
 the employer shall maintain adequate insurance against those risks
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The first part of the clause clearly has transferred the risk of damage by fire to the building owners and the second part has imposed on them a positive obligation to effect adequate insurance. Therefore, the construction of those clauses in the three cases cannot really assist the landlords` case before us. The learned appellate judge rightly disregarded these cases.
Our conclusion is that the landlords were negligent and that the insurance clause does not have the effect of absolving them from liability. Accordingly, the tenants have a right to recover damages from the landlords for the damage to their property, with the result that the tenants` insurers, by virtue of the right of subrogation, have a claim against the landlords. In the result, we dismiss the appeal with costs. There will be the usual consequential order for payment to the tenants or their solicitors, to account for their costs, the deposit paid into court as security for costs.

The first respondent, John Robert Powers School Inc (JRP), is a well-known American company, which was established in 1923, and operates John Robert Powers School in the United States of America providing courses on social development and self-improvement. The second respondent, Ronver BV, is a Dutch company and has exclusive rights to franchise the name `John Robert Powers` and to operate JRP Schools in various jurisdictions, including Singapore. In November 1983, the appellant became the second respondent`s first JRP franchisee in Singapore. Under the franchise, the appellant was permitted to use JRP`s name and materials, including various manuals produced by JRP. This franchise agreement was terminated on 14 February 1988 on less than amicable terms and, thereafter, the appellant set up her own school for social development and self-improvement under the name Clea Professional Image Consultants (Clea), and she informed the public of this two months later. Following the termination of the franchise agreement with the appellant, the third respondent was appointed as the new JRP franchisee on 1 March 1988.
On 13 May 1990, the respondents instituted an action against the appellant alleging copyright infringement and passing-off. They alleged that the appellant had infringed the first respondent`s copyright in the JRP manuals and the third respondent`s copyright in a course syllabus called the `Executive Image Programme` and further alleged that the appellant had passed off her school as John Robert Power School and her courses as John Robert Power courses. The respondents also alleged inverse passing-off, ie that the appellant had passed off JRP`s materials and courses as her own. The action was heard before Lai Siu Chiu JC [as she then was], and, in a reserved judgment, she dismissed the first and third respondents` claims for infringement of copyright but allowed the respondents` claim for inverse passing-off. She granted a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from passing off the courses she conducts as JRP courses, ordered the appellant to deliver up to the respondents all the JRP materials in her possession, directed an inquiry as to damages, and awarded to the respondents 40% of the costs with full disbursements except the travelling and incidental expenses of the first respondent`s vice-president, Barbara Tyler, for coming to Singapore for the trial.

 .] Against the decision of the learned judicial commissioner on passing-off, this appeal has been brought. Following the appeal, the respondents filed a respondent`s notice in the form of a cross-appeal against that part of the learned judicial commissioner`s decision excluding the travelling and incidental expenses of Barbara Tyler.
There were actually two allegations against the appellant of inverse passing-off. First, it was alleged that the appellant had passed off the achievements of JRP as her own. Secondly, it was alleged that the appellant had passed off JRP`s notes as her own. We now deal with each of these allegations in turn.
The first allegation of inverse passing-off was based on the fact that the appellant had written a resume of herself for a seminar she conducted in Kuala Lumpur in October 1988. The material part of this resume is as follows: 
 
Denyse Tessensohn LLB (Hons), LTCL (TESL), 38, is the director of Clea Professional Image Consultants, an organization that runs a grooming school for executives and career people.
 
 
 
Ms Tessensohn is a trained lawyer who was in legal practice for eight years before opening the first school in the region in 1983. She trained in Boston, USA, on finishing and grooming. She is also a licentiate of the Trinity College (London). In these five years, she has been consulted and conducted training programs in Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. She is often called in to train the trainers as well as executives and frontline staff of both the private and public sectors: in airline, banking, education, health, insurance, manufacturing and shipping.
Ms Tessensohn has also been invited as guest speaker for numerous organizations, among them: Ministries, Rotary Clubs, Lion Clubs, SWAP, Life Underwriters Association, university staff and students.
It was alleged that this resume sought to pass off the achievements of JRP as the appellant`s. The learned judicial commissioner discussed the facts and law relating to this resume in some detail; however, she did not make a clear finding as to whether this alleged passing-off was made out.
In support of their claim, great reliance, in this regard, was placed by the respondents on the case of 
 John Henderson & Sons v Alexander Munro & Co 
, a decision of the Court of Session in Scotland. In that case, the defendant had issued an advertising circular stating, in so far as material, as follows: 
 
Our Mr Munro has had extensive experience as managing director for many years with the largest artesian well engineers in Scotland, and is an expert in this class of work.
 
 
 
The following is a list of some of those for whom artesian tube wells have been put down, a special visit having been made by him in each case to the different localities and positions fixed for the wells, all of which have been successful, the yield being from 5000 to 400,000 gallons of splendid water per day. [Then followed a list of 32 names.] Expressions of satisfaction have been received in many instances upon the results obtained.
He has also had the following boring work under his personal supervision. [Then followed a list of 21 names and pieces of work.]
The following are some of the contracts completed under his directorship. [Then followed a list of 36 names.]
However, the circular did not state that the works referred to had been done by the plaintiff company whilst Mr Munro was a managing director of that company. The court held that this amounted to a misrepresentation. At p 639, the Lord President said: 
 
But then the circular goes on to say:
 
 
 
`The following is a list of some of those for whom artesian tube wells have been put down, a special visit having been made by him [ie ""our Mr Munro""] in each case to the different localities and positions fixed for the wells.`
 
 
 
Then follows a long list of names. It is explained that none of this work was done by Munro & Co, but that it was all done by the complainers [plaintiffs] during the time Munro was their managing director. It would have been easy to make a statement which would have made this quite clear. As it is, I do not think I am pressing anything unduly when I say that many people would think, on reading the circular, that Munro & Co had executed this work. If they took that meaning out of it, it would be misleading and untrue, and the natural result would be that they might go to Munro & Co seeing their large experience in the past. If they did so, injury would result to the complainers because of the attribution of the experience of Henderson & Son to Munro & Co.
 
 
 
Similar pronouncement was made by Lord M`Laren at p 640: 
 
... there are members of the public, to which this circular is addressed, who might read it in an uncritical spirit, and would be impressed only by the general effect conveyed, and, if so read, I think the circular is calculated to lead such a reader to the conclusion that the respondents` firm had executed the specified works. I think, therefore, that the complainers are entitled to an interdict against a circular which may be read as representing that the respondents had executed all these important works which were in reality carried out by the complainers.
 
 
 
The objection in the 
 Henderson 
 case was not that Mr Munro should not have publicized his experience in drilling wells and other works. It is perfectly legitimate to publicize one`s experience, regardless of whether such experience was gained whilst in the employ of another. Nor was it objectionable that Mr Munro made out his company to be more experienced than it was; merely exaggerating one`s experience does not amount to passing-off. The objection lay in the defendant seeking to appropriate to their Mr Munro the credit for carrying out those works which were in fact carried out by the plaintiff company; the credit for those works was in fact the plaintiffs` and not Mr Munro`s. On that basis, the circular amounted to a misrepresentation.
Turning to our present case, we think that the impression given by the appellant`s resume may not be all that accurate; it certainly gave the impression that her grooming school was more experienced than it actually was. But it was very general, containing only an account of her achievements, and there was no reference to specific courses or programmes that had been conducted by her in her capacity as JRP franchisee. Without specific mention of particular courses or training programmes, no particular achievements could be identified as the appellant`s. In that respect, she did not appropriate to herself any credit which rightly belonged to the first respondent; hence, nothing of JRP`s can be said to have been passed off as hers. In our judgment, the resume, although an exaggeration, did not amount to a passing-off.
The second allegation of inverse passing-off was based on the fact that numerous notes were found on the open shelves in Clea`s premises, and it was alleged that these notes were JRP notes and that they had been so used and distributed by the appellant as to amount to a representation that they were her own notes. There were substantial factual disputes relating to these notes and it is necessary to refer to the evidence in some detail.
Brian Jeremiah (Jeremiah), an instructor at the third respondent`s school, who had previously taught at the appellant`s school, gave evidence on behalf of the respondents. It was his evidence that JRP notes were available in open shelves at Clea`s premises. He said that various notes were stacked in pigeon holes which were labelled according to subject, and students had free access to these notes. He himself had used some of these notes to teach, having checked with Clea`s manageress that he was permitted to do so. But he did not distribute the notes to the students. It was only when he began working for the third respondent that he realized that the notes he had used in Clea were taken from the JRP manuals.
Shamini Thanasingam (Thanasingam), another instructor at the third respondent`s school who had previously taught at the appellant`s school, also gave evidence on behalf of the respondents. She said that instructors at Clea would collect notes from the open shelves but added that they were only for the personal reference of the instructors and were not distributed to the students. At one point in her evidence, Thanasingam said that the appellant had given her instructions not to use these notes but she later retracted this and said that the appellant had not spoken to her about the notes at all. When she went to work for the third respondent, she realized the similarity between these notes and those in the JRP manual. On the third respondent`s instructions, she returned to Clea to collect any JRP notes she could find. She managed to obtain 23 sheets of notes from the open shelves, many of which were similar to notes in the JRP manuals.
The appellant herself admitted that she had kept some printed sheets of JRP notes after termination of the franchise. She said that these were kept on the shelves in 12 different locations all over the school and conceded that her students had free access to these shelves and could take the notes if they wished. However, she emphasized that the notes were not distributed to the students and that her instructors were told at the time the franchise was terminated that they were not to use these notes. She did admit to the use of one particular sheet of notes which was distributed after deleting therefrom the JRP heading. However, she insisted that this sheet was a work authored by herself.
Sara Dean (Dean), Clea`s manageress, said that no JRP notes were handed out to instructors or students after the franchise was terminated. She admitted that there were large numbers of JRP notes on the shelves in Clea`s premises and that it was possible for students to take them, but she pointed out that each student was given a proper compilation of Clea`s own notes in a Clea folder and they were unlikely to have wanted or needed additional notes. Dean also admitted an incident in which she unthinkingly prepared some JRP notes for distribution but the appellant stopped her in time and roundly chided her.
There was evidence that substantial amount of JRP notes were found in the open shelves. In fact, in June 1990, pursuant to an interim injunction, the appellant delivered to the respondents about 2,692 loose sheets of the notes; but that delivery was effected without any admission that they were infringing materials.
On the evidence before her, the learned judicial commissioner made the following findings of fact: (i) a large number of notes copied from JRP manuals were lying around in open shelves freely accessible to all and sundry; (ii) instructors like Jeremiah and Thanasingam used these notes as part of their teaching programmes; (iii) these notes had no acknowledgment of their source; and (iv) Clea`s instructors had given out these notes with the JRP heading deleted. The learned judicial commissioner held that these facts amounted to a misrepresentation that the JRP notes were the work of Clea. She said: 
 
A large number of JRP notes were lying around in open shelves for all who cared to look and take. Loy had testified that some of the printed notes were stores by her (in particular reprints of the manual [exh P7]) but a substantial amount of the 2,692 sheets delivered up to the plaintiffs` solicitors must have been on the defendant`s premises since their presence was noticed by Jeremiah, Thanasingam and admitted to by the defendant herself. Instructors like Jeremiah and Thanasingam used these notes as part of their teaching programme. These notes had no acknowledgment. Thus, all would assume that they were the work of Clea and that, in itself, is a misrepresentation. It would also mean that apart from the defendant`s work (28 sheets) and the difference in the instructors at both schools, some part of the package offered to the students would be the product of the plaintiffs. The defendant had admitted that counsellors gave out these notes with the JRP heading cut out. Goodwill of the plaintiffs is diluted by the fact that training with reference to their materials, without acknowledgment of source, is available elsewhere at a cheaper price.
 
 
 
The learned judicial commissioner later went on to find that the appellant had passed off these notes as hers. She said: 
 
In effect, by making those notes freely accessible to all and sundry, and especially to instructors who then formulated their lessons with these materials, the defendant was robbing the plaintiffs of the credit and goodwill which was owed to them. 
 Bristol Conservatories
 showed inverse passing-off in the purest sense: the defendants exhibited purely the plaintiffs` work as samples of their own. It would nonetheless still have amounted to passing-off if they promised to produce what in effect were the plaintiffs` conservatories but with extras and frills added on. In both 
 Bristol Conservatories
 and 
 Henderson
, it was held unnecessary to prove that the customers knew the plaintiffs` name. The point was that goodwill owed to the plaintiffs was misappropriated by the defendants and used by the defendants to establish their own reputation.
 
 
 
Before us it was contended on behalf of the appellant that she had authored parts of a volume known as the 
 JRP Students` Text 
 used during the subsistence of the franchise agreement and that the notes found on her premises were copies of those parts of the 
 Students` Text 
 that represented her original work and were not copies made from the JRP manuals as found by the learned judicial commissioner. In support, the appellant tendered a list of original works authored by herself. Having examined the documents in question, we find this argument to be without merit. An examination of the JRP manuals and the 
 Students` Text 
 shows that numerous pages are identical, save for the page numbering at the bottom of each page. The 
 Students` Text 
 was numbered sequentially from `1` to `221`. The JRP manuals were numbered differently. For example, the pages in the `Figure Control Manual` were numbered FIG-1, FIG-2, FIG-3, and so forth, and the pages in the `Wardrobe Manual` were numbered WD-1, WD-2, WD-3, and so forth. Turning to the notes obtained by Jeremiah and Thanasingam from the open shelves on Clea`s premises, we found that the numbering of pages on most of the notes followed that in the JRP manuals. Further, when we considered the substance of these notes, we found that, for the most part, they did not correspond with any items on the appellant`s list of original works. We therefore reject this argument made on behalf of the appellant.
We now turn to consider whether the facts as found by the learned judicial commissioner were sufficient to establish a case of inverse passing-off on the part of the appellant. The classic passing-off occurs when one trader represents his goods to be those of another trader. Lord Diplock provided a definition of passing-off in 
 Erven Warnink BV v J Townend & Sons 
, where he said: 
 
My Lords, 
 AG Spalding & Bros v AW Gamage Ltd
 and the later cases make it possible to identify five characteristics which must be present in order to create a valid cause of action for passing-off: (1) a misrepresentation (2) made by a trader in the course of trade, (3) to prospective customers of his or ultimate consumers of goods or services supplied by him, (4) which is calculated to injure the business or goodwill of another trader (in the sense that this is a reasonably foreseeable consequence) and (5) which causes actual damage to a business or goodwill of the trader by whom the action is brought or (in a quia timet action) will probably do so.
 
 
 
More recently, Lord Oliver stated in 
 Reckitt & Colman Products v Borden Inc 
, at p 880: 
 
The law of passing-off can be summarized in one short proposition: no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the identifying `get-up` (whether it consists simply of a brand name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the public, such that the get-up is recognized by the public as distinctive specifically of the plaintiff`s goods or services. Second, he must demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or services offered by him are the goods or services of the plaintiff ... . Third, he must demonstrate that he suffers, or in a quia timet action that he is likely to suffer, damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the defendant`s misrepresentation that the source of the defendant`s goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the plaintiff.
 
 
 
These cases establish that there are three essential elements to the tort of passing-off: (i) goodwill attached to the plaintiff`s goods or services, (ii) a misrepresentation that the plaintiff`s goods or services are the defendant`s, and (iii) damage to the plaintiff`s goodwill as a result of the misrepresentation.
Inverse passing-off occurs when one trader represents the goods of another trader to be his own. In 
 Bristol Conservatories Ltd v Conservatories Custom Built Ltd 
, the defendants` salesmen showed prospective customers a portfolio of photographs of the plaintiffs` ornamental conservatories as if they were samples of the defendants` design and workmanship. There was nothing in the portfolio which referred to the plaintiffs and there was also nothing there which indicated that the conservatories of which there were photographs were not designed or constructed by the defendants. In the action against the defendants for passing-off, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were passing off the photographs of the conservatories in the portfolio which were designed and manufactured by them as conservatories constructed by the defendants. The defendants took out an application to strike out the statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action. They succeeded before the High Court. However, on appeal, the decision was reversed. It was held that this could amount to passing-off as the defendants had misrepresented that they were the commercial source of those conservatories. Ralph Gibson LJ in delivering his judgment (with whom the other two judges concurred) said, at p 463: 
 
The principle applied in that case seems to me to be well applicable to the facts alleged by the plaintiffs. Custom Built [the defendant], by their misrepresentations, were seeking to induce customers to purchase conservatories from them in order to get a conservatory from the commercial source which had designed and constructed the conservatories shown in the photographs. That was the purpose of Custom Built in showing the photographs and in claiming to have designed and made the conservatories there shown. If a customer ordered a conservatory from Custom Built in response to the misrepresentation - as it was the intention of Custom Built that he should - Custom Built would supply conservatories not of the stated commercial source but of their own manufacture. Lord Greene thought that would be passing-off. With respect, so do I.
 
 
 
Later, he said, at pp 464-465: 
 
I do not intend to decide whether there is a form of the tort to be known as reverse passing-off. It is sufficient, I think, to hold that the facts alleged can properly be regarded as within the tort of passing-off.
 
 
 
To deal further with the judgment of Judge Fallon, the claim in passing-off, on the facts alleged, is not, as the judge says it was, ruled out because it is not alleged that any member of the public, looking at any of the photographs, would associate any conservatory with the plaintiffs. No person affected by the misrepresentation in 
 Samuelson`s 
 case, or in the 
 Plomien 
 case, or in the 
 Henderson 
 case, would have known who the plaintiff in any of those cases was. That did not stop the plaintiff being injured in his property rights in his business or goodwill. Nor would it matter if there was nothing in any photograph to link the conservatory there depicted with the plaintiffs in any way. Next, it would not matter that there was no allegation that there would be any confusion in the minds of the public. The concept of confusion, in my view, is irrelevant when the misrepresentation leaves no room for confusion. The prospective customer here is not left to perceive the difference between two allegedly similar products, he is told simply and untruthfully that Custom Built designed and constructed the conservatories which provide the evidence for the experience, skill and reputation of the plaintiffs. Lastly, the judge was wrong, I think, to proceed on the basis that the plaintiffs were not alleging that they have a goodwill which was affected by the use of the photographs. In truth, as Mr Prescott submitted, the goodwill was asserted and demonstrated as the photographs were shown and was at the same moment misappropriated by Custom Built.
It is clear to us that not only is it passing-off to misrepresent that one`s goods or services were those of another, but it is also passing-off to misrepresent the inverse: that another person`s goods or services are one`s own. The three essential elements of passing-off equally apply to such passing-off as well. Therefore, to succeed in an action for inverse passing-off, a plaintiff must prove that there is goodwill attached to their goods or services; that the defendants misrepresented themselves as the commercial source of the goods or services in question; and that the plaintiff`s goodwill was damaged as a consequence.
Reverting to the facts of this case, we see no difficulty in finding that the first two elements of passing-off have been made out. John Robert Powers is a well-known name associated with self-improvement and social development courses and the appellant did not seriously contend that JRP lacked goodwill and reputation in Singapore. Next, there was misrepresentation made by the appellant that the JRP notes were those of the appellant`s. Copies of the JRP notes had been left on shelves for all to take without the notes containing any acknowledgement of their source. Anyone who took them would naturally have thought that they were the work of the appellant. It is true that the appellant did not distribute these notes to the students but they were left on the open shelves and were easily accessible to the students. The inference is that they were left there deliberately for certain purpose, ie to render them accessible to the students. Thus, by making the notes available in that manner, she was in fact holding out to her students and customers that the notes were the product of her own efforts. That clearly was a misrepresentation.
We now turn to the question whether the respondents have established that they had suffered any damage caused by the passing-off. The respondents adduced documentary evidence of the number of enrolments at the third respondent`s school and submitted that the increase in enrolment following the injunction granted on 4 June 1990 showed that damage had been suffered by the respondents. These figures were obtained from JRP itself, as franchisees were required to report such matters to their franchiser. These figures, however, do not support the respondents` case; they disclosed no such damage. Enrolments per month at the third respondent`s school from December 1989 to November 1990 inclusive were 29, 36, 27, 31, 23, 18, 14, 23, 24, 32, 32, 30 respectively. The average monthly enrolment for a period of six months prior to the injunction was about 27. For the period of six months after the injunction was granted, the average monthly enrolment was almost 26. On these figures, there was no significant increase in the enrolment figures following the injunction against the appellant. Whilst it may be true that after the injunction the enrolment figures rose from 14 to about 30, this was merely a return to the same level of enrolment two months before the injunction was granted. It would also have been possible for the respondents to have proved damage by comparing the enrolment figures of the appellant`s franchise prior to its termination with the third respondent`s enrolment figures as the new JRP franchisee. Such figures presumably were available from the first respondent but, as was noted by the learned judicial commissioner, no figures were provided to show the enrolment at the appellant`s school when she was the JRP franchisee. The learned judicial commissioner was clearly aware of this as she said in her judgment: 
 
In his submissions (para 68), counsel for the plaintiffs pointed out that the increase in enrolment at the third plaintiff`s school in July 1990 after the injunction was obtained against the defendant proves that damage was suffered by the plaintiffs as a result of the defendant`s activities. My only comment is that no corresponding figures are provided by the plaintiffs in AB175-177 for comparison of enrolment during the period when the defendant was the franchisee for a definite finding to be made. Even if enrolment at the JRP School fell after the defendant started Clea, it could be due to any number of factors which I would not venture to speculate.
 
 
 
No sufficient evidence had been adduced before the learned judicial commissioner to show that actual damage had been sustained by the respondents. That, of course, is not the end of the matter.
We have to consider the question whether damage would be likely to be caused by the appellant`s passing-off which would warrant an injunction to be granted quia timet. In connection with this question, the respondents `must shew a strong case of probability that the apprehended mischief will, in fact, arise`: see 
 A-G v Manchester Corp 
, at p 92. In 
 Hooper v Rogers 
, at p 50, Russell LJ said: `the degree of probability of future injury is not an absolute standard: what is to be aimed at is justice between the parties, having regard to all the relevant circumstances.` In the present case, if the appellant was allowed to continue making JRP notes available in the passive but nonetheless extensive way within Clea`s premises, damage to the respondents would likely be caused. All it would take is for one or more students of the appellant to take the JRP notes from the shelves and circulate or distribute them and they would then become freely and illegitimately available to many under the mistaken impression that they were Clea`s notes. Therefore `the apprehended mischief` will arise. The potential damage to the respondents in such a case would be significant as the notes and publications provided by JRP form a very large part of the product they market. The appellant clearly cannot be permitted to continue holding out that these notes are theirs by leaving them on shelves easily accessible to all and sundry. The learned judicial commissioner granted a permanent injunction restraining the appellant from passing off the courses she conducts as JRP courses. That injunction is not correct. We therefore set aside that injunction and, in lieu thereof, order that the appellant be restrained from passing JRP notes as her own. But the mandatory injunction granted below directing delivery to the respondents of all materials originated from JRP will remain unaffected. Since no actual damage has been proved by the respondents, we discharge the learned judicial commissioner`s order directing an inquiry as to damages.
We now come to the respondent`s notice. In her judgment, the learned judicial commissioner awarded full disbursements to the respondents but excluded travelling and incidental expenses of the first respondent`s executive vice-president, Barbara Tyler, in coming to Singapore for the trial. The reason given for this exclusion was that Barbara Tyler`s evidence pertained to the issue of copyright infringement on which the respondents had failed. It was submitted on behalf of the respondents that Barbara Tyler`s travelling and incidental expenses should be the respondents` in any event. The basis for this argument was that a notice to admit facts dated 14 June 1991 was served on the appellant, and in that notice the respondents sought, inter alia, the appellant`s admission that the first respondent was the owner of the copyright in the JRP manuals. No such admission was made. On 17 February 1993, the respondents not having received any reply to their notice, faxed a letter to the appellant requesting some reply. They also pointed out that failure to reply would necessitate flying witnesses in from abroad and that the expense might yet be saved if they admitted the facts in question. No reply to the fax was received. It was only on 24 February 1993, the first day of the trial, that the appellant admitted the facts in the notice. In such a case, it seems to us that clearly O 59 r 3(5) of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1990 applies. It provides as follows: 
 
If a party on whom a notice to admit facts is served under Order 27, Rule 2, refuses or neglects to admit the facts within 14 days after the service on him of the notice or such longer time as may be allowed by the Court, the costs of proving the facts shall be paid by him, unless the Court otherwise orders.
 
 
 
Not only had the appellant failed to admit the respondents` ownership of the copyright within the stipulated 14 days, they actually waited about a year and eight months before doing so. This necessitated Barbara Tyler`s flight to Singapore to give evidence of JRP`s ownership of the copyright. The travelling costs (to and from Singapore) should clearly be the respondents` in any event. However, it is noted that the respondents chose to call Barbara Tyler to give evidence, and this took place on the second day of the trial. There was no need to call this witness since the appellant had already admitted the respondents` ownership of the copyright. Neither was there a need to call her to show that she had made a pointless trip. In fact, there was no reason for her to have stayed in Singapore for any significant length of time after the appellant`s admission on the first day of trial. Therefore, disbursements should exclude the costs of her stay in Singapore beyond two days after her arrival in Singapore. We accordingly so order.
This appeal is dismissed with costs. The respondent`s notice is allowed to the extent as we have ordered. There will be the usual consequential order for payment to the respondents, or their solicitors, the deposit in court as security for costs.

On 8 November 1990 at about 10.05pm, officers of the Anti-Vice Enforcement Unit raided 9A Tyrwhitt Road and detained five Thai women who had been providing sexual services in those premises. One of them was then entertaining a client. One Chua Huat Thong (`Chua`), PW1, had told them the terms of their service; he assigned them to clients and collected payments from the clients.
However the respondent was shown to be the leading culprit. He had secured the premises and recruited Chua to assist him in managing it as a brothel. Although Chua received payments from the clients, he handed the daily proceeds to the respondent. The respondent would then pay Chua and others who had assisted in managing the brothel and would give Chua money to pay the women.
On 9 April 1992 the respondent was convicted in the district court upon:
one charge of managing a brothel between 25 October 1990 and 8 November 1990 under s 148(1) read with s 148(5) of the Women`s Charter (Cap 353);
five charges of knowingly living in part on the earnings of the prostitution of five women between 25 October 1990 and 8 November 1990 under s 146(1) of the Women`s Charter.
On each charge the respondent was fined $3,000 with a default imprisonment term of three months. This amounted to a total fine of $18,000 and a total default term of 18 months` imprisonment. The prosecution appealed against the sentences and asked that they be enhanced. I allowed the appeal and now give reasons for my decision.
 The respondent`s antecedents
When the respondent came to be sentenced on 9 April 1992, it emerged that he had also previously been convicted on 4 January 1991 on the following charges under the Women`s Charter:
one charge of managing a place of assignation at some time before 11 October 1990, an offence under s 147(1) of the Women`s Charter, for which he had been fined $1,500; and
six charges under s 146(1) of the Women`s Charter, of living in part on the immoral earnings of a prostitute at some time before 11 October 1990 (with seven other similar offences being taken into consideration), for which he had been fined $2,000 on each charge.
 The sentence in the present case
In deciding upon sentence on 9 April 1992 the district judge considered whether the previous convictions sustained on 4 January 1991 for the offences committed before 11 October 1990 could be considered `previous convictions` for the purposes of sentencing the respondent in the present case.
He decided that a `previous conviction` meant that:
the first offence must be committed before the second offence;
the conviction for the first offence must be sustained before the conviction for the second offence; and
the conviction for the first offence must be sustained before the commission of the second offence.
Accordingly he held that the convictions sustained on 4 January 1991, after the present offences were committed between 25 October 1990 and 8 November 1990, could not be previous convictions for the purposes of enhancing sentence because condition (c) had not been satisfied.
The district judge decided that the earlier offence under s 147(1) of managing a place of assignation did not make the offence of managing a brothel a second or subsequent conviction for the purposes of s 148(5). In respect of the five offences under s 146(1), of knowingly living in part on the earnings of prostitution, the district judge referred to s 146(2) and held that as he had only imposed a fine and not a term of imprisonment for these offences, the additional liability to caning under s 146(2) did not arise.
 Previous convictions
The main issue before me was whether the convictions of 4 January 1991 could be taken into account in sentencing the respondent for the present offences which were committed before that date.
It is convenient first to turn attention to statutes which prescribe different grades of punishment for second or subsequent offences under the same statutory provision. In the present case, the Women`s Charter does in fact contain such provisions. I turn first to the offence of managing a brothel under s 148(1). Section 148(5), which provides for penalties upon conviction of offences under s 148, reads 
 
Any person who is guilty of an offence 
 under this section
 shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $3,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3 years or to both; and on a
 second or subsequent conviction
 shall be liable to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both. [emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The first implication of this form of drafting is that a `second or subsequent conviction` in this context ought to be construed to mean a second or subsequent conviction of an offence under that section. None of the convictions sustained on 4 January 1991 concerned s 148(1). Accordingly in my judgment the district judge was quite correct to sentence the respondent on 9 April 1992 for the offence under s 148(1) on the footing that he had acted contrary to s 148 for the first time. The prior offence under s 147(1) of managing a place of assignation could not make the offence under s 148(1) a `second or subsequent conviction` for the purposes of s 148(5).
I now turn to the offences of knowingly living in part on the earnings of prostitution. Section 146(2) of the Women`s Charter provides: 
 
Any male person who is convicted of a second or subsequent offence under this section shall in addition to any term of imprisonment imposed in respect of such offence be liable to caning.
 
 
 
The question was whether the five charges under s 146(1) that were before the court on 9 April 1992 constituted second or subsequent convictions for the purposes of s 146(2), by virtue of the earlier offences under s 146(1) for which the respondent had been convicted on 4 January 1991. It was because of these charges that I had to consider whether the words `second and subsequent` offence` in this subsection require the second offence to have been committed only after the conviction for the first has been sustained.
The prosecution contended that the district judge erred in his treatment of the term `previous convictions`, and that a sentencer may take into account any convictions for offences committed prior to the commission of the offence before the court, regardless of whether those earlier convictions were sustained before or after the commission of the offence before the court.
Therefore for present purposes the only antecedents under consideration are those offences which an accused has already committed and been convicted of by the time he is sentenced for the offence before the court. The question is whether, and if so how, the sentencer may take into account all these earlier offences or only a narrower category of them, consisting of those earlier offences of which the offender had been convicted before he committed the offence for which he is being sentenced.
The learned district judge in deciding in favour of the narrower category, expressed the following view: 
 
The practice of these courts is that for a conviction to be a `previous conviction` the 
 commission
 and 
 conviction
 of that offence should precede the commission of the second offence for which the accused is to be sentenced. The rationale for this requirement is clear. The accused must have been dealt with by a court previously for an offence. Having been dealt with he was not deterred and had committed a second offence. In such circumstances, the accused would face an enhanced sentence for the second offence because of his previous conviction, especially if both offences are similar.
 
 
 
In short, he regarded an offender`s persistence in breaking the law as the primary basis for a sentencer to enhance sentence upon referring to the offender`s antecedents.
Indeed, where an accused person has committed offences of a similar nature to the offence before the court, the implication of recidivism and defiance cannot be ignored in assessing the appropriate sentence. By definition, a person cannot be shown to be defiant in this context unless an element of failed reproof exists. Until he has been convicted of an offence, a person is presumed not to know himself to be guilty; he is entitled to presume that his actions were not contrary to law. That being so, he cannot be said to be defiant if he repeats those actions before he is convicted of an offence in respect of his earlier similar actions. Therefore in the repetition of those actions he may not be punished as if he had perpetrated the repetition defiantly. This reasoning is particularly persuasive in the case of offences to which no moral turpitude attaches or offences which individuals commonly do not know they are committing, for ignorance of the law, though it be no defence for the purposes of conviction, is yet not defiance for the purposes of sentence. For these reasons the force of the learned district judge`s conclusion is plain.
However there is another dimension to the problem. An earlier offence may involve such a degree of moral turpitude that any reasonable individual would have known that it was wrongful without needing to be charged, let alone convicted for it. In these circumstances it seems unreasonable that a further similar offence committed subsequent to this instance of conscious and egregious wrongdoing should meet with less abhorrence than it otherwise would simply because it was committed prior to the conviction and sentence for that wrongdoing. In these circumstances the element of proven defiance would be but an embellishment upon the true nature and gravity of the offender`s later transgression.
In 2 
 Coke`s Institutes 
 p 468 at n 5, there is a commentary upon Ch 44 of the Second Statute of Westminster. The relevant part of the statute reads: 
 
... and if they offend the second Time, they shall award greater Punishment, that they may be duly corrected and if they offend the third Time, and be thereupon convicted, if they be Officers of the Fee, they shall leefe their Fee; and if they be other, they shall void the King`s Court, and shall not be received again, without the special Grace and Licence of the King himself.
 
 
 
Coke`s commentary is as follows: 
 
Though this branch saith, 
 et super hoc convicti fuer
, and may seem to refer to the third offence, yet cannot he be convicted of the third before he be convicted of the second, nor of the second before he be convicted of the first; 
 and the second offence must be committed after the first conviction
, and the third after the second conviction, and severall judgments thereupon given; 
 for so it is understood in other Acts of Parliament, where there be degrees of punishment inflicted
, for the first, second and third offence, etc, there must be severall convictions, that is to say, judgments given upon legall proceeding for every severall offence, 
 for it appeareth to be no offence until judgment by proceeding of law be given against him
. [emphasis added.]
 
 
 
In 
 Christie v Britnell 
, the defendant was prosecuted for two offences of selling liquor without a licence, both committed on the same day. For the sale of the first bottle of beer, she was convicted and fined as for a first offence. In respect of the sale of the second bottle of beer, she was convicted and sentenced as for a second offence. She successfully applied for review of the second sentence on the ground that a second offence within the meaning of the relevant statute must be an offence which was committed after an accused person had been convicted of a first offence - it did not mean two technical offences committed on one occasion, one after another. Madden CJ held: 
 
The words `subsequent offence`, together with the larger measure of punishment to be awarded, would seem to indicate that the second offence should be one which followed after conviction and punishment of the first offence.
 
 
 
He cited the passage from 
 Coke 
 as a general principle governing these matters and went on to refer to 
 Re Authers 
 22 QBD 345 and said: 
 
The principle involved there is that to be an offence there must be a conviction, and also that the meaning of the legislature in imposing grades of punishment for a second, as contrasted with a first offence, really was that the liability to a higher degree of punishment is to be a warning not to be again convicted.
 
 
 
Subsequently in 
 O`Conner v Bini, 
, Hodges J dealt with the sale of adulterated milk: 
 
The next objection is that the justices convicted the defendant as for a second offence, and it is argued on behalf of the defendant that he could not be properly convicted as for a second offence, because this offence was committed on the 8 May, and the conviction for the first offence was on the 28 May following; and although the act in respect of which that conviction on the 28 May was recorded preceded the 8 May, yet it was contended for the defendant that in order to authorize the justices to convict as for a second offence the person charged must have been convicted of that first offence - not merely have committed it, but must have been convicted of it - before the second offence was committed. In this case the defendant had not been convicted of the first offence before the second offence was committed; and in my opinion that objection is good. It has been held - and as far as I know invariably held since Lord Coke`s time - to 
 be a general rule in regard to statutes of this kind that where the statute fixes one penalty for a first offence and another penalty for a second offence the accused must have been convicted of the first offence before the commission of the second offence in order to justify a conviction and penalty as for a second offence
. That view of the law has been followed by the Chief Justice of this court comparatively recently in the case of 
 Christie v Britnell
. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The only English case that sufficiently bears upon the matter is 
 R v South Shields Licensing Justices, 
, which concerned s 3 of the UK Licensing Act 1872. This provided against selling or exposing for sale intoxicating liquor without a licence or in a place where the seller was not authorised by his licence to sell the same and prescribed increased maximum penalties for second offences and for third and subsequent offences, further providing that: 
 
In addition to any other penalty imposed by this section any person convicted of a second or subsequent offence under this section shall, if he be the holder of a licence, forfeit such licence ... .
 
 
 
The applicant had been convicted on 16 November 1910 of two offences under s 3 committed on 4 November that year. Subsequently when he applied for renewal of his licence the licensing justices held that the licence had, by virtue of s 3, become forfeited upon the second conviction, that therefore there was no licence to renew, so the proper application should have been for a new licence. They accordingly refused the renewal and the applicant obtained a rule calling upon them to show cause why a writ of mandamus should not issue for them to hear and determine the application for renewal on the ground that the licence had not been forfeited and the applicant was entitled to such renewal. Counsel for the applicant cited the passage from 
 Coke 
quoted above but also relied upon s 56 of the Licensing Act 1872, which required, in the case of a conviction for an offence against the Act the repetition of which might render the premises liable to be disqualified from receiving a licence, that notice of the conviction should be served on the owner of the premises. The argument was that the only reason for such a requirement was to give the owner an opportunity of obtaining a better tenant, so if two convictions on the same day could operate as a forfeiture of the licence under s 3, the requirement as to giving the notice would be futile. The court held that the rule must be made absolute, Lord Alverstone CJ saying at pp 7-9: 
 
No doubt the fact that there were two convictions is almost conclusive to shew that one of those convictions must have been a second conviction, but that is not what the section says ... It seems to me that it is quite impossible to give a reasonable construction to the various clauses of the section unless the words `second offence` and `third and any subsequent offence` are read as meaning an offence after a previous conviction or convictions, as the case may be, for an offence under the section. The enactment aims at a persistent breach of the law after a previous conviction, and though the section does not in terms say that the offence to be punished with the heavier penalty must be one committed after a previous conviction for a similar offence, it is not reasonable to say that where a person commits three offences under the section on the same day a different penalty attached to each of those offences. Apart therefore from the assistance which is to be derived from the weighty authority of 2 
 Co Inst
, p 468, n 5, I have come to the conclusion that in this particular part of the section a `second offence` means an offence committed after a previous conviction for an offence under the section ... when we apply the forfeiture clause we ought to give to the words the same meaning as they bear in the earlier part of the section. In my opinion therefore the words `second or any subsequent offence under this section` mean an offence committed after a previous conviction or previous convictions, as the case may be, for an offence under the section. It is said on behalf of the licensing justices that they had evidence of two convictions before them, and that as one must necessarily be first and the other second there was before them a conviction for a `second offence` ... The fallacy of that argument lies in a misconstruction of the section. All that the licensing justices had before them was the fact that there were two convictions against the applicant for two offences against the section committed on the same day. That is not enough to shew a `second` offence within the section so as to bring the forfeiture clause into operation. [emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Upon considering all these cases and also 
 Knox v Bible, 
, 
 Wright v Carcary 
, and 
 R v McCaig, 
, I reached the following decision. It appears from the case law that, in general, where statute prescribes a higher grade of punishment for second or subsequent offences, the higher punishment may only be imposed upon an offence committed after the conviction for and not merely after the commission of the earlier offence or offences.
Accordingly, I held that the respondent`s convictions of 4 January 1991 on six charges under s 146(1) could not make the offences under s 146(1) for which he was convicted on 9 April 1992 second or subsequent offences for the purposes of s 146(2).
However, it was necessary to examine further the status of these earlier offences, and whether they should still be taken into consideration in determining the sentences for the later convictions. 
 Halsbury`s Laws of England 
 (4 Ed) Volume 11(2) at p 289 says: 
 
In fixing punishment for any particular offence, the court will take into consideration its nature and the circumstances in which it was committed; the degree of deliberation shown by the offender, the fact that the crime was a highly-organised one, in which a number of offenders took part; the provocation which the offender has received, if the crime was one of violence; 
 the antecedents of the offender up to the time of sentence
, his age and character; the fact that he is a danger to the public, and whether such danger is due to mental disturbance or immaturity and may decrease or disappear; and any recommendations to mercy which the jury may have made. [emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It may well be that statutes dealing with second and subsequent convictions should be read narrowly because the large gap that generally exists between the sentences prescribed for first offences and for second and subsequent offences renders it unreasonable that where a person commits two offences under the section on the same day, a vastly different penalty should attach to each of these offences. This I have already adverted to. However, the specific injunction put upon sentencers by such statutory provisions is entirely distinct from the general principle of discretion that sentencers should have regard to the antecedents of the person being sentenced. The statutory position mandatorily places upon the person being sentenced an altogether different tariff from that which he faced for the earlier offence or offences. However the general discretion only permits a sentencer, upon consideration of an offender`s antecedents, to impose a sentence towards the higher end of the tariff appropriate to the offence before the court. Normally the tariff ought not to be exceeded no matter how evil the offender may appear by his antecedents to be, for he must in general be punished only for the offence before the court.
I take the simple view that a person who commits but one offence is presumptively less deserving of severity than a person who commits two offences of the same nature, and it seems to me unreal that their relative standing should change simply because of an administrative factor such as the speed or sequence of or interval between the progress of criminal proceedings in relation to the second person`s two offences.
In 
 R v Wilson 
, the issue, somewhat different from, but related to our present difficulty, was whether a sentencer could take into account convictions for offences which had not even been committed before the commission of the offence for which the accused person was being sentenced. Lowe J, in the course of a dissenting judgment, expressed a view relevant to our problem: 
 
... the fact that the judge must punish the prisoner only for the offence that is before the court does not at all involve that two men committing the same offence must be dealt with in the same way, or that the judge`s view in regard to an offence by one man must be the same at different times ...
 
 
 
He referred for support to the passage I have quoted from 
 Halsbury`s 
 (albeit from a later edition) and continued: 
 
... but for the contrary opinion of my brothers I should have thought that the judge must have regard to circumstances right up to the time he imposes sentence ... I see no reason why he should not in any case have regard to such circumstances. If the trial took place immediately after the commission of the crime, the judge in awarding punishment would rightly have regard to the character and tendencies of the prisoner. At such a time he would have to form a judgment as to the prisoner`s future conduct. He would have at that stage to deal with possibilities or probabilities. At the later stage, through the delay of trial, there is further evidence as to his character and tendencies and the judge has before him facts and not merely opinions. Having the advantage of these later matters before him it seems to me unreal to say that the judge must view the matter as if these later facts had not happened.
 
 
 
Although the majority of the court disagreed with Lowe J in the result, they in fact sympathized to some extent with this view: 
 
If it were not for the existence of ss 409 and 428 of the Crimes Act 1928, we should think it proper for the judge to take such convictions into account. It is true that this may result in an accused man having a heavier sentence on account of an offence subsequent to the one for which he is being sentenced and therefore an offence which, if the trials had taken their normal course, could never have come under consideration, but substantial justice might perhaps be considered satisfied, since, had the trials taken their normal course, the conviction on which he is awaiting sentence would have been available as a prior conviction ... when he was tried on the offence which was later in time. To take them into account would be entirely consistent with the general principle that a judge should consider everything relevant before passing sentence ... However we find it so incongruous with the provisions of ss 409 and 428 of the Crimes Act 1928 to do so, that we cannot think it should be done. [emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The statutory provisions specified in this quotation provided that it be lawful to prove that an offender `had previously to committing such offence been convicted of an offence, although either or both of such offences is or are not such as that by reason of any provision of this Act the degree, character or punishment of the subsequent offence is affected`. I found Lowe J`s reasoning cogent and compelling. In view of the clear statement by the majority that, in the absence of such statutory provisions, they would have been inclined towards the position taken by Lowe J, I am fortified in my determination that this position is appropriate for this jurisdiction.
I have therefore reached the conclusion that all earlier offences of similar nature should be put before a sentencer, regardless of whether the convictions therefor were obtained before or after the commission of the offence for which the defendant is being sentenced. However, in exercising the sentencing discretion, the court shall also be open to persuasion as to the weight that should be assigned to these convictions for earlier offences. Naturally, where the accused had already been convicted of the earlier offence before he committed the offence for which he is being sentenced, the impression of persistence despite chastisement is more obvious and harder to dispel. Where the accused was convicted of the earlier offence only after he committed the offence for which he is being sentenced, then normally he will have a better chance of persuading the court that circumstances relating to those earlier offences show that, in committing the offence for which he is being sentenced, he was not acting in defiant disregard of the law. If the court is persuaded that the element of defiance did not exist then it may certainly reflect its opinion in the sentence imposed, and perhaps in certain circumstances the court may even think fit to sentence the accused as if he were a first time offender. However the burden of bringing these matters to the court`s attention must lie on the person being sentenced.
Accordingly I decided that the learned district judge had erred in principle and that it was open to the court to take into consideration the convictions sustained by the respondent on 4 January 1991. The appropriate sentences for the charges upon which the respondent was convicted on 9 April 1992 then fell to be dealt with.
Although the earlier offence under s 147(1) of managing a place of assignation could not make the offence under s 148(1) a second or subsequent conviction for an offence for the purposes of s 148(5), I was disposed to consider the earlier offence as being of a similar nature to an offence under s 148(1). Accordingly, though the fine could not exceed $3,000, I thought it appropriate to impose a three month term of imprisonment in addition to the fine.
Although the earlier offences under s 146(1) could not make the offences under s 146(1) for which he was convicted on 9 April 1992 second or subsequent offences for the purposes of s 146(2), they were of a similar nature and I was of the view that a higher fine of $6,000, with a default imprisonment term of three months, would be appropriate for each charge and I so ordered.

In this action the plaintiffs, who are bankers and merchant bankers, claimed damages for negligence against the defendants, a firm of accountants, who were alleged to have negligently prepared and audited the accounts of Pan-Electric Industries Ltd (`Pan-EL`) and the consolidated accounts of the Pan-El group of companies for the year ended 1983. This was in essence a claim to recover economic losses suffered by the plaintiffs in respect of loans which they had extended having relied on what they asserted were the negligent mis-statements made by the defendants, as auditors, when they after the audit negligently mis-represented in their auditors` report dated 9 April 1984 that the accounts represented a `true and fair` view of the financial position or state of affairs of Pan-El, the borrower company, and of the group, when in truth and in fact they were not.
In the light of the ratio of the House of Lords in 
 Caparo Industries plc v Dickman & Ors 
 1 and particularly the ruling of Millet J in 
 Al Saudi Banque & Ors v Clerk Pixley (a Firm) 
 ,2 and distinguishing 
 Morgan Crucible Co plc v Hill Samuel Bank & Ors 
 ,3 the defendants not unexpectedly applied for an order that the plaintiffs` statement of claim be struck out under O 18 r 19(1) of the Rules of Supreme Court on the principal ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action.
As I was persuaded that no direct and close relationship or proximity in the 
 Caparo 
 1 sense existed between the plaintiffs and the defendants, I was of the view that the plaintiffs` claims as pleaded were bound to fail. 
 Caparo 
 ,1 which approved 
 Al Saudi Banque 
 ,2 ruled that for a claim for purely economic loss suffered by reason of a negligent mis-statement there must be a sufficient `relationship of proximity` and it must be just and reasonable to impose liability on the potential defendant. I was persuaded by counsel for the defendants that the averments in the statement of claim would establish that it was foreseeable, indeed even highly foreseeable, that the plaintiffs who were in the thick and fury of being engaged in the corporate finance of the Pan-El group would rely on the statements of the defendants as auditors and would suffer loss if the auditors` statements were wrong. But I was equally convinced that such foreseeability by itself was not enough if 
 Caparo 
 1 and 
 Al Saudi Banque 
 2 were to be followed and if the frontiers of this sub-category of the tort of negligent mis-statement were not to be unjustifiably extended.
In this case, the parties were not in any relevant contractual relationship; there was neither privity between them nor any consideration proceeding from the plaintiffs to the defendants. Nor were they in a relationship analogous to privity or to there being consideration moving from the plaintiffs to the defendants. Therefore the defendants did not owe the plaintiffs any contractual duty or any analogous duty in tort in relation to the audit. The plaintiffs also did not allege any intentional deceit practised on them by the defendants. The plaintiffs based their cause of action on the duty of care equivalent to that which arose in 
 Hedley Byrne & Co Ltd v Heller & Partners Ltd 
 .4 Reading 
 Hedley Byrne 
 ,4 and the powerful dissenting views of Denning MR in 
 Candler v Crane Christmas & Co Ltd 
 ,5 and in view of 
 Caparo 
 1 and 
 Al Saudi Banque 
 ,2 I was not persuaded that the plaintiffs` case, as pleaded, could arguably come within this limited category of auditors` negligent mis-statement as a cause of action. I accepted the submission that the purpose of the auditors` report in this case was in compliance with their statutory duties under the Companies Act and that this critical factor was the main reason why in 
 Caparo 
 1 it was held that there was no proximity such as would give rise to a duty of care. I accordingly struck out the plaintiffs` statement of claim.
Counsel for the plaintiffs almost immediately applied for leave to amend the plaintiffs` statement of claim. After considering the matter, I took the view that the amendments sought did not arguably demonstrate that there could be the relationship of proximity and that therefore a duty of care was owed by the defendants to the plaintiffs. Since the amendments for which leave to amend was sought did not, in my view, take the matter any further, I refused leave to amend in the exercise of my discretion. The reasons for this decision will be further elaborated.
For the purposes of the application before me, it was assumed, as was and is the practice in such interlocutory applications, that the averments in the statement of claim were true although there had been no proof of the same in a trial. Indeed, and in fairness to the defendants, it has to be stated quite categorically that the defendants strenuously disputed any allegation of negligence on their part.
The plaintiffs are well-known bankers in Singapore and had been bankers of Pan-El since 1965. Mr Northrop was at all material times the Area Credit Controller of the first plaintiffs. Indeed, the first plaintiffs were one of the major bankers of Pan-El which, unfortunately for many in Singapore, went into provisional liquidation on 6 February 1986 and liquidation on 9 October 1986. Both plaintiffs also participated in a syndicated loan of S$40m and US$15m. The loan was granted to Pan-El on or about 16 May 1984 pursuant to a loan agreement dated 9 May 1984. However, negotiations for the syndicated loan had started in Jan 1984, well before the issue of the auditors` report dated 6 April 1984.
Pan-El, a public company, was quoted on the Stock Exchange of Singapore and the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange until November 1983 when a receiver and manager was appointed for Pan-El. Up to the receivership, one of the directors of Pan-El was one Peter Tham Wing Fai who became a director of Pan-El from May 1982. The other director who featured in this case is one Tan Kok Liang. Pan-El`s accounts and the consolidated accounts of the Pan-El group were at all material times audited by the defendants. Pan-El had a number of subsidiaries.
It is significant to note that the accounts of some of the subsidiaries were audited by other firms of accountants, although the defendants were responsible as auditors for the consolidated accounts of the entire group. It is only necessary to mention the relevant subsidiaries, of which the first sub-group comprised of Anrite Aviation Co Pte Ltd (`Anrite`), Vanguard Realty & Development Pte Ltd (`Vanguard`) and Holland Park Development Pte Ltd (`Holland Park`); all these three companies were audited by another firm of accountants, Messrs Ernst & Whinney. The second sub-group is Orange Grove Property Pte Ltd (`Orange Grove`) which was audited by Messrs Tan Teo & Co, another firm of accountants. The third sub-group is Orchard Hotel (Singapore) Pte Ltd (`Orchard Hotel`) which was audited by KPMG Peat Marwick, yet another firm of accountants.
It has to be noted that Peter Tham was also a director and majority shareholder in Associated Asian Securities Pte Ltd (`AAS`) which, at all material times, carried on business as stockbrokers on the Stock Exchange of Singapore. AAS were audited by Tan Teo & Co. Peter Tham`s dual and dominant roles in the Pan-El group and in AAS, it was suggested, provided him with the opportunity to get his hands at the funds and manipulate the accounts of the Pan-El group.
The defendants, a firm of accountants, were auditors of Pan-El and some of the subsidiaries. The defendants had audited the accounts of Pan-El and the consolidated accounts of the Pan-El group for 1983. However, they were not auditors of Vanguard, Holland Park, Anrite, AAS, Orange Grove or of Metal Agencies (Malaya) Pte Ltd (`Metal`), a 100% subsidiary of Pan-El. Nor were they auditors of Contango Pte Ltd, a 100% subsidiary of Growth Industries Holdings Ltd (`GIH`), a major shareholder in Pan-El. Having different auditors of sub-groups of companies within a parent public company again set the stage, it would appear, for the inherent weaknesses to be exploited.
The defendants` audit of Pan-El began in February 1984. They issued the auditors` report dated 6 April 1984 in which they stated their opinion. The opinion has to be stated in full because these were the very representations complained of by the plaintiffs as negligent mis-statements and which were allegedly relied upon by the plaintiffs. The opinion stated that: 
 
 
(a) the 1983 accounts were properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act and gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs of Pan-El as at 31 December 1983 and of the profit for the year ended 31 December 1983 and of the other matters required by s 169 of the Companies Act to be dealt with in the accounts; 
 
(b) the 1983 consolidated accounts subject to any adjustment which may become necessary on the finalization of certain salvage awards referred to in the notes thereto, gave a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Pan-El group as at 31 December 1983 and of the results of the group and the source and application of the funds for the year ended 31 December 1983 and of the other matters required by s 169 of the Companies Act to be dealt with in the accounts.
  
 
 
The auditors` report was made under the then s 174 of the Companies Act which provided for the powers and duties of auditors as to reports on accounts. Under the then s 174(6) of the Companies Act it was provided that the auditors` report shall be attached or endorsed on the accounts or consolidated accounts and shall, if any member so required, be read before the company in general meeting and shall be open to inspection by any member at any reasonable time. This was done. As required under the Companies Act, the defendants` auditors` report was addressed to the members of Pan-El and nobody else. In the proceedings before me, it was not suggested that the report was sent by the defendants to anyone else.
I would now elaborate on the plaintiffs` complaints against the defendants as to the latter`s audit of the accounts for the year ended 1983. Anrite had entered into `forward contracts` with AAS for the sale and purchase of shares which were not genuine transactions in the sense that AAS received moneys from Anrite in respect of the purported purchases thereof but no shares were in fact transferred thereunder nor were any of the relevant scrips handed over to Anrite. As at year ended 1983 AAS owed Anrite S$47,197,805 and would have held scrips for Anrite to the value of S$13,888,881. These were not true and genuine transactions but were contrived to disguise the transfer of funds from Pan-El to AAS. The allegation was that Peter Tham was at the bottom of it. Just after the year end, Anrite banked cheques drawn by AAS totalling S$44,077,733 but at about the same time Anrite paid a similar sum to other companies within the Pan-El group. As part of the fraud, companies within the Pan-El group (which in all cases except one were not the companies which had received payments from Anrite) made payments to AAS and these payments totalled S$40,928,000. For the fraudulent scheme to have worked, Anrite`s accounts (before auditing) were prepared by officers of the company on the basis that the company had both received the AAS payment and the company had itself made payments to other companies within the Pan-El group before the end of the year. On the other hand, so far as the accounts of the companies which had made payments to AAS were concerned, those accounts showed that the payments were only made after the year end.
What did the defendants discover and what steps did they take after that? During the audit, the defendants discovered, firstly, that the balance shown in Pan-El`s cash book as at 31 December 1983 exceeded the balance on its bank account(s) by S$25,896,345.85, including cheques payable to Pan-El from Anrite and other subsidiaries and banked only after 31 December 1983. Secondly, the defendants discovered that the payments by Anrite to Pan-El had been banked after 31 December 1983 and had followed the payments of such sums totalling S$44,077,733 by AAS to Anrite. Thirdly, they also noted the fact that the said sum of S$44,077,733 had also been banked after 31 December 1983 and, in fact, between 4 and 6 January 1984. Lastly, the defendants`s audit revealed that the said sum of S$40,928,000 had been paid by the members of the Pan-El group to AAS between 4 and 6 January 1984.
The plaintiffs asserted that after making the discoveries the defendants made inquiries with Tan Kok Liang. Tan Kok Liang told the defendants that the `late banking` of the cheques from AAS was due to the year-end holidays and oversight. It was further alleged that Tan Kok Liang had told the defendants that the sum of S$44,077,733 was reflected in the draft accounts under `cash in hand` instead of under `debtors` because he did not want to show the said sum as a debt for three reasons, namely, (1) the inclusion of such a large debt would upset Pan-El`s (meaning thereby Pan-El group`s) bankers; (2) such a large debt would breach the loan ratios which the Pan-El group had agreed with their bankers to maintain; and (3) the sum of S$44,077,733 cheque had been given (though not encashed) before the year end. The plaintiffs also asserted that Tan Kok Liang had told the defendants that the sum of S$44,077,733 paid by AAS to Anrite was immediately re-invested in the purchase and forward sales of shares through AAS. These responses which were allegedly made by Tan Kok Liang were apparently the answers the defendants were believed to have obtained in the course of their audit enquiries. By the last two `particulars of duty` the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants as experienced accountants and auditors knew that bankers including the plaintiffs would inevitably demand and rely on audited accounts of their borrowers and that by March/April 1984 it was well known in Singapore banking and accounting circles that the plaintiffs and other bankers were contemplating making a substantial syndicated loan to the Pan-El group.
In particular, para 39(i) of the statement of claim asserted `that in or about early April 1984, Tan Kok Liang informed Mr Tan of Coopers that the audited accounts (meaning thereby the 1983 accounts, 1983 consolidated accounts and the auditor`s report) were required by SCB in respect of loans made to the Pan-El group as a whole and that the said audited accounts would also be required by SCB and SCMBA as the lead bankers for the syndicated loan.` I interpose this summary of the averments with a view which I wish to make on this assertion of the plaintiffs, which allegedly provided the linkage between the plaintiffs and the defendants. The averment about what Tan Kok Liang had told Mr Tan of the defendants was nothing more than a reiteration to the defendants what was plainly foreseeable to the defendants. In the prevailing commercial context and in the light of their experience as accountants, the defendants must have known that the audited accounts of Pan-El and its group were required by existing and potential lenders of Pan-El and its group.
On those premises the plaintiffs averred that the defendants were `sufficiently proximate to (the plaintiffs) to owe them a duty of care in respect of the statements and/or representations` which were contained in their auditors` certificate.
In an area of the law such as negligence where liability for pure economic loss was sought to be imposed on a party which was not under any contractual duty and where the question was whether the relationship was akin to a contractual duty, perhaps it is unavoidably necessary to hark back and listen to the lessons and guideposts thrown up by the historical developments in the law of negligence. The tort of negligence, like other traditional types of torts such as deceit, nuisance or conversion, has its own elements which have to exist before there can be a cause of action. In 
 Donoghue v Stevenson 
 ,6 at p 579 Lord Atkin said: `In order to support an action for damages for negligence the complainant has to show that he has been injured by the breach of duty owed to him in the circumstances by the defendant to take reasonable care to avoid such injury`. It was, and meant to be, a general proposition inasmuch as it was impossible, and unwise, to distil and expound a proposition with greater particularity. The common law genius was left to extend the proposition to a new category of negligence if and only if the case so warranted as a matter of principle: see 
 Hedley Byrne 
 4 where the essence of liability was that where the plaintiffs and the defendants were dealing with each other directly, albeit in a non-contractual context since there was no consideration or fee paid to the defendants, the defendants had voluntarily assumed responsibility to the plaintiffs to ensure that the advice or information given was not made carelessly.
Negligence as a cause of action, in sharp contrasts with other types of torts, features most prominently in litigation today. This has been so for sometime. Most of the claims for damages for negligence which courts deal with nowadays are brought by plaintiffs who had suffered personal injury or property damage. This development is, in my view, singularly remarkable if one recalls the fact of legal history that negligence had originally developed out of the action of trespass on the case and, what is more remarkable, negligence was not recognized by common law as an independent tortious liability until the 19th century. In other words, negligence as a tort has been developed pragmatically and incrementally. It follows, with greater force, that any category of the tort of negligence should only be extended pragmatically and incrementally.
To found negligence, common law required that firstly the defendant should have been under a duty of care owed to the plaintiff. Secondly, the defendant had breached that duty of care. Thirdly, to warrant an order that the defendant compensate the plaintiff for any damage or injury such damage or injury must be shown to be a reasonably relevant consequence of the defendant`s careless behaviour. Until the decision in 
 Donoghue v Stevenson 
 6 common law found it difficult to make a manufacturer of a defective product liable to a consumer because there was no privity of contract and there was not the relationship between the two parties as to give rise to a duty of care.
When will a duty of care arise? Lord Atkin at p 580 in 
 Donoghue v Stevenson 
 6 described in general terms the kind of relationship which would give rise to a duty of care and stated: 
 
The liability for negligence, whether you style it such or treat it as in other systems as a specie of `culpa`, is no doubt based upon a general public sentiment of moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay. But acts or omissions which any moral code would censure cannot in a practical world be treated as to give a right to every person injured by them to demand relief. In this way rules of law arise which limit the range of complainants and the extent of their remedy. The rule that you are to love your neighbour becomes in law, you must not injure your neighbour; and the lawyer`s question, Who is my neighbour? receives a restricted reply. You must take reasonable care to avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely to injure your neighbour. Who, then, in law is my neighbour? The answer seems to be - persons who are so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably to have them in contemplation as being so affected when I am directing my mind to the acts or omissions which are called in question.
 
 
 
The case before me concerned pure economic loss arising out of an auditors` negligent mis-statement, which is a category or a sub-category of the tort of negligence: see 
 Hedley Byrne 
. The plaintiffs as bankers sought damages for their bad loans extended to borrowers which became insolvent and defaulted on the basis that they had relied on, as the defendants well knew, the careless representations of the defendants in the auditors` certificate. Cases such as 
 Caparo 
 and 
 Al Saudi Banque 
 have brought into sharp focus the limits of duty of care with which we are concerned so that liability for economic loss caused by negligent mis-statements does not result in a flood of claims for indeterminate sums by an indeterminate class of claimants over an uncertain period.
Whether the defendants in these proceedings on the case as pleaded against them owed the plaintiffs a duty of care raised issues which were almost authoritatively considered in 
 Caparo 
 .1 Caparo Industries plc, who were shareholders of a company, launched a takeover of the company relying on the audited accounts which certified that the company had earned a profit when in fact it had suffered a loss. Caparo Industries plc alleged that the auditors owed them a duty of care as existing shareholders and as potential investors who might buy more shares in reliance on the audited accounts. At first instance and on a preliminary issue, the learned judge ruled that no duty of care was owed to existing shareholders or potential shareholders. The Court of Appeal decided that a duty was owed to existing but not potential shareholders. Both parties appealed against that part of the decision unfavourable to them respectively. The House of Lords held that in the absence of exceptional circumstances auditors owe no duty of care to third parties who rely on the audited accounts. Doctrinally consistent with the incremental approach as was seen in the historical evolution of the tort of negligence, the House of Lords was most reluctant to go beyond 
 Hedley Byrne 
 4 unless there were exceptional circumstances. The Law Lords made it very clear that foreseeability or high foreseeability that a person or a group of persons may rely on the statements of an auditor was by itself not sufficient. On behalf of Caparo Industries plc it was submitted that there was a widespread duty of care owed by the auditors when they performed their statutory duty to certify company accounts and that the duty of care extended to anyone who might rely on the accounts to invest in or lend the company money. Lord Roskill (at p 582) said: 
 
No doubt it can be said to be foreseeable that those accounts may find their way into the hands of persons who may use them for such purposes or, indeed, other purposes and lose their money as a result. But to impose liability in these circumstances is to hold, contrary to all recent authorities, that foreseeability alone is sufficient ... .
 
 
 
Lord Bridge (at p 576) set out the underlying principle: 
 
... the `limit or control mechanism ... imposed upon the liability of a wrongdoer towards those who have suffered economic damage in consequence of his negligence` rested in the necessity to prove, in this category of the tort of negligence, as an essential ingredient of the `proximity` between the plaintiff and the defendant, that the defendant knew that his statement would be communicated to the plaintiff, either as an individual, or a member of an identifiable class, specifically in connection with a particular transaction or transactions of a particular kind (eg in a prospectus inviting investment) and that the plaintiff would be very likely to rely on it for the purpose of deciding whether or not to enter upon that transaction or upon a transaction of that kind.
 
 
 
In 
 Al Saudi Banque 
 the plaintiff banks had advanced money to the company whose accounts were alleged to have been carelessly audited by the defendants. The company was compulsorily wound up and was badly insolvent. Seven of the banks were existing lenders on the date of the auditors` reports and three were not. They sued the defendants and alleged 
 
 
(1) that the defendants ought reasonably to have foreseen that the plaintiff banks would rely on the contents and accuracy of the defendants` reports; 
 
(2) that the plaintiffs had relied on the defendants` reports in deciding whether to continue, renew or increase the existing credit facilities, or to grant new facilities to the company; and 
 
(3) that the reports did not reflect a true and fair view of the company`s affairs as at the date of the balance sheet.
  
 
 
Millett J in answering the preliminary issue held (1) that the three banks, like that of a potential investor in the company, did not have the proximity necessary to found a duty of care even though it was foreseeable that they might well ask the company for copies of the audited accounts; and, according to the headnote: 
 
(2) That, although the remaining seven plaintiffs were a limited class and their identities and the amounts of their exposure were known to the defendants at the dates when they signed their reports, their position was not comparable with that of shareholders of the company, to whom a statutory duty to report was owed; and that, since the defendants had neither supplied the plaintiffs with copies directly, nor sent copies to the company with the intention or in the knowledge that the company would supply them to the plaintiffs, no duty of care was owed to them.
 
 
 
Millet J at p 337 A/B quoted O`Connor LJ who, in the course of his minority judgment in 
 Caparo 
 in the Court of Appeal, said: 
 
In my judgment there has to be something linking the auditor to the person relying upon his certificate other than knowledge that some person, or persons may rely on the certificate.
 
 
 
He prophetically pointed out that the stringent requirements of proximity would `limit the duty of care in respect not only of the persons to whom it is owed, but also of the transactions in which it applies.` The learned judge expressed the views that the Court of Appeal`s decision in 
 Caparo 
 marked `the furthest limit to which the duty of care for negligent mis-statement (had) so far been taken in England` and that `its reasoning (did) not encourage any further advance.` The House of Lords cut back the extension by the Court of Appeal and approved the reasoning of O`Connor LJ.
Counsel for the defendants submitted that the critical feature underlying proximity was to identify the purpose for which the auditors` statements were made. It was stressed that there would be no liability unless it was made for the purpose for which the plaintiffs relied upon it. When I considered the matter, this submission influenced me most. In my judgment, what ruled out the arguable existence of a relationship of proximity so as to give rise to a duty of care was that, on the plaintiffs` case as pleaded, the alleged negligent mis-statement by the defendants had not been given to the plaintiffs for the purpose of continuing their existing credit facilities or in connection with their participation in the syndicated loan. Lord Bridge of Harwich stated in 
 Caparo 
 1 (at p 576): 
 
The salient feature of all these cases is that the defendant giving advice or information was fully aware of the nature of the transaction which the plaintiff had in contemplation, knew that the advice or information would be communicated to him directly or indirectly and knew that it was very likely that the plaintiff would rely on that advice or information in deciding whether or not to engage in the transaction in contemplation. In these circumstances the defendant could clearly be expected, subject always to the effect of any disclaimer of responsibility, specifically to anticipate that the plaintiff would rely on the advice or information given by the defendant for the very purpose for which he did in the event rely on it. So also the plaintiff, subject again to the effect of any disclaimer, would in that situation reasonably suppose that he was entitled to rely on the advice or information communicated to him for the very purpose for which he required it. The situation is entirely different where a statement is put into more or less general circulation and may foreseeably be relied on by strangers to the maker of the statement for any one of a variety of different purposes which the maker of the statement has no specific reason to anticipate. To hold the maker of the statement to be under a duty of care in respect of the accuracy of the statement to all and sundry for any purpose for which they may choose to rely on it is not only to subject him, in the classic words of Cardozo CJ, `to liability in an indeterminate amount for an indeterminate time to an indeterminate class`(see 
 Ultramares Corp v Touche
 (1931) 255 NY 170 at 179), it is also to confer on the world at large a quite unwarranted entitlement to appropriate for their own purposes the benefit of the expert knowledge or professional expertise attributed to the maker of the statement.
 
 
 
Lord Roskill said (at p 582): 
 
I think that before the existence and scope of any liability can be determined, it is necessary first to determine for what purposes and in what circumstances the information in question is to be given.
 
 
 
Lord Oliver said (at p 592): 
 
My Lords, no decision of this House had gone further than 
 Smith v Eric S Bush
, but your Lordships are asked by the respondents to widen the area of responsibility even beyond the limits to which it was extended by the Court of Appeal in this case and to find a relationship of proximity between the adviser and third parties to whose attention the advice may come in circumstances in which the reliance said to have given rise to the loss is strictly unrelated either to the intended recipient or to the purpose for which the advice was required. My Lords, I discern no pressing reason of policy which would require such an extension and there seems to me to be powerful reasons against it.
 
 
 
Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said (at p 605a/b): 
 
The crucial issue is the purpose for which the report was made. To quote the words of Denning LJ in the 
 Candler
 case 
[1951] 2 KB 164
, 183, what was the `very transaction` for which it was provided?
 
 
 
As was fully explained in 
 Caparo 
, and as laid down by s 207(1) of the Companies Act in Singapore, an auditor has to report to the members on the accounts required to be laid before the company in general meeting and on the company`s accounting and other records relating thereto. That statutory duty is owed to the shareholders as a body and not to individual shareholders, and certainly not to existing and potential lenders.
Counsel for the plaintiffs relied on 
 Morgan Crucible 
 .3 It was a company take-over case. The directors of a target company in resisting a bid stated in their letters to shareholders that they forecast a 38% rise in the profits of the target company. The accountants, the second defendants in that case, confirmed that the statement was made in accordance with the target`s accounting policies. In compliance with the requirements of the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers, the forecast was sent to the plaintiffs, Morgan Crucible Co plc. Relying on the forecast the plaintiffs in that case increased their offer. They succeeded in the take-over bid but, after the take-over, they found that the target company was in such an unfavourable financial position that the forecast amounted to a negligent mis-statement by the accountants. They issued a writ and the statement of claim, which was filed before the decision in 
 Caparo 
 ,1 averred that there was liability based on the alleged foreseeability of the economic loss which the plaintiffs suffered. After the decision in 
 Caparo 
 ,1 the plaintiffs in that case applied for leave to amend their statement of claim. I should mention that the amendments included an assertion that `a particular purpose of the representations was to persuade them to offer the best terms which the directors could expect to recommend shareholders to accept`. The judge refused the plaintiffs` application. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal. They came to the view that each of the defendants intended when making the forecast that the plaintiffs in that case would rely on it in deciding whether or not to make an increased bid and that accordingly it was at least arguable that a duty of care arose. The Court of Appeal at pp 319-320 held that on the assumed facts the defendants were aware that: 
 
Morgan Crucible would rely on them (ie the representations) for the purpose of deciding whether or not to make an increased bid, and intended that they should; this was one of the purposes of the defence documents and the representations contained therein.
 
 
 
I was informed that 
 Morgan Crucible 
 was settled and there was no trial. It therefore only decided that on the assumed facts it was `plainly arguable` that there was such proximity between the parties as could give rise to a duty of care. As pointed out by counsel for the defendants in the instant case, the crux of 
 Morgan Crucible 
 was the view of the Court of Appeal that the defendants in the defence documents intended that Morgan Crucible should rely on the forecast. That feature set it apart from 
 Caparo 
. Contrary to the submissions of counsel for the plaintiffs in this case, I accepted the defendants` submission that this feature distinguished 
 Morgan Crucible 
 from the present case.
This analysis of 
 Morgan Crucible 
 3 conveniently leads to the amendments for which the plaintiffs sought leave. Counsel for the plaintiffs indicated that the amendments were inspired by 
 Morgan Crucible 
 ;3 he also said that he was not asserting any new primary facts except that there was no disclaimer on the part of the defendants when issuing the auditors` report. The plaintiffs claimed that they were making explicit what was implicit in the averments. Four new sub-paragraphs were added after sub-para 39(i) of the statement of claim and an omnibus assertion to the effect that one of the purposes of the defendants` report as auditors `was to enable the Pan-El group to place the same before the plaintiffs in order to persuade them to grant the said syndicated loan and to continue and/or grant further overdrafts and loan facilities to Pan-El and the Pan-El group.`
Counsel for the defendants in opposing the application to amend made a number of points. First, it was too late. Although it was late, as it was made after I had ruled on the matter and had certified that no further arguments would be required, I decided not to disallow the application on that ground in view of the serious consequences of my decision. Secondly, counsel for the defendants turned to the substance and merits of the application. It was stressed that the factual foundation in the averments remained wholly intact, to which no allegation of any new fact, except the fact that there was no disclaimer, was added. The defendants were discharging their duties as auditors under the Companies Act and they had that pre-existing duty before they were told what was set out set out in sub-paras 39(h) and (i); that is, what Tan Kok Liang told one Mr Tan of the defendants. There was no allegation of any direct contact and no other factual basis to found the assertion that there was a second purpose, as alleged in the amendments, in the defendants` issue of the audited accounts and their certificate. I accepted these objections. On the question of disclaimer, I agreed that it did not arise and that, in any event, no such disclaimer was possible in view of s 140 of the Companies Act. In the result, there was no factual substratum to bring the plaintiffs` case within the decision in 
 Morgan Crucible 
 .3 The claim as amended did not overcome the hurdles which the plaintiffs faced as a result of the decisions in 
 Caparo 
 1 and 
 Al Saudi Banque 
 .2 I was satisfied that for reasons of adhering to strict doctrine as enunciated in 
 Caparo 
 1 the sub-category of tortious liability for economic loss arising out of an auditor`s mis-statement should not be extended to lenders, existing or potential, where in truth and in substance the auditors are performing the statutory duty of rendering an auditors` report for the protection of shareholders and no more.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The plaintiff, Mukhtiar Singh, aged 21 at the material time, and an aircraft technician with the Republic of Singapore Air Force (`RSAF`) was a pillion rider on a motor cycle ridden by his brother-in-law (the defendant) at about 4.30pm on 25 January 1987. The motor cycle was travelling at the material time, on the right-most lane of Lornie Road towards the direction of Thomson Road. It was said that the estimated speed of the motor cycle at the relevant time was 50 kmph.
When the motor cycle was making its way thus, an unknown motorist came from behind, overtook him on his left and cut into the path of the motor cycle about 20 feet in front. The defendant, who was at that time under the influence of alcoholic drinks, panicked, lost his nerve and swerved. To the misery of both riders, the defendant hit the road divider to his immediate right, resulting in both the plaintiff and the defendant being thrown off the motor cycle.
In the event, the plaintiff suffered injuries. The injuries sustained by the plaintiff, the treatment he received subsequently over a period of time, and the residual effect could be condensed as follows: 
 
 
(A) 
 
Injuries 
 
(1) Open grade III fracture of the upper one third of the right humerus; 
 
(2) Cut right brachial artery; and 
 
(3) Cut musculocutaneous nerve. 
 
(B) Number of operations 
 
(1) wound debridement and plating of fractured humerus with repair of cut artery and nerve done on 25 January 1987; 
 
(2) arteriogram done showed thrombosis of the brachial artery; 
 
(3) re-exploration and vein grafting of brachial artery done on 29 January 1987; 
 
(4) disarticulation of right thumb on 24 February 1987; 
 
(5) contralateral pedicled arm flap to improve skin cover of right hand on 24 January 1989; 
 
(6) turning right index finger into a thumb (pollicization) on 19 June 1989; 
 
(7) adductorplasty on 13 February 1990; and 
 
(8) opponenplasty on 25 February 1992. 
 ( 
C) Residuals 
 
(1) 35cm scar over right arm; 
 
(2) faint scarring of left arm and faint scarring of left thigh; 
 
(3) right elbow has 0 to 90 degrees flexion out of a maximum of 150 degrees; 
 
(4) no supination of forearm; 
 
(5) pronation of forearm of 0 to 45 degrees out of a maximum of 90 degrees; 
 
(6) wrist has 0 to 20 degrees dorsiflexion out of a maximum of 60 degrees and 0 to 45 degrees palmar flexion out of a maximum of 50 degrees; 
 
(7) unable to make a flat hand; 
 
(8) grip strength of right hand 7kg. Normal grip strength of adult is 30 to 40kg; 
 
(9) no precision tip pinch; and 
 
(10) functional outcome of right hand is about 50% of normal.
  
 
 
Three medical reports included in the agreed bundle (AB-12, AB-30/31 and AB-36/37) were referred to by both counsel during the trial. To appreciate the effect of the injuries suffered by the plaintiff and the treatments given to him, it would be useful to refer to a specialist report put up by Dr Teoh Lam Chuan, a consultant hand surgeon and the head of the department of hand surgery. Dr Teoh`s report (AB-30/31) dated 25 October 1989 reads as follows:

Specialist Report
 
 
 
Mukhtiar Singh Kartar Singh M
 /23
NRIC No : 1738391
 
 
 
Mr Mukhtiar Singh sustained a severe injury to the whole of his right upper limb two years ago. He had his initial treatment in Tan Tock Seng Hospital. Further report from Tan Tock Seng Hospital may answer the questions (a) and (b) listed in your 12 June 1989 letter.
 
 
 
He was seen and treated by me in the department of hand surgery, Singapore General Hospital as from 5 December 1988.
He had a complete loss of right thumb with extensive scarring and soft tissue loss. He had a two stage surgery to reconstruct his right thumb. Stage one was that of a contralateral pedicled lateral arm flap to improve the skin cover of the right hand. This was performed on 24 January 1989 and he was admitted from 23 January 1989 to 20 February 1989 for this reconstruction. He was readmitted from 19 June 1989 to 4 July 1989 for stage two reconstruction. This consists of turning the right index finger into a thumb which is known as pollicization.
He is currently still on outpatient hand therapy to improve his right hand function.
He was reviewed on 13 September 1989 for the purpose of writing this specialist report.
Clinical assessment of his right upper limb was carried out. His right hand had acceptable cosmesis. The new thumb was capable of tip pinch and key pinch, but the power was still weak. The remaining middle, ring and small fingers had good function. He had no forearm supination and the pronation was limited to 0-45 degrees. He also had a 35cm scar over the arm.
Opinion: He sustained a very severe right upper limb injury which required multiple surgery and reconstruction. The cosmesis and function of his right hand had improved with reconstruction. However he may need further surgery to improve the power of his right thumb. But the final outcome of his right hand at best will be about 50% of normal. The dexterity in his right hand is also further compromised by the stiff forearm supination/pronation.
He will not be able to return to work as an aircraft technician since this demands rotatory functions of his right hand. He will have difficulty in manipulating tools to loosen or tighten nuts and screws.

A further specialist report (AB-36/37) given by Dr Agnes BH Tan of the department of hand surgery, Singapore General Hospital, dated 21 January 1992 reads thus: 
 
21 January 1992
 
 
 
Specialist Report
 
 
 
Mukhtiar Singh Kartar Singh M/26 SD 1738391
 
 
 
Please see previous specialist report (SGH/MR5133/89) dated 25 October 1989 written by Dr Teoh Lam Chuan.
 
 
 
Further to this, the patient had a revision to the reconstructed right thumb with adductor plasty on 13 February 1990. He is currently awaiting another revision with opponenplasty which is scheduled on 25 February 1992.
He was reviewed on 8 January 1992 for the purpose of this specialist report.
Clinically, his right upper limb has acceptable cosmesis. He has a 35cm scar over the arm. The right elbow has 0-90o flexion. He has no forearm supination and limited pronation of 0-45o. His right wrist has 0-20o dorsiflexion and 0-45o palmar flexion.
The right hand has a reconstructed thumb and three other fingers. The middle, ring and small fingers have good function. The reconstructed thumb is adducted and the patient is unable to make a flat hand. The grip strength of his right hand averages around 7kg. The reconstructed thumb is capable of key pinch of 2kg power. He is able to write with his right hand. However there is no chuck pinch, precision tip pinch or opposition.
Opinion: Mr Singh sustained a very severe injury to his right upper limb for which multiple reconstructive surgery were carried out to restore function. Despite these, he still has limited elbow flexion, forearm rotation and wrist movement which compromised his right hand dexterity. Although the hand function had greatly improved with reconstruction of the thumb, he still needs further reconstructive procedure to improve the thumb function further. At best, the final functional outcome of his right hand will be about 50% of normal. He would be most compromised in functions that involve rotatory movement of the forearm and thumb opposition.

The defendant was charged subsequently at the subordinate court for driving whilst under the influence of drinks to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of the vehicle. He pleaded guilty to that charge and was accordingly convicted. At this trial too, he admitted that he was under the influence of alcohol at the material time, having consumed four or five large bottles of `Tiger` beer before he set out on his motor cycle and that his reflexes were impaired by reason of his intoxication. He claimed that he panicked when he swerved to the right.
On the question of liability, the only issue was whether the accident was caused solely by the negligence of the defendant or that of the unknown motorist, or, if both of them were negligent, how the liability should be apportioned between them.
The court was informed that the Motor Insurers` Bureau, which would meet the liability of the unknown motorist if any blame were to be attributed to the motorist, had intimated to the solicitors for the defendant that it would accept whatever apportionment the court would deem fit to award in the circumstances.
Counsel for the defendant contended that the evidence placed before the court had established that the speed of the motor cycle at the material time was only 50kmph and that the swerving by the defendant to his right was more due to the sudden intrusion of the unknown motorist about 20ft in front. Counsel submitted that his swerving to the right was entirely reasonable in the circumstances and urged the court to attach 70% liability to the unknown motorist and the remainder to the defendant.
The court was informed that Lornie Road on which the defendant was travelling was a dual carriageway with a divider and metal railings separating the traffic. The part of the road where the defendant was had three lanes and he occupied the right outermost lane close to the divider.
The defendant admitted that his reflexes were impaired as a result of consumption of alcoholic drinks. The level of intoxication as reported in AB-7 (admitted in evidence without any objection) showed that the blood specimen provided by the defendant had a blood alcohol concentration of 172mg of ethanol per 100ml of blood. When asked why he was at the right outermost lane which was intended for fast moving vehicles, the defendant replied that he was then in a hurry. Such an explanation did not seem to tie up with his claim that he was proceeding only at 50kmph. It seemed to suggest on the contrary that he was either not travelling at 50kmph as claimed by him or alternatively that he was not aware at what speed he was in fact riding his motor cycle. The plaintiff`s evidence that he too thought that the defendant was travelling at 50 kmph was not really helpful as he was at all times seated at the pillion.
Taking all the factors into consideration, I am of the view that the defendant is to be blamed for the accident substantially and must bear 70% of the liability and the remaining 30% is to be borne by the unknown motorist.
On the question of quantum, parties fought tooth and nail on almost all issues including items of the least significance. There was a sliver of reason when counsel agreed on the second day of the trial to a global figure of $4,500 in respect of special damages and subsequently to an additional sum of $400 bringing the agreed special damages to $4,900.
As respects all other heads of claims, there was a wide chasm. Before dealing with the material evidence relating to quantum, it may be useful to tabulate the parties` respective positions and they are as follows: 
 
 
(A) General damages Plaintiff`s claim Defendant`s position 
 
Pain and suffering and loss of 
 
amenities $ 86,500 $ 31,000 
 
Loss of future earnings $ 401,519.83 *$ 51,000 
 
Future medical and transport 
 
expenses $ 10,000 Nil 
 
(B) Special damages Plaintiff`s claim Defendant`claim 
 
Agreed $ 4,900 $ 4,900 
 
Loss of actual income arising 
 
from the plaintiff`s inability to 
 
travel on overseas assignments $ 10,000 Nil 
 
$ 512,919.83 $ 86,900 
 * 
 The defence`s contention in this regard is that the appropriate claim should be loss of earning capacity (which should not exceed $10,000) and not loss of future earnings.
  
 
 
Since the dispute between the parties on quantum kept revolving around the plaintiff`s employment prospects and his physical capability, some salient features in the testimony of the witnesses pertaining to his employment with the RSAF and medical opinion require mention.
The plaintiff was born on 18 March 1966 and was 21 years of age at the time of the accident. His original seven-year contract with the RSAF which expired on 15 December 1992 was extended for a further term of five years until 15 December 1997. The plaintiff was by vocation an aircraft technician. Since the accident on 25 January 1987, the plaintiff though nominally still an aircraft technician, had been assigned to do staff work such as extracting technical information from documents, keying of data into the computer terminal (exh P-2) and answering telephone calls.
After the accident, the classification of the plaintiff`s Physical Employment Status (`PES`) plummeted from PES A to PES E (A being the highest and F being the lowest) but later on, he was medically categorized by the RSAF at PES C2. PES C indicates that the person is not fit for combat. The difference between PES C1 and PES C2 is that a person with PES C1 would be allowed to take the annual Individual Physical Proficiency Test (IPPT) whereas a person with PES C2 would not be eligible to take the said test.
The plaintiff was a private by rank when he joined the RSAF. He was promoted to the rank of lance corporal on 28 December 1987 and to that of corporal on 1 September 1988, both promotions occurring after the accident. According to Peh Sien Hoon (also known as Mrs Christine Chia) (PW-1) from the RSAF personnel division, the plaintiff`s future promotions would depend upon various factors including his performance. The court was informed that if he were to remain as a technician in the military forces he would retire at the age of 45 and if he is a `non-uniform[ed] staff`, he would retire at the age of 60. A senior technician normally retired at the age of 50.
At the time of the accident, the plaintiff`s gross pay including CPF was $738.78 pm. In May 1992, the gross pay of the plaintiff was $1,288.76 pm excluding employers` CPF contribution of $136. Despite the downgrading in his medical status, the plaintiff did not suffer any loss of salary.
The other feature that emerged from the evidence of PW-1 was that an aircraft technician would receive a higher pay supplement than a clerk. Pay supplements would vary from vocation to vocation in the RSAF.
A letter dated 25 September 1992 from the RSAF`s personnel affairs division and signed by PW-1 was admitted in evidence (exh P-2). The letter provides some useful information as to the RSAF salary scales and the way the plaintiff had been treated by the RSAF since the accident. The said letter reads: 
 
25 September 1992
 
 
 
Edmund Nathan & Co
 
 
 
Suit No 955 of 1988
 
 
 
Mukhtiar Singh v Balwyndarjeet Singh
 
 
 
We refer to your clarification on certain areas that would be very material to 3SG Mukhtiar Singh`s case (Suit No 955 of 1988).
 
 
 
The salary scale of the various ranks, pay supplement of aircraft technician, clerk and librarian and MVC are attached as Annex A. On the average, 3SG Mukhtiar Singh`s cohort may be upgraded to Grade 50 in 1993 and promoted to 2SG in 1994. Further promotion will depend mainly on performance and potential.
3SG Mukhtiar Singh has been offered two options by MINDEF and they are: 
 
Option 1
 
 
 
To be revocationalized to that of a clerk or librarian. In the event that he chooses clerk, he will be posted to an appointment that does not require him to type, for example, the recruitment centre.
 
 
 
Option 2
 
 
 
If he refuses revocationalization, his contract service will be terminated with three months notice and he will receive a gratuity for the completed months of contract service since he cannot continue his service in the present vocation.
 
 
 
To date, 3SG Mukhtiar Singh has not made a decision on the options given. (We understand from him that this is as per your advice.)
3SG Mukhtiar Singh was medically categorized at PES C2 (temporary) by the SAF medical board. Servicemen categorized at PES C2 may remain in the service vocation, namely as clerk, librarian etc. Whether his contract after 1995 can be renewed will depend on his performance, potential, disciplinary record and PES status then. Thus, we are unable to forecast at this point in time whether his contract can be renewed in 1995. 
 PES grading per se will not jeopardize the chances of his contract being renewed after 1995 as we do retain service vocationalists even though they are of PES C2 status. 
 
 In the event that he is revocationalized, he will retain his present rank pay. Though the pay supplement of clerk and librarian is lower than that of aircraft technician, the difference will be paid to him in the form of temporary pensionable adjustment (TPA) 
.
3SG Mukhtiar Singh was already a qualified aircraft technician on 24 March 88. There is no advance course for the aircraft technician except for those very good ones who may be selected to be upgraded to senior aircraft technician. Selection is based mainly on performance and potential.
After the accident, 3SG Mukhtiar Singh was assigned to do staff work like extracting technical information from documents and keying of data into the computer terminal.
 Not all aircraft technicians will be sent abroad. It all depends on the appointment that the aircraft technicians hold. There are appointments whereby there is no requirement for them to be sent abroad. If 3SG Mukhtiar Singh had not been injured, there is a possibility that he may be sent overseas considering the unit he is in. However we are unable to confirm the average amount of overseas allowance that the aircraft technician will receive as the range is very wide. The range has already been given in the last court hearing. The allowance payable will depend on the country, type of assignment and duration. This allowance does not form part of the remunerations for tax purposes 
.
The above information is given to you only for the purpose of the court hearing of 3SG Mukhtiar Singh and it should not be used for any other purpose.
We hope with the above information you are able to dispense with your requirement for my personal attendance in court on 29 Sep 1992. Please call me should you require further clarification. [Emphasis added.]

It must be presently observed that the fear expressed in the foregoing letter concerning the possibility of the plaintiff`s contract not being renewed after 1995 did not materialize. As observed earlier, his contract was renewed until 15 December 1997. The plaintiff himself did not allege that he suffered any actual loss of salary since his accident save for a complaint concerning his not being sent on overseas assignments following injuries sustained by him in the accident. He reckoned that he has lost an average of $2,000 per year. He mentioned that according to normal RSAF practice, he would be given at least one overseas assignment each year. He added that as a result of the said injuries he had not been sent for any further training courses.
The main feature of the plaintiff`s testimony concerned his future prospects. He testified that if he were to be re-classified as a clerk, he would suffer a reduction in his pay supplement. On the other hand, if he were to be discharged from the RSAF in 1997, upon the expiry of his contract, he could only be employed as a security guard which vocation would yield him a salary of between $700 and $750 a month only. He claimed that had it not been for the accident, he would have attained the maximum rank of a senior warrant officer.
Touching upon his injuries, he said that due to complications, his right thumb had to be amputated. He still experienced pain during cold weather. He further claimed that if he were to be discharged from the RSAF after 1997, he would not be eligible for free medical treatment. He estimated his medical expenses after 1997 to be in the region of $10,000 or more.
The injuries sustained by the plaintiff and the several operations he had undergone have been detailed earlier. The main aspect of the medical evidence was that the plaintiff suffered a complete loss of his right thumb with extensive scarring and soft tissue loss. Reconstructive surgery (pollicization) performed resulted in the right index finger being transformed into a thumb.
Dr Yong Fok Chan (PW-2) opined that from the injuries suffered, it is possible that the plaintiff would suffer osteoarthritis and if required to type, he would be unable to have the use of his right thumb. The rest of the fingers are, however, quite mobile. He added that if strength achieved from the current operations weakened, the plaintiff might require a further operation to stabilize his thumb. Dr Yong testified that the plaintiff had no forearm supination; his pronation was limited to 0 to 45 degrees. The normal for supination is 90 degrees and pronation 80 degrees. Dr Yong mentioned in cross-examination that the plaintiff would be unable to place his hand into his pockets or into narrow spaces. He added that owing to the limitation of elbow flexion, he would also be unable to reach the back of his head or back. Further, owing to the absence of forearm supination, his ability to turn objects would be affected.
The sum and substance at the end is that the plaintiff will be unable to perform his duties as an aircraft technician since the job demands rotary functions of his right thumb. He will encounter difficulty in manipulating tools to loosen or tighten nuts and screws. The plaintiff`s loss of his right thumb had resulted in 50% loss of the function of his right hand.
Dr Kwek Yung Chiang Kenneth (PW-4), a medical officer with the Ministry of Defence in charge of personnel at the air base, said that he had made a recommendation to the manpower office of the ministry to revocationalize the plaintiff since he is found unsuitable to continue in his present vocation as an aircraft technician/armourer. Dr Kwek was confident that his recommendations would be acted upon.
 Pain and suffering and loss of amenities
Counsel for the plaintiff, after citing several authorities, quantified the plaintiff`s claim under the head of pain and suffering and loss of amenities at $86,500 as follows: 
 
 
(a) Finger - amputation of the right thumb and transplant 
 
of index finger with attendant disabilities $40,000 
 
(b) Fracture to humerus with metal plating with disabilities $30,000 
 
(c) Severe scars $16,500 
 
$86,500
  
 
 
The defence submission on the contrary is: 
 
 
(a) Loss of right thumb through surgical disarticulation, 
 
turning of right index finger into a thumb, operations to 
 
achieve better function, limitation of elbow flexion, 
 
forearm rotation and wrist movement, residuals in 
 
function resulting therefrom and extensive scarring of 
 
right hand $25,000 
 
(b) Fractured humerus with 35cm surgical scar, cut brachial 
 
artery and brachial nerve $ 6,000 
 
$ 31,000
  
 
 
On the amputation of the right thumb and turning of the right index finger into a thumb, I was referred to the following authorities: 
 
 
(i) 
 Yahaya bin Abd Wahid v Kol Lai Chong Wah (Komandan) & Anor 
, where the injuries suffered by the plaintiff resulted in the amputation of the thumb, index and middle finger of the right hand: Siti Norma Yaakob J awarded a sum of RM20,000 (the date of accident being 14 August 1975); 
 
(ii) 
 Ong Moh Chong v Hitachi Chemical (S) Pte Ltd 
, where in respect of the amputation of the plaintiff`s right index finger, the right middle finger and the right ring finger, AP Rajah J awarded a sum of $30,000 (the date of accident being 18 July 1981); and 
 
(iii) 
 
 Araveanthan & Anor v Nippon Pigment (S) Pte Ltd 
, where the plaintiff`s right hand index, middle and right fingers had to be amputated and his last finger became deformed and stiff: Yong Pung How CJ awarded a sum of $35,000 (the date of accident being 11 October 1985).
  
 
 
On the injuries to the hand, humerus and arm inclusive of disabilities, the following decisions were referred to me: 
 
 
(i) 
 Samsudin bin M Amin & Anor v Mui Siew Kong 
, where for severe injury of the right hand and for undergoing a desloughing operation, Abu Mansor J awarded a sum of RM45,000 (the date of accident being March 1989); 
 
(ii) 
 Koh Hak Eng v Nadarajan & Anor 
, where for the loss of use of the right arm, Eusoff Chin J awarded a sum of RM48,000 (the date of accident being 30 October 1981); 
 
(iii) 
 Sulaiman bin Aziz v Abd Razak bin Abd Wahab & Anor 
, where for the dislocation of the left elbow with fracture of lateral epicondyle of left humerus and difficulty in engaging in occupation requiring unrestricted movement of the upper and lower limbs, Abu Mansor J awarded a sum of RM22,000 (the date of accident being 29 November 1985); 
 
(iv) 
 Rodiah bte Ibrahim & Anor v Teoh Chiang Meng 
, where for serious permanent disability due to injury to the attachment of the flexor muscle from the arm to the forearm at the right elbow resulting in serious loss of power in the whole right arm, Mohamed Dzaiddin J awarded a sum of RM20,000 (the date of accident being 15 August 1980); 
 
(v) 
 Leonardo Sundrason v Yeo Yeow Kwang & Anor 
, where for an open fracture of the right humerus with a 0.5cm puncture wound over it, James Leong AR awarded a sum of $4,500 (the date of accident being 14 July 1989); 
 
(vi) 
 Tan Meng Hua v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd 
, where for fragmentation of the medial epiphysis of the left humerus, Tan Seck Sam DJ awarded a sum of $4,500 (the date of accident being 1 March 1986); and 
 
(vii) 
 Arumugam Chandrakumar v Supa`ad bin Sahid 
, where for an open comminuted left supracondylar fracture of the humerus, William Lim DR awarded a sum of $7,500 (the date of accident being 7 February 1989).
  
 
 
Moving on to scars, relying on the specialist report (AB-30/31) where it is stated that the plaintiff had suffered extensive scarring, counsel for the plaintiff urged the court to award a sum of $16,500. The defence contention was that there should only be a notional award of $3,000 - that, too, according to counsel, formed part of the figure of $25,000 suggested by her.
On scars, the following authorities were referred to me: 
 
 
(i) 
 Zainal Abidin bin Ali v Chan Mook Sung 
, where for scarring over the right thigh, right knee, right leg and over the left thigh, William Lim DR awarded a sum of $6,000 (the date of accident being 14 January 1987); 
 
(ii) 
 Arumugam Chandrakumar v Supa`ad bin Sahid 
, where for scars, William Lim DR awarded a sum of $7,000 (the date of accident being 7 February 1989); 
 
(iii) 
 Noor Azan bte Bari v Kaw Teck Guan 
, where for scars, Liew Thiam Leng DJ awarded a sum of $6,000 (the date of accident being 19 July 1986); and 
 
(iv) 
 Raveendran v Chong Suiew Foo 
, where for multiple anterior abdominal wall abrasions and lacerations, Lai Siu Chiu JC awarded a sum of $18,000 (the date of accident being 6 February 1984).
  
 
 
Most of the cases which were cited to me were only digest summaries and as such they have to be approached with circumspection. The main injuries suffered by the plaintiff were to his right hand and those injuries have led to several related claims and the possibility of overlapping in the damages to be awarded has been raised by counsel for the defendant.
It was contended by the defence that the injuries caused directly by the accident were confined to the fracture of the right humerus, a cut brachial artery and cut musculotaneous nerve and that the plaintiff did not, as a result of the accident, suffer any direct trauma to his right hand. Counsel further contended that it was the blockage of the repaired brachial artery which resulted in the gangrenous condition of the plaintiff`s right thumb, resulting in its surgical disarticulation and the conversion of his right index finger into a thumb.
However the specialist report produced at the trial bespoke volumes of the trauma suffered by the plaintiff. The suggestion by the defence that the fractured humerus, the cut brachial artery and nerve in this case did not, by themselves, give rise to any apparent residual disability is an over-simplification and tends to gloss over the medical reports (AB-30/31 and AB-36/37). Dr Yong`s testimony that the plaintiff would be unable to put his hands into his pockets and narrow spaces and that he would be unable to reach the back of his head or back, further undermines the defence submission in this regard.
In awarding damages, the question whether the court should adopt a global approach or a component approach in cases of this nature came up for discussion before Yong Pung How J (as he then was) in 
 Seah Yit Chen v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd & Ors 
 14 where in dealing with a similar situation, he observed at p 146: 
 
The main injuries suffered by the plaintiff were to her spine and her knee, and as these injuries have led to several related claims under separate heads, the possibility of an overlapping in the damages to be awarded has been raised by counsel for the defendants. This is the risk that the plaintiff may be over-compensated as a result of the itemization of the heads of damage. In many accidents, the victim suffers multiple injuries. In assessing damages, a court may either adopt a global approach and award a total amount to cover all injuries and claims; or a component approach and award separate amounts for each head of damage, which are then totalled; or even a mixed approach and award separate amounts for each head of damage which are then totalled and matched against a global award. The case authorities which have been cited to me merely illustrate the difficulty which courts face in settling general guidelines to cover the vastly different factual situations which arise in practice, and with which they have to deal. The component approach appears to have been followed in most English cases since 
 Lim Poh Choo
 
 v
 
 Camden and Islington Area Health Authority
 and, in 
 Croke
 
 v
 
 Wiseman
 at p 855, Lord Denning MR explained the ruling on this matter by the House of Lords in that case in the following words:
 
 
 
`They declared that, even in these cases, we must go by the current method of itemizing the various heads of damages. We must assess the cost of future care, loss of future earnings, pain, suffering and loss of amenities, as if they were separate causes of action. Then we must add the items together and award the total sum as damages, irrespective of any overlapping so long as it does not look outrageously high.`
 
 
 
Broadly the same approach was followed in Singapore in 
 Lai Wee Lian
 
 v
 
 Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd
; but at about the same time in 
 Ngooi Ku Siong
 
 v
 
 Aidi Abdullah
, the Federal Court of Malaysia disapproved a High Court decision in which damages for some connected injuries had been assessed separately and not together. In my opinion, which approach is to be followed in each case must necessarily depend on the facts of the case, bearing in mind the need to avoid overlapping. When the injuries sustained are related to the same part or function of the body, there should only be one award of damages, without any risk of overlapping: where the injuries sustained are to different parts of the body and affect different functions, as in the instant case where the plaintiff has sustained injuries to the knee and to the spine, it would be appropriate to make a separate award for each head of damage. In such cases, however, care would still have to be taken to avoid a further `sub-itemizing` of a head of damage or injury.
 
 
 
In 
 Lai Wee Lian v Singapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd 
, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton delivering the judgment of the Privy Council, observed at p 326: 
 
... It is of course true that at the end of the day the total sum awarded is what matters to both parties. But that does not mean that the component items do not have to be separately considered. They are the necessary parts which make up the whole, and the only proper way of deciding whether the global award is too low or too high is by assessing the separate items and arriving at a fair total ...
 
 
 
In the case at hand, the injuries sustained are related to the same part or function of the body (save for the scars due to skin grafting). Therefore adopting the views expressed in 
 Seah Yit Chen 
 ,14 I consider that a fair and reasonable global award for the fracture of the humerus with metal plating and in respect of the amputation of the right thumb and the transplant of the index finger, would be a sum of $50,000. I must add that in arriving at this figure, I have considered all the cases cited and arguments advanced by both counsel including those positive factors highlighted by counsel for the defendant in her written submission.
For scars I award additionally a sum of $6,000.
 Loss of future earnings or earning capacity
The next issue concerns the loss of future earnings or loss of earning capacity. Both counsel have submitted to the court an extensive tabulation of the potential loss that could be sustained by the plaintiff. The gap is wide. In this regard the preliminary issue is whether the plaintiff`s claim should be for loss of future earnings or loss of earning capacity. The defendant`s counsel contended that the award should be on the basis of loss of earning capacity. The distinction between these two heads of claim had been discussed in a number of cases.
In 
 Moeliker v A Reyrolle and Co Ltd 
 ,16 the plaintiff who was employed by the defendant at the time of the accident was still employed by the defendant at the time of the trial. There was no loss in earnings suffered by the plaintiff as at the date of the trial but an award was made to reflect the risk that the plaintiff might still suffer, ie by losing his present job and having to look for alternative employment and being at a disadvantaged position as a result of the injuries and disabilities suffered by him. An uncomplicated test was laid down by Brown LJ at p 15 where he observed: 
 
... As I have said, this problem generally arises in cases where a plaintiff is in employment at the date of the trial. If he is then earning as much as he was earning before the accident and injury (as in the present case), or more, he has no claim for loss of future earnings. If he is earning less than he was earning before the accident (as in 
 Nicholls v National Coal Board
), he has a claim for loss of future earnings which is assessed on the ordinary multiplier/multiplicand basis. But he may have a claim, or an additional claim, for loss of earning capacity if he should ever lose his present job.
 
 
 
That brings me to the case of 
 Araveanthan 
 .3 In that case the plaintiff claimed damages for negligence and/or breach of statutory duties, in respect of personal injuries suffered in an industrial accident on 11 October 1985. He was then a machine operator employed by the defendant. The machine he operated was equipped with a safety device intended to prevent its parts from moving at times when its gate guard was open. He sustained the injuries when a machine part closed on his right hand as he was removing a plate from the machine with the gate guard open. As a result of this accident, his right hand index, middle and right fingers had to be amputated and his last finger turned out to be deformed and stiff. He was assessed to have 70% permanent incapacity for the purposes of estimating workmen`s compensation.
Yong Pung How CJ allowed the plaintiff`s claim. However in declining to award the plaintiff loss of future earnings and awarding him loss of earning capacity instead, the learned Chief Justice observed at p 551: <6>
 Loss of future earnings 
 
It is not possible to accept the first plaintiff`s assertion that, if not for the injury, he would now be earning a basic salary of $2,000. In fact, even with overtime, it is highly unlikely that his earnings each month would be anywhere near that, even if he were not injured. At the time of trial, his basic salary was $836 and it appears that when he resumed work after being discharged from hospital, he did so at the same salary he was earning when he was injured. As for the fact that he has not been promoted, this was explained to the first plaintiff as being caused by a change of management. This reason was not doubted by the first plaintiff and has certainly nothing to do with his injury. In my opinion, no compensation can be due under this head. <6>
 Loss of earning capacity
 
 
 
The first plaintiff is now still employed by the defendant as a weighing assistant, a job that he can perform despite his handicap. He is only 25 years old. It may not be very likely that in the near future he will need to seek another job, but he has a long working life left. Even though the defendant has quite honourably continued to find a place for him for more than six years after the accident, and no criticism may be directed against the defendant in this regard, it must nevertheless be recognized that there is a real risk that the vicissitudes of time will at some point during that long remaining working life compel him to leave the defendant`s employ and find another place. When that happens, since his handicap is permanent, he will have difficulty finding a job that would pay him as well as if he could have complete use of his right hand. His vocational qualification is now useless to him. Consequently, any future employment he may find, in the event that he loses his present one, is not likely to pay him as well as if he could use that skill as well as his hand. Moreover, some allowance will have to be made for the effect of his injury upon his chances of advancement even in the defendant`s employ. For these reasons, I award him a lump sum of $55,000 under this head, without interest thereon, for his handicap in the labour market.
 
 
 
The Malaysian Federal Court in 
 Ngooi Ku Siong & Anor v Aidi Abdullah 
 at p 33, in dealing with the distinction between loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity commented: 
 
There is also a difference between loss of future earnings and loss of earning capacity although both items are under general damages. Future loss of earnings or loss of prospective earnings are awarded for real assessable loss, ie loss that is capable of assessment at the date of the trial. It must be proved by evidence and not by mere speculation. In the absence of such evidence if the court is satisfied that the plaintiff has suffered a loss of earning capacity, he will be awarded a sum as part of the general damages for his disability suffered as a result of the injuries sustained, instead of compensation for loss of future earnings. It arises where there is a residual risk that the plaintiff might be thrown out of work altogether at some future date. The risk must be real and not speculative or fanciful. Any loss of money is relevant, whether the money is properly described as `earnings` or not, provided that the money is more than a `mere possible contingency.` Thus loss of possible contract as opposed to loss of probable contract is not recoverable ... .
 
 
 
I revert to the decision in 
 Araveanthan 
 3 where Yong Pung How CJ declined to award loss of future earnings when the plaintiff, a machine operator continued in employment with his employer albeit as a weighing assistant as a result of his disability. In the case at hand, the plaintiff too returned to the RSAF and continued with his employment, this time doing staff work. His contract with the RSAF which came to an end in 1992 had been extended for another five years until 1997. He was twice promoted since the accident. He did not suffer any reduction in his rank pay though the court was informed that his pay supplement would be affected as a result of his being revocationalised but even then the difference would be paid to him in the form of temporary pensionable adjustment (`TPA`). As regards overseas assignments, even if the plaintiff had not been injured, there was only a possibility that he would be sent overseas and this would depend upon the needs of his current unit (exh P-2, para 8).
Taking all the relevant factors into consideration and following the reasoning in 
 Araveanthan 
 ,3 I am of the view that the facts do not give rise to a basis for loss of future earnings. In any event, the foundation for loss of future earnings by the plaintiff`s counsel is built more upon speculation and possibilities than on probabilities. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate to award loss of future earnings and the award to be made in this case should be one for loss of earning capacity instead.
On loss of earning capacity, counsel for the defendant submitted that the award should not exceed $10,000. Curiously however, defendant`s counsel`s alternative argument based on loss of future earnings (submitted in the event of the court deciding in favour of loss of future earnings) suggested a sum of $51,000. The calculations in summary are as follows: 
 
 
(a) Projected loss from 1993 to 1997 $22,612.48 
 
(b) Loss for further five years $28,374.85 
 
$50,987.33 
 
Rounded up to $51,000.00
  
 
 
Plaintiff`s counsel had little to say on the defendant`s arguments in favour of loss of earning capacity. His submission which was somewhat elaborate, touched mainly on loss of future earnings. In sum, the figures submitted are as follows: 
 
 
(a) Loss for 1993 to 1997 $ 24,553.92 
 
(b) Loss of earnings based on a multiplier of 15 years 
 
from 1988 to 2012 $376,965.91 
 
Total $401,519.83
  
 
 
It would appear from the foregoing that save for the period 1993 to 1997 where the parties` calculations are somewhat close, the difference is substantial as to the remainder. In assessing damages for loss of earning capacity, I am inclined to adopt the reasoning given and the language employed in 
 Araveanthan 
 at p 551F. I am mindful that there is a real risk that the vicissitudes of time will, at some point during the long working life of the plaintiff, necessitate the plaintiff leaving the RSAF and finding another employer. In such an eventuality since his handicap is permanent, he will have difficulty finding a job that would pay him as well as if he could have the complete use of his right hand. His qualification as an aircraft technician cannot now be put to good use. Consequently any future employment he might find in the event of his contract not being renewed after 1997, is not likely to pay him as well as if he could use that skill as well as his hand. Allowance will also have to be made for the effect of his injury upon his chances of promotion in the RSAF. Taking into consideration all the factors, I award him a lump sum payment of $76,000 which includes an element of $4,000 for any possible loss of gain from his overseas assignments. I am mindful in this regard that those overseas allowances were meant to cover one`s expenses overseas and not intended as additional emoluments. I also took into account that such assignments were entirely at the discretion of the RSAF and depended upon the needs of the current unit of the serviceman. It must also be observed that the claim for such loss is somewhat in the nature of special damages.
That brings me to the claim of future medical and transport expenses. It was put forward on the basis of Dr Yong`s evidence that `if strength achieved from the current operations weaken, then he [the plaintiff] may need a further operation to stabilize his thumb.` A claim for $10,000 is made under this head. There is evidence that the plaintiff will continue to be in the employ of the RSAF until 1997 and any expenses on account of any operation which might take place within that period, I am told, would be absorbed by the RSAF. In the circumstances, the claim under this head is not sustainable.
The question of apportionment between the defendant and the unknown motorist has already been disposed of (70% against the defendant and 30% against the unknown motorist). Be that as it may, there will however be judgment for the plaintiff against the defendant as follows: 
 
 
(1) General damages 
 
Pain and suffering and loss of amenities $ 50,000 
 
Scars $ 6,000 
 
Loss of earning capacity $ 76,000 
 
(2) Special damages (as agreed) $ 4,900 
 
$ 136,900
  
 
 
There will also be interest at the rate of 6% pa on the damages awarded (except on the sum of $76,000) from the date of writ till judgment, and costs. There will however be a deduction of a sum of $500 from the costs payable by the defendant to the plaintiff on account of an amendment to the statement of claim made at the eleventh hour by the plaintiff`s counsel. Further, there will also be the usual consequential orders pursuant to the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks And Compensation) Act (Cap 189).

Whether accused's plea of guilt would entitled him to discounted sentence
  – 
Protection of the public an exception to the general rule
 
You pleaded guilty to three charges and consented to three other charges to be taken into consideration. Before I hand down the sentence which I consider appropriate in the circumstances, I must observe presently that the common feature in all the three offences on which you were convicted was the presence of deadly weapons. In respect of the first charge (ie the culpable homicide offence) where the victim lost his life as a consequence of your actions, there was, in addition to the presence of the weapons, employment of considerable violence.
Touching upon the first charge (under s 304(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224)), though it was submitted that you were armed only with a metal file, whatever you did on the day in question together with your companion was sinister. Your deliberateness in going over to a hotel (where one would think intrusions of violent criminals would be most unlikely) testifies to your callousness and a total absence of fear of the consequences. The injuries suffered by the victim paint a gruesome picture. It was suggested by your counsel that you stabbed the deceased because during the attack, the victim picked up a chair and started attacking your companion. That aspect is hardly a mitigating factor, to say the least. It was also suggested to the court that you did not cause any violence to the deceased`s wife. That again is not a mitigating factor. The admitted facts are that you went to attack the deceased in order to assist one of your friends to avenge some wrong which the victim allegedly had done to your friend. Such dark and lightless allegiance of the sort with which you acted is not a virtue but one that is evil and despicable. All in all, the offence bespeaks aggravating features. The number of wounds inflicted on the deceased suggests that you and your companion had been extremely wicked, cruel and heartless when you inflicted those wounds. On the face of it the offence calls for a fitting punishment.
Section 304(a) of the Penal Code provides that `whoever commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine or to caning, if the act by which death is caused is done with the intention of causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.` The facts presented by the prosecution and accepted by you show that you attacked the deceased with the intention of causing such bodily injuries as is likely to cause death.
On the question of sentence your counsel, after submitting that you have pleaded guilty to the charges without reservation, referred me to the Malaysian case of 
 PP v Ravindran 
 
 & Ors 
 1 where Visu Sinnadurai J set out a number of sentencing principles. My attention was invited to the principle that the general rule is that an accused who pleads guilty is entitled to a discount of between one-quarter and one-third on the sentence which would have been imposed had he claimed trial and been found guilty. But in exceptional cases, the courts may exercise their discretion to refuse to grant any discount.
What are those exceptions? Lord Lane CJ in the case of 
 Sharon Elizabeth Costen 
 2 at p 184 observes: 
 
But there are certain exceptions, likewise well authenticated in the authorities, to that general rule that discount will be allowed for a plea of guilty. The first and most important exception is the protection of the public. Where it is necessary that a long sentence, if necessary the maximum sentence, should be passed in order to protect the public, in those circumstances a plea of guilty may not result in any discount.
 
 
 
I will revert to this charge later.
Now, as respects the second and third charges, viz the two charges of armed robbery committed by you and your companion on 8 February 1992, I note that the robbery was meticulously planned and you were armed with deadly weapons. You both had in your possession for that evil venture, a revolver and an axe. Though no violence had been employed, the use of weapons must have been ever present in your minds should there have been any resistance. Restitution was almost negligible and the revolver (which was held by your companion) was reported to have been returned to someone in Malaysia. Your counsel invited the court to note that the offences of armed robbery were committed at about the same time and though two victims were involved, they should be treated as a single transaction. In this regard he referred me to a passage from 
 Principles of Sentencing 
by DA Thomas (2nd Ed) at p 55 where it was stated that `a series of thefts in different shops in the course of one afternoon formed part of ""a single shoplifting expedition"" for which consecutive sentences were held to be incorrect, ... .` I am also aware in this regard of the provisions of s 71 of the Penal Code which provides: 
 
 
(1) Where anything which is an offence is made up of parts, any of which parts is itself an offence, the offender shall not be punished with the punishment of more than one of such offences, unless it be so expressly provided. 
 
(2) Where anything is an offence falling within two or more separate definitions of any law in force for the time being by which offences are defined or punished, or where several acts of which one or more than one would by itself or themselves constitute an offence constitute when combined a different offence the offender shall not be punished with a more severe punishment than the court which tries him could award for any one of such offences.
  
 
 
The effect of s 71 was considered by our courts in 
 Harry Lee Wee v PP 
 where Choor Singh J, after reciting s 71 of the Penal Code, observed at p 63: 
 
The appellant could have been charged with one offence to the effect that between 4 March 1976 and 10 June 1976 he accepted restitution of $297,956.12 in consideration of his concealing offences of criminal breach of trust committed by Santhiran. It would have been more favourable to the appellant if the prosecution had done this but then restitutions had been accepted on separate dates, some of them far apart, and it is not wrong on the part of the prosecution to have proceeded on eight separate charges. The charges are certainly not illegal. There is however considerable merit in the submission based on s 71 of the Penal Code.
 
 
 
The law as stated by Choor Singh J makes it clear that the public prosecutor has an unfettered discretion to prefer two distinct charges against you as was done in this case since you committed two separate offences against two separate individuals involving separate subject matters though committed on the same occasion.
Now reverting to the offences, ss 392 and 397 of the Penal Code read as follows: 
 
 
(392) Whoever commits robbery shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 2 years and not more than 10 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 6 strokes; and if the robbery is committed after 7 pm and before 7 am the offender shall be punished with imprisonment for a term of not less than 3 years and not more than 14 years and shall also be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes. 
 
(397) If at the time of committing or attempting to commit robbery, the offender is armed with or uses any deadly weapon, or causes grievous hurt to any person, or attempts to cause death or grievous hurt to any person, such offender shall be punished with caning with not less than 12 strokes, in addition to any other punishment to which he may be liable under any other section of this Code.
  
 
 
The offences as averred to in the charges were committed in the afternoon on 8 February 1992. The minimum sentence of imprisonment prescribed under s 392 of the Penal Code is imprisonment for a term of not less than two years and not more than ten years and also punishment with caning of not less than six strokes. Section 397 of the Penal Code makes it obligatory that if at the time of the commission of the offence, the offender is armed with any deadly weapons, he shall be punished with caning of not less than 12 strokes in addition to any other punishment to which the offender may be liable. On the sentence of imprisonment, your counsel submitted that one of the accomplices involved in the robbery was given only five (5) years` imprisonment. However, I have been informed by the learned DPP that the accomplice who partook in the two offences was originally given seven (7) years` imprisonment which was subsequently enhanced to 20 years` preventive detention. However the court was not provided with the specifics of the sentences.
As it stands you have been convicted before me for three distinct charges. Section 18 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`CPC`) provides: 
 
Where at one trial a person is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for at least 3 distinct offences, the court before which he is convicted shall order that the sentences for at least two of those offences shall run consecutively.
 
 
 
The learned DPP in his written submission this morning suggested that you be awarded preventive detention of 20 years in view of the nature of the offence and your past conduct as provided for under s 12(2) of the CPC. In this regard, he invited my attention to your antecedents as set out in the memorandum of previous convictions. As against this, your counsel this morning produced a letter from you in which you implored the court to show leniency to you on grounds that you are totally remorseful and contrite.
I note that you are now 41 years of age; you have pleaded guilty to the charge and thereby saved time and expense which would otherwise have been incurred by a protracted trial. I note your sense of contriteness and shame. In the circumstances I do not propose to impose on you a sentence of preventive detention. I am conscious however that the sentence of this court must truly address the seriousness of the charges and the protection of the public. Those prone to violence and violent ways must be made aware that the courts will not treat them lightly with kid gloves.
Having noted all the features of the first charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the robbery offences, the three charges to which you have consented to be taken into consideration, the relevant antecedents and your plea in mitigation, I impose on you the following sentences: 
 
 
(a) on the charge under s 304(a) of the Penal Code, ten (10) years` imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane; 
 
(b) on the charge of armed robbery where you committed robbery of cash totalling $12,500 and the NEC handphone in the possession of one Neo Ban San, a sentence of seven (7) years` imprisonment. 
 
As observed by me earlier, ss 392 and 397 of the Penal Code prescribe the mandatory minimum punishment of caning. However, s 230 of the CPC provides that `when a person is convicted at one trial of any two or more distinct offences any two or more of which are legally punishable by caning the combined sentence of caning awarded by the court for any such offences shall not, anything in any Act to the contrary notwithstanding, exceed a total number of 24 strokes in the case of adults or ten strokes in the case of youthful offenders.` 
 
In the light of that section and the court having already imposed on you 12 strokes of the cane, I shall now impose on you only 12 strokes of the cane for the charge under reference; and 
 
(c) on the third charge of armed robbery where you committed robbery of cash totalling $5,000 and a black `Dunhill` wallet containing some personal effects in the possession of one Neo Ban Hin, a sentence of six (6) years` imprisonment. For reasons stated earlier, there shall not be any further caning. 
 
The sentences of imprisonment in respect of all three charges are to run consecutively and are to be backdated to the date of your remand, ie 3 March 1992.
  
 
 
Now, as regards the three charges which were taken into consideration as provided for under s 178(2) of the CPC, it shall be recorded that you shall not, unless the convictions which had been had are set aside, be liable to be charged or tried in respect of the three offences so taken into consideration.

This is an appeal against a decision of the High Court dismissing a claim by the plaintiffs for personal injuries suffered on account of the negligence of the defendants. It was agreed between the parties at the trial that only the question of liability need be determined at that stage, with damages to be assessed by the registrar if the need arose.
The first and second plaintiffs, Teng Ah Kow (`Teng`) and Kwok Chuan Yuen (`Kwok`), were employed by the first and second defendants as cooks in their restaurant business carried on under the name of Sun Kum Leng Restaurant. The plaintiffs started work there two months before the accident, although they had considerable previous experience elsewhere as cooks. The third defendant was the supplier of gas (in cylinders) to the restaurant. The gas cylinders were connected by pipes to a stove with five burners where cooking was carried out by the plaintiffs.
On 13 September 1986 an explosion and fire occurred in the kitchen when Teng was turning on a gas cylinder in order to enable Kwok to cook. Both persons suffered severe burns. The plaintiffs alleged that the first and second defendants were negligent in, inter alia, (i) failing to provide and/or maintain safe appliances for the plaintiffs` use or (ii) failing to provide a safe system of work. The plaintiffs further pleaded that they would rely on the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur. As against the third defendant, the plaintiffs alleged that he had supplied a gas cyclinder to the restaurant which he knew or ought to have known had a faulty valve/nozzle (host and connector knob) or had failed to maintain the said gas cyclinder in good working order.
In their defence, the first and second defendants denied that they were in any way negligent and pleaded that if they were liable to the plaintiffs, they would look to the third defendant for indemnity and/or contribution.
At the hearing below, the third defendant issued a third party notice against Mobil Oil Singapore Pte Ltd claiming indemnity or contribution from Mobil Oil in the event that the third defendant was found liable to the plaintiffs. Mobil Oil is not a party to this appeal.
 The kitchen equipment
In the words of the learned trial judge, the physical state of the kitchen where the plaintiffs worked was as follows: 
 
The kitchen of the restaurant in which the plaintiffs were employed as cooks by the restaurant was rectangular in shape and about 30ft by 15ft. It had a door towards the right end of the longer side of one wall and another across the kitchen to the left in the shorter wall. Against the wall opposite the longer wall which had a door in it, and in the corner with the shorter wall which had a door, was the stove. The stove was equipped with five burners. Next to the stove was the refrigerator. The gas cylinders which fed the burners in the stove with gas were placed against the shorter wall opposite the shorter wall which had a door in it. According to Teng, the gas cylinders were about ten feet from the stove.
 
 
 
There were five gas cylinders in all which fed gas to the stove ... Each of the five gas cylinders was connected separately to a simple metal tube or pipe which ran along the wall and behind the refrigerator to the stove from where individual connections were made separately to each of the five burners. Each burner was fitted with a pilot light (and) ... a switch. There was a main safety switch fitted in the metal tubing leading from the gas cylinders to the stove ...
The connection of the five gas cylinders to the single metal tube or pipe ... was effected by a metal screw and nut joint ... from which was led a hose of about 3ft in length. At the other end of the hose was attached a connector knob ... The five sets of hose and connector knobs, one for each of the five gas cylinders, were permanently attached to the single metal tube or pipe.
The piping system of feeding gas from the gas cylinders to the stove was installed by the third defendant. The gas cylinders, each of about 31U2ft in height, were always kept in an upright position. On the top of each gas cylinder was attached a contraption called a regulator valve. A nozzle protruded sideways from the regulator valve to which the connector knob was screwed. The topmost part of the regulator valve was the hand control knob, which was attached by a screw to a spindle or threaded shaft. When the knob was turned anti-clockwise or clockwise, the spindle or threaded shaft would be moved up and down. A stud-like device was attached to the bottom end of the spindle or threaded shaft, on which was a washer to prevent the spindle or threaded shaft from being screwed out of the regulator valve as well as to seal the gap between the spindle or threaded shaft and the outercasing of the regulator valve. The underside of the stud-like device was the stud onto which the critical part of the regulator valve, a plug or O-ring component, was slotted.
The operation of the O-ring component and the spindle or threaded shaft was further explained by the learned judge as follows: 
 
The O-ring component is made up of three component parts, that is, a rubberized ring called the `O` ring held between two metal rings to form one unit. The underside of the O-ring component is packed with a synthetic substance which gives when the spindle or threaded shaft is screwed tight into place over the `seat` at the bottom of the shaft into which the spindle or threaded shaft screws in. Thus the gas in the cylinder is locked in when the hand control knob is turned clockwise screwing the spindle or threaded shaft and the O-ring component downwards into place over the seat. When the hand control knob is turned anti-clockwise it raises the spindle or threaded shaft and the O-ring component upwards clearing the side opening to the nozzle so that the gas can now escape through the nozzle and the hose connected to the nozzle by the connector knob to the system.
 
 
 
The spindle or threaded shaft and the O-ring component are locked in place by a locking nut which is a largish nut with several rows of threads and ... is tightened at manufacture with a torque of 900kg per centimetre. Both expert witnesses were agreed that the locking nut cannot be loosened by hand. Some tool like a spanner and considerable force would be required to loosen the locking nut. Although two and a half turns anti-clockwise of the hand control knob will open the regulator valve fully it cannot be turned further as it then turns on the locking nut which has the same threading but because of the torque on the locking nut further pressure by hand on the hand control knob anti-clockwise will not loosen the locking nut. Thus, by hand manipulation alone the spindle or threaded shaft and the O-ring component cannot be screwed out of the regulator valve.
 Events leading to the accident
Evidence was led by the plaintiffs that, on 10 September 1986, three gas cylinders were delivered by the third defendant to the restaurant and that one of them had something wrong with it. They saw the third defendant placing the cylinders near the door at the wall on the side of the kitchen opposite to the side where the stove was situated. It was the duty of a kitchen help, one Ah Chung, to receive gas cylinders and connect and disconnect them to the system. This point was not in dispute as the second defendant admitted that. The second defendant had never seen the two plaintiffs change cylinders. The plaintiffs said that they overheard Ah Chung telling the employer, the second defendant, that there was something wrong with one of the cylinders delivered on 10 September 1986. The plaintiffs claimed that, on 11 September 1986, they had also overheard Ah Chung reminding the second defendant of the faulty cylinder. They maintained that Ah Chung told them what the fault with the cylinder was but they could not at the trial recall what it was. Be that as it may, there was evidence from the second defendant himself who told the court that Ah Chung did tell him on 12 September 1986 that one of the cylinders delivered had a loose cap. The second defendant said that he even went to check it and found that the hand control knob of a cylinder was wobbly. However, he did not smell any gas. He marked that cylinder with white chalk and told Ah Chung and the plaintiffs not to touch that cylinder until the third defendant had attended to it.
There was a conflict in evidence as to the day on which the second defendant was told of the faulty cylinder by Ah Chung. We do not think this aspect is that material. In any case the learned judge found it was on 12 September 1986. In turn, the second defendant called the third defendant to attend to the fault. The third defendant did turn up later on the same day, but found nothing wrong with the three spare cylinders which were placed against the wall; in fact he also found nothing wrong with the five cylinders which were at that time connected to the system to feed the stove. At the time when the third defendant came to inspect the cylinders, the plaintiffs were not present. But later in the evening of the same day they overheard Ah Chung telling another person that the gas supplier had been to the restaurant that afternoon.
At around noon on the day of the accident, 13 September 1986, an order for soup was received by Kwok. He turned on a burner and found that there was no gas. There was no smell of gas in the kitchen either. He asked Teng to turn on another cylinder. Teng turned on the hand control knob of the gas cylinder nearest to him. The moment that was done, a hissing sound of gas escaping from the cylinder was heard. Both Kwok and Teng could smell gas. Teng tried to turn off the knob of that cylinder. Kwok also rushed to help him. Then there was a loud explosion and fire. Both the plaintiffs suffered severe burns.
The learned judge found that at the time of the accident not one of the five pilot lights had been lit. He also found that it was necessary to turn on only one gas cylinder at a time to feed all the five burners.
After the fire, the third defendant arrived at the scene. He was asked by the police officers to disconnect the gas cylinder that caught fire. He found the hand control knobs of the five gas cylinders which were connected to the system were turned off. When he tried to disconnect the gas cylinder in question by unscrewing the connector knob there was a slight out-flow of gas. He then shut the connector knob tight, bent the hose to block the gas and disconnected the hose at the other end and sealed it with an angle-joint screw. He also smelled gas coming out of the hand control knob even though it was turned off. He tightened the hand control knob but there was still a gas leak. Later, on the instruction of the police, the third defendant took the gas cylinder to an open space at Marina Square and released the gas from the cylinder.
 Expert evidence
The third defendant and the third party (Mobil) each called an expert to testify. One Mr Hasegawa, called by Mobil, conducted tests on the regulator valve (of the cylinder in question), hose and connector knob in February 1991. He found no leakage from the regulator valve. But, in testing the regulator valve, a substituted O-ring component had to be used as the original O-ring component of the regulator valve of the gas cylinder in question was found to be missing. When he first submerged in water the hose and connector knob under pressure he found there was leakage at the connector knob but when the connector knob was tightened the leakage stopped. He said that a loose hand control knob would not indicate that something was wrong with the regulator valve.
One Mr Glover, for the third defendant, having examined the locking nut and the spindle or threaded shaft, found some damage to the locking nut which was consistent with an incorrect tool having been used on it. He was of the view that the `only feasible cause of accident [was] ... deliberate unscrewing of the locking nut`. Mr Glover also told the court that an O-ring component must have been there originally. He surmised that perhaps someone took it out. He also said that, if the locking nut was unscrewed and removed, the O-ring component would fall out. He opined that it would not fall out by turning the hand control knob. What he suggested was that there was tampering with the regulator valve.
 Findings of the High Court
Having reviewed the evidence adduced by the plaintiffs, the learned trial judge came to the following conclusion as regards the plaintiffs` case: 
 
I have the gravest doubts whether their evidence does establish anything at all except for the fact that on Teng turning open one of the five gas cylinders connected to the system it burst out in flames. Apart from this, there are serious anomalies in their evidence, the most serious of which, on their own admission, was that there was no source of ignition in the kitchen when Teng turned on that gas cylinder. Much was made of by the plaintiffs of a faulty gas cylinder being delivered to the restaurant on 10 September 1986. On their own evidence they do not know this for a fact and rely on what they say they overheard or what was told to them by Ah Chung. Ah Chung was not called by them as a witness. On their own evidence, they do not know whether the faulty gas cylinder was ever connected to the system any time up to the fire from the time it was delivered to the restaurant on 10 September 1986. Their evidence, on its face value, was that it was not. I also have the gravest doubts whether on this evidence the principle of res ipsa loquitur can be raised.
 
 
 
The court found that, on 12 September 1986, when the second defendant contacted the third defendant, the former did not say to the latter that there was any gas leak, only that the hand control knob of a cylinder was wobbly. The court preferred the evidence of the second defendant to that of the third defendant. The court also found that after the third defendant had made the inspection of the gas cylinders, the second defendant, not being present when the inspection was carried out, called the third defendant to confirm that the gas cylinders were in order.
The court further found that there was no evidence whatsoever that the alleged faulty cylinder was ever connected to the system. He concluded that: 
 
The only person who could possibly have thrown some light on this was Ah Chung. But he was not called as a witness by the plaintiffs who, in my view, should have called him to testify on their behalf.
 
 
 
He also drew an adverse inference against the plaintiffs for failing to call upon Ah Chung to testify to resolve `some anomalies and mysteries`.
The learned judge held that the plaintiffs had not proved any one of the particulars of negligence they had alleged against any of the three defendants. He held that the plaintiffs had failed to discharge that burden. What weighed very heavily in the learned judge`s mind was that there was no evidence that the alleged faulty gas cylinder had been connected to the system before the accident. In his view this was `a fatal flaw in the plaintiffs` case`. He also did not think that the principle of res ipsa loquitur could apply to assist the plaintiffs in tilting the balance in their favour.
 Grounds of appeal
The main grounds of this appeal are that the learned judge had erred (i) in failing to apply the principle of res ipsa loquitur to the case; (ii) in holding that the failure by the plaintiffs to call Ah Chung entitled the court to draw an adverse inference against the plaintiffs; (iii) in deciding that the first and second defendants had discharged their common law duty of providing a safe system of work, safe equipment and safe place of work; and (iv) in finding that the third defendant was not negligent in the supply, repair and maintenance of the gas cylinders and of the system.
Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted before us that, in the circumstances of the present case, the mere fact that an unexpected and unexplained explosion and fire took place which caused the plaintiffs to suffer serious injuries entitles them to rely upon the principle of res ipsa loquitur.
It seems to us settled law that the principle of res ipsa loquitur is no more than a rule of evidence of which the essence is, as Lord Radcliffe pointed out in 
 Barkway v South Wales Transport Co Ltd 
, that an event which in the ordinary course of things is more likely than not to have been caused by negligence is by itself evidence of negligence. It would then be for the defendant to rebut the prima facie case.
In 
 Scott v London and St Katherine Docks Co 
, Erle CJ explained the operation of the principle in these words: 
 
There must be reasonable evidence of negligence. But where the thing is shown to be under the management of the defendant or his servants, and the accident is such as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use proper care, it affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the defendants, that the accident arose from want of care.
 
 
 
In relation to the facts of the present case, what we have here are two cooks who were on the fateful day going about doing their work normally when one of them (Teng), on unscrewing the hand control knob of a gas cylinder, heard gas escaping from the cylinder, followed by an explosion and fire. There were some discrepancies as to which precise gas cylinder Teng turned on. We do not think that is material. The indisputable fact is that one of the cylinders did, on being turned on by Teng, catch fire. At the point in time, neither of the plaintiffs were clear as to whether any of the pilot lights in the stove were on. They also told the court that some three days earlier the third defendant delivered three cylinders of gas to the restaurant, which cylinders were left at the side of the kitchen wall as spares. They also heard the kitchen help, Ah Chung, whose duty it was to attend to the deliveries of gas cylinders and to connect and disconnect them to the system, telling the second defendant that something was wrong with one of the cylinders delivered that day. In their defence, the first and second defendants admitted that `on or about 12 September 1986, it was discovered that the cap on one of the (cylinders) was faulty.` The plaintiffs did not connect any of those three cylinders to the system; that was, of course, not their duty. Neither did they witness any of the three cylinders being connected by Ah Chung or anyone else to the system to feed the stove.
In these circumstances, it seems to us that the principle of res ipsa loquitur applies to shift the burden to the employers, the first and second defendants, to show that they were no way at fault: see Lord Pearson in 
 Henderson (Widow and administratix of the estate of George Arthur Henderson, deceased) v Henry E Jenkins & Sons & Anor 
, at p 766. We would respectfully differ from the learned judge who held that the plaintiffs could not pray in aid res ipsa loquitur. In our opinion the present case falls within the following statements made by Megaw LJ in 
 Lloyde v 
 West Midlands Gas Board 
, at p 1246, where he explained the principle thus: 
 
... I think it is no more than an exotic, though convenient, phrase to describe what is in essence no more than a common sense approach, not limited by technical rules, to the assessment of the effect of evidence in certain circumstances. It means that a plaintiff prima facie establishes negligence where: (i) it is not possible for him to prove precisely what was the relevant act or omission which set in train the events leading to the accident; but (ii) on the evidence as it stands at the relevant time it is more likely than not that the effective cause of the accident was 
 some
 act or omission of the defendant or of someone for whom the defendant is responsible, which act or omission constitutes a failure to take proper care for the plaintiff`s safety.
 
 
 
We do not think it is for the plaintiffs to explain why the explosion and fire occurred. They have given an account of what they did before the accident which was largely undisputed with minor discrepancies, like which cylinder Teng turned on, that we do not think are material. Having been engaged as cooks, they were entitled to expect the employers to provide them with safe equipment to do their work and/or a safe system of work. This duty of an employer to provide safe equipment and a safe system of work remains with the employer notwithstanding that the employer might have delegated the discharge of that duty to another employee: see 
 Wilsons and Clyde Coal Co Ltd v English 
. The plaintiffs in the present case were not in control or possession of the premises. They were there only to carry out their work during specified hours.
In our judgment, in the light of the plaintiffs` account of what took place that day, the evidential burden shifts to the first and second defendants to show that they had provided safe equipment and had taken reasonable care for the safety of their employees. Now there is evidence of a faulty cylinder. The second defendant admitted that the faulty cylinder might well have been connected by Ah Chung or any other employee of the first and second defendants to the system that fed the stove. He did not know. It is for the employers to explain the measures they had taken and what had happened to the faulty cylinder. Here, with respect, we think that the learned judge had erred when he held that the plaintiffs should have called upon Ah Chung to testify and explain the mysteries. Ah Chung was an employee of the first and second defendants for whose acts the first and second defendants would be vicariously liable. They should have, in order to discharge that evidential burden, called upon Ah Chung to say what he had or had not done so that the court would be in a position to assess whether the employers, through Ah Chung, had undertaken all reasonable measures to ensure that the kitchen would be safe for the plaintiffs to carry on their work.
Accordingly, we also do not think it is correct for the learned judge to draw an adverse inference against the plaintiffs for failing to call upon Ah Chung to testify. We think the correct inference to be drawn is the other way round. No explanation was offered by the employers why they did not call Ah Chung. The employers would have the particulars of Ah Chung and they should know where to locate him. Yet nothing was made known to the court as to why the employers had failed to call Ah Chung; they did not even try. The second defendant only said he was not sure whether he could get in touch with Ah Chung. Pursuant to s 116(g) of the Evidence Act, the court should have presumed that, if Ah Chung were called, his evidence would be unfavourable to the employers.
We will now turn to examine the evidence adduced by the defendants. The evidence of the second defendant was that, on being told by Ah Chung on 12 September 1986 that one of the three cylinders was not quite in order, he called the third defendant to come and inspect them. He said he even went personally to look at the cylinders and marked the one which had a wobbly hand control knob with white chalk. However, no one attended to the third defendant when he came to do the inspection. The second defendant did not inform the third defendant that the defective gas cylinder was the one which he had marked with white chalk. It would appear that later that day, after the third defendant had done the inspection, the second defendant called up the third defendant to confirm that the cylinders were in order. However, the third defendant denied that the second defendant had made such a call to him. On this point the learned trial judge preferred and accepted the evidence of the second defendant.
The evidence of the third defendant was that he carried out an inspection of all the eight cylinders in the kitchen on 12 September 1986 but found nothing wrong with any of them. The learned judge accepted the evidence of the third defendant that he did inspect all the cylinders that day.
Then we have the evidence of Mr Glover who was of the view that the accident was due to a `deliberate unscrewing of the locking nut` - an act of tampering with the regulator valve. In his opinion, the only way that the hand control knob together with the locking nut and threaded shaft could have become `detached` from the body of the regulator valve was if the locking nut had been physically unscrewed. When, how and by whom did the tampering take place? One inference that can be drawn is that tampering took place between the time when the third defendant inspected the cylinders and the time shortly before the plaintiffs reported for work at 10.30am on 13 September 1986. On the other hand, Mr Glover did not examine the regulator valve immediately after the accident. It was done some three and a half years after the gas cylinder (and the regulator valve) was placed in police custody. We do not know whether during that period the police or any other person carried out any test or inspection of the cylinder and/or regulator valve; there is just no evidence on that. Why would someone stealthily unscrew the locking nut? If the intention of such an intruder was to release the gas in the cylinder, then surely there were easier ways of doing that, like disconnecting the connector knob from the nozzle of the gas cylinder and turning on the hand control knob of the gas cylinder. Could not the damage to the locking nut have been caused even before the cylinder was delivered by the third defendant to the restaurant? There is no evidence that a locking nut which had been tampered with a little earlier could not be used again.
The learned judge held that no negligence was established against the third defendant. He found that the third defendant did attend at the restaurant on 12 September 1986 and he `did check all eight cylinders in the kitchen and found that there were no leaks or wobbly hand control knobs on any of the eight gas cylinders`. But we must point out that the learned judge also accepted the evidence of the second defendant who said that, as soon as he received the complaint on 12 September 1986, he checked the gas cylinders delivered two days earlier and found that `one of them had a wobbly hand control knob`. Clearly, the evidence of the second and the third defendant are inconsistent in so far as the point regarding a wobbly hand control knob is concerned. Only one of them can be correct. We note that as between the second and the third defendants, whenever there is a conflict in evidence, the learned judge had accepted the evidence of the second defendant in preference to the third defendant. We have no reason to differ from the views of the learned judge as regards his assessment of credibility and applying the same rule, we would also accept the evidence of the second defendant. Accordingly, the inevitable conclusion which we would have to draw is that the third defendant never properly checked all the cylinders; thus he did not notice the one with a wobbly hand control knob. This, in our view, is negligence.
In our judgment, the second defendant was also negligent for failing to ensure that someone was in attendance to point out to the third defendant the gas cylinder with a faulty hand control knob. Only a washerwoman, who had no knowledge of the matter, was in the kitchen when the third defendant came to inspect. The second defendant said that he made sure that Ah Chung would draw the third defendant`s attention to the faulty cylinder. The fact remains that Ah Chung was not in sight when the third defendant came. The second defendant should have exercised greater care because of the dangerous nature of gas.
Mr Hasegawa said that a wobbly hand control knob would not affect the function of a regulator valve. But the indisputable fact is that there was such an escape of gas which caused an explosion and fire when Teng tried to turn the hand control knob. After the fire, the hand control knob of the gas cylinder was seen by the second defendant to be lying on the floor. There was no clear answer how the escape of gas occurred. But, on the evidence, we think that, in all probability, the explosion and fire had everything to do with the wobbly hand control knob that the second defendant had noticed and complained of to the third defendant.
The learned judge was puzzled as to how there could be an explosion and fire if there was no source of ignition in the kitchen. We would first observe that the plaintiffs did not categorically say that the pilot lights of the burners were not on. They were simply not sure. However, the second defendant said that the pilot lights would be on. He even said the fire of the burner would not go out completely. The third defendant said that there would be a change of cylinder whenever very little gas was left in a cylinder. It seems to us that it is unlikely that the fire of a burner would go off completely when the gas in the cylinder was about to be exhausted; undoubtedly the intensity of the fire would be reduced and that would be the time when the cooks would switch on a new cylinder. In our view the fact that a fire occurred necessarily suggests that there must be a naked flame around in the vicinity. More likely than not, it would be the pilot lights.
Finally, we come to the question of tampering. The learned judge held, in the light of the evidence of Mr Glover, that some form of tampering with the locking nut was the cause of the fire. It seems to us, for the reasons given above, that what was advanced by Mr Glover as the cause of the accident was no more than a possibility. Furthermore, it is important to bear in mind that it was never alleged in the pleadings of the third defendant that the explosion and fire was caused by a deliberate act of tampering by anyone, be it an intruder or an employee of the restaurant. Of course it had not been suggested that the tampering could have been done by either of the plaintiffs. It was never specifically put to the second defendant that, due to the inadequate security at the restaurant, intruders had, outside the working hours of the cooks, trespassed into the premises and disturbed the cylinders. The question as to the time at which the damage to the locking nut could have been caused was not explored. We do not think that the mere damage to the locking nut (due to the use of wrong tool), as found by Mr Glover, necessarily suggests that the tampering must have been committed by an intruder between 12 (after the third defendant had inspected the cylinders) and 13 September 1986. It is true that the second defendant said that the restaurant doors were left open during the afternoon break. But everything was in order when cooking resumed in the kitchen in the evening of 12 September 1986. It was never put to the second defendant that the restaurant premises were not secured during the night. Therefore, there is simply insufficient material to make a finding that an intrusion occurred during the period after the restaurant closed for the night on 12 September 1986 and before the plaintiffs turned up for work at about 10.30am the following morning and that the intruder had damaged the locking nut of the gas cylinder.
Accordingly, we find that the first and second defendants as employers and the third defendant as supplier of the gas cylinder were all equally negligent and that their negligence had caused the fire and explosion. We would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the learned judge and order that interlocutory judgment be entered against the defendants, with costs here and below to be borne equally between the employers and the third defendant. Damages shall be assessed by the registrar. The damages assessed shall also be borne by the employers and the third defendant in equal shares.
The security for costs of this appeal shall be refunded to the appellants or their solicitors.

The question reserved for the decision of this court was as follows: 
 
Whether the High Court, in exercising its jurisdiction in an appeal as to sentence, has the power to enhance the sentence beyond the limit of the power of the subordinate court which imposed the sentence.
 
 
 
We answered the question in the negative and now give our reasons.
Lee Meow Sim Jenny (`the accused`) was on 20 March 1993 charged in the district court with three counts of having committed criminal breaches of trust by misappropriating or converting to her own use a total of $2,237,250, the property of NatSteel Chemicals Ltd, between 1 February 1991 and 5 February 1993. They were DAC 1519 of 1993 ($1,012,250); DAC 1842 of 1993 ($1,065,000); and DAC 2123A of 1993 ($160,000). The offences were punishable under s 408 of the Penal Code `with imprisonment for a term which may extend to seven years and shall also be liable to fine`. The accused pleaded guilty to these charges and was sentenced by the district judge to terms of imprisonment of two years each for DAC 1519 of 1993 and DAC 1842 of 1993 and 18 months for DAC 2123A of 1993, with the sentences in DAC 1519 of 1993 and DAC 1842 of 1993 running consecutively commencing from 10 February 1993 whilst the sentence in DAC 2123A of 1993 would run concurrently with the sentences in DAC 1519 of 1993 and DAC 1842 of 1993. No fine was imposed. A fourth charge in which the amount misappropriated was $29,900 (DAC 2123 of 1993) was taken into account. Thus the actual amount embezzled was $2,267,150.
The public prosecutor not being satisfied with the sentences imposed by the district judge appealed to the High Court. The learned Chief Justice heard the appeal on 23 September1993 and allowed the public prosecutor`s appeal. He left undisturbed the custodial sentences but enhanced the totality of the sentence imposed by the district court by imposing a fine of $200,000, in default two years` imprisonment, on each of DAC 1519 of 1993 and DAC 1842 of 1993. The consequence of this was that if the accused did not pay or was unable to pay the fines she would serve a total of eight years` imprisonment.
On 2 October 1993, at the instance of the public prosecutor, the learned Chief Justice reserved the question we have set out at the beginning of this judgment for the decision of this court pursuant to s 60 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act. We heard the reference on 8 October 1993.
Mr Ismail Hamid for the public prosecutor pointed out at the outset that the High Court exercises both appellate as well as revisionary powers over the subordinate courts but whether it was the one or the other did not matter as the powers of the High Court exercisable in the one were the very same as the powers exercisable in the other. The powers of the High Court exercisable in an appeal from the subordinate courts are set out in s 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code (`CPC`) whilst the powers of the High Court when exercising its revisionary powers over the subordinate courts are set out in s 268(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code which refers back to s 256 of the CPC. It is well to bear this in mind when looking at the Indian cases, as one often does when dealing with the Penal Code and the CPC, so as not to be misled, as the Indian cases have taken the view that when the High Court exercises its revisionary as opposed to its appellate powers, the powers of the High Court is unlimited. There are historical reasons for this which need not trouble us. Suffice it for us to say that the Singapore position is not `
 idem 
` with the Indian position on this particular aspect of the matter.
Section 244 of the CPC clearly provides that `when an accused person has pleaded guilty and been convicted by a district court or magistrate`s court on that plea there shall be no appeal except as to the extent or legality of the sentence`, and s 256(c) of the CPC provides that the High Court may, `in an appeal as to sentence, reduce or enhance the sentence, or alter the nature of the sentence`.
We are particularly concerned with the word `enhance` in s 256(c) of the CPC. Certainly there are no words of limitation used in conjunction with `enhance`. Does this then mean that the powers of the High Court are unlimited when enhancing a sentence of the subordinate courts? The sentencing powers of the High Court and the subordinate courts, the district court in this case, are set out in s 11(1) and s 11(3) of the CPC respectively.
Section 11(1) reads: 
 
The High Court may pass any sentence authorised by law provided that in no case shall the 3 punishments of imprisonment, fine and caning be inflicted on any person for the same offence.
 
 
 
Section 11(3) reads: 
 
A District Court may pass any of the following sentences:
(a) imprisonment for a term not exceeding 7 years; 
(b) fine not exceeding $10,000; 
(c) (not relevant) 
(d) any lawful sentence combining any of the sentences which it is authorised by law to pass; 
...
 
 
 
Provided ...
 
 
 
Mr Hamid submitted, with which Mr Clement Lopez for the accused agreed, that we must examine the other provisions of the CPC to understand what, if any, limitations should be placed on the word `enhance` in s 256(c) of the CPC.
Mr Hamid started this examination by, first, looking at s 261 of the CPC which provides as follows: 
 
No judgment, sentence or order of a District Court or Magistrate`s Court shall be reversed or set aside unless it is shown to the satisfaction of the High Court that the judgment, acquittal, sentence or order was either wrong in law or against the weight of the evidence, or, in the case of a sentence, manifestly excessive or inadequate in the circumstances of the case.
 
 
 
It is clear beyond doubt that the words `manifestly excessive or inadequate` in s 261 of the CPC refer to the sentence of the sentencing court, namely, the district or magistrate`s court. It is also clear beyond doubt that the High Court, whether exercising its appellate or revisionary powers, acting under s 261 of the CPC is revising the excessiveness or the inadequacy of the sentence passed by the sentencing court. It must therefore follow that the measure of the excessiveness or the inadequacy is measured against the fullness of the sentence as prescribed by the particular penal provision governed by the limits of the jurisdiction set by s 11(3) of the CPC for a district court and s 11(5) of the CPC for a magistrate`s court. If this were not so s 261 of the CPC would be rendered useless and meaningless. It is evident, in our judgment, that the High Court would have to first consider a judgment of the district court or magistrate`s court in the light of s 261 of the CPC before proceeding to s 256(c) of the CPC to consider whether it ought to reduce, or enhance the sentence, or alter the nature of the sentence. Thus, in enhancing a sentence the High Court having first considered it to be manifestly inadequate in the circumstances of the case then proceeds to enhance the sentence to what in its view the sentencing court should have passed given its jurisdictional limitations.
Mr Lopez supplemented this argument by urging upon us a construction of s 256(c) which was harmonious with s 256(a) of the CPC. He argued that it had never been doubted that under s 256(a) which deals with an appeal from an order of acquittal and which empowers the High Court, inter alia, to find the accused `guilty and pass sentence on him according to law` that that sentence was the sentence which the court trying the offence could have passed in law. In support of this proposition he cited to us 
 Jagat Bahadur v State of Madhya Pradesh 
, where the Supreme Court of India had to consider the meaning of the words `pass sentence on him according to law` in s 423(1)(a) of their Code of Criminal Procedure which is pari materia with s 256(a) of the CPC. Mudholkar J in delivering the judgment of the Supreme Court quoted with approval from the judgment in 
 Sitaram v Emperor 
, the following: 
 
Nevertheless, it is a rule underlying the whole fabric of appellate jurisdiction that the power of an appellate court is measured by the power of the court from whose judgment or order the appeal before it has been made ... It is a fundamental principle that every Court of Appeal exists for the purpose, where necessary, of doing, or causing to be done, that which each court subordinate to its appellate jurisdiction should have, but has not, done, or caused to be done, and nothing further. Therefore, the jurisdiction in appeal is necessarily limited in each case to the same extent as the jurisdiction from which that particular case comes. It is a proposition which cannot be disputed that all powers conferred upon an appellate court, as such, must be interpreted as subject to the general rule above stated.
 
 
 
and from 
 Muthiah v Emperor 
 the following: 
 
We think that the power given to an appellate court ... is not an unlimited power to make such an order in any circumstances, but is to be taken as giving the appellate court power to do only that which the lower court could and should have done.
 
 
 
and concluded: 
 
An appeal court is after all `a court of error`, that is, a court established for correcting an error. If, while purporting to correct an error, the court were to do something which was beyond the competence of the trying court, how could it be said to be correcting an error of the trying court.
 
 
 
We entirely approve of the submissions made by counsel and the judgment of the Indian Supreme Court in 
 Jagat Bahadur v State of Madhya Pradesh 
.
Before we leave this question we should mention that except in the case of capital offences which must be tried in the High Court and certain other offences which cannot be tried in the magistrate`s court because the minimum sentence that can by law be imposed in respect of them exceeds the sentencing powers of the magistrate`s court, all other offences can be tried in the magistrate`s court, the district court or the High Court exercising original jurisdiction at the election of the public prosecutor. The sentencing powers of the magistrate`s court and the district court are limited by s 11(5) and (3) of the CPC respectively, whereas the sentencing power of the High Court exercising original jurisdiction is virtually unlimited (see s 11(1) of the CPC and s 15(2) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act). Concomitant with this right of election of the public prosecutor is the procedure for trials in the magistrate`s and district court prescribed by s 180 of the CPC. We draw particular attention to s 180(b) which reads as follows: 
 
If the accused pleads guilty to a charge whether as originally framed or as amended, the plea shall be recorded and he may be convicted on it:
 
 
 
Provided that before a plea of guilty is recorded the court shall ascertain that the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him.
It seems to us that the effect of the proviso is that before a plea of guilty is accepted by a magistrate or district judge he is required to ascertain from the accused whether he understands the nature and consequences of his plea. The principle underlying this, in our judgment, is that an accused person pleading guilty is entitled to know the maximum punishment that can be meted out to him by that court for that offence and it is on that understanding by the accused person of the possible consequences of his plea of guilty is the court to accept his plea. Now, if the court recording the plea of guilty has erred by imposing a `manifestly inadequate` sentence `in the circumstances of the case` it would, in our judgment, be against all the principles and tenets embodied by statute or otherwise in our criminal justice system, if on an appeal to the High Court against sentence, the High Court could impose a sentence greater than the court which recorded the plea of guilty could.
It should be noted that the appellate criminal jurisdiction of the High Court vide s 19(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act is the hearing of appeals from magistrate`s or district courts `according to the provisions of the law for the time being in force relating to criminal procedure`. So, it is to the CPC that we must look to for the sentencing powers of the High Court exercising its appellate jurisdiction and having done so and for the reasons given above we answered the question reserved to us in the negative.
Consequent on our answer to the question reserved, we set aside the fines imposed by the learned Chief Justice, and for the reasons which follow we exercised our powers under s 60(4) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and enhanced the terms of imprisonment in DAC 1519 of 1993 and DAC 1842 of 1993 to three years each, everything else remaining the same as ordered by the learned district judge. The result is that the accused will now serve a total term of imprisonment of six years commencing from 10 February 1993.
The accused is a married woman aged 33 years. She has three young daughters, the youngest of whom is three years old. At the time of being charged with these offences she was employed as a commercial assistant in the commercial department of NatSteel Chemicals Ltd (`the company`), in which capacity she was in charge of the large sums of cash kept in the company`s safe, for the company`s use. It was her duty to draw from the safe the amount of cash requisitioned for by the company`s paying officer which had to be recorded in the cash balance record. Between 1 February 1991 and 5 February 1993 she misappropriated to her own use a total of $2,267,150 in cash from the company`s safe. She did this by taking out from the company`s safe more money in cash than what was requisitioned for by the company`s paying officer and retaining for her own use the excess over the requisitioned amount. She would however, record in the cash balance record the exact amount drawn from the safe and falsify documents to account for the excess amount of the cash drawn from the safe. When money was received from the company`s head office to replenish the cash in the safe she would destroy some of the pay orders and retain the cash covered by them so that the amount of the cash in the safe would balance with the cash balance record and the general ledger. To avoid detection by the company`s external auditors she would alter the entries in the general ledger and the trial balance report to account for the discrepancy in the cash. She also generated false purchase reports and debit notes for filing and preparation of the general ledger and journal voucher by the accounts department to account for the shortfall in the cash. She destroyed original copies of debit notes and did not send them to the company`s head office for filing in order to prevent detection of her misappropriations.
She spent the money she had misappropriated in maintaining an extravagant life style. She went on overseas holidays with members of the family; she purchased shares, a car and a piano; she made lavish gifts; she paid off her step-father`s debts and later paid for his hospital treatment and funeral expenses. Following her arrest she made partial restitution and through her co-operation there was recovery of some of her assets totalling in all about $468,000 leaving a sum of about $1.8m unaccounted for.
It is plainly evident from the statement of facts that the sum dishonestly misappropriated by the accused, namely, $2,267,150 over a period of two years was systematically and calculatedly achieved simply through greed and a desire to support an extravagant life style. It shows a high degree of sophistication and planning and furthermore the accused was in a position of trust vis-a-vis her employers, the company. The degree of culpability is undoubtedly at the higher end of the scale. Restitution was a token when compared with the vast amount of money embezzled. A plea of guilt is of little mitigating value in a case such as this. As Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) said in 
 Wong Kai Chuen Philip v 
 
 PP 
:4 
 
... the voluntary surrender by an offender and a plea of guilty by him in court are factors that can be taken into account in mitigation as they may be evidence of remorse and a willingness to accept punishment for his wrongdoing. However, I think that their relevance and the weight to be placed on them must depend on the circumstances of each case. I do not see any mitigation value in a robber surrendering to the police after he is surrounded and has no means of escape, or much mitigation value in a professional man turning himself in in the face of absolute knowledge that the game is up.
 
 
 
Certainly the game was up for the accused when the defalcations of the company`s books were discovered and although the accused was not a professional person she was certainly in a position of trust. Later, in the same case Chan Sek Keong J made this very pertinent observation. He said: 
 
In an offence like criminal breach of trust, it is a matter of common sense that, all other things being equal, the larger the amount dishonestly misappropriated the greater the culpability of the offender and the more severe the sentence of the court.
 
 
 
The deputy public prosecutor relied on these observations of Chan Sek Keong J in urging upon us that the sentence of a total of four years` imprisonment imposed on the accused by the learned district judge was manifestly inadequate.
Mr Lopez for the accused urged upon us the following mitigating factors:
 
 
(a) The plea of guilt usually warrants a discount of the sentence otherwise appropriate. 
 
(b) The co-operation of the accused which resulted in the recovery of some of her assets. 
 
(c) The partial restitution made by the accused and the inability to make full restitution on account of her having gambled away something like $1.8m in an endeavour to re-coup and pay back the amounts embezzled. 
 
(d) The personal ruin of the accused; that by the conviction she had brought irreparable damage to her own character and the prospects of her future employment; and that she had put her marriage in jeopardy. 
 
(e) The financial difficulties which existed when the first act of embezzlement was committed in that her step-father had approached her to settle his business debt of about $30,000. 
 
(f) The needs of her infant children who desperately needed her maternal care. 
 
(g) The unlikelihood of repeating the offences.
  
 
 
We found little merit in any of these mitigating factors. We have already commented on the plea of guilt, the co-operation of the accused in recovering some of her assets and the partial restitution as being of little mitigating value in the circumstances of this case. We have great difficulty in accepting the contention that the accused gambled away $1.8m in the futile attempts at winning large sums of money to pay back the amounts embezzled. This seems most unlikely and out of character, judging from the evidence available to us as to how she spent the dishonestly misappropriated money. If anything it is more of an aggravating factor than a mitigating one. Personal ruin is what one must expect when one embarks on a life of crime and we cannot accept her step-father`s business debt as being a mitigating factor for her own dishonest misappropriations. That leaves her infant children`s needs and the unlikelihood of her repeating the offences, the latter of which is but a pious hope and the former alone which needs to be taken into consideration.
Having considered the submissions of the deputy public prosecutor and Mr Lopez we were left in no doubt that the sentence of imprisonment of a total of four years imposed by the learned district judge was manifestly inadequate. In our judgment, in all the circumstances of this case, having regard to the principles of proportionality which are eminently appropriate in criminal breach of trust cases and bearing in mind that totality of consecutive sentences should not result in the sentence being a `crushing` one we substituted a term of imprisonment of three years for DAC 1519 of 1993 and DAC 1842 of 1993 without disturbing the other orders of the learned district judge.
Before concluding this judgment we must say that we have found the statements of principle of sentencing in criminal breach of trust cases enunciated by Chan Sek Keong J in 
 Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP 
, most helpful and we respectfully endorse them. Having said that we must observe that Chan Sek Keong J was not there dealing with the inadequacy of the sentences passed but was dealing with the accused person`s appeal on the excessiveness of the sentence. Lest we shall be misunderstood that we have treated 
 Wong Kai Chuen Philip v PP 
, as a `guideline case` for the measuring of the adequacy of a sentence in a criminal breach of trust case, we must make it clear that that case does not bear comparison with this case. Nor have we tried to maintain parity between that case and this. Each case must depend on its own particular facts, and the facts in that case were entirely different. There, the accused faced six charges of criminal breach of trust in his capacity as an agent of client`s money held in his client`s account, which were more serious charges than those brought against the accused in the instant case, and the total amount involved was $1,841,232.20 for which he had made no restitution. The prosecution proceeded only with two of the charges, to which the accused pleaded guilty, and the remaining four charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentence. The accused was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for three years in respect of each charge and the sentences were ordered to run consecutively. Against the sentences, there was no appeal by the public prosecutor. We make no observation on the adequacy of the sentence. It may be that if a case similar to 
 Wong Kai Chuen Philip 
, should arise in the future, the court may well be disposed to impose a more severe sentence.
Lastly, it is apparent to us that the learned Chief Justice in imposing the fines he did and, in default of payment, the default terms of imprisonment, must have had in mind that the accused having embezzled such vast sums of money and having made such little restitution should disgorge her ill-gotten gains by paying a hefty fine and in default serve a substantial period of imprisonment. Unfortunately, this exceeded the sentencing power of a district court. This impelled us to consider whether a compensation order under s 401(1)(b) of the CPC could be made. Under this provision there is no limit to the amount of compensation that can be ordered but the maximum default term is only six months (see s 403(2)(c) of the CPC). We raised this issue with both Mr Hamid and Mr Lopez. It was submitted, and we agree, that a compensation order under s 403(1)(b) is not part of the `sentence` and consequently the High Court would not have the power under s 256 to make such an order. In our opinion, a compensation order is not `punishment` for an offence under the Penal Code. Scarman LJ (as he then was) voiced this caution in 
 R v Inwood (Roland Joseph) 
:5 
 
Compensation orders were not introduced into our law to enable the convicted to buy themselves out of the penalties of crime. Compensation orders were introduced into our law as a convenient and rapid means of avoiding the expense of resort to civil litigation when the criminal clearly has means which would enable the compensation to be paid.

The appellant was seen driving erratically at about 1.30am on 20 March 1992. He was arrested and charged for drunken driving under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) as amended by the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1990. The charge read: 
 
You ... are charged that you on 20 March 1992 at about 1.30am along the PIE 14km towards the airport, Singapore, did drive motor car no: EU 6688 G whilst under the influence of drink to such an extent as to render you incapable of having proper control over the aforesaid vehicle and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 1990 (Cap 276).
 
 
 
On the occasion mentioned in the charge, the appellant`s blood alcohol level was tested at 92mg per 100ml. The prescribed statutory limit is 80mg per 100ml.
The appellant was convicted of this charge on 22 March 1993 and sentenced to a fine of $3,000, imprisonment for two weeks and disqualification from driving all classes of vehicles for a period of three years. I dismissed his appeal against this sentence and now give reasons for my decision.
The magistrate was informed that the appellant had been convicted in 1984 of `driving under the influence of drink/drugs` contrary to s 29(1) of the then current Road Traffic Act (Cap 92, 1973 reprint) and had been fined $200. The issue was whether the present conviction constituted the 1993 conviction `a second or subsequent conviction` for the purposes of sentencing under s 67(1) of the current Road Traffic Act. The magistrate held that it did. He said he was of the view that: 
 
... although the mandatory jail term for a second offender as provided by s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) was amended in 1990 and the accused`s previous conviction for drunken driving was in 1984, ie before the amendment date of 1990, the mandatory jail term for a second offender as provided by s 67(1) Road Traffic Act 1990 would cover the accused`s previous conviction in 1984 although it was before the amendment in 1990.
 
 
 
In the case of 
 PP v Tan Teck Hin 
 [Criminal Motion No 18 of 1991], it was held that the amendment to s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) on the punishment for a second offence could have retrospective effect to embrace offences committed before the date of amendment.
As this was the second offence committed by the accused for driving whilst under the influence of drinks, it would entail a mandatory jail term under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act 1990 (Cap 276). Moreover, deterrence is necessary to discourage the accused and others from driving when they are under the influence of drinks as they could pose a hazard to other road users.
Counsel for the appellant contended that it was not correct to consider the conviction in the present case as the appellant`s second conviction for the purposes of s 67(1). He did not dispute the correctness of 
 PP v Tan Teck Hin. 
 His reasons were founded upon the legislative history of the Road Traffic Act.
Section 29(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 92, 1973 reprint) provided as follows: 
 
Any person, who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle, shall be guilty of an offence under this Act and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, and in the case of the second or subsequent conviction to a fine not exceeding two thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months or to both such fine and imprisonment.
 
 
 
By an amendment statute of 1984, ss 30A and 30B were added. Section 30B read as follows: 
 
Any person who has been arrested under section 29 or 30 of this Act shall be presumed to be incapable of having proper control of a motor vehicle if the specimen of blood provided by him under section 30A of this Act is certified by a medical practitioner to have a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 110 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.
 
 
 
It was under the regime of both these sections that the appellant was convicted in 1984.
Section 67(1) of the current Act provides as follows: 
 
Any person, who, when driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle on a road or other public place, is under the influence of drink or of a drug to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine of not less than $1,000 and not more than $5,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months and, in the case of the second or subsequent conviction, to a fine of not less than $3,000 and not more than $10,000 and to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months.
 
 
 
This may be read in conjunction with s 70: 
 
Any person who has been arrested under section 67 or 68 shall be presumed to be incapable of having proper control of a motor vehicle if the specimen of blood provided by him under section 69 is certified by a medical practitioner to have a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80 milligrammes of alcohol in 100 millilitres of blood.
 
 
 
Counsel submitted that when the appellant was convicted of driving whilst under the influence of drink in 1984, a blood alcohol concentration of 92mg per 100ml would have been insufficient for the presumption to arise. The 110mg limit was reduced by amending legislation to 80mg only in 1985. He submitted that before that amendment, driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 92mg per 100ml would not have constituted an offence.
The point of this submission was, however, a little obscure to me. Counsel appeared to have things backwards. In 1984 the appellant was convicted of driving while he presumably had a blood alcohol concentration higher than the prevailing statutory limit of 110mg per 100ml. He was, under the definition of the Road Traffic Act, more under the influence of drink then than he was on the occasion of the present offence, when his blood alcohol concentration was 92mg per 100ml. It mattered not that the facts of the present case could not have constituted an offence in 1984; common sense dictates that what mattered was that the facts of the case in 1984 not only constituted an offence then but would most certainly have constituted an offence today also. Accordingly, there was, in my view, no reason why the conviction of 1984 could not be accepted as a first conviction for the purpose of regarding the present conviction as a second conviction under s 67(1).
Besides, I did not agree that the facts of the present case could not have constituted an offence in 1984. This proposition was premised upon the following reasoning.
Counsel for the appellant submitted that 
 Ong Beng Soon v PP 
, was authority for the proposition that the presumption arising under s 70 (and thus under the earlier s 30B) was an irrebuttable or conclusive presumption. So it was.
Counsel further submitted that after the statutory presumption came into force, it removed any necessity for the prosecution to produce circumstantial evidence and observation that would induce the court to find as a fact that the driver was incapable of proper control of a vehicle because he was under the influence of drink before a conviction under s 67(1) was warranted. So it did.
Next, counsel went on to say that once the presumption was introduced, and the blood alcohol concentration of a driver exceeded the prescribed limit, it was irrelevant to produce evidence of his capacity to consume alcohol or his actual proficiency in driving and control of the vehicle, because these would not rebut the presumption arising from the blood alcohol concentration. This also was acceptable.
However, counsel then submitted that it followed that evidence of improper control of the vehicle, the odour of alcohol on the driver`s breath and other such observations would not be sufficient for conviction of an offence under s 67(1) if the driver`s blood alcohol concentration was under the statutorily prescribed limit.
I did not see how this followed at all. The Road Traffic Act simply provides that exceeding the statutory blood alcohol limit gives rise to the presumption of incapability. The offence for which the driver might then be convicted is not called `exceeding the statutory blood alcohol limit` - ultimately the offence for which he might be convicted is still an offence of driving while under the influence of drink. In other words, the presumption is not the definition of an offence itself. It is one method, usually the simplest, of proving that owing to `the influence of drink` the driver was `incapable of proper control` of the vehicle - and it is not the only method. If the driver`s blood alcohol concentration is below the statutory limit, but he has a peculiarly low tolerance for alcohol so that he is nonetheless driving erratically, I do not see why it cannot be proved by circumstantial evidence and observation that he fell within the words of s 67(1), ie that he was driving whilst under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of proper control of the vehicle.
This being the case, by reason of the fact that on the occasion mentioned in the charge, the appellant was observed not to be driving straight but jerkily and from side to side, I should have thought it entirely possible that he might have been convicted of driving whilst under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of proper control of the vehicle even if these events had occurred in 1984, although his blood alcohol concentration did not exceed the prevailing statutory limit of 110mg per 100ml.
Counsel for the appellant went on to submit that s 67(1) of the current Act created a different offence from s 29(1) of the 1973 reprint. He contended that the definition of the present offence was `driving or attempting to drive with a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood`, and not driving or attempting to drive a motor vehicle whilst under the influence of drink to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of such vehicle. This was based on the misconception already dealt with.
It was suggested by counsel that if the 80mg limit were to be read retrospectively all persons arrested before the amendment of 1985 with blood alcohol concentrations above 80mg and below 110mg could be prosecuted after the amendment. Of course they may be prosecuted after the amendment - the date of prosecution is irrelevant. What matters for the purpose of determining the proper version of the Act the accused is charged under is the date of the alleged offence. It is elementary that if a driver was caught in 1984 driving with 90mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood the charge in respect of that incident would have to be under the then current version of the Act, not under the present version of the Act, even if he were to be prosecuted today. It seems to be me absurd that anyone might think that such a driver would be prosecuted under the 1990 version of the Act.
Counsel also tried to distinguish 
 PP v Tan Teck Hin 
, by pointing out that in that case there had been no change in the substance of the offence. The legal ingredient that had to be established in that case to prove incapability of having proper control of the vehicle on both occasions was a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 80mg per 100ml. It seemed to me that if in 1984 the appellant had had a blood alcohol concentration in excess of 110mg per 100ml, counsel`s own reasoning must apply a fortiori - there is all the more reason why an earlier conviction under s 29 of the 1973 reprint ought to be taken account of under s 67(1) of the current Act and I have no doubt that it was the intention of the legislature that this should be so when they lowered the statutory limit in 1985. If the limit had been raised instead, there might have been stronger grounds for suggesting that in the absence of express provision the earlier offence ought not to be regarded as a first conviction for the purposes of the enhanced sentencing provisions in the later enactment.
Finally, counsel submitted that driving and attempting to drive were two separate offences so that a conviction for driving whilst under the influence of drink could not be a `second or subsequent offence` if the offender`s earlier conviction or convictions were for attempting to drive whilst under the influence of drink, and vice versa. Even leaving aside the manifestly preposterous sense of this submission, it is plain from the drafting of s 67(1) that the words `second or subsequent offence` therein presuppose that the relevant earlier offence or offences may be of any description so long as it falls within s 67(1).
Accordingly I was quite unable to accept any of counsel`s arguments to the contrary which were so manifestly devoid of any merit, and I dismissed the appeal.

Offence of cheating involving submission of multiple share applications
  – 
Whether imposition of a fine is adequate punishment
 
The appellant pleaded guilty to and was convicted on a charge under s 415 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) of having cheated a company by deceiving it into believing that a certain Poh Lai Hiang had applied for 1,001,000 shares in the company. In fact, the appellant himself was to be the beneficial owner of the shares applied for. By virtue of the appellant`s deception, the company was fraudulently induced to make an allotment to him of 17,000 shares. This was therefore a case of a multiple share application as this type of case is commonly known. Seven similar charges were taken into consideration.
The appellant was sentenced to three weeks` imprisonment and a fine of $10,000 and now appeals against his sentence of imprisonment on the ground that it is on the whole manifestly excessive and wrong in principle.
For the appellant, it is contended that since 1989 a tariff of sentences has been established for these offences, in that the sentence has always been a fine, and in no case has a sentence of imprisonment been imposed. This appears to be true.
So far as this so-called tariff is concerned, however, the deputy public prosecutor has pointed out that there is an important distinguishing feature in this case which sets it apart from all previous cases. The distinguishing feature is that the prospectus of the company, which was given to the appellant together with the share application form, contained a clause which categorically stated that the making of joint or multiple share applications may be an offence under the Penal Code (Cap 224) and the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289). This cl 2 read as follows: 
 
Joint or multiple applications shall be rejected. Persons submitting multiple applications may be committing an offence under the Penal Code (Cap 224) and the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289) and such applications shall be referred to the relevant authorities for investigation.
 
 
 
Before deciding on the sentence, the district judge took into consideration various mitigating factors which had been urged upon him, namely, that the appellant co-operated immediately and fully with the Commercial Affairs Department in its investigations, that he then pleaded guilty and thereby saved the court both time and inconvenience, and that after investigations began he donated to charities the whole of the $22,577 which he had benefitted from the application. Finally, both in the court below and in this court today, there has been an eloquent and moving plea regarding the hardship which his family will suffer if the appellant is sent to prison. This last factor is of course of very little weight in Singapore nowadays, and of no weight at all when the term of imprisonment is short, as in this case.
Sentences imposed in previous cases which are similar can always be referred to for guidance, so long as it is remembered that they have been based on the particular facts of their respective cases, and on what I might call the ground conditions and the climate of judicial opinion at the relevant times. Unfortunately, it does not appear possible to deduce from the decisions in the previous cases which have been cited to me any clear principles which have been applied in determining the sentences. In my view, fines instead of custodial sentences can be imposed where the amounts involved are not of great magnitude or consequence, but when the operation smacks of something on a considerable scale, a custodial sentence must necessarily follow. In this particular case, the appellant applied for 1,001,000 shares costing $800,800. Together with seven other charges which were taken into consideration, the appellant was involved in applications for a total of 4,708,000 shares involving an outlay of almost $4m, arising from which a total of 89,000 shares were allotted to him as beneficial owner.
I think it should also be remembered that prosecutions for such offences normally take place in the district courts in which a district judge`s power to fine is presently limited to only $10,000. People who are minded to commit such offences of multiple share applications on a substantial scale must be discouraged from thinking that, if they are caught, they can simply surrender their ill-gotten gains and the worst that will then happen to them will be a fine of $10,000. For them, there must now be a custodial sentence.
In the appellant`s case, I am satisfied that all that can be said on his behalf has been said by his counsel, and in fact was taken into account by the district judge in the district court before sentence. Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
The appellant was convicted in the magistrate`s court of five charges under s 72 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Ed) (`the Act`). He was sentenced to a fine of $1,800 per charge and ordered to pay Sony Corporation $10,000 for the costs of his prosecution. Being dissatisfied, the appellant has appealed against the convictions and sentences and the order for the payment by the appellant of the costs of his prosecution.
Before this court, the appellant raised three grounds of appeal. The first ground was one of locus standi. His counsel submitted that it was wrong for the prosecution to be continued under the guidance of Drew & Napier as agent of the aggrieved party Sony Corporation while the complainant was Ong Yong Yew. He based his argument on this issue on s 336(1) and (8) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (`the Code`), which state:
 
 
(1) The Attorney-General shall be the public prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code. 
 
(8) Nothing in this section shall be held to preclude private persons or any officer of any Government department from appearing in person or by advocate to prosecute in summary cases before a Magistrate`s Court or in summary non-seizable cases before a District Court.
  
 
 
On this basis, he contended in a rather roundabout way that if the prosecution in a summary case before the magistrate`s court was someone other than the public prosecutor, that prosecutor must be the complainant, in this case Ong Yong Yew, or his advocate.
In my view this contention is based upon a misreading of s 336(8) of the Code. `Complaint` is defined in s 2 of the Code as: 
 
... the allegation made orally or in writing to a Magistrate with a view to his taking action under this Code that some person whether known or unknown has committed or is guilty of an offence.
 
 
 
A complaint is that which triggers off the prosecution process. This is shown by s 128(1) which states:
 
 
(1) Subject to this Code, a Magistrate`s Court can take cognizance of an offence 
 
(a) upon receiving a complaint as defined by this Code; ...
  
 
 
Once the magistrate takes cognizance of the complaint pursuant to s 133 the complainant is examined upon oath and the substance of the examination is reduced to writing and signed. It can be seen, then, that it is impossible for a company to be a direct complainant. This has to be an individual acting as the company`s agent. In the present case, when Ong Yong Yew signed the complaint, he specified in para 3 that it was made `on behalf of Sony Corporation ...`. Sony Corporation was the real complainant, and there is no evidence to suggest otherwise. In fact, it was most logical in the circumstances for Ong Yong Yew to file the complaint on behalf of Sony Corporation as he had been involved in the raid as an investigator under the employ of HS Intellectual Property Services and consequently had knowledge of the items seized.
Once the accused is issued a summons and proceedings are commenced, the accused has to be prosecuted but it does not follow that it is the person who files the complaint who then has to take charge of the prosecution. Such an argument is negated by the usual case where the public prosecutor takes over the case. Section 336(8) reserves certain situations (that is, summary cases before a magistrate`s court or summary non-seizable cases before a district court) where a private person or a government department can appear in person or by advocate to prosecute the offence. In this context, via s 11 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) incorporated by s 2 of the Code, person includes `any company or association or body of persons, whether incorporated or not`. Hence Sony Corporation was entitled to instruct its solicitors Drew & Napier to conduct the prosecution as its solicitors. It must be noted that these are not civil proceedings but criminal. For the purposes of a criminal prosecution there is no plaintiff-defendant situation. All that matters is the identity of the defendant, the identity of the complainant and most fundamentally, that with which the defendant is charged. Accordingly there was no merit in the first ground.
In his second ground of appeal, counsel for the appellant submitted that three of the charges had not been properly made out. This was because each of the three charges referred to Sony`s trade mark registration No 22195 covering class nine which encompassed a range of products. But in the attached schedules listing the infringing items found, not all the infringing items fell within the ambit of class nine.
The magistrate held that for the purposes of s 72, the mark had to `take on a physical body or form`. As a result he was not sure if all the items specified in the schedules came within this definition. At p 18 of his grounds of decision he stated: 
 
In my opinion, while it may be uncertain if the inlay cards and casings can be considered a `trade mark` for present purposes, the wrappers, boxes and video tape jackets can. Later at p 19 he stated:
 
 
 
Even if I am wrong in this, the relevant charges P2C, P4C and P5C each have, as infringing items, `Sony` stickers.
 
 
 
Counsel for the appellant pointed out, quite correctly, that each schedule forms a part of the charge itself. Hence, if a certain item did not infringe s 72 then the charge should have been amended to omit it. If, indeed, some of the items should not have been included in the schedule, then I would agree with counsel on his submission that the charges are defective. However, I am of the view that the magistrate erred in his definition of a `trade mark` within the context of s 72. In the instant case, the mark has been registered under class nine. A registered trade mark is defined as `a trade mark which is actually upon the register`. A `trade mark` is further defined by s 2 of the Act as: 
 
... a mark used or proposed to be used in relation to goods or services for the purpose of indicating or so
 as to indicate a connection in the course of trade between the goods or services and a person who has the right
, either as proprietor or as registered user, to use the mark, whether with or without any indication of the identity of that person ... [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
This mark was registered as `Sony`. Registration No 22195 granted protection in the use of this mark in relation to: 
 
Radio and television receiving sets and parts thereof, batteries, electric vacuum tubes, loud speakers, electric photographic apparatus, amplifiers, recording machines, converters (rectifier units for operation of battery radio), pickups, sound recording machines (wire type), magnetized recording wire, electric-communicating apparatus, dictating machines, tape-recorders, tapes for tape-recorders, 
 recorded tapes
, transistors, hearing aids, gramophones and parts thereof, phonograph records, record players ... [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
It is with these considerations in mind that we should turn to the second limb of s 72: 
 
Any person who ... has in his possession a trade mark for the purpose of denoting that any goods are the manufacture or merchandise of a person whose manufacture or merchandise they are not, or that they belong to a person to whom they do not belong, shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or to both.
 
 
 
It would seem that the mark referred to in s 72 of the Act is the mark itself as registered, that is, the use of the mark `Sony` in relation to the class of goods registered under that Act and manufactured by Sony Corporation as owners of the trade mark. Once this mark is embossed on anything for the purpose of denoting or rather, misrepresenting, that similar goods from other manufacturers originate from the same source then the section has been contravened. Clearly the carton and paper boxes, audio tape stickers, audio tape plastic wrappers, audio tape in-lay cards, audio tape casings and video tape jackets specified in the schedules to the three charges are capable of being such infringing products as they are used in the packing of video and audio tapes and as such they lead the consumer to think that the tapes sold together with such products are tapes manufactured by Sony Corporation.
I am not aware of any local authority on the ambit of s 72 of the Act. But support for these propositions can nonetheless be found in the case of 
 Ng Chye Mong Pte Ltd v PP 
, where Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) dealt with the then s 69D of the Act which is the present s 73 of the Act. The offence of s 73 of the Act is couched in the following terms: 
 
Any person who imports, sells or exposes or has in his possession for sale or any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods or thing to which a counterfeit trade mark is applied ...
 
 
 
Chan Sek Keong JC held that for a charge to be made under s 69D, the prosecution must prove that the goods to which the marks are impressed did not originate from the owner of the mark; use of a counterfeit mark is per se insufficient. In coming to this conclusion, Chan Sek Keong JC rationalized the nature of a trade mark at p 155 as follows: 
 
In the law of trade marks, a trade mark is not merely a mark. The right of a proprietor in a trademark is not a right to own it as a commodity. That is why trafficking in a trade mark (dealing with it as a commodity) is one of the cardinal sins of trade marks law; see Dillon LJ in 
 Re American Greetings Corp`s Application
. The right in a trade mark is merely a right to use it on goods to indicate the origin of the goods. It is a mark used in the course of trade to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the marks from the goods of other manufacturers. That is the raison d`etre of the trade mark. If a manufacturer has no intention to use a trade mark for this purpose, he is not entitled to claim ownership of it as a trade mark.
 
 
 
Thus the right recognized by s 73 of the Act is the right of the proprietor of a trade mark to prevent others from using his registered mark in selling their products if those products did not emanate from him as the owner of the trade mark. The protection accorded by s 72 correspondingly bolsters the right recognized by s 73. Clearly the mischief aimed at is the possession of a trade mark, whether counterfeit or not, to be used for the purpose of misleading the public into thinking the origin of any goods to be that of the owner of the trade mark when in fact such belief would be misconceived.
The crux of the offence then is in the proof that the purpose of the possession of the inlay cards, casings, boxes, stickers, tape jackets and wrappers was to use the same to package goods which did not originate from Sony Corporation. The learned magistrate concluded that these items were for that purpose. There is no reason to disturb this finding of fact; in fact it would be quite naive to come to a contrary conclusion.
Counsel for the appellant also challenged the sufficiency of the evidence that was produced in the court below. The prosecution did not bring all their exhibits to the court, but only a sample of each type of exhibit, and for the samples brought to court the prosecution had failed to establish that the chain of custody of the exhibits was unbroken. The magistrate dismissed this contention. At p 44 he stated: 
 
I could not find any such doubt as to the exhibits arising. Evidence was given that the exhibits were packed into lift vans and brought to KC Dat`s warehouse. Later, when some samples were taken for the purpose of the trial, PW4 said that they were obtained from lift vans which were carefully marked to prevent confusion between the goods seized at 112 Meng Suan Road and the two vehicles at Upper Thomson Road. He said the indications were `written with markers on the side of the lift vans which lift van contains which items pertaining to which search warrant or vehicles or locations` (p103E, notes of evidence). These markings can be seen by looking at photographs P65 to P73. It follows that the markings would have been sufficient to distinguish the goods seized on 21 December 1990 from any other goods seized from other premises pursuant to other raids.
 
 
 
In my view this finding is a complete answer to appellant counsel`s objection. It is interesting to note that on this issue counsel did not take the opportunity to cross-examine the investigators from HS Intellectual Property Services who identified the exhibits: Lim Kim San (PW1), Ong Yong Yew (PW4) or Ng Soon Yong (PW9). Only Lim Heng Siang (PW2), the managing partner of HS Intellectual Services, was queried.
I now turn to the remaining ground of appeal relating to the other two charges. Under the first limb of s 72: 
 
Any person who makes or has in his possession any die, plate or other instrument for the purpose of counterfeiting a trade mark ... shall be guilty of an offence ...
 
 
 
Charge P111 charged the appellant with the possession of one silk screen for the purpose of counterfeiting the Sony trademark. P112 is a similar charge in respect of two other silk screens.
It was contended by counsel for the appellant that as the investigators had been unable to find any brush, or ink, or words or numbers to match the screens, the causal link between the possession and the purpose of counterfeiting was not proved and that the magistrate`s conclusion at p 24 was open to doubt: 
 
It therefore seems clear that the accused did do some form of printing and therefore must have had the proper printing equipment stored somewhere. With the know how in printing, the possession of these silk screens under the circumstances can only be for the purpose of printing the `Sony` trademark onto items.
 
 
 
There is no doubt in my mind that the magistrate was correct in his conclusions. The manager of the recording media department of Sony Singapore, Mannabu Ozawa, and a quality control manager at the Sony Technological Centre in Japan, Yoshio Sato, testified that Sony Corporation used jet printers to print their trade mark. Evidence was adduced to show that silk screens are printing utensils. Further, both screens produced had the mark `Sony` on them. One even had a lot number. The screens were clearly in the appellant`s possession for the express purpose of reproducing the `Sony` trade mark.
The appellant has also appealed against the costs order made on the ground that the award was made specifically to Sony, and was ultra vires. This contention is similar to the earlier contention that Ong Yong Yew as complainant should have carried on to take charge of the prosecution of the appellant. As stated earlier, this technical objection is completely without merit. As Sony Corporation has borne the costs of the appellant`s prosecution the award was made quite rightly to Sony Corporation.
Before this court, counsel for the appellant also queried the fact that the award included the costs of two Japanese witnesses, and that these costs should not have been included. The order was made under s 401 of the Code:
 
 
(1) The court before which a person is convicted of any crime or offence may, 
 in its discretion 
, make ... 
 
(a) an order for the payment by him of the costs of his prosecution or such part thereof as the court directs; [Emphasis added.]
  
 
 
It can be seen that the section gives a wide discretion to the magistrate on this issue. The magistrate cited the English provision which allows the grant of costs as the court `considers just and reasonable`. The magistrate agreed with the English cases in the view that the conduct of the defence was a vital factor. Owing to the fact that the defence had persisted in challenging peripheral issues and the genuineness of each exhibit, the latter causing ultimately an expert witness to be sent from Japan inspite of the fact that the defence was innocent possession, the magistrate felt that an order as to costs was necessary. Taking into account an approximate of $5,600 for the attendance of the expert witness, and an approximate of $2,300 for warehousing charges, the magistrate awarded Sony Corporation $10,000 for the costs of the appellant`s prosecution which he considered to be a reasonable figure.
In my opinion, this was an appropriate exercise of the magistrate`s discretion. Of course, it is not in every case that such costs should be ordered. In exercising its discretion, however, the court is entitled to take all the circumstances into account, including the strength of the case against the accused, his knowledge of this and his conduct of his defence. An accused has a right to plead not guilty and to conduct his defence in any manner allowed by the law. Nevertheless if he loses and the court thinks that his defence has been conducted extravagantly and unnecessarily, he then cannot reasonably complain if he is ordered to pay some part of the costs which he caused the prosecution to incur. There is no evidence to suggest that such costs as ordered are not within the appellant`s means: after all, he owns a Mercedes, a flat in Yishun, and a packing business.
As to sentence, the maximum penalty at the time that the offences were committed was a fine of $5,000 and/or three years` imprisonment. The magistrate`s sentencing powers limited him to a maximum fine of $2,000 and/or two years` imprisonment. The magistrate ordered a fine of $1,800 for each offence. In my opinion, a court in determining a sentence under the Act is entitled to take into account all the circumstances in which the offences were committed, including the nature and extent of the infringements, and the manner in which the infringements were carried out. As in other criminal proceedings, the court is also entitled to take into account the manner in which the defence has been conducted on the instructions of the accused. Having regard to all the circumstances of this case, it would not be difficult to come to the view that the fine of $1,800 on each of the charges was manifestly inadequate, and that in addition the appellant should have been sentenced on each charge to imprisonment. I note, however, that in previous cases first offenders have not been given custodial sentences, but have only been fined. Also, these charges have been prosecuted in the magistrate`s court. I shall therefore restrain myself to merely issuing a warning that in future cases of similar seriousness a custodial sentence can be expected.
Accordingly the appeal is dismissed.

Cur Adv Vult
 
A criminal motion was filed to set aside eight search warrants issued under s 136(9) of the Copyright Act (Cap 63, 1988 Ed). The search warrants were issued on an application made by Chua Soon Chye on behalf of Anju/Woodridge Inc of New York, USA. The basis of the application was that Anju/Woodridge Inc was the owner of the copyrights in seven fabric designs published in the United States. The designs were applied to fabric manufactured in the United States and Japan and sold in Singapore. The complaint was that Lance Court Furnishings Pte Ltd offered for sale fabric with designs infringing Anju/Woodridge Inc`s copyrights.
A magistrate issued the search warrants, which were subsequently executed, but no further action was taken before the application was made to set them aside.
 Preliminary issue
When the application came before me, I wanted to be satisfied that the public prosecutor was the proper respondent to the motion although Mr Palaniappan who appeared for the public prosecutor did not object to his being named as the respondent. I raised this question because no criminal prosecution had commenced in that no summons were issued against Lance Court.
The public prosecutor may be an interested party by virtue of art 35(8) of the Constitution or s 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68). Article 35(8) reads: 
 
The Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.
 
 
 
Section 336(1) reads: 
 
The Attorney-General shall be the public prosecutor and shall have the control and direction of criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code.
 
 
 
Counsel referred to various cases on what criminal proceedings cover, none of which dealt specifically with proceedings at the stage of the present proceedings. In the end, I found assistance from the provision under which the warrants were issued. Section 136(9) of the Copyright Act provides that: 
 
If information is given upon oath to a magistrate that there is reasonable cause for suspecting that there are in any house, premises, vessel or other place any infringing copies of a work or other subject-matter in which copyright subsists (or any plate or contrivance used or intended to be used for making such infringing copies or capable of being used for the purpose of making such infringing copies) by means of or in relation to which any offence under subsection (1), (2), (3) or (4) has been committed, he may issue a warrant under his hand by virtue of which any police officer named or referred to in the warrant may enter the house, premises, plate or contrivance ...
 
 
 
This provision empowers the seizure of infringing copies of works or other matter by means or relation to which an offence under sub-ss (1), (2), (3) or (4) of s 136 has been committed, to enable proceedings to be brought under the section. The application for and the issuance of the search warrants come within art 35(8) as `proceedings for any offence`, which I construe as proceedings in relation to, or in connection with any offence. As art 35(8) refers to `proceedings` rather than `criminal prosecutions`, `proceedings` should not be limited to proceedings after the commencement of criminal prosecutions but should cover proceedings that may lead up to the prosecutions.
Section 336(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code gives the public prosecutor control over `criminal prosecutions and proceedings under this Code.` As there is no power under s 62 of the Code for a magistrate to issue search warrants in connection with offences under the Copyright Act, the issuance of such search warrants does not fall within s 336(1).
After hearing the submissions on the preliminary issue, I was satisfied that the public prosecutor was a proper party in the application by virtue of art 35(8), although the application may also be taken against Anju/Woodridge Inc and be continued if the public prosecutor does not intervene.
In the course of the arguments important questions relating to the subsistence and protection of copyright under the Copyright Act were raised which had to be dealt with.
 Section 74(2) of the Copyright Act
Mr Dedar Singh, counsel for Lance Court, referred to s 74(2) and (3) and submitted that if a design in which copyright subsists is applied industrially, and the design is not registered under the Registered Designs Act 1949 [UK], then under s 74(3)(a) `it shall not be an infringement of the copyright in the work to do anything which, at the time when it is done, would have been within the scope of the copyright in the design if the design had, immediately before that time, been registered.`
Opposing positions were taken on whether the industrial application is restricted to application in Singapore only. Section 74(2) provides that: 
 
Where copyright subsists in an artistic work, and
 
 
 
(a) a corresponding design is applied industrially by or with the licence of the owner of the copyright in the work;
 
 
 
(b) articles to which the design has been so applied are sold, let for hire, or offered for sale or hire whether in Singapore or elsewhere; and
 
 
 
(c) at the time when those articles are sold, left for hire or offered or exposed for sale or hire, they are not articles in respect of which the corresponding design has been registered under the Registered Designs Act 1949 of the United Kingdom, or any Act amending or substituting for that Act,
 
 
 
subsections (3), (4) and (5) shall apply.
 
 
 
Mr Singh argued that the industrial application referred to in s 74(2)(a) is industrial application anywhere. He referred to the explanation of s 74(2) given by Professor Jayakumar to the Select Committee on the Copyright Bill, and to George Wei`s comments on the provision in 
 The Law of Copyright in Singapore 
 at p 181. However, the minister and the author were referring to industrial applications generally, without making any distinction between local and foreign industrial applications. What they said cannot be relied on to resolve the question whether s 74(2)(a) refers to industrial applications everywhere or to industrial applications in Singapore.
Mr Ghows, who argued for the public prosecutor on a fiat, gave a detailed reply on this point. He traced the forerunners of s 74(2). Section 74(2)(a) and (b) of the Act is similar to s 10(2)(a) and (b) of the Copyright Act 1956 [UK] as amended by the Design Copyright Act 1968 [UK]. The amended provision reads: 
 
(2) Where copyright subsists in an artistic work, and
 
 
 
(a) a corresponding design is applied industrially by or with the licence of the owner of the copyright in the work, and
 
 
 
(b) articles to which the design has been so applied are sold, let for hire, or offered for sale or hire whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere.
 
 
 
The amendment introduced the words `whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere` to sub-s (2)(b).
The authors of 
 Copinger and Skone James on Copyright 
, in referring to the original s 10(2), stated at para 20-20: 
 
It is to be noted that these three conditions were cumulative. If, therefore, one condition was not satisfied it would seem that s 10(2) would not have applied. This could have occurred, it is suggested, if, for instance, the industrial application took place in America and the relevant articles were sold in America and this country. That is to say, neither the condition relating to industrial application, nor the condition relating to sale specified where that activity had to take place for the condition to be satisfied. It is suggested, therefore, that, in the circumstances, both were confined to this country since it would seem surprising if, by reason of industrial application and sale in, for instance, America alone, there should be a limitation on the English artistic copyright.
 
 
 
When referring to the amended form of the provision the authors noted at para 20-32: 
 
The words `whether in the United Kingdom or elsewhere` were added to what was the original sub-s (2)(b), but not to what was the original sub-s (2)(a), which raised the question, since these conditions were cumulative, as to when the subsection applied. That is to say, if it was necessary to provide expressly that sale anywhere was relevant, presumably industrial application was only relevant if it took place in the United Kingdom. Therefore it would seem that, if industrial application took place, say, in America, but sale took place in this country and America, the subsection would not have applied.
 
 
 
The Australian Copyright Act also affords some assistance on this issue. Section 77(1) of the Act, in its original form, was similar to our s 74(2), and read: 
 
Where
 
 
 
(a) copyright subsists in an artistic work;
 
 
 
(b) a corresponding design is applied industrially by, or with the licence of, the owner of the copyright in the work;
 
 
 
(c) articles to which the corresponding design has been so applied (in this section referred to as `articles made to the corresponding design`) are sold, let for hire or offered or exposed for sale or hire in Australia; and
 
 
 
(d) at the time when those articles are so sold, let for hire or offered or exposed for sale or hire, they are not articles in respect of which the corresponding design has been registered under the Designs Act 1906-1968,
 
 
 
the succeeding sub-sections of this section have effect.
 
 
 
In Ricketson`s 
 The Law of Intellectual Property 
, the author referred to s 77 in that form and said at paragraph 22.24: 
 
Section 77 does not apply where the industrial application of a corresponding design and the sale of articles to which it has been applied takes place outside Australia. Thus, an author of an artistic work who is a national of a Convention country will be able to invoke his copyright to restrain the unauthorized application of a corresponding design to articles in Australia, even though he has himself previously applied that design industrially in another country.
 
 
 
Section 77 was amended in 1989 to ensure that a copyright owner who has applied a copyright industrially outside Australia should not be in a better position than a copyright owner who has applied it in Australia. This was achieved by inserting into s 77(1)(b) after the word `industrially` the words `whether in Australia or elsewhere`, thereby eliminating the distinction between foreign and local applications.
In drafting our s 74(2), our legislative draftsmen must have been alive to s 10(2)(a) and (b) of the 1956 Act, the comments in 
 Copinger and Skone James 
 thereon, as well as comments in 
 Ricketson 
 on the original Australian s 77. The inclusion of the words `whether in Singapore or elsewhere` in sub-s 2(b) which deals with sales and hire and their absence in sub-s 2(a) which deals with industrial application mean that the scope of application of the two provisions are not the same. Industrial application under sub-s 2(a) cannot, without those words, be construed to mean industrial application in Singapore or elsewhere, and must be limited to Singapore.
For this reason I found that Anju/Woodridge Inc did not, by applying the designs in the United States and Japan, forfeit copyright protection over them in Singapore.
Another point of construction was raised - whether the three limbs of s 74(2) are disjunctive or conjunctive. Mr Singh argued that they are disjunctive, and that there is no copyright infringement if the fabrics are sold in Singapore or elsewhere even if the designs are applied outside Singapore. Mr Ghows contended that they are conjunctive, and he was right. It will be observed by anyone familiar with the work of our legislative draftsmen that they follow the practice that where there are several limbs to a provision, each limb but the last two are separated by semi-colons, and the last two are separated by an `and` or an `or` to indicate the manner in which those two and the preceding limbs are to be read.
This recognized drafting practice is referred to in 
 Legislative Drafting 
 by GC Thornton, at p 66: 
 
Where the series of paragraphs is either conjunctive or disjunctive it is usual to insert the `and` or `or` after the penultimate paragraph only. This, subject to context, raises the implication of a similar `and` or `or` to separate each of the previous paragraphs in the series.
 
 
 
On this construction of the provision, copyright protection for the design copyrights is not lost under s 74(3)(a) through the sale of the fabrics in Singapore.
 Information before the magistrate
Section 136(9) empowers a magistrate to issue search warrants to seize infringing copies of works or other matter in which copyright subsists by means of or in relation to which any offence under s 136(1), (2), (3) or (4) has been committed.
Section 136(1), (2), (3) and (4) create offences for different dealings with infringing material, eg making, hiring, selling, exhibiting, importing, and distributing. None of the offences are absolute offences. For each offence, a person dealing with infringing material is guilty only if he `knows, or ought reasonably to know` of the infringement.
I asked counsel whether the `knows, or ought reasonably to know` element is one for the prosecution to allege and prove, or whether it is a matter whose absence affords the defendant a defence. After reading their submissions, it appeared that this question has not been considered before.
A careful reading of s 136(1), (2), (3) and (4) where the words appear shows that for each offence, dealing with infringing material does not constitute an offence unless the person knows or ought reasonably to know that the material are infringing copies. Without this element, no offence is made out, and no defence is necessary.
This reflects more than a drafting preference. It means that a copyright owner cannot complain or prosecute under s 136 on the ground that someone is infringing his copyrights unless he can show that the other party knew or ought reasonably to know of the infringement. If he does not know if the other party knew or ought reasonably to know of the infringement, he can cure that by informing that party of it before taking action under the section.
Chua Soon Chye in his complaint said that: 
 
I verily believe that Lance Court is infringing s 136 of the Copyright Act by possessing, distributing, selling and/or importing fabrics bearing artwork which infringe Anju/Woodridge Inc`s copyright.
 
 
 
without saying whether Lance Court knew or ought reasonably to know of the infringements. That did not establish any offence under s 136(1), (2), (3) or (4) and did not justify the issuance of the search warrants under s 136(9). The search warrants issued must therefore be set aside on this ground.
 Other matters
Other complaints were made over the manner in which the warrants were issued, to which I now refer for the purpose of completeness.
(a) It was pointed out that the complainant asserted ownership to the copyrights in seven fabric designs, and complained of the infringements of five of those designs. Nothing was said about the infringement of the other two designs. I appreciate that there are situations where it is difficult to assert every infringement. This was the situation when pirated music tapes were rife, involving great numbers of tapes each containing a dozen or so musical works. In such situations, an applicant should state the known infringements and the basis for suspecting other infringements. If the magistrate is satisfied with the evidence, there is no reason why the warrant to be issued should not cover the suspected infringements as well. If, however, the applicant does not state or justify his suspicions, the warrant should be confined to the known infringed copyrights only. In this case, the search warrants should have been restricted to the five copyrights alleged to be infringed.
(b) Another complaint was that the original and alleged infringing designs were not shown to the magistrate. Two affidavits were deposed and filed by Chua Soon Chye and Stuart Ong confirming that fabric bearing the original designs, four of the alleged infringing designs as well as the certificates of registration of the copyrights were shown to the magistrate. I do not think that there should be a rigid rule that infringing copies must be produced. They should if it can be done, but production is not always possible or practical. A complainant may know of infringing copies, but may be unable to obtain them for production. The actual item involved may be difficult to produce, eg the hull of a yacht. In each case, it is for the applicant to satisfy the magistrate of the alleged infringement whether by producing the items or by other evidence.
(c) Objection was also taken that each warrant was issued to a raiding party consisting of police officers and other persons. Section 136(9) specifies that the warrant shall empower any police officer named in the warrant to execute it. I think that it would be unduly restrictive if only police officers be allowed to effect entry, search for and seize infringing material. The officers are vested with all those powers and are in charge of the operation, but they cannot be expected to do it without the assistance of the party who applied for the warrant. The applicant will have to deploy people who can identify the infringing material and arrange for the recording, packing and removal of the material, so that the operation can be carried out properly. The listing of the raiding party is useful as it enables the magistrate to set the number of persons he considers appropriate for the operation, and also serves as evidence as to who are authorized to take part in it.
(d) The scope of the warrants also came under criticism. The warrants authorized the seizure of not only the infringing fabrics, but also `documents relating to the infringement of Anju/Woodridge Inc`s copyright`. Section 136(9) empowers a magistrate to order the seizure of infringing copies of any matter in which copyright subsists and the plates and contrivances used or intended to be used in the making of such infringing copies but not documents. Documents may be seized if they are in themselves the copyright infringement, eg pirated copies of literary works. Documents evidencing infringement without forming part of the infringement, eg production, sale or stock records, do not come under the ambit of s 136(9) and should not be seizable under a warrant issued under that provision.

Cur Adv Vult
 
This case has to do with what is in law regarded as a legal entity with legal attributes under which rights are held and liabilities are owed. Such an entity is sometimes referred to as a legal person. It may be said that a person in law is any being or entity who or which in the eyes of the law is capable of enjoying rights or is subject to duties, both of which are enforceable at law. The paradigmatic example of a legal person is a natural person or a human being, though even in this obvious example this has not always been the case because in many ancient, and indeed not so ancient, legal systems, for instance, under Roman law at one time, slaves or foreigners were not recognized as having rights. Slaves were in law treated as property of other masters or objects of rights. Foreigners and their property were liable to be seized by a Roman citizen as though they were without owners. At the same time, in our legal system, companies incorporated under our Companies Act (Cap 50, 1994 Ed) and the many and varied corporations which are incorporated by a series of statutes, are recognized by law as legal persons with all the rights, liabilities and, sometimes, certain immunities.
While it is commonplace that such companies and statutory corporations are legal persons, societies registered under the Societies Act (Cap 311) are not incorporated and the extent of its legal personality has, for the first time, been questioned in this case. The question for determination in this case is whether a society registered under the Societies Act has a legal personality which is capable in law of being defamed. If it does not have the necessary legal attributes, this action must fail in limine. If it does, the action shall proceed to trial.
In my view, the answer to the question depends on a true and natural interpretation of the provisions of the Societies Act and also on a review of the English case law which had to grapple with the legal personality of associations such as trade unions and friendly societies. Such associations were and are registered under English statutes which have analogous, though not exactly similar, provisions nor analogous statutory framework as those of our Societies Act. The underlying principles of the law of status and of persons, however, are the same.
The legislative history of the Societies Act should be appreciated against the social matrix of Singapore in early 1889 and the indecisiveness of the then legislative council of the Straits Settlements. In spite of the existence of a large number of secret societies, 1,122 officers and 62,376 members enrolled in the registration book (see App 22 to Minutes of the Legislative Council of the Straits Settlements 1888, laid before the council on 12 December 1888), the passage of the first Societies Ordinance in 1889 met with strong and emotional opposition. Mr Shelford, in voting against the Bill, castigated it as a `despotic measure`. He was obviously a firm believer in the absolute freedom of association. The Ordinance had to be passed as one of the measures to suppress the unlawful activities of secret societies.
The 1889 Ordinance and the present Societies Act (Cap 311) provide that every society as defined which was not registered was unlawful. A society, though registered but was actually formed for an unlawful purpose, is still unlawful. The Societies Act has a number of provisions which regulate the constitutions of societies. For present purposes, I should set out in full the whole of s 35. It provides: 
 
The following provisions shall apply to all registered societies:
 
 
 
(a) the movable property of a society, if not vested in trustees, shall be deemed to be vested for the time being in the governing body of the society, and in all proceedings civil and criminal may be described as the property of the governing body of the society by their proper title;
(b) every such society may sue or be sued in the name in which it was registered under this Act; 
(c) a writ of summons or other legal process may be served on a society by serving it on an officer of the society, or by leaving it at, or sending it by registered post to, the registered address of the society; 
(d) except as otherwise provided in section 36, no judgment in any suit against a registered society shall be put into force against the person or property of any officer or member of the society but only against the property of the society; 
(e) any member who is in arrears of subscriptions which, according to the rules of the society, he is bound to pay, or who takes possession or detains any property of the society contrary to those rules, or who injures or destroys any property of the society, may be sued for the arrears or for the damage accruing from his wrongful possession, detention, injury or destruction of that property by and in the name of the society; 
(f) any member of the society who steals, purloins or embezzles any money or other property, or wilfully and maliciously destroys or injures any property of the society, or forges any deed, bond, security for money, receipt or other instrument whereby the funds of the society may be exposed to loss, shall be subject to the same prosecution, and, if convicted, shall be liable to be punished in like manner as any person, not a member, would be subject and liable to in respect of the like offence; 
(g) in the absence of any specific provision in the rules of a society any number not less than three-fifths of the members for the time being resident in Singapore of the society may determine that it shall be dissolved forthwith, or at a time agreed upon, and all necessary steps shall be taken for the disposal and settlement of the property of the society and its claims and liabilities according to the rules of the society applicable thereto, and if none, then as the governing body finds expedient: 
Provided that in the event of any dispute arising among the members of the governing body or the members of the society, the adjustment of its affairs shall be referred to the High Court, and the Court shall make such order in the matter as it thinks fit; 
(h) no society shall be dissolved unless three-fifths of the members so resident as aforesaid have expressed a wish for such dissolution by their votes delivered in person or by proxy at a general meeting convened for the purpose.
 
 
 
It is not necessary to discuss each paragraph. Section 35(d) in terms protects the members and officers of a registered society. It says that a judgment against a society shall be enforced against the property of the society, and not that of its members or officers. It reiterates the common law rule that a member of an unincorporated association, in the absence of the rules to the contrary, is under no liability to pay anything to the association or any other person beyond his annual subscription: .
In my judgment, and having regard to the analyses of case law later in this judgment, it is of the utmost importance in this case to keep our eyes on the provisions of s 35(b). In my opinion, its presence in the Societies Act confers on registered societies sufficient juridical significance and personification such that they have a good name and reputation as a legal entity and is entitled to the protection of the law of defamation no less than a natural person or legal entity.
In the course of arguments I was told, and as far as I am aware, the issue before me was never raised. It was not even mentioned in the well-known case of . Chua J was, in my respectful view, unquestionably right when he expressed the view that the Societies Act did not create a body corporate. But the defendant in that case never put in issue whether a registered society had the `quasi-corporate` personality or legal personality so as to have a reputation to protect and to sue for any defamation against it. In the only other relevant local case of , the club, at the sole initiative of its chairman, filed an originating summons seeking a declaration that the defendants were deemed to have automatically retired from being officers and/or general committee members, delivery up of the club`s books and an injunction. It failed. The main issue was whether the club, which was registered under the Societies Act, could be the plaintiff and sue the defendants. At p 283, Chua J stated thus: 
 
An unincorporated member club, not being a partnership or legal entity, cannot sue or be sued in the club name (see 
[1916] 2 AC 15
). The Karting Club of Singapore is unincorporated and consequently cannot be made a plaintiff to this action.
 
 
 
Counsel for the club, P Suppiah, failed to draw the court`s attention to the express provisions under s 35(b) of the Societies Act and it was conceded before me that for that reason the defendants in the present case could not rely on it.
Under English trade union laws and the Friendly Societies Act, there are provisions for such registered associations to sue and be sued. The prevailing opinion before was that the effect of these provisions seemed to be to make these associations legal entities distinct from their members. Much earlier and in , the House of Lords construed the relevant trade union laws and inferred that a trade union could be sued in tort in its name. Lord Halsbury stated, as recorded at p 436: 
 
If the legislature has created a thing which can own property, which can employ servants, and which can inflict injury, 
 it must be taken, I think, to have impliedly given the power to make it suitable in a court of law for injuries purposely done by its authority and procurement
 .
 
 
 
In the end, a proper analysis of English case law must mark it off from the construction of what is a local statute; they are of little assistance except to show the approach of the courts as a matter of construction and inference.
In the result, the defendants` appeals against the senior assistant registrar`s decisions are dismissed with costs.

The appellant was tried and convicted for having imported into Singapore on 12 August 1993 a quantity of not less than 3,185.2g of diamorphine contrary to s 7 and punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185). We heard her appeal against conviction and dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
 The facts
The appellant arrived at Changi Airport on Cathay Pacific flight CX 713 from Bangkok at about 2.45pm on 12 August 1993. At about 3.25pm, the appellant was stopped by HCO Kessler (Kessler) in the west wing of the arrival hall of Changi Airport, Terminal 1, while she was walking towards the `Exit` gate. Kessler, who was on duty at the customs counter at the Red Customs Channel, asked the appellant to approach his counter. At that time, the appellant was carrying a brown leather luggage bag and had a black sling handbag hung over her shoulder. Kessler indicated to the appellant to place the bag on the counter and told her in English to open it. The appellant was asked whether she had any cigarettes or liquor to declare and she answered in the negative. The appellant then opened the main zip, side zip, and the two side pockets of the bag. Kessler put both his hands into the bag and he felt bulges on both sides and at the base of the bag. He told the appellant to close the bag and requested for her passport.
Kessler, together with Customs Officer Md Nasir bin Md Tahir, brought the appellant to the Customs Duty Office. At the Customs Duty Office, in the presence of the appellant and Superintendent of Customs Chew Tee Mui (Chew), Kessler conducted a thorough examination of the leather bag. Having removed the contents from the bag, Kessler used a penknife and made a slit, of about an inch long, on the inside-lining of the bag. Some white substance spilled out. According to Kessler, the appellant appeared calm and said nothing at all. Kessler replaced the contents back into the bag.
The appellant was then taken to the customs general office. In an adjacent room, a body search was conducted on her by Woman Customs Officer Chang Yeow Kum (Chang) in the presence of the Deputy Officer-in-Charge Yap Kwee Hong, but nothing incriminating was found. The appellant was brought back to the general office.
A party of Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers led by Woman Inspector Chong Wee Kee (Chong) arrived at the customs general office at about 6.10pm. Chong was briefed by Chang on the case and the appellant`s belongings were handed over to Chong. Three packets of drugs were found concealed in the brown leather bag; one in each side and one at the base of the bag. US$1,900 in cash, a cancelled US $100 note and two Nigerian currency notes were among the contents in the appellant`s bags. At about 7.48pm, at the customs general office, Chong weighed the three packets of drugs in the presence of the appellant. The weight of one packet marked `CA-1A` was found to be 1,567g; another marked `CA-1B` weighed 1,576g; and the third marked `CA-1C` weighed 1,133g. The total gross weight of the three packets was 4,205g. All three exhibits was later sent to the Department of Scientific Services for analysis. They were found to contain not less than 1,164g, 1,177g and 844.2g of diamorphine respectively. The total weight of the diamorphine in the three exhibits was 3,185.2g.
At CNB Headquarters, at 11.35pm, a statement was recorded from the appellant pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Although the voluntariness of the statement was not disputed it was not admitted as part of the prosecution`s evidence. After the recording of the statement, Chong asked the appellant to try on the items of clothing found in the leather bag. According to Chong, all except one piece, a long-sleeved shirt which was too big, fitted her.
In the trial, a submission of `no case to answer` was not made by defence counsel at the close of the prosecution case. As the presumptions under s 18 of the Misuse of Drugs Act was operative, the learned trial judge proceeded to find that there was a prima facie case against the appellant on the charge proffered and called for her defence.
 The defence of the appellant
At the trial, the appellant gave evidence in her defence. In so far as material, it was as follows. The appellant is a Thai national, 32 years old, and a divorcee with two children in Bangkok. She had formal education up to the equivalent of secondary three but spoke little English. The appellant`s defence was that she did not know that the leather bag which she carried had anything concealed in it.
About 20 days before coming into Singapore, the appellant started working in a Bangkok guest house which was mostly patronized by Africans. Prior to that, she was working as a receptionist at `Intown Hotel` in Bangkok. At about the end of 1992, she met a male African known as `Sunny` at the hotel. The appellant did not know Sunny`s nationality but she believed he could be Nigerian. At that time, she considered Sunny as no more than a casual acquaintance.
The appellant did not see Sunny at the hotel from about March 1993. However, on 6 August 1993, she met him by chance at Pata Shopping Centre in Bangkok. Sunny invited her for coffee. She said that she spoke to Sunny in Thai and English and also communicated with some gesticulations. During the conversation, he asked her if she had a passport. The appellant replied that she did have one. She had a passport because she wanted to work in Japan. She had previously worked in Japan and had travelled on another passport. Under cross-examination, the appellant admitted she had worked as a prostitute there. The appellant was asked by Sunny if she could deliver a bag containing some clothes to his friend in Singapore and whilst in Singapore, she was to buy several items for Sunny. These items were a Nikon or Canon camera with zoom lens, a Panasonic telephone with recording facilities and a perfume called `Eternity`. Sunny told her that the items would not cost more than US$1,000 but he would give her US$2,000 in cash. The appellant asked him why he did not go to Singapore himself and Sunny replied that he was busy with his clothing export business. Sunny told the appellant that the items which he wanted her to buy were cheaper in Singapore.
Sunny also told her that he would pay all her expenses and this would come from the US$2,000 paid to her. She could keep the balance of the US$2,000 cash which was not used. Upon hearing this, she told Sunny that she would consider his proposal but needed time as one of her sons was ill then. They arranged to meet on 9 August 1993 at 10 am at the same place and the appellant would give her answer then. On 9 August 1993, she met Sunny as arranged and informed him that she accepted his proposal. When asked in cross-examination why she agreed, the appellant said that she stood to make about 5,000 to 6,000 bahts from the trip, some of which she wanted to use to pay her son`s medical treatment and some she wanted to send to her mother who was looking after her nephews and nieces. According to her, the rate of exchange was at that time, US$1 to 25 bahts. She said that she was also doing it as a personal favour to Sunny and because she had always dreamed of visiting Singapore. Sunny gave her US$400 to purchase a return air ticket and instructed her to take the early morning flight on 12 August 1993. She also borrowed US$100 from him because her son was sick. At this meeting, she asked Sunny for his contact number but he told her that he was moving about and it was not convenient to contact him. She, however, gave Sunny her contact number, which was her telephone number at her work place.
On the next day, the appellant changed the US dollars into bahts for the purchase of the air ticket. On the morning of 11 August 1993, the appellant bought the air ticket for 6,800 bahts. She went to see her ex-husband to give him about 1,200 bahts for her son`s medical fees and gave her younger son 200 baht. The appellant also used some of the money left over to buy some clothes and a pair of shoes. At noon, Sunny called and she informed him that she had purchased the air ticket but for a later morning flight on 12 August. Sunny told her to check into Prince Hotel as it was more convenient for her to go from there to the airport as her home was far away and also because it was near to the guest house where she was working. The appellant agreed.
At 3.30pm, on the same day, the appellant checked into the Prince Hotel and after doing so, went back to work. The hotel room charges were paid out of the balance of the US$400. She returned to Prince Hotel at about 1am with her clothes packed in a paper bag. Sunny called her at the hotel room at 2am and told her to take only one bag to Singapore and not to bring her own bag as it was too troublesome to travel with two bags. When Sunny was asked about the bag of clothing which the appellant was to give to his friend, he told her that he was busy and would bring the bag over at 4am. During cross-examination, the appellant said she did not feel that anything was amiss when Sunny told her not to bring her own bag as she was `very curious to go to Singapore.`
Sunny arrived at 4am with a leather bag together with another African man, whom the appellant had not met before. The African man was carrying a paper bag of clothes. Sunny placed the leather bag on the floor and unzipped it. The appellant noticed that the bag was empty. She sat on the bed as Sunny packed the leather bag with the clothes from the paper bag. She did not notice whether the clothes were old or new. He then placed the appellant`s clothing which were on a table into the leather bag. After putting the clothes into the bag, Sunny gave her US$2,000 in cash. The appellant returned to Sunny US$100 which she had earlier borrowed, from the US$2,000.
Sunny told her that on her arrival in Singapore she was to take a taxi to Orchard Road and to check into a hotel there which was not too expensive. He suggested the names of two hotels, one of which was the Mandarin Hotel. The accused said that as she was familiar with the name `Mandarin Hotel`, there being one with the same name in Bangkok, she decided that she would stay at the Mandarin Hotel. She did not know if the rates at Mandarin Hotel were expensive. She was unable to recall the name of the other hotel. Sunny wrote the words `Orchid (sic) Road` on a business card. The appellant wrote on the same card, 
 `Thanon` 
 which meant Orchard Road in Thai. This was to assist her when it came for her to take a taxi in Singapore. The name, `Mandarin Hotel`, was not written as she knew the name. Sunny also wrote the name of the perfume he wanted her to buy on the same card. This name card was found among the appellant`s belongings and tendered as an exhibit at the trial.
Sunny told her that his friend in Singapore would go to the hotel and meet her to collect the bag. Sunny did not give her the name or even a description of his friend. Sunny then asked her when she was returning to Bangkok. The appellant replied that she would stay in Singapore for two days. Sunny asked her why she did not want to stay on as the money would be enough for her to extend her stay and if she wanted, she could ask his friend in Singapore to postpone the flight. The appellant told him that she could not stay too long as her child was ill. Sunny then told her that he would contact her at the guest house when she returned from Singapore to collect his items.
Sunny and his friend left her hotel room at 5am. The appellant slept for two hours before leaving for the airport at about 8am. Her flight to Singapore was at 11.45am. She did not examine the bag at all. She admitted that she had carried the bag and thought that it was heavy. However, she attributed the weight to the fact that it was a leather bag. She had never had a leather bag before. The bag was not locked when it was checked in by the appellant at Bangkok Airport.
Upon arrival in Singapore, when she came to the immigration counter, she was asked for her disembarkation card which she had not filled in yet as it was in English. She asked others for help and eventually managed to complete it. She knew how to write her date of birth and name in English. After proceeding through immigration and after collecting the bag from the collection belt, the appellant did not know what to do next. She looked for the exit. She then saw a passenger carrying a bag, walking towards the red channel for his bag to be checked at the counter there. She followed along to the counter and intended to hand her bag over for it to be checked. At the counter, the officer told her something in English and when she heard the word `check`, she placed the bag on the counter. The officer indicated he wanted to cut the security strap and the appellant agreed. She was told to open the bag and she unzipped it for the officer to check. After checking the bags, the officer gestured to her to follow him to an office. At that time, she didn`t think anything was wrong.
In the office, the officer slit open the bag with a penknife. The appellant saw some white powdery substance spilling out. The officer said, `You see powder` and she replied, `OK, powder.` At that time, she thought it was something like `face powder`. She was surprised to see the powder coming out of the lining; she said she did not show her surprise in any way and merely looked at it. She heard officers discussing amongst themselves and using the word `drug` several times. At that time, she did not know the meaning of the word `drug` and therefore did not realise the gravity of the situation. The first time she realized the powder was drugs was when a male Thai spoke to her and questioned her about the `heroin` for about five minutes. She was shocked. She explained to him that she was asked by Sunny to bring the bag and told him she did not know there were drugs in the bag. Subsequently, she came to know that the Thai was the Director-General of Excise in Thailand who was, at that time, awaiting a flight back to Bangkok.
During her examination-in-chief, the appellant`s cautioned statement was adduced in evidence. The statement was this: 
 
Some time last week, a black African man whom I believe to be a Nigerian came to me and asked me whether I have a passport. After telling him that I have a passport, he asked me whether I can bring a bag to his friend in Singapore. He told me he will pay me 50,000 baht (Thai currency). He will also buy an air ticket for me. It is a return ticket. I told him I will think about it first because I have never been to Singapore before. I told him that I will give him the reply on 9 August 1993, on Monday. On 9 August 1993, the same Nigerian man came to me and gave me US$400 cash. He asked me to buy an air ticket for the morning flight for Thursday, 12 August 1993, to Singapore. On Tuesday, 10 August 1993, I went to book an air ticket for the morning flight on the 12 August 1993 to Singapore. But it was fully booked for the morning flight. They would try to get me a seat and they asked me to call them back at 4.30pm. I tried but could not get through as the telephone lines were busy. The next day at about 10am on Wednesday, I was told by the agency that they could only manage to get a seat on Cathay Pacific on Thursday, 12 August 1993, at 11.45am for me. I agreed. On Wednesday also, the same Nigerian came to me between 12pm to 2pm to find out about the ticket. After he found that I have bought my ticket, he told me to check in at Prince Hotel in Bangkok and he will go and look for me there. After I have checked into room No 246, I came back to the hotel again at about 1am to sleep. About 2am, the Nigerian man telephoned me in the hotel room. He told me that he will come at about 4am. At about 4.10am or 4.15am, he came to my room, carrying a bag with him. There was another black man with him carrying a paper bag of clothes. When both men were inside my room, the first black Nigerian man, whom I know to be called `Sunny`, put the clothes into the bag. He then left it on the floor in my room. `Sunny` then told me that when I reached Singapore, I was to get a taxi to a hotel in Orchard Road which is not too expensive. I asked him who I should hand the bag to. He told me not to worry and that someone will look for me in the hotel. That is all.
 
 
 
 
 Decision of the High Court
 
The learned trial judge found that the only issue in the case was whether the appellant had, on a balance of probabilities, rebutted the presumption of knowledge under s 18 that operated against her and referred to the oft-quoted judgment in in which the Court of Criminal Appeal cited, with approval, the dicta of Lord Wilberforce and Lord Pearce`s definition of `possession` in .
After observing her demeanour in giving evidence, the learned trial judge found that the appellant was not a naive or ignorant person and agreed with the prosecution that: 
 
... she was a street-smart person, a survivor in city life, having lived and worked in Bangkok since about the age of 12. Over the years she had been engaged in various kinds of jobs. She has even been to Tokyo where she worked as a prostitute.
 
 
 
The learned trial judge was not satisfied that the appellant had, at any time, denied knowledge of the drugs when they were discovered. He noted that the alleged conversation with the Director-General of Excise in Thailand was never properly proved. He held that even if the appellant had told him that she did not know that there was heroin in the bag, `having regard to the prosecution evidence, which I accepted, that she at all times remained silent, nothing turns on her denial.`
On reviewing the evidence, the learned trial judge found several incredible aspects of the evidence of the appellant as to her purpose in coming to Singapore. The learned trial judge disbelieved the appellant`s evidence that she did not know that there were drugs hidden in the leather bag and concluded that the appellant had not, on a balance of probabilities, rebutted the operative presumptions. He was satisfied that the prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt and accordingly convicted her.
 The appeal
It was submitted before us that in all the circumstances, the learned trial judge had failed to sufficiently consider the appellant`s evidence, which was consistent with her cautioned statement and showed that she had no reason to suspect that the brown leather bag contained drugs.
Counsel for the appellant produced the brown leather bag exhibit and attempted to argue that the appellant could not have known that drugs were concealed in the lining of the bag. He drew attention to the undisputed fact that the appellant herself had unzipped the bag when first stopped by Kessler. He contended that the demeanour of the appellant at the airport was not considered by the learned trial judge and which he submitted was consistent with that of an innocent bailee. He relied on the evidence that the appellant had appeared calm and did not act suspiciously. He claimed that the reason why there was no evidence of the appellant protesting her innocence when detained by the customs officers was because none of them attempted to speak to her. It was only when she spoke to the Thai Customs Director-General that she first realised the gravity of the situation and it was also then that she told someone that she did not know there was heroin concealed in there.
All this being said, we were in agreement with the learned trial judge that nothing turned upon the appellant`s alleged denial. The learned trial judge accepted the prosecution evidence that the appellant did not at any time say that she did not know what was concealed in the bag. The prosecution evidence to this effect was clear and there was no basis to interfere. The appellant`s version was that she only became aware that the `white powder` was heroin when the Thai Director-General of Customs spoke to her. The learned judge had rightly observed that this conversation was never properly proved. Even if it was, the fact remained that when the drugs were first discovered in the lining, the appellant did not react in a manner which showed that she did not know something was concealed in it.
It was also contended that the learned trial judge had failed to consider the appellant`s cautioned statement at all, which counsel for the appellant submitted, corroborated her evidence at the trial. Counsel referred to the decisions of this court in and which confirmed the rule that a trial judge must, as a decider of fact, consider the whole of a statement, both inculpatory and exculpatory, after the defence is presented to decide where the truth lies. It was submitted that the learned trial judge had not given due weight to the cautioned statement in reaching his findings.
We were unable to accept counsel`s submission. It seemed to us that the sole basis upon which this contention was made was on the fact that the learned trial judge did not make any direct reference to the cautioned statement with respect to his findings in his grounds of judgment. We were satisfied that the learned trial judge had carefully considered and weighed the cautioned statement in the course of reaching his decision.
Having perused the record, we also agreed with the learned trial judge that there were many aspects of her evidence which were incredible and had cast doubt upon the authenticity of her account of the events which led to her trip to Singapore. In his grounds of judgment, the learned trial judge felt that he only needed to make reference to one such aspect. This was the part of the evidence with respect to whether Sunny knew the full name of the appellant and if not, that it was impossible for the bag to be delivered to Sunny`s friend. This was challenged by the appellant. The learned trial judge`s finding was this: 
 
The accused did not know the real name of the African who was only known to her as `Sunny`. As she also did not have his address or telephone number, she would not be able to contact Sunny when she returned to Thailand. 
 What is more important, Sunny did not know the real name of the accused.
 The accused said that Sunny knew her only as `Noi`. Therefore, the alleged friend of Sunny would never be able to get in touch with her to collect the bag from her in the Mandarin Hotel where she was going to stay because the accused would be registered in the hotel in her name stated in her passport and not as `Noi`. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Before us, counsel referred to the appellant`s evidence that Sunny had asked to look at her air-ticket and that she had shown it to him. He contended that this could show that Sunny had seen the appellant`s real name which was printed on the ticket. He also referred to the evidence that Sunny had phoned the appellant at the Prince Hotel and contended that he would not have been able to do so without knowing her real name.
In our judgment, the learned trial judge was fully justified in coming to that conclusion. The appellant`s evidence was clearly that Sunny knew her by her nickname `Noi` and that she had never told Sunny her full name. However, it was also her evidence that she did not know whether he knew it or not. This being so, we considered an aspect of her evidence which was clearly related. This was the question as to how Sunny`s friend was to contact the appellant in Singapore. The appellant admitted that she did not know how save for the fact that Sunny had told her that his friend would come and look for her at the hotel. She said that she would have given the bag to anyone who came to her and introduced himself as Sunny`s friend. In her evidence, the appellant had also admitted that Sunny did not provide her with any description of his `friend`. It was indeed illogical for the appellant to agree to deliver a bag to an unknown stranger in a foreign country when the intended recipient was unknown to her and the appellant herself did not know if Sunny`s friend knew her full name. It was therefore not unreasonable for the learned trial judge to have concluded that Sunny would not have known the full name of the appellant.
Much of the evidence of the appellant on the whole, was inexplicable. It was her evidence that Sunny was a mere casual acquaintance whom she first met at the end of 1992. She had intermittently met Sunny at the Intown Hotel until March 1993. The appellant did not meet him again until by chance in a shopping centre some six days before coming into Singapore. It was the appellant`s evidence that she did not suspect anything was amiss with respect to the proposal by Sunny to deliver a bag of clothing to someone in Singapore. In light of the learned trial judge`s finding that she was not naive or ignorant, the circumstances of that meeting would have been suspicious as it was strange for a proposal to have been made to a mere acquaintance to deliver a bag of clothing to Singapore. It was also her evidence that she did not know Sunny`s real name and that she did not know how to contact him in Bangkok but left it to him to contact her at the guest house. Sunny did not know where she lived. She did not know to whom the bag of clothing was to be delivered; no name was given nor was a description of the appearance or even the sex of the recipient was provided. `Sunny`s friend` was to come to the appellant`s hotel in Singapore and identify himself as `Sunny`s friend`. The appellant had testified that she would have given the bag to anyone who asked for it and had identified himself as such. There is also uncertainty in the evidence as to where the appellant was to stay in Singapore and whether Sunny knew this for a fact. It was her evidence that she wanted to stay at the Mandarin Hotel because she was familiar with the name. This was one of the two suggestions of Sunny, who had instructed her to stay in an inexpensive hotel in Orchard Road.
There was evidence at the trial that the total weight of the leather bag when checked-in at Bangkok Airport was 11kg. This was ascertained from the baggage check tag. Even though the visible contents of the bag were only items of clothing, a pair of shoes and toiletries, the appellant maintained that she thought that the heavy weight was due to the fact that it was a leather bag. Although she saw Sunny packing in the clothes meant for his friend, she could not say whether they were old or new.
In the circumstances, there were more than substantial grounds to reject the appellant`s evidence as incredible. The learned trial judge had clearly and carefully considered the evidence before him in coming to his conclusion that the appellant was not an innocent carrier without knowledge of the drugs concealed in the bag. The appeal had no merit and accordingly, we dismissed it and confirmed the sentence of death passed by the learned trial judge on the appellant.

The appellant was charged with the murder of one Tan Hui Ngin (the deceased), whose decomposed body was found at a disused egg hatchery at 74P Ponggol Road, Track 13 on 16 October 1990. He was convicted by the High Court and sentenced to suffer death. He appealed against his conviction. We heard the appeal, and at the conclusion of the hearing, we dismissed it. We now give our reasons.
 The prosecution case
The appellant and the deceased were friends since childhood and their families knew each other as they had been neighbours for many years.
At about 1.10pm on 12 October 1990, the deceased (who lived with her family at 54-C Track 13, Ponggol) went to her brother-in-law`s flat in Hougang to help with the domestic chores. She left her brother-in-law`s flat at around 6.30pm. The evidence was that the deceased usually took a bus home after helping out at her brother-in-law`s flat. The proprietress of a provision shop along Ponggol Road (who knew the deceased as a regular customer) testified that on that day she saw the deceased buying bread at a shop next door at around 6pm. She then saw the deceased walking towards the bus stop along Ponggol Road.
By 7.10pm the deceased had not arrived home. Her mother, who was expecting her, became anxious and walked towards the junction of Track 13 and Ponggol Road to wait for her. As she passed a side track (which led to the disused egg hatchery at which the body of the deceased was later found) she heard the sound of a motorcycle and saw a motorcycle turning into Track 13 from the side track. The appellant was riding the motorcycle and he greeted the deceased`s mother as he rode past her. The deceased never returned home that day.
Four days later, on 16 October 1990, the decomposed body of the deceased was discovered at the disused egg hatchery at Track 13, near where the deceased lived. When found, her body was naked except for a long-sleeved T-shirt which had been rolled up to her shoulders. Her right hand was clutching a plastic bag, and her legs were spread wide apart with hip and knee joints slightly flexed. Dr Clarence Tan, the forensic pathologist, went to the scene and examined the body. On 18 October 1990, he performed the autopsy. He found that she had suffered 11 injuries to her head of which two were fatal. Death would have ensued within 20-30 minutes after the first fatal blow was struck. The two fatal injuries were referred in evidence as injuries Nos 1 and 7. Injury No 1 was a comminuted severely depressed fracture corresponding with an area on the right side of the head and it extended over the region of the right eye. It was more likely caused by a brick but possibly with a stick. The amount of force required to cause injury No 1 was severe and, when the deceased was struck, she was probably in a position in which she could not move her head away on impact. If caused by a stick, severe force and repeated blows would have been required to cause the injury. Injury No 7 was a severely depressed oval flattening fracture at the back and left side of the head. Dr Tan`s opinion was that the injury could have been caused by either a brick or a stick. He said that it was not possible to cause this injury while the deceased was supine but it could be caused while she struggled and this part of her head was open to attack.
Dr Tan found no defence-type injuries sustained by the deceased and that no natural disease was present that could have caused or contributed to the death. His evidence was that the deceased had suffered injury to the external genitalia which could have happened within 24 hours before death. He found bruising at two places of the deceased`s vagina. He was of the opinion that sexual interference which could range from molestation to penetration with ejaculation could have taken place. It was not possible to determine the extent of the sexual interference because of the stage of decomposition, but he expressed the opinion that any sexual interference was likely to have taken place after the violence but before death as the deceased was found in an `abducted` position such that her external genitalia was made maximally accessible.
Meanwhile, on the morning of 13 October 1990, the appellant left Singapore with his wife to go and stay with her family in Muar, Malaysia. The next evening, the appellant sent his cousin-in-law to Singapore to hand over to his mother his wife`s ATM card, POSB book, the PIN number and the keys to his flat. The appellant telephoned his mother and told her to withdraw all the moneys in the bank account, convert it into Malaysian currency and hand it to his cousin-in-law who would bring it to him in Muar. He also asked his mother to find out how the deceased was as he had quarrelled with her. After the newspapers reported the deceased`s death, his mother went to meet him in Muar and told him of the news.
Later, the appellant and his wife moved from place to place in Johor until he was arrested in Batu Pahat on 20 March 1991 by the Malaysian police who handed him over to the police in Singapore. After his arrest, the appellant led the police to the place where he had hidden the belongings of the deceased which he had taken from her on the day of the attack.
 The appellant`s statements to the police
In his statements to the police, the appellant admitted attacking the deceased but claimed that he did not intend to kill her. His version of the incident was as follows. The appellant and the deceased had gone to the egg hatchery to discuss the repayment of a loan which he had made to her. When the deceased refused to repay the loan, a quarrel erupted which led to the appellant slapping and then forcibly undressing the deceased. The appellant then started to walk away with the clothes of the deceased when she threw a brick at him which hit him on the back. He became angry and threw the brick back at her. The deceased managed to catch the brick thrown at her but she lost her balance and fell backwards. The deceased then tried to get up and at the same time she tried to grab hold of something. On seeing this, the appellant immediately grabbed a piece of wood, rushed up to the deceased (who was in a sitting position) and hit her on the top of the head with it. He then pushed her down, so that she was lying supine. The deceased tried to get up by pulling on the front of the shirt of the appellant, but he pressed her down and hit her repeatedly on her head. When he stopped hitting her, he saw that there was blood oozing from her head and that her face was covered with blood. The sight of the blood frightened him and so he covered her face with the seat of a chair. He then took her clothes and fled on his motorcycle.
 The evidence of the appellant`s wife
The prosecution called the appellant`s wife as a witness. Counsel for the appellant objected to her giving testimony on the ground that communication between spouses was privileged under s 124 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) (the Act). The trial judge heard arguments on this point and found that ss 124 and 134(5) were in apparent conflict and ruled that s 134(5) superseded s 124 once the spouse of an accused took the stand to give evidence in criminal proceedings. In his opinion, s 134(5) being a later enactment, it must mean that Parliament intended to modify s 124 in so far as criminal proceedings were concerned.
The trial judge therefore permitted the wife to be called to give evidence. She testified that on the evening in question the appellant went to fetch her at her place of work, after which they went to buy dinner. Upon arriving home, she ate her dinner but the appellant was unable to touch his food. She noticed at this time that there was blood on his toes. He was unable to sleep that night; in the early hours of the morning when she awoke he was not asleep. He told her that he had to escape from loan sharks and suggested that they should leave for Johor Bahru. She agreed. They went to stay with her family at Muar and then at several other parts of Johor. Whilst in Parit Sulong, the appellant confessed to her that he had killed the deceased. He gave the deceased a lift and took her to the hatchery where he asked her for money. When she refused to give him any he threatened to kidnap her. She in turn threatened to report him to the police. He was frightened and hit her with a stick and then later with a big stone. He then placed a chair over her head and left.
 The evidence of the appellant at the trial
At the trial, the appellant`s account of events in the hatchery was substantially the same as the account he gave in his statements to the police. He said that after the deceased threw a brick at him, he threw it back at her causing her to fall. He then hit her on the head twice with a stick and forced her to the ground after which he sat on her abdomen and hit her repeatedly with the stick. The appellant said that he could not remember the details clearly because the situation was confusing and chaotic, but that in the course of hitting her, he saw that the right side of her face was bleeding and he thought that he had blinded her right eye. The assault with the stick lasted `10-15 minutes`. The appellant also said that he never intended to kill the deceased. He was angry with her because she refused to repay the money which she owed him and which she knew he intended to use for his wedding. The appellant`s wedding had already been postponed once due to a lack of funds, causing much embarrassment to him. He also explained that he had undressed the deceased because he wanted to make her go home naked and thus force her to tell her mother the truth, which was that she refused to repay the money which she owed to him.
 Decision below
The first question considered by the trial judge was whether the appellant inflicted one or both the fatal injuries on the deceased. The trial judge found that both the fatal injuries were inflicted by the appellant. He said: 
 
The question was whether the accused inflicted one or both the fatal blows on the deceased as charged. I was sure he inflicted both of them that evening on 12 October 1990 at the hatchery. He assaulted her with the stick which he had thrown away and which he failed to identify to the investigating officer. That also accounted for the weapon used to cause the many other external injuries not connected with the two fatal injuries. He then either continued to use the stick or the brick produced in court and inflicted the two fatal blows. It was either one or the other of the two weapons. It did not matter which, as either of them could cause the fatal blows according to Dr Clarence Tan. As will be recalled, if the brick was used, it was used with great force and the head had to be static, as it were, in view of the severity of the fractures. If it was the stick, it had to be used to strike the sites with great force several times.
 
 
 
Although the trial judge was prepared to accept the evidence of the appellant`s wife as to the manner the appellant had killed the deceased, he found it unnecessary to rely on her evidence at all. He was satisfied on the other evidence before him that the appellant inflicted the two fatal blows on the deceased.
Next, the trial judge considered the argument raised by the defence that there was a reasonable doubt as to whether the death of the deceased was caused by the appellant alone, because of the following:
 
 
(1) the evidence of blood stains, found on the wall near where the body of the deceased was, which did not match the blood group of either the deceased or the accused; 
 
(2) the evidence of the accused that the chair which he had used to cover the face of the deceased was found to be in a different position when the body of the deceased was recovered, and 
 
(3) the blood stain on the brick at the scene of the crime and the evidence of the appellant that he had never used a brick to hit the deceased.
  
 
 
The trial judge held that the third party`s blood stains found on the wall did not raise any doubt in his mind. He considered the scenario of another person coincidentally coming upon the deceased while she was still alive and then striking her with the two fatal blows as too far-fetched in the light of the evidence. He held that if the deceased was alive and screaming when the appellant left the scene as alleged by the appellant, the most natural thing for her to do was to remove the chair, hide her nakedness and regain her dignity. That would have meant that she would have moved from the position at which she was attacked and pinned down by the appellant. But on the evidence of the appellant, the deceased had not moved or had not been moved from where she was when he left her. The trial judge found that the appellant was lying on those parts of his evidence which suggested that the deceased was alive, kicking and screaming at the time when he left her; such evidence struck him as contrived and put on. The trial judge said thus: 
 
... I was convinced that the accused was lying on those parts of his evidence which suggested that she was alive, kicking and screaming. For instance, the accused`s detection of the change in the position of the chair when he examined the photographs and took time in the witness`s box to appear to dig deep into his memory came through to me as contrived and put on. I observed him and was convinced that he was putting on an act. These embellishments were fabricated by him in an attempt to build up some case based on the discovery of the presence of a third party human blood in the vicinity of the scene.
 
 
 
The trial judge then referred to the evidence given by the appellant`s wife and accepted her evidence. He found that what she had told the court was the truth. The trial judge said: 
 
... he confessed to his wife that he killed (
 Pak Si
) the deceased and that he had demanded money from and threatened to kidnap her. He told her that he killed the deceased because she threatened to tell the mother to report to the police. He also told the wife that he first used the stick and then a stone (ie the brick). The wife at last came through and cast aside her blind loyalty to her husband. In the witness box she was telling the whole truth and nothing but the truth.
 
 
 
The trial judge then went on to consider the defences that could be available to the appellant. First, there was the possible defence of grave and sudden provocation. The trial judge did not believe the appellant`s evidence that he had made the two loans to the deceased as alleged. The trial judge found that the appellant was not at all deprived of the power of self-control by any grave and sudden provocation of the deceased and that in fact he was the one who demanded the moneys from the deceased and fatally assaulted her when she refused and threatened to tell her mother to report to the police. Next, the trial judge considered the defence of sudden fight and opined that this defence was unsustainable as he found that the appellant inflicted the two fatal blows deliberately and intentionally with great force on the deceased`s head. In any event, he held that the appellant had taken undue advantage of the deceased and had acted in a cruel and unusual manner.
Finally, the trial judge considered the defence of diminished responsibility and the evidence of the two psychiatrists, namely, Dr Wong Yip Chong, called by the defence, and Dr Ang Ah Ling, called by the prosecution. He reviewed their evidence in some detail and accepted the evidence of Dr Ang Ah Ling. He held as follows: 
 
I accepted Dr Ang`s analysis. I agreed with him that the conclusion must be that there was no sudden and uncontrollable explosion of rage on the part of the accused. What had taken place on the court`s finding of the facts and their sequence, so far as they coincided with the narrative of the accused on the sequence of events, made it clear that what took place was an evolution of events. To me, after considering all the evidence, I was sure that every step of the accused at the hatchery was deliberate and controlled: there was no loss of control on his part. I accordingly rejected the defence of diminished responsibility.
 
 
 
 
 The appeal
 
Before us, counsel for the appellant did not canvass any of the three defences considered but rejected by the trial judge. He raised only two grounds of appeal. First, it was contended that there was a reasonable doubt that the death of the deceased was caused by the appellant by reason of likelihood of an involvement of a third party who might have caused or contributed to the death of the deceased. Specifically, it was argued that after the appellant had attacked the deceased, an unknown third party might have come on to the scene, attacked her and caused her death. In support, counsel relied on the following:
 
 
(1) the presence of blood splattered on the wall near the deceased which did not match the blood group of either the deceased or the appellant; 
 
(2) the blood stain on the brick found near the deceased and the evidence of the appellant that he did not use a brick at all to hit the deceased; and 
 
(3) the evidence that the chair which the appellant had used to cover the face of the deceased was found in a different position when the body of the deceased was discovered.
  
 
 
Counsel also relied on the evidence that the deceased had been sexually interfered with prior to her death and the evidence of the appellant that he had not sexually interfered with the deceased.
In our judgment, the alleged involvement of an unknown third party was pure speculation; the presence of the blood of a third party was too tenuous a ground to found an allegation that such third party had also attacked the deceased. It was not unlikely that the blood of the third party might have been shed along the wall long before the incident. As for the position of the chair covering the face of the deceased, the trial judge disbelieved the evidence of the accused and found his evidence on that point much too contrived and put on. The trial judge was wholly justified in disbelieving the appellant. It seems to us highly unlikely that he could remember the position of the chair with any clarity, especially on his own evidence the situation was confusing and chaotic and he put the chair on the deceased`s face when he saw blood thereon and the sight of the blood horrified him. As for the evidence of the blood stained brick, it was again too inconclusive. Although the brick was sent for analysis, the blood group on the stain found on the brick could not be ascertained and the rough surface of the brick made it impossible to lift any finger print therefrom. Hence, it could not be said with certainty whether the brick was or was not used to attack the deceased. But, as the trial judge found, whether the appellant used the brick or the stick to attack the deceased was immaterial; either of them used as a weapon could have caused the injuries that were caused. The appellant himself testified that he had sat on the deceased`s abdomen and hit her repeatedly with the stick for `10-15 minutes`, and that her right eye was so badly injured that he thought he had blinded her. The location of the injury coincided with the fatal injury No 1 in the pathologist`s report, and according to the evidence of the pathologist would have immobilized the deceased and caused her death within 20-30 minutes. We find ourselves in entire agreement with the conclusion arrived at by the trial judge.
We now turn to the second ground of appeal which was directed at the trial judge`s admitting the evidence of the appellant`s wife that the appellant confessed to her that he had killed the deceased and that he told her why and how he killed the deceased. Counsel for the appellant challenged the trial judge`s ruling that s 134(5) of the Act has superseded s 124 in relation to evidence given by the spouse of an accused in criminal proceedings. The arguments of counsel raised an important issue which turns on the construction of ss 124 and 134(5) of the Act. In considering this issue, it is necessary to examine the relevant provisions of the Act concerning the competency and compellability of the spouse of an accused in criminal proceedings. The starting point is s 120 of the Act which governs generally the competency of a witness and it provides as follows: 
 
All persons shall be competent to testify unless the court considers that they are prevented from understanding the questions put to them or from giving rational answers to those questions by tender years, extreme old age, disease, whether of body or mind, or any other cause of the same kind.
 
 
 
 
 
 Explanation 
 
 - A lunatic is not incompetent to testify unless he is prevented by his lunacy from understanding the questions put to him and giving rational answers to them.
Next, we come to s 122 of the Act which contains specific provisions governing the competency of husband or wife as a witness in civil and criminal proceedings brought against his or her spouse. In so far as criminal proceedings are concerned, sub-s (2) of s 122 is the relevant provision and it is in the following terms: 
 
In criminal proceedings against any person, the husband or wife of such person respectively shall be a competent witness.
 
 
 
The Act, however, is silent on whether the spouse, being competent to testify as a witness, is also additionally 
 compellable 
. In , McElwaine CJ held that the wife of an accused was a compellable witness. In that case, the accused was charged in the magistrates` court for the offence of kidnapping a Mohammedan girl under the age of 16 from the lawful guardianship of her father. Before the trial commenced, the accused married the girl, and at the trial the only material witness against him on the charge was his wife. He was convicted of the offence charged. On appeal to the High Court it was argued, inter alia, that under s 121(2) of the then Evidence Ordinance (corresponding to s 122(2) of the Act), she could not be compelled to testify against him. This argument was rejected. In the course of his judgment, McElwaine CJ said, at p 37: 
 
Under s 123 [corresponding to s 124 of the Act], a spouse may be compelled to disclose a communication made during marriage if it is relevant in a prosecution for any crime committed against the other.
 
 
 
We have two observations on this proposition. First, it was said clearly in obiter. It is not clear from the report precisely what evidence she gave that was objected to, but it seems to us that the evidence could not be that of any communication between husband and wife, and disclosure of such communication could not have arisen and probably did not arise in that case. The husband was charged with the offence of kidnapping, which was committed prior to the marriage, and the relevant evidence which the wife could give must be in relation to events or matters concerning the kidnapping. Under s 121(2) she was a competent witness and there was nothing in the Ordinance which said that she was not compellable to give such evidence. Secondly, the Chief Justice`s proposition pertaining to s 123, with respect, was not correct. Under s 123, the wife was not permitted, without the consent of the accused, to disclose communication made to her by the accused during the marriage. In the later part of his judgment, the learned Chief Justice clarified the position. He said thus, at p 37: 
 
If a witness in this colony is `competent` and has been summoned he is bound to give evidence, and to answer all relevant questions. There is no class of witness who can be called a `compellable witness.` The word `compellable` when used in the Evidence Ordinance relate not so much to a witness as to a type of evidence; and in my opinion a witness may be compelled to give any relevant evidence unless a section enacts that he shall not be compelled to give it. Such sections are 122-127 and 130.
 
 
 
The above pronouncement, if we may respectfully say so, is correct.
This decision was followed by the Supreme Court of Sarawak, North Borneo and Brunei in . There, the accused was charged for the murder of one Samidal. At the trial, the accused`s wife was called as a witness for the prosecution and her evidence incriminated the accused. He was convicted. On appeal, the conviction was upheld. One of the main arguments raised on appeal was that the wife`s evidence was not admissible as she was not a compellable witness. That argument was rejected on the basis that the wife was a competent and compellable witness under the Evidence Ordinance, which was in pari materia with our Evidence Act. Smith Ag CJ, after referring to ss 118 and 120 of the Ordinance (corresponding respectively to ss 120 and 122(2) of our Evidence Act) said, at p 118: 
 
The general rule in North Borneo is that all persons within the ambit of s 118 of Cap 43 are competent to testify. There is no distinct category of `compellable witnesses` as that term was understood at common law. Although all persons within s 118 are competent, certain sections of the Evidence Ordinance (eg ss 121, 122, 124, 125 and 129) set out specific instances where such competent witness cannot be compelled to give evidence relating to specified matters. These instances must presuppose the existence of the rule that all competent witnesses are bound to give evidence. Nowhere is it stated in this or any other Ordinance that a wife is not bound to give evidence in criminal proceedings against her husband. A wife is not compelled to disclose communications during marriage - s 122; surely if the legislature intended that she should not be bound to give evidence in criminal proceedings against her husband, this would be clearly stated in the law. It seems to this court that a wife is in no different position from any other competent witness. A court may summon her to give evidence, just as it may summon anyone else likely to be acquainted with the facts of the case - see s 176 of the Criminal Procedural Code (Cap 30) of the Laws. Unless the wife can point to any exception in the law relieving her from the obligation to give evidence, then she is bound to give evidence.
 
 
 
In our opinion, that is also the position in Singapore. All persons falling within the ambit of s 120 of the Act are competent and compellable to testify as a witness in any proceedings. Under s 122, a husband or wife is competent to testify as a witness in any proceedings against his or her spouse. The Act does not differentiate a spouse from any other witness; the spouse is in the same position as any other witness. There are specified instances, however, in which a particular person, though competent as a witness, is not compellable or is not permitted to give evidence on certain specified matters and these are provided in ss 123-133 of the Act. An accused, however, stands in a different and special position. Although the accused is competent to give evidence, he `shall not be compellable to do so`: see s 122(3) which provides: 
 
In any criminal proceedings, the accused shall be competent to give evidence on behalf of himself or any person jointly charged with him, but shall not be compellable to do so.
 
 
 
It follows that once an accused elects to give evidence in his defence under s 190 of the Criminal Procedure Code, he is compellable to give evidence relevant to the charge except evidence on specified matters as provided in the Act, eg under s 124, communication made to him by his wife during the marriage. At this stage, we hasten to add that there is no provision in the Act which entitles an accused, if he elects to give evidence, to refuse to answer any question or to produce any document which tends to prove that he has committed the offence with which he is charged. In short, once he takes the witness stand, he enjoys no privilege against self-incrimination on the charge he is facing.
On our analysis, the scheme of the Act is that, unless expressly provided, every witness (including the spouse of an accused) is compellable as well as competent to testify in any proceedings, and an accused is not compellable but competent to give evidence in relation to the charge he is facing.
We now come to s 124 which provides as follows: 
 
No person who is or has been married shall be compelled to disclose any communication made to him during marriage by any person to whom he is or has been married; 
 nor shall he be permitted
 to disclose any such communication unless the person who made it or his representative in interest consents, except in suits between married persons or proceedings in which one married person is prosecuted for any crime committed against the other. [Emphasis is added]
 
 
 
It is to be noted that this section has two limbs: under the first limb, a witness is not compellable to disclose any communication made to him (or her) by his (or her) spouse during the marriage, and the second limb contains a prohibition on the disclosure of any such communication unless the spouse, who made the communication, or his (or her) representative in interest, consents to the disclosure. Subject to such consent, this prohibition is absolute except in two types of proceedings (which are not relevant here). For simplicity, we shall refer to the communication between husband and wife made during their marriage as `marital communication`.
Pausing at s 124, the position is this. Although the husband or wife of a person against whom proceedings are brought is a competent and also a compellable witness, he or she is not compellable to disclose any marital communication made to him or her by his or her spouse. Further, even if he or she is prepared to disclose such communication, he or she is not permitted to do so without the consent of his or her spouse. It follows from this that the spouse of an accused can give evidence against him of any fact but is not compellable to disclose any marital communication made by the accused, and if she is prepared to disclose such communication, she is not permitted to do so without his consent. For instance, if the wife has seen her husband committing the offence or returning home with blood stains on his clothes, in proceedings brought against the husband she is both competent and compellable to testify on what she saw. On the other hand, if the husband has confessed to her that he committed the offence or has explained to her how the blood stains were splattered on his clothes or has written to her a note or letter to that effect, she is not compellable to disclose such communication or produce the note or letter and, if she is prepared to disclose such communication or produce the note or letter, she is not permitted to do so, unless he consents to such disclosure.
Section 134 must now be considered in relation to evidence given by the spouse of an accused in criminal proceedings. Prior to the Evidence (Amendment) Act 1976, s 134 had only three subsections which dealt with the privilege of a witness against self-incrimination in giving evidence. At common law, a person enjoys the privilege against self-incrimination, that is, he is excused from answering any question or produce any document in any proceedings, civil or criminal, on the ground that such answer or document might incriminate him or expose him to a penalty or forfeiture of any kind. Subsection (1) of s 134 removes such privilege from a witness in giving evidence in civil or criminal proceedings, and sub-ss (2) and (3) provide him with certain safeguards. By the Evidence (Amendment) Act 1976 (1976 Act), which came into effect on 1 January 1977, four new subsections were added to s 134, namely, sub-ss (4), (5), (6) and (7). For our purpose, we need be concerned with only sub-ss (4) and (5) which are as follows: 
 
(4) Where the accused gives evidence in any criminal proceedings - 
(a) he shall not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would tend to prove the commission by him of the offence charged; and 
(b) except as regards any question, document or thing which in the opinion of the court is relevant solely or mainly to the accused`s credibility as a witness (not being, in the case of a question, one asked by virtue of section 56), he shall not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would - 
(i) tend to expose him to proceedings for some other offence or for the recovery of a penalty; or 
(ii) tend to expose his wife or husband to proceedings for an offence or for the recovery of a penalty.
 
 
 
(5) Where a person being the wife or husband of the accused gives evidence in any criminal proceedings, that person - 
(a) shall not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would tend to prove the commission by the accused of the offence charged; and 
(b) except as regards any question, document or thing which in the opinion of the court is relevant solely or mainly to that person`s credibility as a witness, shall not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would tend to expose her or him to proceedings as mentioned in subsection (4)(b)(i).
 
 
 
It is to be noted that under these two subsections, the ground on which the accused and the spouse are 
 not entitled 
 to refuse to answer a question or produce a document is very specific: in the case of the accused, `that to do so would tend to prove the commission by him of the offence charged`, and in the case of the spouse, `that to do so would tend to prove the commission by the accused of the offence charged.` On a plain reading of these words, they do not compel the accused or his spouse (as the case may be) to disclose any marital communication made to him or her, because the ground for refusing to disclose such communication is that, under s 124, he or she is not compellable to disclose it and further is not permitted to disclose it unless the maker of such communication consents. Such a construction is based on the express words used in sub-ss (4) and (5) of s 134.
The effect of such a construction, in so far as sub-s (5) is concerned, is that when the spouse of an accused is called as a witness, he or she is a competent and compellable witness, and under s 134(5) he or she is `compellable` to give evidence of any fact and produce any document which would or might incriminate the accused in respect of the offence the latter is charged, save and except that under s 124 he or she is not compellable to disclose any marital communication, whether oral or written, made by the accused, and further if he or she is prepared to disclose it, he or she is not permitted to do so without the consent of the accused. In other words, s 134(5) does not deny the operation of s 124; it is read subject to s 124. Thus construed, s 134(5) is not in conflict with s 124 and can be reconciled with s 124. This construction gives effect to both the sections.
It was the case for the prosecution that notwithstanding the inadequacy of the words used, s 134(5) was intended by Parliament to abrogate the privilege against disclosure of marital communications in criminal proceedings and that a purposive construction should be adopted in preference to a strict and literal construction. We agree with the prosecution that a construction that will promote the purpose and object underlying the amendments to s 134 made by the 1976 Act should be adopted: see s 9A of the Interpretation Act (Cap 1). For this purpose, in so far as the amendments to s 134 are concerned, it is incumbent on us to delve into the historical background to the 1976 Act. It was submitted on behalf of the prosecution before the trial judge and also before us that Parliament in enacting the 1976 Act followed the recommendations of the Criminal Law Revision Committee (Committee) in England. For this reason, we need to examine the recommendations made by the Committee in its report, namely, the 
 Eleventh Report: Evidence (General) 
 presented to the Parliament in Britain in June 1972, Cmnd 4991 (the Report). For our purpose, the relevant parts of the Report are paras 170-173.
In para 170, the Committee said: 
 
When the accused or his wife gives evidence, this raises special questions concerning the privilege against incrimination to which there are no corresponding questions in the law of civil evidence. Those questions depend partly on common law and partly on s 1(e) and (f)(i) of the Criminal Evidence Act 1898. Section 1(e) clearly prevents the accused from claiming privilege in relation to a question directly incriminating him of the offence charged. But whether he may refuse to answer other incriminating questions is obscure. The question might arise in relation to (i) other offences which are directly or indirectly relevant as tending to show that the accused committed the offence charged or (ii) other offences which are relevant to his credibility as a witness. ...
 
 
 
The Committee then discussed these two questions, giving an example to each, and referred to the authorities pertaining to these questions and came to `a compromise` which was stated in para 171 which, so far as relevant, was as follows: 
 
We favour a compromise by which the accused should have no privilege against self-incrimination in the case of questions about the offence charged or about any other offence which is admissible as tending directly or indirectly to show that he committed the offence charged but should have the privilege in respect of other offences which are relevant to his credibility as a witness. ... The necessary provisions for the compromise are in cll 15(2)(a) and (b)(i). Since the division between offences which are relevant to the question whether the accused committed the offence charged and offences which are relevant to his credibility as a witness may not always be clear-cut, para (b) provides that the test should be whether the question `in the opinion of the court is relevant solely or mainly to the accused`s credibility as a witness`.
 
 
 
Having dealt with the proposed removal of the privilege against self-incrimination in the case of an accused, the Committee, on the same principle, went on to recommend provisions for removal of the privilege against incriminating the spouse of an accused and also corresponding provisions where the spouse of the accused gave evidence. This was to be found in para 172 of the Report which, so far as relevant, was as follows: 
 
On the same principles, cl 15(2)(b)(ii) allows the accused no privilege against incriminating his wife except in relation to an offence going to his credibility as a witness. For example, if he was charged with burgling a house in which his wife worked as a servant and she had stolen the key and given it to him to get in with, and the key was found in his possession, it would be curious if he could refuse to say how he got the key because this would show that his wife stole it. ... Clause 15(3) makes corresponding provision, as seems right in policy, for where the accused`s wife gives evidence.
 
 
 
We now come to the actual amendments recommended by the Committee in these two paragraphs, and they were cl 15(2) and (3) of the draft Criminal Evidence Bill which was in Annex 1 of the Report. These clauses, namely, cll 15(2) and (3) of the Bill, were specifically referred to in paras 171 and 172 of the Report. At the risk of burdening this judgment, we set out in full cl 15(2) and (3) which were as follows: 
 
(2) Where the accused gives evidence in any proceedings - 
(a) the accused shall not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would tend to prove the commission by the accused of the offence charged; and 
(b) except as regards any question, document or thing which in the opinion of the court is relevant solely or mainly to the accused`s credibility as a witness (not being, in the case of a question, one asked by virtue of section 7 of this Act), the accused shall not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would - 
(i) tend to expose the accused to proceedings for some other offence or for the recovery of a penalty; or 
(ii) tend to expose the wife or husband of the accused to proceedings for an offence or for the recovery of a penalty.
 
 
 
(3) Where a person being the wife or husband of the accused gives evidence in any proceedings, that person - 
(a) shall not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would tend to prove the commission by the accused of the offence charged; and 
(b) except as regards any question, document or thing which in the opinion of the court is relevant solely or mainly to that person`s credibility as a witness, shall not be entitled to refuse to answer a question or produce a document or thing on the ground that to do so would tend as mentioned in subsection (2)(b)(i) above.
 
 
 
These provisions were identical in all material respects with sub-ss (4) and (5) of s 134 of our Evidence Act, and it is manifestly clear to us that the source of sub-ss (4) and (5) of s 134 is to be found in cl 15(2) and (3) of the draft Criminal Evidence Bill as recommended by the Committee. It is significant that in recommending these provisions, the Committee was, at that stage, not concerned with the privilege against disclosure of marital communications: see paras 171 and 172 (supra). And that question was dealt with by the Committee in the immediately next para, namely, para 173. The entire para 173 is now reproduced: 
 
Clause 16 abolishes certain unimportant privileges which exists in criminal proceedings and existed in civil proceedings until they were abolished in these by s 16 of the Civil Evidence Act 1968. These are (i) the right to decline to answer a question or produce a document which would tend to expose the witness to a forfeiture or to produce a document of title to his land, (ii) the right to decline to disclose a communication made to the witness by his wife during the marriage (there is no privilege against disclosing a communication made by the witness to his wife) and (iii) the right to decline to say whether marital intercourse did or did not take place between the witness and his wife during any period. We have no doubt that these privileges should be abolished in criminal proceedings also. In the case of communications between spouses there may be a case for preserving the privilege and extending it to communications made by the witness to his wife, and the former might be given the right to prevent the wife from disclosing the communication; but the abolition of this privilege, like that of the others mentioned above, in civil proceedings was in accordance with recommendations of the Law Reform Committee in their 16th report. The Committee had informed us of their proposal to make these recommendations and we had agreed with them. Moreover, it would in our view be undesirable that witnesses in criminal proceedings should enjoy greater privileges in these respects than witnesses in civil proceedings.
 
 
 
Clause 16 recommended in para 173 was cl 16 of the draft Criminal Evidence Bill and the relevant provision thereof, for our purpose, was cl 16(2), which was as follows: 
 
Section 3 of the Evidence (Amendment) Act 1853 [which provides that a husband or wife shall not be compellable to disclose any communication made to him or her by his or her spouse during the marriage, and which was repealed by section 16(3) of the Civil Evidence Act 1968 except in relation to criminal proceedings] shall cease to have effect.
 
 
 
For completeness, we set out here s 3 of the Evidence (Amendment) Act 1853: 
 
III. No Husband shall be compellable to disclose any Communication made to him by his Wife during the Marriage, and no Wife shall be compellable to disclose any Communication made to her by her Husband during the Marriage.
 
 
 
Thus, only by cl 16 did the Committee recommend the abrogation of the privilege against disclosure of marital communications. Sub-clauses (2) and (3) of cl 15 recommended by the Committee (which we have earlier set out and which were identical in all material respects with sub-ss (4) and (5) of s 134) were not concerned with such privilege.
Having examined the relevant parts of the Report and the recommendations contained in the draft Criminal Evidence Bill, we find irresistible the following conclusion. Our draftsman in drafting the amendments to s 134 of our Evidence Act adopted the recommendations of the Committee as contained in cll 15(2) and (3) of the draft Bill verbatim, with only necessary modifications, and these are reflected in sub-ss (4) and (5) of s 134 of the Act. The draftsman, however, did not adopt the Committee`s recommendation in para 173 of the Report in respect of the privilege against disclosure of marital communication, and accordingly did not make an appropriate amendment to s 124. In other words, he did not intend to abrogate the privilege against disclosure of marital communications as specifically provided in s 124 of the Act. This is obvious from the fact that having read para 173 of the Report and cl 16(2) of the draft Bill, the latter providing for a repeal of s 3 of the English Evidence (Amendment) Act 1853, he would have been reminded of and would have instantly realized the existence of s 124 which, compared to s 3 of the English Act 1853, provided for such privilege even in a more prohibitory sense. We are therefore not persuaded that in enacting the amendments to s 134 of the Act, Parliament in fact intended to amend s 124 by abrogating the privilege against disclosure of marital communications in criminal proceedings.
The prosecution relied on para 173 of the Report and submitted that the Committee had recommended the abolition of similar privilege under English law. The trial judge was persuaded to accept this submission. He said: 
 
As stated in para 173, the Committee was in favour of abolishing the right to decline to disclose a communication made to the witness by a spouse during the marriage. It noted that in England by then the privilege attaching to marital communications was abolished in civil proceedings and the Committee considered it `undesirable that witnesses in criminal proceedings should enjoy greater privileges in this respect than witnesses in civil proceedings.`
 
 
 
True it is that in para 173 the Committee recommended the abolition of such and other privileges. However, two points of great relevance had not been brought to the attention of the trial judge - and this is clear from a perusal of the detailed submission made before him. First, the Committee in paras 171 and 172 recommended cll 15(2) and (3) of the draft Bill which were adopted by our Parliament and are now reflected in sub-ss (4) and (5) of s 134. Secondly, the Committee in para 173 recommended cl 16 of the draft Bill which was not adopted even in principle by our Parliament. It is abundantly clear to us that Parliament did not follow the recommendation in cl 16, because if it did, it would have done so by expressly amending s 124 appropriately or repealing it altogether. This is especially so as Parliament is presumed to know the existence of s 124, and if it intended to amend or circumscribe s 124 in any way at the time, it would have done so easily and without any ambiguity. We are reinforced in our view from a perusal of the Parliamentary debates on the introduction of the Evidence (Amendment) Bill. At the second reading of the Evidence (Amendment) Bill, the Minister for Law and the Environment said in Parliament the following with reference to cl 7 of the Bill which introduced the four subsections to s 134: 
 
Clause 7 restricts in two ways the right of the accused, if he gives evidence, to claim the privilege against self-incrimination or against incriminating his spouse. The proposal is that the accused should have no privilege against self-incrimination in the case of a question about the offence charged or about any other offence which is admissible as standing directly or indirectly to show that he committed the offence charged but should have the privilege in respect of other offences which are relevant to his credibility as a witness. But no privilege should be allowed if the accused has claimed to be of good disposition or reputation. On the same principle, the accused should be allowed no privilege against incriminating his wife except in relation to an offence going to his credibility as a witness.
 
 
 
No mention, however, was made by the Minister that an accused and his spouse should not be entitled to claim any privilege against the disclosure of marital communications.
Having regard to the historical material which we have examined and on the basis of expressions contained in s 134(5), we have come to the conclusion that on the true construction of s 134(5) it does not supersede or amend s 124 in relation to criminal proceedings. Both the sections should be construed in a way that promotes consistency between them. In our judgment, s 134(5) therefore does not abrogate the privilege against disclosure of marital communications, and s 124, even after the amendments made to s 134 by the 1976 Act, remains intact and effect must be given to it in applying s 134(5).
In our judgment, the wife`s evidence of what the appellant told her was not admissible in evidence and ought to have been disallowed. The appellant therefore succeeded on this point. Unfortunately, this did not help the appellant`s case in the appeal. Reverting to the facts in this case, we found that, casting aside entirely the evidence of the appellant`s wife, there was ample evidence to sustain the conviction. According to the appellant, he brought the deceased to the disused egg hatchery; demanded moneys from her, and as she refused to pay or repay the moneys an argument took place in the midst of which he slapped her. Not content with that he forcibly undressed her with the intention that she should go home naked; when she retaliated, he attacked her by using a stick; he hit her on the head twice with a stick, forced her to the ground, sat on her and repeatedly hit her on her head with a stick. The trial judge said he had no doubt that he inflicted the two fatal blows on the deceased. Neither had we. In our judgment, it is unarguable that he had no intention of causing her death or causing her such bodily injuries as were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.

This is an appeal by the public prosecutor against the respondent`s acquittal on a charge of trafficking in not less than 742.89g of diamorphine under s 5(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) (the Act). The charge as amended read as follows: 
 
That you, Goh Hock Huat, are charged that you, on or about 30 December 1992 between 2.50am and 12.50pm at Apt Blk 131, Jln Bukit Merah #09-1599, Singapore, did have in your possession a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185), to wit, 72 packets of substance containing not less than 742.89g of diamorphine without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, and by virtue of s 17 of the Misuse of Dugs Act, did thereby traffic, to wit, by 
 offering to sell, distribute or deliver
, the said drug you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(a) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
The respondent was convicted, however, on the lesser charge of possession of the drugs under s 8(a) of the Act and sentenced to ten years` imprisonment.
 The facts
The undisputed facts of the case were as follows. The respondent was stopped at a routine road block on 30 December 1992 at 2.55am. He was arrested and detained in the CID lock-up. Later the same day, a team of Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) officers took the respondent to his residence at Blk 131, Jln Bukit Merah #09-1599, Singapore. There, the respondent surrendered a grey `Tiptoe` bag to the CNB officers. In the bag, there were three plastic packets, which contained a granular substance which was subsequently confirmed to contain diamorphine, a digital weighing scale, two hair clips, a bundle of empty sachets, a metal spoon and two disposable lighters. In two out of the three packets, the granular substance had been packed into 30 smaller sachets each. The respondent was then asked if he had any more heroin. He replied in the negative. However, on a more detailed search by the CNB officers, 11 other packets of a similar granular substance were found in a drawer of a wardrobe in the master bedroom. Subsequently, his wife, his brother and his sister (who were all at the flat) were also arrested.
 The respondent`s statements
After his arrest on 30 December 1992, while the respondent was in the custody of the CNB, a s 122(6) Criminal Procedure Code (CPC) statement was recorded from him. At the trial, a voir dire was held to determine the admissibility of the statement and the trial judge ruled that it had not been obtained as a result of inducement, threat or promise and was admissible. In it, the respondent stated: 
 
My wife Lim Bok Hoey does not know that there was heroin at my flat. All my other family members who came to my flat do not know about the heroin seized in my flat. The heroin was given to me by a Malaysian Chinese known to me as `Ah Seng` who asked me to keep the heroin for him. Ah Seng told me that if he wanted to take the heroin he would page for me. I do not know where Ah Seng stays. It was always Ah Seng who contacted me by my pager.
 
 
 
Subsequent statements were also recorded from the respondent on 5, 7, 8 and 19 January 1993 at the CNB. Later a further statement was recorded from him on 14 June 1993 at Queenstown Remand Centre. The prosecution sought to admit parts of the statements recorded on 7, 8, and 19 January 1993 and the entire statement recorded on 14 June 1993. At the trial, the trial judge was not satisfied that the statements had been voluntarily given and ruled that they were inadmissible.
 The defence
The respondent admitted that the drugs seized from his flat were kept there by him, and that he knew that they were diamorphine. He also admitted that, originally, the Tiptoe bag contained two packets of the substance but, a few hours before his arrest, he had locked himself in the master bedroom and, using the weighing scale, hair clips and lighters, he had spent about 11/2 hours repacking the contents of one packet into 60 sachets, each sachet containing 7.5g of the drug. The 60 sachets were then separated by him into two bundles of 30 sachets each and placed in two different packets.
The respondent stated that he worked as an illegal moneylender at a gambling den and was a compulsive gambler and a heavy punter at the Bukit Turf Club. It was at the Bukit Turf Club that he was introduced in June 1992 to one `Ah Seng`, who then became his regular bookie. Initially, the respondent made a considerable amount of money through his gambling activities, but his luck soon changed and he started to lose heavily from September 1992. When the respondent could not settle his accounts with Ah Seng, he stopped returning Ah Seng`s pager calls and stayed away from the Bukit Turf Club as he knew that Ah Seng had a formidable reputation and had secret society connections. The respondent also stopped using his own pager and started using his wife`s pager instead.
In early December 1992, while the respondent was alone in a coffee house at River View Hotel, Ah Seng came up to him. He demanded to know why the respondent had not responded to his pager calls, and asked for the money which the respondent owed. The respondent pleaded for more time to make payment. Ah Seng then took down the respondent`s address from his identity card. He also noted down the respondent`s new pager number and told the respondent that he would go to the respondent`s flat in a week`s time to receive full payment. On 14 or 15 December 1992, at about 3pm, the respondent received a call from Ah Seng who asked if the money was ready. The respondent asked for more time but Ah Seng offered instead to give him a way out if he would keep certain `things` for him. When the respondent asked what the things were, Ah Seng replied that it would not be convenient to discuss this over the phone and that he would go over to the respondent`s house to do so. The respondent asked Ah Seng to come between 6pm and 7pm as his wife would not be in the flat at that time.
Shortly after 6pm, Ah Seng came to the respondent`s flat. He brought with him a Tiptoe bag and told the respondent that he wanted the respondent to keep some `peh hoon` for him. The respondent became frightened when he heard this and pleaded with Ah Seng that he had a wife and children and could not keep the drugs. Instead, he asked Ah Seng for more time to repay the money and kept resisting Ah Seng`s suggestion that he keep the drugs. Suddenly, Ah Seng`s expression changed. He took out a gun from his left pocket and pointed it at the respondent`s right temple. The respondent was terrified and asked Ah Seng to calm down and talk things over. He asked Ah Seng how long he had to keep the drugs and Ah Seng replied that he would collect the drugs on New Year`s Eve. The respondent said that he had no choice but to agree to Ah Seng`s demands. Ah Seng then showed him the contents of the bag and asked him to repack the two packets of `peh hoon` into the plastic sachets, demonstrating to him how to do so. Ah Seng warned the respondent not to reveal this to the police or he and his family would die. Ah Seng then brought up from his car to the flat a larger packet containing 11 packets of drugs and instructed the respondent not to repack these 11 packets but to keep them properly. He further told the respondent that he would collect all the packets on New Year`s Eve and that he would page the respondent before he came to collect them. The respondent kept the Tiptoe bag and its contents in the cupboard behind the bed while the 11 packets were kept in a drawer of a wardrobe in the master bedroom. Later that night, the respondent was arrested.
When the respondent was asked why he had failed to mention the incident of the gun threat in his s 122(6) statement, he said that he had been afraid to do so. He claimed that his main worry, at that time, was that his wife had been charged, even though she was innocent. When it was pointed out to him that he had already revealed that he was holding the drugs for Ah Seng, the respondent merely replied that `Ah Seng` was actually a nickname which was used by many people. He said that later that night, while he was in the CID lock-up, he decided to tell the CNB about the gun incident. However, this changed when he met Ah Seng in the CID lock-up early the next morning. Both of them were surprised to see each other. On discovering the details of the respondent`s arrest, Ah Seng told him to admit to the offence and threatened the respondent that if he (Ah Seng) was implicated, the respondent`s family would be harmed. It was this fear that prevented the respondent from mentioning the gun incident in his subsequent statements. Subsequently, the respondent and Ah Seng met a few times in the CID lock-up but Ah Seng continued to behave in a rude and uncivilized manner towards him.
On 21 January 1993, the respondent was transferred from the CID lock-up to the Queenstown Remand Prison. There, the two of them met up again and in fact for a period of about six weeks in September and October 1993 they were even in the same cell. The respondent said that throughout this period Ah Seng was aloof. However, some two or three weeks before the start of Ah Seng`s trial in the High Court for drug trafficking, Ah Seng told the respondent that he could tell the court everything that had happened. The respondent said that it was because of this that he was able to reveal to the court during his trial the facts surrounding his possession of the drugs.
The respondent`s defence was therefore that:
 
 
(1) he was only a bailee of the drugs and was merely holding the drugs for Ah Seng until Ah Seng came to collect them; and 
 
(2) that he was acting under duress because Ah Seng had threatened him with a gun and had told him that there would be harm to himself and his family if he did not obey Ah Seng`s instructions.
  
 
 
 
 Testimony of `Ah Seng` - Lu Lai Heng
 
The trial judge initially found the respondent`s defence implausible as he found it hard to believe that a bookie, who was owed money by the respondent and who hardly knew the respondent, would go to the respondent`s flat and demand that the respondent store drugs for him, and would threaten the respondent with a gun when he refused. Moreover, the respondent had failed to mention the gun incident in his s 122(6) statement.
However, Ah Seng volunteered to be a witness for the defence. His real name was Lu Lai Heng (Lu). In November 1993, Lu had been convicted by Goh Phai Cheng JC (as he then was) for trafficking in heroin and had been sentenced to death. His appeal against conviction had also been dismissed by this court and, at the time when he appeared as a defence witness for the respondent, he was in the death row awaiting the outcome of his petition for clemency. Lu claimed that he was a man deeply involved in many illegal activities and that it was his usual habit to carry a gun with him. He knew he was `wanted by the CNB` and so he wanted another place to store the drugs that were not immediately required for his `business`. He discovered that the respondent was an incorrigible gambler who was in serious financial difficulties and he assessed that the respondent would be attracted by the lure of easy money.
When the respondent was unable to repay the $10,000 which the respondent owed him, Lu decided to take advantage of the situation and entice the respondent to keep the drugs for him and assist him in his drugs trafficking activities. Since the respondent had a family, Lu felt that the respondent would be loyal to him and would not betray him once the respondent was involved in the drug business. Hence, he turned up at the respondent`s flat in December 1992 with the drugs and the paraphernalia for packing the drugs. He was surprised that the respondent resisted so strongly. However, since he had already revealed the drugs to the respondent, he could not let the respondent off. He therefore pulled out his gun and threatened the respondent. When he did so, the respondent quietened and agreed to do as he was told. Lu further said that he did not tell the respondent that the $10,000 debt would be treated as cancelled and that, on New Year`s Eve, if he had not been arrested, he would have personally picked up the drugs from the respondent and would then have recruited the respondent to work for him on a regular basis.
Lu said that he had a good family background and had been brought up as a Catholic. However, he had strayed and begun to be involved in illegal activities. In prison, however, he had been counselled by a Catholic priest and had started to regret his criminal life. He said that he was unable to do anything to atone for his wrongdoing. However, in respect of the respondent, he could still tell the court what had really happened; that was the reason why he did so at his trial before Goh Phai Cheng JC, despite strenuous objections from his counsel. This was substantiated by the notes of evidence recorded by Goh Phai Cheng JC.
 Trial judge`s findings
The trial judge found that Lu had substantially confirmed all that the respondent had said, even though there were some variants from the respondent`s account of the events that happened. In the light of Lu`s testimony, the trial judge accepted that the respondent came to be in possession of the drugs because of the threats made by Lu and that at the time he was arrested, he was merely keeping the drugs for Lu.
On the submission by the respondent`s counsel that, in keeping the drugs for Lu, the evidence showed that the respondent had acted under duress, the trial judge held that the defence of duress under s 94 of the Penal Code had not been established. If there had been any imminent threat of instant death to the respondent, it had ceased once Lu left the respondent`s flat. However, the trial judge accepted that the respondent was able to rebut the presumption of trafficking under s 17 of the Act as he had not `offered to deliver` the drugs to Lu. The trial judge was of the view that the act of delivery does not include circumstances where prohibited drugs are returned to its `owner` after the drugs had been entrusted to the custodian. Therefore, the trial judge acquitted the respondent of trafficking but convicted him of the lesser charge of possession, and sentenced him to ten years` imprisonment.
 Arguments on appeal
Before us, Mr Seng takes issue with the trial judge`s judgment on three grounds: first, his construction of the word `deliver`; second, that the facts disclose an alternative charge of abetment of trafficking under s 12 of the Act; and third, that the facts also disclose another alternative charge of trafficking under s 5(c) of the Act by `doing an act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in the controlled drug.`
 `Trafficking by delivery`
The trial judge had to consider whether, on the facts as he found them to be, the offence of trafficking as charged had been made out. Lengthy arguments were addressed to him, as they were later addressed to us, on the meaning of the terms `deliver` and `offer to deliver` in the context of whether a delivery by a custodian of drugs, or a redelivery by him to the owner, would amount to an offence of trafficking under s 5(a) of the Act. In the result, after referring to English and Australian decisions based on very different statutory provisions, the trial judge accepted in an oral judgment the submission of counsel for the respondent that the return of drugs to an owner, instead of a third party, was not delivery, and therefore that the prosecution had not proved the charge of trafficking against the respondent. In our view, if the respondent had transported the drugs back to Lu, the owner, or had handed them back to him on his calling for them on New Year`s Eve, then, even though Lu was the owner, there would clearly have been a delivery within the definition of trafficking under the Act. The requirement is merely the transfer of possession from one party to another. But that of course was not the case here. The real point was that the drugs remained with the respondent all the time, and there was simply no delivery in any sense of the term which could amount to trafficking under s 5(a) of the Act.
 Abetment of trafficking under s 12
Alternatively, Mr Seng submits that the trial judge should have exercised his discretion and amended the charge to one of abetment of trafficking, having regard to the evidence before the court. His reasons are that both Lu and the respondent testified that the drugs belonged to Lu; the respondent agreed to keep and did keep the drugs for Lu, who was to collect them on New Year`s Eve; the respondent knew that possession of the prohibited drugs was an offence; Lu instructed the respondent to repack a portion of the drugs into sachets and the respondent did repack a portion of the drugs into 60 sachets of 7.5g each; and Lu intended to distribute the drugs that were packed by the respondent, at a later date.
Under s 12 of the Act: 
 
any person who abets the commission ... or does any act preparatory to or in furtherance of the commission of any offence under this Act shall be guilty of that offence and shall be liable on conviction to the punishment provided for that offence.
 
 
 
 
 Offence under s 5(c)
 
Mr Seng further contends, however, that the facts disclosed that the respondent had committed an offence under s 5(c) of the Act, it being an offence to `do or offer to do any act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in a controlled drug.` Mr Seng contends that the respondent was keeping the drugs for Lu who would collect them at New Year`s Eve for the purpose of trafficking. He was not only keeping them but, in accordance with Lu`s instructions, had repacked a portion of them into smaller sachets to facilitate their later distribution. He contends therefore that all these were clearly acts preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in these drugs, and the respondent was guilty of trafficking under s 5(c) of the Act.
Counsel for the respondent submits that the respondent did not do or offer to do an act preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking as he was merely in possession of the drugs at that time. He contends that an act of possession of the drugs could not amount to an act preparatory to drug trafficking or be for the purpose of drug trafficking. In our view, this submission has no merit. The wording of s 5(c) of the Act is plain and unambiguous. While the act of possession by itself may not come within the purview of s 5(c), we are of the view that the position would be very different if it were shown that the possession or keeping of the drugs was merely the prelude to an act of trafficking. In the present case, both the respondent and Lu have given evidence that the drugs were being kept by the respondent for the sole purpose of facilitating their later collection and distribution by Lu. In fact, Lu had even taught the respondent how to repack the drugs into smaller sachets, and the respondent had done some of this work shortly before he was arrested. We are of the view therefore that the facts of this case clearly disclosed an offence the appropriate charge for which was under s 5(c) of the Act.
 Amendment of charge at appeal
The Court of Appeal has the power to alter or amend a charge on appeal, since the trial court has this power under s 163(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). By s 54(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 332), the Court of Appeal is empowered to make any order as it may think just, and may by such order exercise such power which the trial court might have exercised. This power must be exercised judiciously. Since the Court of Appeal, unlike the trial court, is not bound by the procedures in ss 163 to 166 of the CPC when altering a charge, the possibility of prejudice to the accused (or the prosecution) would be of utmost concern. On appeal, counsel for the respondent contends that to allow the amendment of the charge at the appellate stage would prejudice and embarrass the respondent. He also submits that the decision in should be reconsidered and that the Court of Appeal should be bound by the procedures in ss 163 to 166 of the CPC.
 Prejudice to the respondent
In `s case1, this court found that the amendment would not cause any injustice as the appellant had not actively tried to adduce evidence that he was not in possession of the drugs in the course of trafficking. He had chosen to remain silent and it could not be said that the fact that the charge was widely framed was such as to deprive him of a chance to establish a defence. Before us, counsel submits that `s case1 may be distinguished from the present case. He contends that, during the trial, the respondent had actively sought to establish two defences, first, that he was in possession of the drugs under duress, and, secondly, that he was not trafficking in the drugs. He refers to the judgment in `s case1 where the Court of Appeal stated on p 521: 
 
If the accused had actively tried to adduce evidence that he was not in possession of the drugs in the course of trafficking the court might be and instead hold that the charge was defective. The fact that the charge was too widely framed may have made his task unjustifiably burdensome. [Emphasis added.]
 
 
 
Further, counsel for the respondent points out that during the course of the trial in the High Court, the prosecution had not attempted to apply to the trial judge for the charge to be amended. He thus submits that they should not be able to rectify this lack of foresight at the appellate stage.
In our view, the respondent has already been provided the full opportunity of setting out the details of his defence. He has testified for his own defence, and called Lu, his most important witness, to testify on his behalf. The respondent had by his own admission agreed to keep the drugs for Lu, stored the drugs for him and repacked them into smaller sachets. There can be no injustice to the respondent in accepting the version of the facts as stated by him. On the facts as established and accepted by the trial judge, it would not operate unfairly against the respondent to amend the charge. Any contention that the defence, as already established by the respondent, would have been different if he had to meet the amended charge would only suggest that the `amended` defence was not a credible one.
 Re-examining Lee Ngin Kiat v PP
Alternatively, counsel for the respondent submits that, since the Court of Appeal is not now bound by its previous decisions, (see Practice Statement of 11 July 1994) this court should re-examine case and hold that the Court of Appeal in exercising its powers to amend the charge, should be bound by ss 163 to 166 of the CPC. He relies on the cases of and the Indian decision of 3 for the proposition that the Court of Appeal`s power on appeal should be limited to those of the High Court. Thus, he submits that, if the charge is amended, the Court of Appeal should remit the case back to the High Court for the plea to be taken on the amended charge, and to allow the respondent to recall all or any of the witnesses in answer to the amended charge.
In our view, the Court of Appeal is not bound by the provisions in ss 163 to 166 of the CPC. The two authorities relied upon by counsel relate to appeals against sentence. It is clear to us that there are good reasons why the sentencing powers of an appellate court should be limited to those of the trial court. That is a question of 
 jurisdiction 
 of the Court of Appeal in sentencing, and is very different from the issue that is before us, which is whether the Court of Appeal is bound by the same 
 procedural 
 rules as the High Court. As we have stated in case, the Court of Appeal`s power to amend the charge at the appeal stage is derived solely from s 54(1) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act and not the CPC. Considering the defence of the respondent, it would seem unnecessary to remit the case back to the High Court as there are no material disputes of fact on appeal between the prosecution and the respondent. This appeal relates mainly to questions of law and it would be futile for the respondent to call any further witnesses. The evidence, as established in the High Court, does not reveal any gaps to be filled in, but is, in our view, a complete picture of the circumstances leading to the respondent`s possession of the drugs.
As we are of the view that the more appropriate charge in this case would be that under s 5(c) of the Act, considering the facts that have been established at trial, we would exercise our power to amend the charge to read as follows: 
 
That you, Goh Hock Huat, are charged that you, on or about 29 December 1992 at Apt Blk 131, Jln Bukit Merah #09-1599, Singapore, did, in relation to a quantity of a controlled drug specified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, (Cap 185), to wit, 72 packets of substance containing not less than 742.89g of diamorphine, do the following acts preparatory to or for the purpose of trafficking in the said drugs without any authorization under the said Act or the Regulations made thereunder, to wit, by keeping the said drugs in your possession or custody or under your control and packing part of the said drugs into 60 sachets for one Lu Lai Heng for the purpose of trafficking therein and you have thereby committed an offence under s 5(c) punishable under s 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act.
 
 
 
Accordingly, we allow the appeal, convict the respondent on the amended charge and will sentence him to death.

s 5(1) Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A, 1991 Ed)
 
The respondent was prosecuted in the subordinate courts under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A), on two charges of employing foreign workers during the period 7 March 1992 to 12 March 1992, without having first obtained valid work permits for them. The foreign workers in question were two Malaysian women, Tong Shwu Hong (PW1) and Sim Kim Hong (PW2). Both were discovered on the premises of the respondent`s hairdressing salon (Sweeney Le Saloon) on 12 March 1992 during a raid by officials from the Ministry of Labour. In the course of their testimony in the court below, both PW1 and PW2 confirmed that they had worked at the respondent`s hair salon for the period of time alleged in the charges, the work in question being the provision of hairdressing cum cleaning services between the hours of 9.30am and 7.30pm daily. Whilst working at the said salon, they had received free accommodation and meals from the respondent, but neither of them had yet been paid any money up to the time of the MOL raid on 12 March 1992. Furthermore both women had been told by the respondent that there existed only one vacancy for the permanent position of hairdresser at her salon and that they would have to work for a trial period of some one to two weeks before the respondent made up her mind as to the more suitable `candidate`.
It should be noted at this juncture that throughout the relevant period (ie 7 March 1992 to 12 March 1992) the respondent was aware of the nationality of the two women, having been duly informed from the outset. Indeed she had told them that she would apply for a work permit in respect of the `candidate` she eventually chose.
At the close of the prosecution case, it was submitted by counsel for the respondent below that since both PW1 and PW2 had only been `
 trying out 
` for the same vacancy and since neither of them had received any remuneration during their period of work at Sweeney Le Saloon, the respondent could not be said to have `employed` them in the sense given to that term under s 2 of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) (there being no definition of the term in the Employment of Foreign Workers Act itself). That provision reads: 
 
`employ` means to engage or use the services of any person and to pay such person for services rendered or work done or to remunerate such person on a piece rate or on a commission basis ... .
 
 
 
The above submission was accepted by the district judge who acquitted the respondent without calling for her defence. The prosecution appealed against that order of acquittal.
 The present appeal
In his written grounds of decision the district judge held that under s 6 of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act (Cap 91A) the respondent could, on the basis of the evidence adduced, be presumed to have employed both PW1 and PW2. Counsel for the respondent argued on appeal that in fact the presumption should not have been invoked so far as PW1 was concerned because there was no evidence to show that she had been found working on the premises of the respondent`s salon. I found no merit in this argument. PW3, one of the employment inspectors from the ministry who had conducted the raid, testified that when the MOL inspectors arrived at the respondent`s salon, PW1 had opened the door for the inspectors when they came to the salon, an act she would scarcely have done had she been a mere casual bystander instead of a worker at the salon. Indeed, as the district judge pointed out, on PW1`s own admission she had been providing hairdressing and cleaning services at the salon from 7 March 1992 up to the day of the raid itself, ie 12 March 1992. Plainly, therefore, the inference to be drawn from the evidence was that PW1 had been found working on the premises. PW2 for her part had also clearly been found working there, for as PW3 testified, she had been in the act of assisting another hairdresser in the perming of a customer`s hair when the MOL inspectors made their appearance. PW2 too stated in evidence that during the period of 7 March 1992 to 12 March 1992, she had gone to the salon everyday with PW1 to do work ranging from the cleaning of the furniture to the washing and blow-drying of customers` hair. According to the testimony of both women, the work instructions had been given by the respondent, who had supervised their work at the salon everyday.
Having held that the presumption of employment provided for in s 6 applied, however, the district judge then went on to conclude that by the close it its case, the prosecution had `
 not proved conclusively 
` the actual employment of PW1 and PW2 by the respondent. In the district judge`s view, the evidence showed that both women had not yet been paid any money at the time of the raid, nor had there even been any explicit discussion of wages or salaries between the parties. He therefore acquitted the respondent without calling upon her defence.
I must, with respect, express some surprise at this decision. From a reading of his written grounds it appears to me that the learned judge misdirected himself as to the burden of proof laid upon the prosecution at the close of the prosecution`s case. Under s 189(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), at the conclusion of the case for the prosecution, the trial court may record an order of acquittal only if it finds that `no case against the accused has been made out which if unrebutted would warrant his conviction.` As Lord Diplock pointed out in at p 51: 
 
The crucial words in [s 189(1)] are the words `if unrebutted`, which makes the question that the court has to ask itself a purely hypothetical one. The prosecution makes out a case against the accused by adducing evidence of primary facts. It is to such evidence that the words `if unrebutted` refer. What they mean is that for the purpose of reaching the decision called for by [s 189(1)] the court must act on the presumption (a) that all such evidence of primary fact is true, unless it is so inherently incredible that no reasonable person would accept it as being true; and (b) that there will be nothing to displace those inference as to further facts or as to the state of mind of the accused which would reasonably be drawn from the primary facts in the absence of further explanation.
 
 
 
In short, all that is required of the prosecution at the stage it concludes its case is the adduction of some evidence (not inherently incredible) which, if the trial judge were to accept as accurate, would establish each essential element in the alleged offence. In the context of the present case, this required the prosecution to produce some credible evidence at the close of its case of the respondent`s having employed PW1 and PW2. In this task, however, as the district judge himself observed early on in his grounds, the prosecution was aided by the provision made in s 6 of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act for a presumption of employment vis-a-vis persons found working on the premises; and as I have related above, there was reliable evidence from PW3 as well as admissions from PW1 and PW2 themselves to show that PW1 and PW2 had been found working on the premises of the respondent`s salon. The presumption of employment in s 6 therefore sprang into operation against the respondent and the burden shifted onto her at that juncture to rebut the presumption by adducing evidence to the contrary. The evidence as to non-payment could then perhaps have been adduced by her in her defence, or indeed any other evidence her counsel deemed fit to call. In any event, the fact remained, in my opinion, that the prosecution had at the close of its case made out against the respondent a prima facie case satisfying the case and her defence should at once have been called.
For the reasons set out above I allowed the prosecution`s appeal and ordered the case to be remitted back to the subordinate courts for the respondent`s defence to be called in respect of the charges under s 5(1) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act.
 Order accordingly.",1994-11-23 00:00:00,SG Court of Appeal

The respondent was arrested on 20 January 1994 at about 10pm by officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) who found him hiding in the toilet of flat #10-13, Blk 71, Circuit Road, Singapore. The respondent admitted to the arresting officers that he had disposed of some heroin down the rubbish chute; and when one of the officers went down to the chute on the ground floor of the block to investigate, he discovered the said heroin in the form of two long straws, 14 shorter straws and one sachet. The respondent identified these items as the drugs he had thrown down the chute. On analysis the said items were found to contain a total of 1.98g of diamorphine.
The respondent pleaded guilty in the subordinate courts to a charge of possessing a controlled drug under s 8(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185) and was sentenced to six months` imprisonment by the district judge. Subsequently, however, the prosecution brought this appeal against the sentence. It was pointed out that the respondent had previously, on 1 March 1980, been convicted of possession of a controlled drug under the then s 6(1) of the 1973 edition of the Misuse of Dugs Act. The prosecution asserted that the then s 6(a) of the 1973 edition constituted the predecessor to the present s 8(a) of the 1985 edition, being identical in its terms; and that the respondent`s conviction in the present case under s 8(a) of the 1985 edition of the Act should therefore be regarded as a `
 second or subsequent offence 
` meriting the mandatory minimum sentence of two years` imprisonment called for under the Second Schedule to the Act.
Having perused the Act in its present as well as in its former editions, I agreed with the submissions of the deputy public prosecutor. The 1985 edition presently in use is in fact a reprint of the original Act (Act 5 of 1973). Indeed the 1985 edition is not even the first reprint: the first reprint was issued in 1978, this being Reprint 2 of 1978. The respondent`s conviction in 1980 under s 6(a) of the 1973 edition of the Act subsists, however, as a `
 previous conviction 
` for the same offence that now stands delineated by s 8(a): it would be absurd to hold otherwise. The process of reprinting in itself means only that the legislation in question is reproduced in a form in which the original Act has incorporated into it the amendments made to it after its initial enactment: see for example 
 Pearce and Geddes on Statutory Interpretation in Australia 
 (3rd Ed) at p 159. So far as the offence of possessing a controlled drug is concerned, however, its definition has remained unaltered between the various reprints. The only change that has been wrought lies in the stricter punishment now provided for second or subsequent offenders in the Second Schedule to the 1985 edition of the Act. Under the Second Schedule to the original 1973 edition, the sentencing judge had a choice of imposing on such an offender a minimum of two years` imprisonment 
 or 
 a fine of $3,000 (or, for that matter, both). In the 1978 reprint the fine was raised to $4,000. The choice between imprisonment and a fine has been removed in the 1985 edition of the Act, which provides exclusively for a minimum custodial sentence of two years without the option of a fine only. Clearly the intention of Parliament was to ensure stricter punishment for persons repeatedly found in possession of controlled drugs; and it would be an absurd denial of Parliament`s intention if, in considering whether an accused should be punished as for a `
 subsequent offence 
`, the courts were to ignore his past convictions for the same offence on the mere basis that these convictions had taken place under an earlier edition of the Act.
Regard should be had in this respect to the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in . The respondent in that case was convicted in July 1991 on a charge of drunken driving under s 67(1) of the Road Traffic Act (Cap 276). He had in fact been previously convicted in March 1990 on a similar charge, also under s 67(1) of the Act. In April 1990, however, the then s 67(1) had been repealed by an Amendment Act which substituted a new s 67(1) providing for enhanced punishment for `
 second or subsequent 
` offenders. Counsel for the respondent argued that he should be treated as a first offender under the new s 67(1). It was contended that the former s 67(1) formed no part of the corpus juris of Singapore, having been repealed; and that as the provision creating the offence of drunken driving was the re-enacted s 67(1), the offence referred to by the word `
 conviction 
` must mean a conviction under the re-enacted s 67(1). The Court of Criminal Appeal was asked to rule on the question of whether a court, for the purposes of sentencing an accused convicted under the new s 67(1), should take into account the accused`s previous conviction under the same section before the amendment and impose the minimum sentenced provided for in the new section. It answered the question in the affirmative. Warren LH Khoo J, in delivering the judgment of the court, stated at pp 847-848: 
 
The conviction of the respondent under s 67(1) before the `repeal` is a fact which did not cease to exist on the repeal. He remained as a person who had been so convicted ... (T)here is no question of the `repeal` affecting the subsistence of this fact ... We have no doubt at all that what Parliament intended to do was simply to enhance the punishment for persons found guilty of driving while under the influence of alcohol and drugs. What was changed was the punishment prescribed for persons convicted of the offence. The legislature was particularly intent on dealing severely with repeat offenders. Rather than prescribing a maximum fine and imprisonment term and leaving it to the courts to impose an appropriate punishment up to the maximum, Parliament prescribed the minimum as well. This indicates beyond doubt an intention to see that such criminal conduct is treated with the required degree of seriousness by the courts. If the argument for the respondent is correct, it would lead to the absurd result that a person no matter how many times he has been convicted in the past under the old subsection would be treated as a first offender if he is convicted for the first time under the new subsection. This would obviously defeat the intention of the legislature.
 
 
 
I noted of course the fact that the charge preferred against the respondent in the court below did not state the particulars of his previous conviction, contrary to the requirement of s 158(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC). Section 162 of the CPC provides, however, that `[n]o error in stating either the offence or the particulars required to be stated in the charge and no omission to state the offence or those particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as material unless the accused was in fact misled by that error or omission`; and having examined the records in this case, I was satisfied in the circumstances that the respondent had not in fact been misled by the omission.
For the foregoing reasons, I allowed the prosecution`s appeal and revised the custodial sentence imposed on the respondent to the mandatory minimum of two years.

The respondent, together with three co-accused, stood trial before the High Court on the following charge: 
 
You, 1. Panya Martmontree
2. Prawit Yaowabutr 
3. Manit Wangjaisuk 
4. Panya Amphawa
 
 
 
on or about 17 September 1993 at about 5am at the Lee Kim Tah & Woh Hup construction site at Tampines Ave 1, Singapore, did, together with three unknown persons, conjointly commit gang robbery of worksite equipment and that in contemplation of such gang robbery, the murders of one Vallaisamy Aryian and one Arumugam Chokalingam were committed by one or more of your number, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under s 396 of the Penal Code (Cap 224).
 
 
 
At the close of the case of the prosecution, the trial judge called on Panya Martmontree, Prawit Yaowabutr and Panya Amphawa to enter upon their defence; in respect of the respondent, Manit Wangjaisuk, however, the trial judge held that he had no case to answer and accordingly discharged and acquitted him. The prosecution appealed against the acquittal. We allowed the appeal and now give our reasons.
 The facts
The case arose from a gang robbery committed in the early hours of 17 December 1993 by a group of men at the construction site of the then proposed Temasek Polytechnic at Tampines Ave 1. In the course of the robbery, two foreign construction workers, one Vallaisamy Aryian and the other Arumugam Chokalingam, who had apparently been sleeping there, were attacked by some of the robbers. The former died on the spot from multiple fractures of the skull and a contused brain. The latter, although sent to hospital, was pronounced dead on arrival; he too died from multiple fractures of the skull and a contused brain. A third construction worker, one Rayappan Vedamuthu, was also attacked by several members of the gang. He suffered serious injuries for which he was hospitalized for almost a month.
Subsequently, four Thai workers were arrested and charged under s 396 of the Penal Code. The respondent was the third accused. The other accused were Panya Martmontree (the first accused), Prawit Yaowabutr (the second accused) and Panya Amphawa (the fourth accused). At the trial, the prosecution conceded that there existed no evidence of anyone identifying any of the robbers and no forensic evidence such as bloodstains or fingerprints which might have linked the four accused persons to the crime with which they were charged. The case against the four accused at the trial was based primarily on statements made by the first, second and fourth accused which the prosecution tendered. Following the voir dires, the trial judge admitted in evidence three statements each from the first, second and fourth accused respectively. No statement from the respondent was tendered by the prosecution.
In respect of the first accused, the three statements admitted were: a long statement recorded on 27 May 1994 pursuant to s 121 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) (CPC); a cautioned statement made pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC in response to a charge under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code and recorded also on 27 May 1994; and an oral statement made to Inspector Gerald Lim during a visit to the scene of the alleged gang robbery and murder at Tampines Ave 1 on 7 June 1994 and was then recorded by Inspector Lim in his field book in indirect speech. In both the long statement and the oral statement, the first accused admitted being involved in the theft of worksite equipment `sometime in 1993`, together with some other men, one of whom he referred to as `Nit [Manit]`. He further admitted attacking two Indian workers then sleeping in the office which he and his confederates had broken into, claiming that he did so on the instructions of `Nit`.
In respect of the second accused, the three statements that were admitted were: a long statement recorded on 27 May 1994 pursuant to s 121 of the CPC; a cautioned statement made pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC in response to a charge under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code and also recorded on 27 May 1994; and an oral statement made to Insp Lim during a visit to the scene of the alleged gang robbery and murder at Tampines Ave 1 on 7 June 1994. Like the first accused, the second accused also admitted having broken into the office at the Tampines construction site `sometime in 1993.` He stated that three workers then staying on the site had been attacked by several of his confederates but he denied having participated in the assaults himself. Among the other men allegedly present on that fateful night was one `Nit` whose full name, according to the second accused, was `Manit`.
In respect of the fourth accused, the three statements admitted were: a long statement recorded on 3 August 1994 pursuant to s 121 of the CPC, a cautioned statement made pursuant to s 122(6) of the CPC in response to a charge under s 302 read with s 34 of the Penal Code and recorded on 2 August 1994; and an oral statement made to Insp Lim during a visit to the Tampines construction site on 3 August 1994. The fourth accused admitted to having been involved in the theft of worksite equipment on 17 September 1993, in the course of which three workers then staying there had been assaulted. He admitted, inter alia, that the group of men who had broken into the site office included one `Manit`, whom he referred to alternately as `Nit`. When asked who `Nit` was, the fourth accused replied that he did not know his full name but that he had heard people addressing him as `Manit`.
In so far as the case against the respondent was concerned, the prosecution relied on these statements as evidence against him by virtue of s 30 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1990 Ed) and the decision of the Court of Appeal in on the construction of that section.
 The defence submission of no case to answer
At the close of the case for the prosecution counsel for the respondent submitted that there was no case to answer in respect of the charge against the respondent. Counsel advanced several arguments but the most pertinent, for the purpose of the present appeal, was this: even assuming the statements by the respondent`s co-accused amounted to confessions capable of being used as evidence against the respondent under s 30 of the Evidence Act, the prosecution still bore the burden of showing that these confessions in fact incriminated the respondent. This, counsel submitted, the prosecution had failed to do; for, although the statements were replete with references to `
 Nit 
` or `
 Manit 
`, there was nothing to indicate that the makers of the statements were in fact referring to the respondent, Manit Wangjaisuk. After all, counsel argued, there were two `
 Panyas 
` among the accused persons; and the statements also contained references to two different persons known as `
 Nong 
` or `
 Norng 
` (one of them being the fourth accused and the other being the buyer of the stolen surveying equipment). It was not at all unlikely, therefore, that the `
 Manit 
` mentioned in the statements was actually another person altogether and not the respondent. There was, moreover, no satisfactory evidence to support the suggestion that the respondent was the `
 Manit 
` referred to in the statements: for example, no identification parade had been held so that the respondent could be specifically identified by his co-accused as one of their accomplices.
The prosecution case, on the other hand, was that the cautioned statements of the co-accused were made in reply to charges in which the respondent, Manit Wangjaisuk, was expressly named as one of the accused persons. It followed from this that the makers of these statements must have had in mind only one `
 Manit 
` and that was the respondent himself. In any event, evidence was given by Inspector Lim which showed that the fourth accused had identified the respondent from photographs shown to him; whilst the respondent himself was responsible for identifying the first and second accused from a set of photographs shown to him, thereby revealing his own connection with the robbery and murders of 17 September 1993. In the prosecution`s submission, therefore, there existed evidence identifying the respondent as the `
 Nit 
` or `
 Manit 
` mentioned in his co-accused`s confessions.
 The trial judge`s findings
Applying the test in , the trial judge held that the statements of the respondent`s co-accused amounted to confessions which, by virtue of s 30 of the Evidence Act, were capable of being employed as evidence against the respondent. In his view, however, the statements did not sufficiently incriminate the respondent in respect of the charge against him, for the simple reason (as submitted by defence counsel) that there was no positive identification of the respondent as the `` or `` referred to. He said: 
 
From the statements, it was clear that Nit and Manit are the names of the same person. It was equally clear that none of the co-accused said that person was Manit Wangjaisuk.
 
 
 
The prosecution drew attention to the fact that Manit Wangjaisuk was named in the charges in response to which the cautioned statements were made. The charge against the first accused referred to seven persons - him, Manit Wangjaisuk, Prawit Yaowabutr and four unknown male persons. The charge against the second accused also mentioned seven persons, ie him, Manit Wangjaisuk, Panya Martmontree and four unknown male persons. There were six persons referred to in the charge against the fourth accused - him, Manit Wangjaisuk, Panya Martmontree, Prawit Yaowabutr and two unknown male persons. When the first, second and fourth accused referred to `Nit` or `Manit` in their cautioned statements, they may be referring to the third accused, or they may be referring to any one of the unknown male persons mentioned in the charges.
The possibility that one name may refer to two different persons cannot be ignored. Panya Martmontree and Prawit Yaowabutr in their s 121 statements mentioned that one `Nong` went with them to the construction site. The fourth accused Panya Amphawa in his s 121 statement identified another `Nong` as the buyer of the stolen equipment. There may well be other Thais named Manit or Nit involved in the offence besides the third accused, just as there are two Panyas amongst the four accused and two Nongs.
The trial judge therefore held that the prosecution had failed to produce any positive identification of the respondent as the `` or `` referred to in the statements of the other three accused; and that without this vital element of identification, the statements did not establish a case against the respondent. Since there existed no other evidence sufficient to connect the respondent with the offence of which he stood accused, the trial judge discharged and acquitted him without calling on his defence.
 The present appeal
On appeal the prosecution relied, first, on the confessions of the co-accused of the respondent which contained references to `Nit` or `Manit`, and, secondly, on other evidence which connected the respondent to the robbery and murders on 17 September 1993.
We turn first to the evidence constituted by the statements. So far as these statements were concerned, the prosecution relied largely on the cautioned statements of the second and fourth accused. These statements were made by them respectively in reply to charges which specifically named the respondent as one of the accused persons. It appeared to us that the `other unknown male persons` referred to in the charges were in fact accounted for in the statements. Thus, for example, the fourth accused`s cautioned statement, which was made in reply to a charge naming the respondent, the first accused, the second accused `and two other unknown male persons`, named the following persons as accomplices: `
 Manit, Ya, Chai, Nat, Han and Ooan. 
` Inspector Lim testified that `
 Ya 
 ` and `
 Ooan 
` were the nicknames of the first and second accused respectively, `
 Chai 
`, `
 Nat 
` and `
 Han 
` were apparently the `unknown` persons referred to in the charge; whilst `
 Manit 
` referred to the respondent himself. As for the second accused`s cautioned statement, it made reference to `
 Nit, 
` which Inspector Lim testified was the respondent`s nickname. The second accused`s statement also alleged the person `Nit` as one of the persons involved in gang robbery.
We now turn to the other evidence adduced by the prosecution. There was the statement of Inspector Lim (P36A) which was admitted in evidence and in that statement, Inspector Lim described in some detail the visit to the Tampines construction site on 7 June 1994 and also the respondent`s conduct during the visit: 
 
37 On 7 June 1994 at about 2.55pm, acting on my instructions, D/Sgt Cher Kwong Chan, D/Sgt Colin Han and D/Sgt Goh Eng Huat left CID with accused Panya Martmontree and Prawit Yaowabutr for the Temasek Polytechnic worksite at Tampines Ave 1.
38 On the same day at about 3.05pm, I left CID with the accused Manit Wangjaisuk together with the Thai interpreter Mdm Tasneeporn Pusantanasal, D/Cpl Choo Hock Leng and D/Cpl Ee Teck Chye. 
39 At about 3.33pm, led by the accused Manit Wangjaisuk, we arrived at the Temasek Polytechnic worksite at Tampines Ave 1 ... . 
42 At about 4.08pm, while at the scene, I interviewed the accused Manit Wangjaisuk and he described to me his role in the incident involving the death of Vallaisamy Aryian and Arumugam Chokalingam in the Thai language which Mdm Tasneeporn Pusantanasal interpreted to me in English. I recorded the same in writing in my field investigation book. The interview ended at about 4.20pm.
 
 
 
The most telling piece of evidence to emerge from these paragraphs, in our opinion, was that the respondent described to Inspector Lim his `
 role 
` in the incident on 17 September 1993. Plainly, the inference to be drawn from this was that the respondent admitted to the inspector his involvement in the incident.
Furthermore, evidence was given at trial to show that the respondent was himself responsible for naming or identifying the first and second accused. In his statement, Inspector Lim said as follows: 
 
2 On 9 March 1994, I took over the investigation on the murder of two Indian nationals, Vallaisamy Aryian and Arumugam Chokalingam at Temasek Polytechnic worksite at Tampines Ave 1 ... .
6 On 23 May 1994 at about 10.25am, acting on information, I led a raid at the Central Bar Hotel located at 624 and 624A Serangoon Road with a party of 11 police officers. A male Thai national, `Manit Wangjaisuk`, was arrested. 
7 On 26 May 1994 at about 1.35pm, at CID, I instructed Detective Sergeant Colin Han and Detective Corporal Choo Hock Leong to interview the accused Manit Wangjaisuk. 
8 At about 4.05pm, the accused Manit Wangjaisuk was referred to me in my office by D/Sgt Colin Han and D/Cpl Choo Hock Leng. 
9 At about 5.51pm, at CID, I showed the accused Manit Wangjaisuk, a set of seven photographs of male Thai nationals. He positively identified to me the photographs of two persons, one Panya Martmontree and one Prawit Yaowabutr. I now produce the set of seven photographs.
 
 
 
In fact it was on the basis of the information given by the respondent that the police arrested and charged the first and second accused. Inspector Lim confirmed this in his evidence. He was asked to explain why the first and second accused had been charged. He replied that they had been charged on the basis of the information given by the respondent as well as their own statements. It was significant that no challenge was mounted against this testimony by counsel for the respondent below.
Lastly, Inspector Lim also testified that whilst no formal identification parade had been held in respect of the respondent, he had nevertheless been identified by the fourth accused from photographs shown to the latter by the inspector. Indeed, the first and second accused too were identified by the fourth accused from photographs on the same occasion. Counsel for the respondent urged us to disregard this testimony for the reason articulated by the trial judge, namely, that Inspector Lim had failed to describe or produce in the court the photographs shown to the fourth accused. With respect, such a failure constituted a factor affecting only the accuracy of the identification evidence; and accuracy, as Lord Diplock stated in , is not a relevant factor in a trial court`s consideration of the evidence against an accused at the close of the prosecution case. In our view, therefore, the evidence of the fourth accused`s identification of the respondent should have been taken into account by the court at the close of the prosecution`s case.
In conclusion, we found that there was sufficient evidence to show that `Manit` and `Nit` referred to in the statements of the first, second and fourth accused referred to the respondent. In our judgment, a case had been made out by the prosecution against the respondent which, if unrebutted, would warrant his conviction. Accordingly, we allowed the appeal and directed that his defence be called.
