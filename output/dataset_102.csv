      JUDGMENT - Application to exclude “Melbourne evidence” 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application brought on behalf of the accused generally. The application seeks to exclude from the trial material, which has been referred to as ""the Melbourne evidence"".  
     
      
    2 Mr Dalton SC presented the principal argument on behalf of his client, Mr Elomar. Generally, however, he was supported by all other defence counsel in relation to his principal submissions. In addition, Mr Dalton was supported by separate submissions from Ms Yehia. Those submissions were made on behalf of her client, Mr Hasan. Ms Yehia’s submissions were also supported by other counsel.  
     
      
    3 Mr Buscombe made a brief submission on behalf of his client, Omar Baladjam. This too was a general submission that was shared by others.  
     
      
    4 By way of contrast, Mr Waterstreet made submissions that were primarily directed to the position of his client, Khaled Cheikho. Mr Scragg took this position as well on behalf of his client, Mr Jamal. I will include in this decision references to the submissions made on behalf of Khaled Cheikho and Jamal. It may be assumed, however, that in general much of the tenour of this decision will be applicable to the separate submissions made regarding those two accused men. 
     
      
       
      The Melbourne group 
       
      
    5 It may be convenient if I set out in a general way the nature of the ""Melbourne evidence"" and the way in which the Crown says it should form part of the case against each of the accused at trial.  
     
      
    6 The Melbourne group comprised a number of men who are presently on trial in Melbourne in relation to charges of belonging to a terrorist organisation. One of those defendants is a Melbourne cleric named Abdul Benbrika. It is said that he was an Islamist who had publicly declared his support for militant or violent jihad. It will be alleged in the Sydney trial that Benbrika communicated with certain of the present accused. It will be alleged that, in Sydney, this contact was often covert in nature, involving, for example, airline travel being booked in false names. Benbrika had regular contact with a number of the Sydney accused, although, admittedly, his principal regular contact appeared to have been with Khaled Sharrouf. The Crown wishes to lead evidence of conversations intercepted on his telephone service, and in listening devices, in which extremist language and notions were used or discussed.  
     
      
    7 Others of the Melbourne group who adhered to Benbrika's extremist views included Atik, Joud, Raad and Sayadi. The Crown case is that these men communicated with certain of the accused in Sydney. Again, the contact was often covert in nature involving the use of covert and public telephones, and involving airline travel being booked in false names. The Crown case is that Benbrika and Joud maintained regular contact with Hasan, Elomar, Sharrouf, Moustafa Cheikho, Khaled Cheikho and Jamal.  
     
      
    8 The Crown has listed in its written submissions examples of some of the Sydney accused associating or having connection with Benbrika and some members of the Melbourne group. These include: 
     
      
       
      (a) Hasan, Elomar and Moustafa Cheikho's visit to Raad and Benbrika in Melbourne on 30-31 August 2004. (On the return trip from Melbourne on the evening of 30 August 2004, the vehicle in which Hasan, Elomar and Moustafa Cheikho were travelling (registered number ULC 693) was stopped shortly after midnight at Sutton Forest by the New South Wales Police. When questioned by the police as to where they had travelled from, Moustafa Cheikho is alleged to have falsely stated ""we've been to Canberra...we were looking at buying a boat"".) 
       
       
      (b) On 17 September 2004 at 1/56 Birchwood Boulevard, Hoppers Crossing, Victoria, a search was made of Joud's computer. This located a number of documents, which, amongst other things, provided instructions on the manufacture of improvised explosive devices, firearms and other weapons. The ""weapons caching"" section of one of the documents contained instructions on the storage of weapons and ammunition using PVC pipes and ""slip on type end caps"", with a recommended best choice for sealing them with PVC cement. The document further recommended sealing the ammunition into airtight containers or zip lock bags before placing it in the containers. (The Crown case suggests a connection between this material and the fact that, in November 2005, at a time when the accused were aware that they were likely to be ""raided"", a number of activities occurred, which included the obtaining of items such as those referred to in ""The White Resistance Manual"". This involved a number of the accused obtaining PVC pipes, end caps, cement solvent, airtight containers, et cetera: Despite the fact that this material was obtained shortly before the arrest of the accused, many of these items, and indeed a large amount of ""ammunition"", have not been located.) 
       
       
      (c) On 6 December 2004, Benbrika travelled from Melbourne to Sydney by plane. He travelled under a false name. While in Sydney, Joud, Raad, Sayadi and Benbrika were observed visiting a camping store. They spent the afternoon at Sharrouf's residence. Hasan was also there. (On 31 May 2004 and on other occasions, Hasan had attended at various branches of a well-known camping and disposal store and purchased large quantities of camping equipment. He gave a false name and paid in cash. He told the sales staff the equipment he was purchasing was ""for a youth group"", although the clothing and other equipment were in adult sizes. 
       
       
      (d) On 29 December 2004 at 8.56am Hasan visited Benbrika in person, urgently, having been stopped and searched by police in the vicinity of Lucas Heights the day before.  
       
       
      (e) Hasan and Sharrouf travelled to Melbourne to visit Benbrika on 23 February 2005. During this meeting, they appeared, according to the Crown, to be printing material from a CD entitled ""A Guide for the Mujahideen"" and they also discussed another book of which Benbrika had only printed one side, entitled ""Martyrdom Operations"". Later, when Joud was present, Benbrika discussed living in an Islamic state and fighting against ""them"" if their law threatened Sharia law. He then discussed preparing the mujahideen, stating: 
       
       
        
        “Everyone has to prepare himself. Or to die or to be gaoled...but we have to be careful. If we want to die for jihad, we do maximum damage. Maximum damage. Damage their buildings with everything and damage their lives, just to show. That's what we're waiting for. You be careful...trust no one.” 
        
       
       
      (f) Whilst at Benbrika's home, there was a discussion among those present about purchasing or ordering laboratory equipment from Haines (this was a company (Haines Educational Pty Limited) based at Oakley, Victoria. (Hasan's wife had contacted the company on 11 August 2004 and asked for a catalogue. The catalogue included laboratory equipment.) During the course of the conversation on 23 February 2005, reference was made to items in the Haines catalogue, to prices, and to a list, which had been made, including a reference to quantities of equipment. 
       
       
      (g) The “discussion” correlated with a handwritten list of an order, which was ultimately placed with Haines on 2 June 2005. This order was placed by way of a fax sent to Haines from a fax machine at Sayers Road Pharmacy, Hoppers Crossing, Victoria. (This business was located about 1.5 kilometres by road from Joud's premises). The order was in the name of ""Peter Drabjic"". The items ordered were laboratory equipment which, according to the Crown case, could be used in the manufacture of explosive devices, et cetera. A handwritten list of these items with the Haines code numbers and the quantities required was found at Joud's premises during execution of a search warrant on 22 June 2005.  
       
       
      (h) Hasan and Joud's fingerprints were found on the document located at Joud's premises. The document was in the handwriting of Elomar. A follow-up call in relation to the order was received by Haines on 14 June 2005. The inquirer gave a contact number 0421 002 054. This telephone had been activated on 14 June 2005 in a false name. The receipt for this telephone was located at Hasan's premises on 27 June 2005 during the execution of a search warrant. The address given for the “false name” telephone service was 26 Morris Road, Hoppers Crossing, Victoria (the same street and suburb as Joud's premises). The telephone service was later shown to be used by Hasan in making inquiries with a firm called Techni Ice.  
       
       
      (i) On 27 June 2005 there was a discussion between Sharrouf and Joud concerning the fact that Benbrika's home had been ""raided"" by the police and that this had happened to ""three brothers as well"". There was then a mutual discussion between the two men about this topic, comparing the situation in Sydney and Melbourne. The discussion included a reference to the possibility of police intercepting their telephone calls. 
       
       
      (j) On 27 July 2005 there was a conversation between Sharrouf, Benbrika and others during a car journey, which was captured on a listening device. The conversation included reference to one Taj el-Din. He was apparently a Muslim who had informed on others. Sharrouf was condemnatory of the informer (""may God curse him""). 
       
       
      (k) Between 31 July and 2 August 2005; Benbrika visited Sydney. He was picked up by Sharrouf. Jamal was with Benbrika, having driven him back to Melbourne a few days earlier. There was a meeting at the ASJA Prayer Hall. Hasan and Elomar were seen near the hall at the time. Later Benbrika delivered a sermon at Sharrouf's home. A number of the accused were present then and later.  
       
       
      (l) A number of the accused watched Benbrika's performance on television during The 7.30 Report (ABC TV 4 August 2005). During this interview, Benbrika praised Osama bin Laden and stressed the importance and value of jihad. He proclaimed the only law to be spread ”here or anywhere” was the law of Islam.  
       
       
      (m) Benbrika came back to Sydney on 9 August 2005 to give a ""lesson"". During the visit he was seen with Sharrouf, Khaled Cheikho, Moustafa Cheikho, Hasan and Jamal. 
       
       
      (n) There was a further visit on 31 October 2005. Benbrika came to Sydney Airport where he was collected by Moustafa Cheikho and Sharrouf. He gave a lesson on that day. 
       
       
      Relevance of the evidence to the Crown case 
       
      
    9 The Crown, in its submissions, has identified the essential elements of the offence charged against each accused in the present matter. The Crown argued that evidence of the kind identified in the examples given above is relevant to the fact and nature of the conspiracy. It is relevant to the intention of various of the accused in undertaking activities in furtherance of the conspiracy. It is also relevant to the defence case likely to be raised, namely, that the actions of the individual co-conspirators may reasonably be explained in an innocent fashion and without reference to violent jihad.  
     
      
    10 With that type of reliance in mind, the Crown has argued that the accused undertook activities in furtherance of the conspiracy against a background where, amongst other things: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) They were receiving advice and inspiration from Benbrika who supported - promoted violent jihad; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the accused were being supplied by Benbrika and others with extremist material, including instructional material; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the accused were assisted by Benbrika and Joud in their attempts to obtain large quantities of laboratory equipment.  
        
       
      
    11 The Crown acknowledged that the character of the activities that were undertaken by each of the accused, and whether or not they support the inference of the conspiracy as alleged by the Crown, is obviously to be a matter of serious contest in the trial. The Crown argued that the circumstances in which these activities were being undertaken (including the Melbourne evidence) was relevant to support the inferences contended for by the Crown.  
     
      
    12 The Crown argued that the nature, context and circumstances of the accused's contact with Benbrika, and with others who shared his views, was highly probative. The Crown argued that Benbrika was being contacted regularly as an important source of extremist religious inspiration and advice, at a time when the accused were actively sourcing materials consistent with an agreement to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts.  
     
      
    13 The Crown argued that, in general terms, the Melbourne evidence was admissible against all the accused to prove the existence, scope and nature of the conspiracy. Further, it contended that some aspects of the evidence were admissible to prove the participation of the accused in the conspiracy. The Crown argued that, in accordance with established authority, the admissibility of the evidence on the first basis was circumstantial evidence and did not infringe the hearsay rule (Ahern v R (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 100, 103; Tripodi v R (1961) 104 CLR 1 at 6-7; Masters v R (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 at 461.)  
     
      
    14 In relation to the second basis of admissibility, the Crown argued again in accordance with established authority, that if there were reasonable independent evidence of an accused's participation in the conspiracy, and the evidence sought to be tendered was the acts of a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy, it would be admissible against the accused to prove his participation in the conspiracy, even though he was absent or not present at the time. In relation to this aspect, the Crown submitted that the appropriate time for the trial Judge to determine if there was reasonable evidence of preconcert was at the conclusion of the Crown case.  
     
      
    15 Although the Crown did not entirely agree with the manner in which the defence submissions “truncated” the Melbourne evidence for the purposes of analysis, and suggested that that approach (""dealing with each aspect of the evidence in isolation"") was incorrect, the Crown, for the purposes of argument, made its analysis in accordance with the sequence suggested by Mr Dalton's submissions. The Crown, however, made the point that the relevance of the Melbourne evidence fell to be determined by considering it in the context of the entire Crown case. For example, Mr Dalton dealt with evidence relating directly to ""overt acts"" as a separate topic from evidence not so described (this was referred to by Mr Dalton as ""annexure 2"" material.) The Crown pointed out that some of this evidence, although not characterised as an overt act or acts, was nevertheless evidence admissible of acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
     
      
       
      Submissions made by Mr Dalton on behalf of Elomar and adopted by the accused generally 
       
      
    16 It will be convenient if I now turn to the submissions by Mr Dalton. Mr Dalton's submissions were predicated upon three assumptions. First, there was the assumption that the Crown adhered to its stated position that none of the Melbourne group were co-conspirators with the accused in relation to the Sydney conspiracy. Secondly, there was the assumption that the ""overt acts"" listed as part of the Crown case statement were all of the acts and declarations of the alleged conspirators (and/or their agents) which had been made in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. (As I have indicated above, the Crown did not accept the accuracy of this second assumption.) Thirdly, the submissions were predicated, admittedly prematurely, on the basis that the co-accused Sharrouf was likely to be found unfit to be tried and would not face trial jointly with the other co-accused. (This is a reference to a fitness hearing which was scheduled to take place (and in fact did take place) on 9 May 2008. It was a matter of common understanding at the time the submissions were made, that psychiatric evidence assembled by the Crown and the legal representatives for the accused Sharrouf was in agreement as to his unfitness to be tried at this time).  
     
      
    17 Against the background of these assumptions, Mr Dalton's submissions divided the evidence into a number of categories. First, there were those parts of the evidence, which had been particularised as ""overt acts"". Secondly, there were those parts of the Melbourne evidence, which did not fall into this category. These were described by counsel as the matters appearing in ""annexure 2"" to his written submissions.  
     
      
    18 The third category of evidence related to the documents found on Joud's computer in the search of his premises on 17 September 2004. Finally, there was evidence relating to the visit by some of the accused to Lucas Heights on 28 December 2004, and to its suggested connection with Benbrika on the following day. 
     
      
       
      The overt acts 
       
      
    19 Mr Dalton specifically addressed in his written submissions Overt Acts 10, 12, 19 and 20, 21 and 26. In oral submissions, Mr Dalton addressed other factual matters in the Crown case statement that were said by the Crown, during the course of its written submissions, to be admissible as acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. The thrust of Mr Dalton's submissions in relation to the overt acts may be well understood against the background of his argument regarding overt acts number 10, 19, 20 and 21. The subject matter of the evidence relating to these matters embraces the Haines chemical topic. On 23 February 2005, Hasan and Sharrouf discussed an order for laboratory equipment from the Haines company; on 4 May 2005, Hasan and Elomar discussed the preparation of an order for laboratory equipment from the same company; on that evening Hasan, Elomar, Sharrouf, Joud and Benbrika further discussed the preparation of the order; and on 2 June 2005 the order was placed.  
     
      
    20 The fact and contents of these conversations, involving various of the accused with the Melbourne men, was not, for present purposes, challenged. It was accepted that it might be both relevant and admissible. Mr Dalton, however submitted, that the identification of Benbrika and other members of the Melbourne group was of minimal probative value and that its probative value was clearly outweighed by its unfair prejudicial effect. So too with the geographical location of the Melbourne group. The prejudicial effect that was said to arise from the identification of those persons would be its capacity to establish in the jury’s mind that they were the unconvicted but charged members of a terrorist organisation in Melbourne. (Mr Dalton provided the Court with a volume of media reports concerning the Melbourne men and their trial. As I have indicated, the trial is underway at the present time, although it may conclude in June/July 2008.)  
     
      
    21 Mr Dalton made a subsidiary point in relation to the conversations surrounding the Haines’ discussions. In particular, he said that extremist statements made by Benbrika during those discussions were not in furtherance of the conspiracy and therefore not relevant. Alternatively, he argued that they should be excluded pursuant to section 137. Again, the main area of unfair prejudice was said to reside in the identification of Benbrika as a terrorist on trial albeit, at this stage, unconvicted.  
     
      
    22 In relation to the covert nature of Benbrika's travel to Sydney, Mr Dalton argued that there was no evidence that any of the accused knew of this situation. He argued that Benbrika may have had his own reasons to engage in ""covert movements"", quite separate from any consideration relating to the present offence. Indeed, he may have simply wished to avoid undue media attention.  
     
      
    23 In relation to the other overt acts, Mr Dalton said this: First, the documents found on Joud's computer, during the search of his premises, could not, he argued, be said to be in furtherance of the subject conspiracy. For that reason, they were not relevant and should be excluded. Secondly, the visit to Lucas Heights was not pressed by the Crown as being a visit in contemplation of a terrorist attack upon the nuclear reactor. Consequently, the reference to Lucas Heights should be excluded as it was, in any event, quite prejudicial. Counsel suggested that an agreement could be reached between the Crown and the accused as to an admission, or agreed state of facts, which would serve the purpose of the Crown case, without bringing in the damaging and unnecessary reference to Lucas Heights.  
     
      
    24 Another matter referred to by Mr Dalton in the present context was the trip to Curranyalpa. Again, for present purposes, Mr Dalton accepted that the evidence had been held to be relevant to the Crown case. He insisted, however, that the identification of the three Melbourne men who attended, was not in any way relevant. If it were, they could simply be referred to in some way that would not identify them as persons on trial in Victoria for terrorist offences.  
     
      
    25 The final matter addressed in oral submissions related to the additional overt acts identified by the Crown in its written submissions. Here, the submission was there was no real link at all between the activities of the accused in October/November 2005 and the material found at Mr Joud's premises in September 2004. If there were held to be such a link, again counsel suggested that the identity of the Melbourne men should not be disclosed to the jury. 
     
      
       
      Annexure 2 Arguments 
       
      
    26 Mr Dalton made a series of very detailed submissions regarding the listening device material and the telephone intercepts. Generally his point was that the matters identified in annexure 2 were not acts in furtherance of the alleged conspiracy. For that reason, he argued that they were not relevant as to the existence or scope of the conspiracy. Nor were they admissible pursuant to the co-conspirators' rules. Again, in a general way, Mr Dalton submitted that the only relevance of the statements in some of the conversations was as to the possible state of mind of the individual speaking, or perhaps listening to the conversation.  
     
      
    27 Secondly, in relation to annexure 2 matters, Mr Dalton submitted that any discussions between Benbrika and Sharrouf should be excluded altogether. This was because it might be safely assumed that Sharrouf would not be tried jointly with the other accused because of his mental condition.  
     
      
    28 In the alternative, Mr Dalton again submitted that, were any of the conversations to be admitted, they should be the subject of an admission or agreed statement which would permit the Crown the benefit of the minimal probative value of the evidence, but avoiding the prejudicial effect of the same by excluding the actual names and geographical location of the Melbourne group. 
     
      
       
      Ms Yehia's submissions 
       
      
    29 Ms Yehia provided written and oral submissions on behalf of her client, Hasan. Generally, Ms Yehia took up a similar position to Mr Dalton in relation to those matters that might be described as relating to the overt acts, for example, the Haines order and the Curranyalpa camp. Ms Yehia, however, made a number of discrete points about the annexure 2 material in Exhibits “A”, “B” and “C” on the voir dire (the listening device material, telephone intercept material and the material seized from Joud's computer).  
     
      
    30 Ms Yehia's starting point was a table or chart, which had been prepared by her team. The object of this chart was to demonstrate how many of the conversations were between Mr Sharrouf and Melbourne people; and how few there were between her client (or for that matter any of the other accused) and the Melbourne people. For example, the telephone intercepts reveal that out of 116 calls, 98 fell into the category of conversations between Mr Sharrouf and one or other of the Melbourne people. Only 11 of the 116 calls were between one or other of the Sydney men and one or other of the Melbourne people. In fact, there were a couple of calls that were only between the Melbourne people themselves and did not involve the Sydney accused at all.  
     
      
    31 Against the background of this analysis, Ms Yehia made a number of discrete points. First, counsel cautioned that, although the Crown suggested that the material would show the Melbourne men providing the Sydney accused with extremist and instructional material, this was not necessarily the case. In particular, counsel argued that there was no real identification of the videos and other material that were referred to in the intercepts. Simply because a video or book might be of a religious nature, did not mean that it was extremist, that is, material that promotes or encourages violent acts. There was, for example, reference to a video movie ""The Prophet's Life"". There were also discussions about the life story of Umar al-Khattab, a caliph who reigned in the year 634 to 644.  
     
      
    32 Secondly, Ms Yehia challenged whether it was accurate to say that the conversations disclosed Benbrika being used as a source of advice or inspiration to the Sydney accused. Counsel argued that a close inspection of the contents of the calls revealed the conversations to be instances of Mr Sharrouf seeking advice from Mr Benbrika. True it was advice of a religious type, but it was personal to Mr Sharrouf's situation. Thirdly, Ms Yehia challenged whether it could be said that instructional material was passed from the Melbourne men to the Sydney group. Apart from the Joud material, about which there was no evidence it was ever seen by the Sydney men, there was no other evidence of instructional material being provided or exchanged.  
     
      
    33 The final discrete point made by Ms Yehia was that the covert nature of Benbrika's trips to Sydney might also be explained by the fact that the trips were organised by Atik. There is material that shows that he was engaged in the theft of personal identities and also involved in credit card fraud on quite a large scale.  
     
      
    34 Overall, Ms Yehia highlighted the fact that her client had little to do with these conversations, especially when they were viewed in their entirety. Counsel submitted that all of this material under present discussion failed to provide the type of background that would explain or illuminate the overt acts relied on by the Crown. The most that they showed, if they showed anything at all, was something as to the state of mind of Mr Sharrouf on occasions. There was nothing, for example, to show that Mr Hasan had adopted the ""maximum damage"" outburst by Benbrika in February 2005. In her concluding submissions, Ms Yehia adopted Mr Dalton's submission concerning s 137 of the Evidence Act. More broadly, however, she submitted that the intercepts really showed Mr Sharrouf acting on his own in relation to a separate and distinct relationship he had with the people from Melbourne.  
     
      
       
      Mr Buscombe's submission 
       
      
    35 Mr Buscombe made a brief submission. It was to the effect that no inference at all could be drawn from the fact that there were certain activities engaged in by his client, Mr Baladjam, and Mr Mulahalilovic in early November 2005, which could, in reality, be related to the material seized from Mr Joud's premises. Counsel highlighted the fact that Mr Joud is not said to be a member of the Sydney conspiracy. Secondly, the only contact between Mr Joud and any of the alleged Sydney group, prior to 17 September 2004 when the seizure occurred, was a telephone call at 10.51am on 10 September 2004. It was a call, which involved Mr Atik, Mr Sharrouf and Mr Joud. It was not a call that discussed the exchange of anything, nor did it relate to the provision of any material. It was, counsel said, a completely innocuous call. Thirdly, Mr Buscombe pointed to the fact that the material seized from Mr Joud was never returned to him.  
     
      
    36 How then, counsel asked, could it be inferred that when Mr Baladjam and Mr Mulahalilovic attempted to obtain certain materials in early November 2005, they were doing so using information that had been supplied by Mr Joud? Counsel argued that it was simply impossible to show a relevant connection between the two events, especially as they occurred about 14 months apart.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
       
      Preliminary argument 
       
      
    37 The oral submissions made by Mr Dalton on 5 and 7 May 2004 threw up a preliminary point for decision. At the time the written submissions were filed, it seemed to be common ground between the parties that certain well-established principles of admissibility would apply to and influence the rulings that I would be required to make in this decision. A particular statement of those principles had appeared in my earlier judgment R v Baladjam & Ors [No 11], unreported, 16 April 2008. The particular passages, especially relevant to this preliminary argument, appear in that decision at paragraphs 24 to 29. I shall set them out again in this decision.  
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to a charge that a person has conspired with others to commit a criminal offence or offences, established authority points to three propositions relevant to the present arguments. In identifying these matters, I leave to one side for the moment the requirements of the  
        Criminal Code Act 
         1995 relating to a conspiracy charge. These three matters are:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) In many instances the same facts will be relied on by the Crown to establish both the existence of the conspiracy and the participation of the individual conspirators in it. This will not always be so, but it will often be the case. (A general scrutiny of the Crown case in the present matter reveals that this is a case where the Crown will rely on the same matters to prove both the existence of the conspiracy and the participation of the individual conspirators in it. Apart from issues as to when several of the conspirators were alleged to have joined the plot, there is said to be one conspiracy pursuing the same objects over about one and a half years. Each accused, in general terms, is said to have been involved in furthering the objects of the conspiracy in one way or another continuously throughout this time.) 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The co-conspirators' rule will, as a consequence, apply in general terms to the individual actions to be relied on by the Crown so as to make these actions admissible against the other alleged conspirators. This will be in proof of the participation of the accused in the conspiracy.  
          Quite apart from the co-conspirators' rule, those individual acts may be relied upon to prove the existence of the conspiracy, its scope and nature and its continued, uninterrupted existence throughout the duration of the conspiracy 
          . (emphasis added). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The method and timing of the determination of issues relating to whether there is reasonable evidence, apart from the acts or words of other conspirators, that a particular accused was also a participant falls to be determined by the trial Judge at the close of the Crown case or before jury address.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The authorities founding these propositions are  
        Ahern v The Queen 
         (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 94-95; 100 and 104. See also  
        R v Chai 
         (1992) 27 NSWLR 153 at 191;  
        R v Masters 
         (1992) 26 NSWLR at 465-6.  
        
       
       
        
        The relevant passages that underscore these propositions are at pages 94-95, 100 and 104 of  
        Ahern 
        . I will set out the first two. The third appears in one of the decisions I gave yesterday, when I was dealing with Mr Scragg’s submission re his client Jamal. 
        
       
       
        
        At pages 94-95, the Court said: - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “That basis is provided in an appropriate case by the rule which states that when two or more persons are bound together in the pursuit of an unlawful object, anything said, done or written by one in furtherance of the common purpose is admissible in evidence against the others. The combination implies an authority in each to act or speak on behalf of the others. Thus, anything said or done by one conspirator in pursuit of the common object may be treated as having been said or done on behalf of another conspirator. That being so, once participation in the conspiracy is established, such evidence may prove the nature and extent of the participation.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The Court then likened the situation and justified the situation of that rule to an analogy of people being partners in crime.  
        
       
       
        
        The second major point made by the High Court in  
        Ahern's 
         case was that the question of whether there was reasonable independent evidence of the participation of an alleged conspirator as a ground for use against him of evidence of the acts and declarations of others taking place in his absence must be determined, this being a matter for the trial judge. The discussion appears at page 100. Their honours said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “In our view the test adopted in  
          Tripodi 
           is an appropriate one. Where an accused is charged with conspiracy, evidence in the form of acts done or words uttered outside his presence by a person alleged to be a co-conspirator will only be admissible to prove the participation of the accused in the conspiracy where it is established that there was a combination of the type alleged, that the acts were done or the words uttered by a participant in furtherance of its common purpose and there is reasonable evidence, apart from the acts or words, that the accused was also a participant.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    38 During the oral presentation of his argument, Mr Dalton, in the politest of terms, pointed out a suggested qualification to these statements of principle, derived as they were from established authority. In essence, Mr Dalton took issue with a proposition inherent in the statement appearing in para 24 (b) above: 
     
      
       
        
        “Quite apart from the co-conspirators' rule those individual acts may be relied upon to prove the existence of the conspiracy, its scope and nature; and its continued uninterrupted existence throughout the duration of the conspiracy.""  
        
       
      
    39 This inherent proposition had been taken up by the Crown in its written submissions. It had argued, in relation to the Melbourne material generally, that ""the evidence is admissible against all accused to prove the existence and nature of the conspiracy, and some aspects of the evidence are admissible to prove the participation of the accused in the conspiracy"". I have earlier set out the Crown submission in full.  
     
      
    40 Mr Dalton's qualification was simply this: Counsel argued that evidence could not be admitted against the accused generally to prove the existence and nature of the conspiracy unless that evidence was itself evidence of acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy, or, as Mr Dalton later put it, pursuant to the conspiracy. Senior counsel argued that this qualification arose from a consideration of the ALRC report (ALRC 26 vol 1 para 646 and para 755) and the terminology of ss 57(2) and 87(i)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995. Counsel argued in addition, that a close examination of established authority demonstrated that where evidence had been allowed in to prove the existence and nature of a conspiracy, it was generally in fact evidence of acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. After the conclusion of the hearing on 7 May 2008, Mr Scragg sent me some further submissions, which contained references to recent authority, bearing, it was said, on the present preliminary point. As these submissions were sent in aid of Mr Dalton’s argument, I shall respond to them in this decision. 
     
      
    41 Mr Dalton sought to use the qualification he urged to exclude the evidence of the Sharrouf conversations with Benbrika.  He argued that the evidence could only be relevant as to Sharrouf's state of mind. It was not material that was admissible, subject to the application of the co-conspirators' rule, against the other co-conspirators. Mr Buscombe said the conversations would not be admissible against the other men, even if Benbrika had said something about their state of mind during the conversations. It could only reflect on his state of mind. It could not reflect on theirs.  
     
      
    42 Broadly, Mr Dalton submitted that none of these matters could be admitted to show the existence and scope of the conspiracy unless the acts and words (and the fact of association itself) were in furtherance of the conspiracy. Because Benbrika (and the Melbourne men) were not alleged to be co-conspirators, it was impossible to say that either the association with them or the ""acts"" represented by the conversations could be in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the preliminary issue 
       
      
    43 It will be necessary in due course to look carefully at the various conversations in Exhibits “A” and “B” to determine whether they are relevant and admissible. It will be also necessary to consider whether any of those conversations or remarks should be excluded pursuant to s 137. For the moment, I am merely examining Mr Dalton’s suggested qualification to the general statement of principle. Is his argument correct? Is the evidence of one co-accused doing an act (including verbal acts) relevant and admissible in proof of the existence and scope of an alleged conspiracy, in circumstances where the “act” is not one done in furtherance of the conspiracy? Mr Dalton's proposition is that, for it to be relevant, evidence as to the existence and scope of the conspiracy must be evidence of acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy, or pursuant to the conspiracy. I have come to the conclusion that Mr Dalton's qualification cannot be accepted as a correct statement of the law. In my opinion, it is contrary to authority and to established principle. Secondly, it is inconsistent with the provisions of the Evidence Act, which, in general terms, reinforce the existing common law on this topic.  
     
      
    44 I shall turn first to established authority. Before doing so, it will be convenient to refer to the second edition of ""The Law of Criminal Conspiracy"" by Dr Peter Gillies 1990 chapter 13 at page 176: 
     
      
       
        
        “Conspiracy counts typically present difficulties of proof. Technically, of course, a conspiracy is a mere agreement for an unlawful purpose. The only way it could be proven by direct evidence, would be by the adducing of direct evidence of the acts by which the alleged conspirators formed their agreement. Typically, this will be impossible. Indeed, unless a conspiracy is transacted, in whole or in part, it is unlikely even to come to the attention of the police and the prosecuting authorities. Most conspiracies, which come to be indicted, have been transacted.  
        
       
       
        
        Just as the police come to know of the existence of a conspiracy through the commission of its overt acts, the prosecution will usually seek to determine the specific objects of the conspiracy and the identity of its participants and victims, and to prove its existence in these terms, very largely by reference to and proof of these overt acts. In practice, that is, the prosecution will invite the jury to infer the existence of the conspiracy, its terms and its participants, by reference to the overt acts done in its commission, subject to the prevailing standard of proof in criminal trials. This approach is entirely logical. If A and B jointly commit a series of cognate crimes, it may readily be inferred that they agreed upon the commission of these offences. In the words of the Canadian Supreme Court in  
        Paradis v R 
         (1934) 61 CCC 184: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'No doubt the agreement...is the gist of the offence (i.e. conspiracy), but only in very rare cases will it be possible to prove it by direct evidence. Ordinarily the evidence must proceed by steps. The actual agreement must be gathered from ""several isolated doings"" having possibly little or no value taken by themselves, but the bearing of which one upon the other must be interpreted; and the cumulative effect, properly estimated in the light of all the surrounding circumstances, may raise a presumption of concerted purpose entitling the jury to find the existence of the unlawful agreement.' 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The High Court commented in similar terms in its recent decision in  
        Ahern v R 
         (1988) 165 CLR at 92.""  
        
       
      
    45 Dr Gillies points out (at page 177) that Ahern was, at the time his book was published, the leading Australian case dealing with the proof of conspiracy. (it may properly be still so regarded at the present time). 
     
      
    46 At page 92 of Ahern, the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An appropriate starting point from which to consider the use which might be made of the acts and declarations of one co-conspirator against another is the rule of thumb referred to in  
        Tripodi v The Queen 
         (1961) 104 CLR 1 and 7. There it was said to be an 'empirical' but practical and convenient test; that acts and declarations done or made outside the presence of an accused are not admissible against him. Practical and convenient though that test might be, it can be no more than a rule of thumb, because it is clear that it has a limited application. It represents an attempt to state, in practical terms, the effect of the hearsay rule although, of course, acts (other than certain acts of communication) cannot of themselves constitute hearsay and, strictly speaking, lie outside the rule. However, acts may contain an implied assertion on the part of the actor, which makes it appropriate to treat evidence of those acts for some purposes as the equivalent of hearsay. A conspirator may, in the absence of another person alleged to be a co-conspirator, say or do something carrying with it the implication that the other person is involved. The statement or the act may be admissible in evidence to prove the fact of a conspiracy and, by way of admission, the participation of the maker of the statement or the actor in that conspiracy. But evidence of neither the statement nor the act should, except in the circumstances which we shall elaborate presently, be admitted against the other person to prove his participation, because it would for this purpose be hearsay or the equivalent of hearsay.""  
        
       
      
    47 Mr Dalton placed particular reliance upon these passages. The Court however, continued (page 93):  
     
      
       
        
        “In conspiracy cases a clear distinction is to be made between the existence of a conspiracy and the participation of each of the alleged conspirators in it. Conspiracy is the agreement of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act by unlawful means and it is the fact of the agreement, or combination, to engage in a common enterprise, which is the nub of the offence. This fact can seldom be proved by direct evidence of the making of an agreement and must in almost all cases be proved as a matter of inference from other facts, that is to say, by circumstantial evidence. For this purpose, evidence may be led which includes the acts or declarations of one alleged conspirator made outside the presence of the others, provided such evidence is not led to prove against the others the truth of any assertion or implied assertion made by the actor or the maker of the statement. It may take the form of evidence of separate acts or utterances from which the fact of combination might be inferred. Led in that way, it is not hearsay and is not dependent upon some circumstance to take it outside the hearsay rule... 
        
       
       
        
        Thus it was said in Tripodi (at page 6) that proof of the crime of 'conspiracy' may well consist in evidence of the separate acts of the individuals charged which, although separate acts, yet point to a common design and when considered in combination justify the conclusion that there must have been a combination such as that alleged in the indictment.""  
        
       
      
    48 And later, at page 94, the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, it is not in all cases that evidence of the separate acts of the alleged conspirators will prove both the fact of combination and their participation. Of course, if the evidence fails to prove a combination at all, then that is an end of the matter. But if it proves a combination, although not the participation of an individual alleged to be a conspirator, then the question arises whether there are circumstances in which evidence of the acts and declarations of other participants, outside the presence of the individual, may be led against him, not as separate facts from which, when combined with other facts an inference of combination may be drawn, but as evidence of his own participation. Evidence of the acts or declarations of others led for this purpose will be led to prove the truth of the assertion or implied assertion contained in those acts or declarations. It would be excluded as hearsay or its equivalent, were it not admissible upon some other basis. That basis is provided in an appropriate case by the rule which states that when two or more persons are bound together in the pursuit of an unlawful object, anything said, done or written by one in furtherance of the common purpose, is admissible in evidence against the others. The combination implies an authority in each to act or speak on behalf of the others."" 
        
       
      
    49 The Court then went on to consider the degree or standard of proof of the evidence from another source which is required before the admission of the evidence against the absent conspirator; and whether it was for the trial Judge or the jury to decide whether proof to a required standard existed.  
     
      
    50 It will be seen, however, from the analysis conducted by the High Court, that the Court envisaged that evidence relevant to the existence and scope of the conspiracy might be a combination of circumstantial evidence not necessarily represented by acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. It is true that the example given by the Court (persons engaged in various aspects of a bank robbery) were acts and declarations of participation in the venture. But in my opinion, the Court also made it clear that “acts or utterance” from which the fact of combination might be inferred, were not restricted to acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy.  
     
      
    51 This aspect of the relevant principles was examined extensively by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in two decisions given in 1992. The first of these was R v Masters, Richards and Wunderlich. Two of the three accused were alleged by the Crown to have been recruited to join an existing conspiracy, of which the third accused was already a member. Evidence was led, over objection, of three conversations between the third accused and another of the existing members of the conspiracy. Two of the conversations took place before the other two accused were recruited. The third conversation took place after recruitment. At page 460G the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In conspiracy cases, the Crown must establish both the existence of the conspiracy and the participation of each particular accused in that conspiracy; there is a clear distinction to be made in relation to the admissibility of evidence to establish each of those two issues:  
        Ahern v the Queen 
         (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 93. That distinction becomes of special importance where the conspiracy is alleged to have been between the accused and persons not standing trial with them. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to establish the existence of the conspiracy, evidence is admissible of acts done or statements made by persons other than the particular accused even if he were not present - not (so far as the statements are concerned) to prove the truth of what was said, but in order to establish from the fact that the acts were done or the statements were made, the inference that the agreement which constituted the conspiracy charged had been entered into...that evidence is direct evidence, not hearsay ( 
        Ahern v The Queen 
         at 93); and it is admissible for that purpose even if the acts were done or the statements were made before the particular accused joined or became a participant in that conspiracy, for it does not depend in any way upon any acknowledgment or acceptance of the truth by the accused of the statements so made. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to establish that the particular accused participated in that conspiracy, there must first be reasonable evidence of that participation - that is, evidence independent of those acts and statements by other persons - which is admissible in the ordinary way against that accused:  
        Ahern v The Queen 
         (at 100). Once the judge has decided that there is such reasonable evidence in the case against that accused...the acts and statements by other persons in the conspiracy will become admissible against that accused, not only as establishing the existence of the conspiracy, but also, if they were done or made in furtherance of the conspiracy, as establishing his participation in it:  
        Tripodi v The Queen 
         (1961) 104 CLR 1 at 67;  
        Ahern v The Queen 
         at 100, 103;  
        R v Davidovic 
         (1990) 51 A Crim R 197 at 201-202.  
        
       
       
        
        It has not always been made clear in the cases just what constitutes an act done or a statement made 'In furtherance of the conspiracy'. In  
        Tripodi v The Queen 
         (at 7), the distinction was drawn between such actions and statements and something said which is no more than a narrative statement or account of some event, which has already taken place. Statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy, it was said, will usually be 'Directions, instructions or arrangements or...utterances accompanying acts'. 
        
       
       
        
        The expression itself - 'made in furtherance of the conspiracy' - suggests to us that a distinction should also be drawn between those acts or statements which form the conspiracy itself (that is, the acts or statements by which the agreement was made) and those which are done or made subsequently in furtherance of, or in carrying out, that conspiracy once the agreement had been made. The reference in  
        Tripodi 
         to 'arrangements' was (we believe) intended to be arrangements made in order to carry out the conspiracy, not to the formation of the conspiracy itself. Such a distinction is not one, which will always be easy to make. It is certainly rare that there is direct evidence of the Acts or statements which themselves form the conspiracy.” 
        
       
       
      
    52 In relation to statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy before the particular accused participated in the conspiracy, the Court held they would not be admissible against the accused who had subsequently joined the conspiracy as evidence of the truth of those statements, including as to his subsequent participation in that conspiracy. Such statements, the Court said, would become admissible against C as evidence from which the existence of the conspiracy may be inferred. For that reason, it would be necessary for the trial Judge in such a case to instruct the jury carefully upon the limited purpose for which the evidence was admissible (463A to C). The Court continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Applying that view of the law to the facts of this case, it is clear that the first and second of the three conversations in issue (which took place before there is any suggestion in the evidence that the appellants had participated in the rip-off conspiracy) were not admissible against them as having been made by co-conspirators in the furtherance of the conspiracy, as the Judge told the jury in the directions to which we have already referred. 
        
       
       
        
        But that circumstance did not make those two conversations inadmissible. We are satisfied that each of them was admissible in order to establish the existence of the rip-off conspiracy itself. No question of hearsay arose. The conversations were original evidence of the existence of that conspiracy. In the first conversation, Richards agreed with Morrison to take part in the conspiracy and the subject matter of that conspiracy was identified. In the second conversation, it was agreed between the existing conspirators that Richards would recruit others to assist in that conspiracy. That conversation enlarged the scope of the conspiracy. No question therefore arose as to the application of the 'co-conspirator rule' in relation to these two conversations. Their admissibility did not depend in any way upon whether they took place in furtherance of the conspiracy. They became admissible against Masters and Wunderlich as to the existence of the conspiracy which they had joined, if there were reasonable evidence of their subsequent participation in it... 
        
       
       
        
        In our view, the remainder of the summing-up made it clear that those two conversations went only to establish the existence of the conspiracy which these two appellants were alleged to have subsequently joined.""  
        
       
      
    53 The Court went on to consider the third conversation. This was found to be admissible because it constituted statements by the co-conspirators related to the carrying out or the furtherance of the conspiracy already established by the first and second conversations. It thus was enlivened by the co-conspirators' rule.  
     
      
    54 Now, it is true that in R v Masters, the first two conversations went directly to prove the existence of the alleged conspiracy. They were not only relevant to that issue, but proved the existence of the conspiracy. But circumstantial evidence relevant to the existence of a conspiracy may not be so direct. It may include many circumstantial facts, none of which in themselves will prove the existence of the conspiracy but, which, when examined with the evidence as a whole, will reveal the existence of the agreement relied upon by the Crown. This multitude of circumstantial facts may include acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy and facts which do not constitute acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Many of the facts, when examined in totality, will point not only to the existence of a conspiracy, but to the nature of that conspiracy. Again, some of those acts may be acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Others will not be of that character. Further, circumstantial evidence of this kind may contain hearsay statements or involve implied hearsay assertions. That will not prevent its admission into evidence in proof of the existence and scope of the agreement, as the authorities make clear. But, again, much of the circumstantial evidence may not be hearsay at all. It may make no reference to the other conspirators. It will be admissible against all the conspirators, however, in the sense that it may be considered, along with the whole of the evidence, not to prove the participation of the other conspirators, but to prove that a conspiracy existed and to identify the subject matter. 
     
      
    55 In R v Chai (1992) 27 NSWLR 153, the principal judgment was given by Badgery-Parker J, with whom Hunt CJ at CL and Allen J agreed) said at page 187: - 
     
      
       
        
        “It appears to me abundantly clear that the Judge, having reached a conclusion that there is reasonable independent evidence of the accused's participation, and having told the jury that the issue is whether the Crown has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was a participant in the conspiracy charged, should simply direct the jury's attention to the evidence available to them in considering that matter, which evidence would consist, upon the hypothesis now made, of the evidence admitted directly as evidence of the acts and declarations of the accused himself (which may itself be direct evidence or circumstantial evidence) together with such part of the evidence of the acts and declarations of co-conspirators as expressly or impliedly assert the participation of the accused in the conspiracy.  
        He would also, of course, draw to the jury's attention as evidence going to show the existence of the conspiracy as distinct from the accused's participation therein, the evidence of the acts and declarations of the co-conspirators which, as explained in Ahern, permit an inference to be drawn of the existence of a conspiracy with no infringement of the hearsay rule 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        If, on the other hand, the trial Judge came to the conclusion that there was no reasonable independent evidence of the accused's participation,  
        he would direct the jury that while they might refer to the evidence of the acts and declarations of the co-conspirators in the absence of the accused as forming part of a network of facts from which in accordance with ordinary principles of circumstantial evidence they might draw an inference of the existence of a conspiracy 
        , they must put out of their minds such part of the evidence as might assert or impliedly assert the accused's participation when they came to consider whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt the accused's participation. It may of course well be the case that if, in the view of the trial Judge, that evidence was not available because there was not otherwise reasonable independent evidence of the accused's participation, he would in any event direct the acquittal of the accused."" (underlining added). 
        
       
      
    56 And later, at 193 (B-D), dealing with an associated ground of appeal, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This court has discussed the relevant principles in  
        R v Masters 
        . A distinction is to be drawn between acts or words of co-conspirators,  
        [] 
        the doing or uttering of which provide circumstantial evidence of the existence of a conspiracy and of its nature; and acts or words of co-conspirators which expressly or impliedly assert the participation of the accused in the conspiracy. As to the former, they are admissible against an accused person whether they took place before or after a time as to which there is evidence available to show his participation. As to the latter, they would be excluded by reason of the hearsay rule, unless rendered admissible by virtue of the co-conspirators' rule.” 
        
       
      
    57 The associated ground of appeal was that the trial judge had been in error in leaving to the jury conversations and acts of the co-conspirators which occurred prior to the appellant being appointed as a local buyer, and hence as a member of the conspiracy.  
     
      
    58 The court held that all the conversations were admissible in evidence as circumstantial evidence that a conspiracy to import heroin into Australia existed, and that the parties to it were certain Hong Kong residents. The conversations did not suggest that the appellant had by that time become a member of the conspiracy. Nevertheless, the court held all conversations to be admissible against the appellant as circumstantial evidence and without reliance on the co-conspirators' rule.  
     
      
    59 Although this case was dealing with a wide variety of issues, and essentially turned upon an examination of the directions which the trial Judge had given, the statements of principle are, in my view, completely consistent with the decision in R v Masters and consistent with the decision of the High Court in Ahern. Each of the decisions is inconsistent with the proposition argued by Mr Dalton that evidence going to show the existence of a conspiracy must be restricted to acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy before it can be admitted against the others.  
     
      
    60 The next authority which needs to be examined is the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Louden (1995) 37 NSWLR at 683. The appellant and another man had been tried on a charge that they conspired with two others (Dorain and Francisco) to manufacture a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. Louden's defence at trial was that he was only ever involved in the manufacture of a drug that was legal in New South Wales, and that he had never been involved in the manufacture of the prohibited drug.  
     
      
    61 The trial judge admitted certain tape-recorded conversations between Dorain and Francisco. They had been talking at a farmhouse shortly before their arrests. The conversations were relied on by the Crown and were admitted, notwithstanding that the appellant and the second defendant were not present at the time of the conversations. The Crown relied upon the conversations to confirm that the intention of the conspirators was to manufacture methylamphetamine. The point at issue in the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the trial judge had erred in admitting the taped conversations; and whether he had erred in relation to his directions concerning those conversations.  
     
      
    62 Allen J (with whom Newman and Simpson JJ agreed) endorsed the statements of principle in both R v Masters and R v Chai. Those principles were stated to be entirely in accord with the High Court's decision in R v Ahern. In relation to the admissibility of evidence relevant to the existence and scope of a conspiracy, Allen J said at 691 line D: 
     
      
       
        
        “Its admissibility for that purpose is quite separate from its admissibility for the purpose of being part of the proof of the participation of the accused in the conspiracy.  
        For the purpose of establishing that the conspiracy did exist and what it was, as distinct from proving that the accused participated in that conspiracy, it is irrelevant whether the acts or declarations were in furtherance of the conspiracy 
        .” (underlining added). 
        
       
      
    63 Allen J's statement of this proposition makes it clear that his Honour was enunciating a general proposition applicable to the law of criminal conspiracy. Indeed, his Honour's detailed analysis of the conversations in the tape recordings shows that he expressly maintained this distinction throughout his examination.  
     
      
    64 In the ultimate, the court held that all the conversations were relevant as circumstantial evidence to show the existence and scope of the conspiracy; and that a number of them were, as well, evidence of acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy.  
     
      
    65 Mr Dalton argued that Louden's case could be distinguished from the argument that has arisen in the present matter. Mr Dalton reminded me that Louden had been put on trial twice for the same charge. In the first trial all the alleged conspirators were on trial, although in the second trial Mr Louden was tried jointly with one Allan Price. Mr Dalton suggested that, in this second trial, there could have been no challenge to the admissibility of the taped conversations as they were plainly in furtherance of, or in pursuance of the conspiracy. It appears clear from a reading of R v Louden that Mr Greenwood QC, who appeared for Louden, did object to the admission of the tapes. Senior counsel had argued that the tapes should not be admitted into evidence because they were not conversations in furtherance of the conspiracy (page 689 line C.) He also argued that they were not admissible on any other basis. Accordingly, I do not consider that the first point of distinction is justified.  
     
      
    66 The second point of distinction was that the trial predated the Evidence Act 1995. Mr Dalton argued that the Evidence Act altered the legal landscape referred to in Louden and the earlier authorities. In my opinion, it did not and I shall shortly discuss the provisions of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    67 For the moment, it may be said that the Court of Criminal Appeal in Louden had to examine the question as to whether the conversations were admissible against the appellant. This was in the context that, apart from two references, the conversations made no mention of the appellant at all. Even though Allen J expressed the view that most of the conversations constituted evidence of matters in furtherance of the conspiracy, he made it clear that this was of no moment to his decision. It was held that all the conversations were admissible against the appellant as evidence of a circumstantial kind relevant to the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. This was so even though the conversations (with two exceptions) did not point to the participation of the appellant in the conspiracy. 
     
      
    68 I consider that R v Louden is direct authority, binding on me, and that it requires me to reject the qualification to established principles inherent in the proposition advanced by Mr Dalton.  
     
      
    69 I understand that an application for leave to appeal to the High Court was filed in Louden, but it is my understanding that this was unsuccessful. Louden was applied in the West Australian Court of Appeal in Caratti v R (2000) 157 FLR 241.  
     
      
    70 Mr Dalton would, no doubt, say that much of the evidence under scrutiny in both Chia and Louden (as it had been in Masters) was in fact evidence showing persons acting in furtherance of the conspiracy. There is no warrant, however, for suggesting that evidence of the existence and scope of the conspiracy is to be confined to acts in furtherance. The authorities themselves do not say that this is so. Quite to the contrary. Of course, in most conspiracies, the evidence obtained will usually be evidence of acts done in furtherance of conspiracy. That is, it might be said, the nature of the beast. But with modern surveillance techniques, the evidence may capture the conspirators in the very act of their agreement. That would not be, in ordinary parlance, an act done in furtherance of the conspiracy. Sophisticated interception methods might show the conspirators discussing the agreement they had made a short time after its interception. A narrative of past events would not be an act in furtherance of the conspiracy. One conspirator might be overhead telling third parties about the agreement that had been struck. He might even name the other parties to the agreement. These conversations would not necessarily be acts in furtherance of the conspiracy (that might depend upon the relationship between the conspirator and the third party and other matters). But they would be admissible, as would the other examples I have given, in going to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. The last illustration, where the single conspirator named the others, would be admissible directly against the speaker. But it would also be admissible, for a non-hearsay purpose, against the others who were not present. It would be evidence which, when taken together with other evidence, would tend to show the existence and scope of the conspiracy and the identity of the participants in the conspiracy. Of course, if there were no subsequence evidence of participation by the others, the evidence would cease to have relevance against them and the jury would be so instructed. 
     
      
       
      Provisions of the Evidence Act 1995 
       
      
    71 Mr Dalton's submission is that, although the Evidence Act does not change the common law position regarding conspirators generally, it does so in relation to the qualification he argued. This arises from a consideration of the terminology of s 57(2) and s 87(c). 
     
      
    72 The starting point in Mr Dalton's argument is a statement of principle published by the ALRC (ALRC 26, volume 1, para 646) concerning the proposal for s 57(2). The statement is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of statements made by an alleged conspirator A intended as evidence of acts done pursuant to the alleged conspiracy will continue to be admissible against A and against alleged conspirator B. The evidence is not intended for a hearsay purpose and is not caught by the hearsay proposal. Such evidence raises an issue of conditional or provisional relevance - the relevance of the act of A to the case against B will depend upon a finding that there was a common purpose. This issue was covered by the proposal on conditional relevance. In addition, however, the proposal provides that, as at present, the evidence of A's acts may be considered with evidence of B's acts and collateral circumstances to prove the common design.” 
        
       
      
    73 It will be convenient, for the purposes of this decision, to set out the whole of s 57 of the Evidence Act 1995. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        57 Provisional relevance 
          
        
       
       
        
        (1) If the determination of the question whether evidence adduced by a party is relevant depends on the court making another finding (including a finding that the evidence is what the party claims it to be), the court may find that the evidence is relevant: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if it is reasonably open to make that finding; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) subject to further evidence being admitted at a later stage of the proceedings that will make it reasonably open to make that finding.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), if the relevance of evidence of an act done by a person depends on the court making a finding that the person and one or more other persons had, or were acting in furtherance of a common purpose, (whether to effect an unlawful conspiracy or otherwise), the court may use the evidence itself in determining whether the common purpose existed.” 
        
       
      
    74 It will be recalled that Mr Dalton's ""qualification"" was that evidence could not be admitted against the accused generally to prove the existence and nature of the conspiracy, unless that evidence itself was evidence of acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy, or pursuant to the conspiracy.  
     
      
    75 With all respect, I am unable to see that there is anything in either the terminology of s 57(1) or (2) or, for that matter, in the Law Reform Commission's statement that supports the suggested interpretation.  
     
      
    76 It needs to be borne in mind that section 57 is dealing with the issue of relevance. Part 3.1 of the Evidence Act is concerned with relevance and s 57 falls within the ambit of that topic. Section 55 of the Act defines evidence that is relevant in a proceeding. Section 56 provides that only relevant evidence is admissible. Section 57 caters for the admission of evidence if it is provisionally relevant. Section 58 deals with the ability of the court to draw a reasonable inference from a document or thing in order to determine its relevance. By way of contrast, parts 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 deal with hearsay, opinions and admissions. These parts of the Evidence Act assume relevance, but indicate where relevant evidence may not be admitted and where it may be admitted. With exceptions, hearsay evidence may not be admitted. For example, admissions, which would infringe the hearsay rule, are admissible in certain circumstances. There is no need for me to examine the other aspects of part 3 dealing with matters such as tendency, credibility, character and other matters. Again, by way of further contrast, part 3.11 is concerned with discretions to exclude evidence that is otherwise relevant and admissible. 
     
      
    77 In a conspiracy case, as with litigation generally, s 57(1) is an important provision. It enables the court to admit evidence as provisionally relevant in circumstances where its relevance depends on the court making another finding, if it is reasonably open to make that finding, or subject to further evidence being admitted at a later stage of the proceeding that will make it reasonably open to make that finding. Section 57(2) does not limit the ambit of sub-s (1). Indeed, it extends it if the relevance of evidence of an act done by a person depends on the court making a finding that the person and one or more other persons had a common purpose; or were acting in furtherance of a common purpose. In the first situation, the court may use the evidence itself in determining whether the common purpose existed. If admitted provisionally, it will cease to be relevant if admitted, if there is not other evidence to show in the second situation, the existence of a common purpose, the purpose being of the kind and character that is alleged in the charge; or it may cease to be relevant if there is not other evidence to show the acts were done in furtherance of such a common purpose. It will cease to be relevant as against a particular conspirator if there is no evidence of his participation in or membership of the conspiracy. Of course, in the ultimate, it may demonstrate both the existence of the common purpose and that it is an act done in furtherance of such a common purpose. 
     
      
    78 Strictly speaking, the section is not itself concerned with the issue of admissibility or exclusion. Rather, it is concerned to identify the basis on which evidence may be regarded as provisionally relevant and, in relation to s 57(2), the way it may be used in a common purpose situation. In the case of a conspiracy charge, it allows the court to scrutinise the provisionally relevant evidence itself (no doubt along with other evidence) in order to determine whether a common purpose of the kind alleged was in existence. 
     
      
    79 Viewed in this way, it will be seen that s 57 does not change the existing law. Nor does it qualify or modify the Ahern principles as enunciated in the three decisions of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal to which I have made reference. 
     
      
    80 The ALRC paragraph, upon which Mr Dalton placed reliance, referred to “evidence of statements made by alleged conspirator A intended as acts done pursuant to the alleged conspiracy”. These statements, according to the Report, would continue to be admissible against A and against conspirator B, but not for a hearsay purpose. The Report did not suggest, however, that evidence generally relevant to the existence and scope of a conspiracy would be incapable of being regarded as provisionally relevant. It did not suggest that circumstantial evidence in proof of the existence and scope of a conspiracy would not be relevant or provisionally relevant, It certainly made no suggestion that only acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy was to be regarded as relevant to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. That would have been a startling and radical proposal. Rather, the passage suggests that the law of evidence in relation to this aspect of the law of conspiracy was to remain unaltered. 
     
      
    81 Mr Dalton also made reference to s 87(2) of the Evidence Act. This appears in that section of the Act dealing with admissions. Section 81 provides that the hearsay rule and the opinion rule do not apply to evidence of an admission. ""Admission"" is defined in the dictionary: 
     
      
       
        
        '""Admission' means a previous representation that is: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding""; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) adverse to the person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding”. 
          
         
        
       
      
    82 Previous representation is defined to mean a representation made otherwise than in the course of giving evidence in the proceeding in which evidence of the representation is sought to be adduced. It includes both an express or implied representation (whether oral or in writing), and a representation that is to be inferred from conduct.” 
     
      
    83 Section 87 deals with ""admissions made with authority"". Thus it is concerned with representations made, for example, by an employee of the party to proceedings, or by a person who had authority otherwise to act for the party where the representation related to a matter within the scope of the person's employment or authority (s 87(1)(b)). For present purposes, the relevant section is s 87(1)(c). This is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        87 Admissions made with authority 
        
       
       
        
        (1) For the purpose of determining whether a previous representation made by a person is also taken to be an admission by a party, the court is to admit the representation if it is reasonably open to find that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The representation was made by the person in furtherance of a common purpose (whether lawful or not) that the person had with the party or one or more persons including the party."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    84 The terms of s 87(1)(c) would appear to indicate that it is, in general terms, a direct application of the co-conspirators' rule. The expression ""if it is reasonably open to find"" may not be precisely the same as the concept of the presence of ""reasonable evidence of participation"", but the concept is generally the same. 
     
      
    85 That this is so is not contradicted by the ALRC Report 26 Volume 1 para 755. In any event, in R v MacRaild (unreported) NSWCCA, Sully, Dunford, Simpson JJ, 18 December 1997, held that s 87(1)(c) reflects the existing common law (see also, in the context of a civil case, dealing with the phrase ""reasonably open"", Jackson v TCN Channel 9 Pty Limited (2002) NSWSC 1229 (at 40, per Adams J). 
     
      
    86 Mr Dalton argued that the use of the expression ""an act done"" by a person in s 57(1) was to be contrasted with the expression ""a previous representation"" appearing in s 87. I am unable to see that this distinction is of any real moment for the purposes of the present discussion. Section 57 appears in a part of the Evidence Act dealing with relevance of acts. Moreover, ""an act done"" clearly would extend to ""verbal acts"" as described by the High Court in Ahern. The expression ""previous representation"" appears in that part of the Act dealing with ""admissions"". In any event, representation includes one that is to be inferred from conduct. I do not consider that the distinction in the expressions used supports the ""qualification"" argued for by Mr Dalton. 
     
      
       
      Other Authorities 
       
      
    87 The two authorities sent to me by Mr Scragg were Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v Leahy Petroleum Pty Limited and Ors (2007) 160 FCR 321; and R v Hayter (2005) 1 WLR 605; (2005) UKHL 6. 
     
      
    88 The first was a decision of Gray J in the Federal Court of Australia. The case concerned allegations of retail price fixing in the Geelong retail petrol market. The plaintiff alleged that a series of arrangements or understandings existed between competitors in that market, each containing a provision, having the purpose, or likely to have the effect, of fixing prices. The conduct alleged was said to contravene certain sections of the Trade Practices Act. As might be expected, the factual content of the case was very complicated. One question which arose, however, was the admissibility against one respondent of an admission made by another respondent. In relation to this issue, Gray J referred to s 57(2) and s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Grey J made two statements. The first related to s 57(2) in these terms at 339 (52): 
     
      
       
        
        “The other issue that may arise in this case, with respect to which it is necessary to look at some authorities, is the question of the admissibility against one respondent of an admission made by another respondent. For instance, if A gives evidence of a conversation between A and B, and A's evidence is that, in the course of the conversation, B said something probative of the existence of an arrangement or understanding between B and C, the evidence is plainly admissible against B as an admission, pursuant to the exception in section 81(1) of the  
        Evidence Act 
         to the hearsay rule in section 59(1). The question is whether this admission is also admissible against C. 
        
       
       
        
        Section 57(2) of the  
        Evidence Act 
         does not answer this question itself. It provides in its own terms, and it deals only with the relevance of evidence. Indeed, it is one of the provisions in part 3.1 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        , all of which deal with relevance. There can be no doubt that, if the statement made by B in the conversation with A is indicative of the existence of an arrangement or understanding between B and C, then, consistently with section 57(2), the court may use the content of that statement to determine whether it is evidence that the requisite common purpose existed, and therefore that the evidence is relevant to that question. Given its relevance, the evidence is still not admissible against C unless section 87(1)(c) of the  
        Evidence Act 
         applies. For that to apply, it must be reasonably open to the court to find that the statement was made in furtherance of a common purpose that B and C had. It is clear that section 87(1)(c) can only operate if it is reasonably open from evidence other than the statement itself that the statement is made in furtherance of a common purpose.” 
        
       
      
    89 I would agree with this analysis with one exception. It seems to me that, consistently with decided authority, the evidence of the statement made by B referred to above may be examined alongside other evidence in the proceedings, including a body of circumstantial evidence, to determine whether the common purpose existed, its participants, and its scope. In that sense, the statement is admissible against C, although it cannot be used to prove the participation of C in the agreement unless the process in s 87(1)(c) is followed and satisfied. 
     
      
    90 As to this process, Gray J discussed it at 340 (54). His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Some confirmation of this proposition is available from the authorities. On two occasions, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal has said that section 87(1)(c) of the  
        Evidence Act 
         1995 (NSW) reproduces the pre-existing common law (see  
        R v MacRaild 
         and  
        R v Watt 
        ). The pre-existing common law is found in  
        Tripodi v The Queen 
         and  
        Ahern v The Queen 
        . In both of these cases, the High Court of Australia made it clear that the statement by B could only be admissible against C if there were ""reasonable evidence"" establishing the existence of the common purpose, apart from the statement itself. I do not necessarily accept, as a New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal appears to have done, that the 'reasonable evidence' test is identical to the formulation 'reasonably open to find' referred by the legislature. For present purposes, however,  
        MacRaild 
         and  
        Watt 
         stand as authority for the proposition that, so far as they are consistent with the terms of section 87(1)(c) of the  
        Evidence Act 
        ,  
        Tripodi 
         and  
        Ahern 
         are to be taken as providing authority on the proper construction of that provision. It follows that section 87(1)(c) must be applied on the basis that the admissibility of B's statement as against C can only be determined by reference to evidence other than the statement itself.” 
        
       
      
    91 Again, I would demur from Gray J's analysis in one respect. It seems clear to me from the authorities to which I have made reference that B's statement may be admissible against C in proof of the existence and scope of the conspiracy in the manner I have suggested it may be used. 
     
      
    92 Interestingly enough, Gray J not only dismissed the case against the defendants who argued that no arrangements of the kind pleaded had existed, his Honour also dismissed the proceedings against the respondents who made admissions and consented to the case being decided against them on the basis that such arrangements existed. Grey J acted on the basis of Heydon JA's formulation of the test in Damberg (2001) 52 NSWLR 492, namely that the court could (and perhaps should) decline to act on admissions when there was ""reason to doubt their correctness"", or ""reason to question the correctness of the facts admitted or agreed"". 
     
      
    93 The second case of R v Hayter was well removed from the present discussion. The House of Lords were considering an appeal by Hayter following the dismissal of his appeal by the Court of Appeal against conviction for murder. The principal point at issue was whether the confession of a defendant was inadmissible in a joint criminal case against a co-defendant. Three persons had been charged with murder. All three were indicted as principals. The judge invited the jury to consider in logical phases the cases against, first, the alleged killer; then, secondly, against the woman who procured the killing, and finally against the middle man. The judge directed the jury that, only if they found both the actual gunman and the woman who arranged the killing guilty of murder, would it be open to them, taking into account those findings of guilt, together with other evidence against the middle man, to convict the middle man Hayter. The jury convicted all three defendants of murder. 
     
      
    94 The majority of the House of Lords confirmed that the judge had correctly directed the jury that the confession of the killer was irrelevant and inadmissible in the case against the other defendants. It also found that in subsequent directions to the jury as to how the jury might sequentially reason from the guilt of the killer and the woman who procured the murder to the guilt of the middle man, did not involve error. 
     
      
    95 I have read carefully the passages Mr Scragg referred me to during the oral against, especially the reference to Keane’s Modern Law of Evidence. I do not find, however, that there is anything in the decision that persuades me to take a different view of the settled principles established by Australian authority. 
     
      
    96 Finally, there were a number of authorities referred to by Messrs Waterstreet and Lange in one of their written submissions in reply. The propositions they sough to draw might best be exemplified by the remarks in R v Moore (1988) 25 A Crim R 302, 310 per McPherson J: - 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence of statements or declarations by one conspirator may on some occasions be admissible against another in the character of original evidence of conspiracy, provided however that the relevant statement or declaration is made  
        in furtherance of the purpose of the conspiracy 
        , and is not merely a narrative account of a past event: see Finn and Niblock [1985] 1 Qd R 212 at 214-215, and authorities cited there.” 
        
       
      
    97 These remarks, it might be respectfully observed, are quite at variance with the observations of the High Court in Ahern’s case. They fail to reflect the distinction the High Court (and subsequently the New South Court of Criminal Appeal) thought of such critical importance. In any event, pre Ahern judgments are, in my view, of little assistance. Indeed, in the light of the settled principles established in Ahern, such remarks are apt to positively mislead. 
     
      
       
      Application of these principles to the present trial 
       
      
    98 I propose now to move from a theoretical consideration of the relevant principles, applicable generally to a conspiracy trial, to examine the way in which they should be applied to the controversy that has arisen in the present pre-trial application. Such an approach may best be understood against the background of an example. Let me take the example of the “maximum damage” statements made by Benbrika on 23 February 2005. It will be recalled that Hasan and Sharrouf travelled to Melbourne on that day and met with Benbrika at his home. There were discussions about the CD entitled “A Guide for the Mujahideen” and discussions about another book entitled “Martyrdom Operations”. While at Benbrika’s home, there was a discussion among those present about purchasing or ordering laboratory equipment from Haines. This is relied on by the Crown as an overt act referable to the alleged conspiracy. In that regard, the discussion correlated with a handwritten list of an order which was ultimately placed with Haines on 2 June 2005. The order was placed by way of a FAX sent to Haines from a pharmacy at Hoppers Crossing, Victoria. A handwritten list of these items, with connections to both Hasan and Joud, was found at Joud’s premises during the execution of a search warrant on 22 June 2005. There was also a connection between the phone used in a follow up call and Hasan. A receipt for this telephone was located at Hasan’s premises on 27 June 2005 during the execution of a search warrant. The Crown alleged that the telephone service was later shown to be used by Hasan in making enquiries which was said to be in furtherance of the conspiracy. Finally, the address given for the telephone service, when it was initiated, was at Hopper Crossing, being an address at the same street and suburb as Joud’s premises. 
     
      
    99 I will, for the purposes of this analysis, assume that the Crown case is capable of showing, in a general way, that the accused, or some of them, were receiving advice, spiritual and otherwise, from Benbrika. I will also assume that the evidence is capable, again in a general sense, of suggesting that the Melbourne group were supplying at least some of the Sydney accused with extremist material or material expressing shared Islam views. For the moment, I will also assume that this includes material or information of the kind found at Joud’s premises. 
     
      
    100 I return now to the “maximum damage” conversation. There is no need to repeat it. It is set out in paragraph (e) at the foot of page 4 of this judgment. I shall refer to it as “the conversation”. 
     
      
    101 Mr Dalton has argued that the conversation, if it is admissible at all, is only admissible against Sharrouf to show his state of mind. Mr Dalton argued, firstly, that not every “extremist” discussion between Benbrika and Sharrouf would be relevant to show a state of mind or an intention linked to terrorist activities. If the discussion, for example, amounted to no more than a group of men expressing political views about the presence of the Americans in Iraq or Iran, Mr Dalton argued that it would not be relevant at all. 
     
      
    102 Secondly, assuming that the conversation is relevant as showing Sharrouf’s state of mind, Mr Dalton argued that the particular conversation would not be relevant and admissible against the other conspirators. It would not be admissible against, for example, Mr Elomar. This would be so unless the co-conspirators rule had application. Mr Dalton argued that it could not apply for three reasons. First, Benbrika was not a co-conspirator. Secondly, the conversation itself could not be described as an act in furtherance of the conspiracy. Thirdly, Mr Sharrouf’s state of mind could not be used as evidence of an “admission” by the other men of their state of mind. 
     
      
    103 Finally, Mr Dalton argued that it could not be admissible against the other conspirators to show the nature and scope of the conspiracy because it was not an act done in furtherance, or in pursuance of, the conspiracy. This was the “qualification”, argued by Mr Dalton. In his final written submissions, counsel argued that the evidence of the conversation with Benbrika was not a conversation “in relation to Sharrouf’s advancement of the crime” and therefore, it could not be evidence relevant to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. It could not be evidence of the state of mind of the other alleged co-conspirators because, to use it in that way, would be to use it a hearsay manner and that would be prohibited. 
     
      
    104 I am unable to agree with Mr Dalton’s arguments for a number of reasons. 
     
      
    105 In the first place, while the conversation may tell us something about Benbrika, it is not, in terms of the Evidence Act, an admission because Benbrika is not a defendant in the trial. Secondly, it may be, as Mr Dalton has argued, that the conversation is relevant to Sharrouf’s state of mind. For that matter, it may also be relevant to Hasan’s state of mind. Arguably, Hasan was present in the room during this part of the conversation. On the other hand, there is no indication from the conversation itself to indicate that either Sharrouf or Hasan endorsed, adopted, or accepted the views expressed by Benbrika in the conversation. In regard to the state of mind of persons other than Benbrika present in the room, the conversation can be no more than a circumstantial fact bearing upon their respective states of mind, if that be relevant. Of itself, it would not prove a state of mind and the Crown does not necessarily rely upon it for that purpose.  
     
      
    106 Indeed, Mr Dalton’s approach is, in one sense, an illustration of “placing the cart before the horse”. Counsel says the analysis should start at the beginning by asking – is the conversation relevant to Sharrouf? I would respectfully suggest such an approach may tend to lead in the wrong direction. 
     
      
    107 The correct starting point is to examine the evidence to determine whether, if it were accepted, it could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. The test of relevance will extend not only to the elements of the offence in the light of the plea but to facts that are themselves relevant to the facts in issue. (Smith v The Queen [2001] 206 CLR 650 at (6) per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ). This test is often best approached by seeking to identify the purpose for which the tender is sought by the Crown, or the basis on which the Crown says it will advance the Crown case. The Crown wishes to tender evidence of the conversation as relevant to prove the existence and nature of the conspiracy, and as relevant to the accuseds’ intention in undertaking activities in furtherance of the conspiracy. The Crown wishes to argue that these activities took place in the context of the accused generally receiving advice and inspiration from Benbrika, he being a person who supported and promoted violent jihad as part of his preachings in relation to the theology of Islam.  
     
      
    108 Further, the Crown argues that these activities were undertaken in the context where there was a sharing between Benbrika, and others who reflected his view, of religious material, excluding extremist material. Indeed, the Crown will endeavour to prove that, at least in one instance, there was a sharing of information contained in instructional material held by one of the Melbourne group. Importantly, part of the context, according to the Crown case, is that there is evidence of actual facilitation where some of the Melbourne group assisted the Sydney group in relation to attempts to obtain large quantities of laboratory equipment. Finally, the Crown case is that, if it be the defence position that the various actions alleged to be in furtherance of the conspiracy were actions taken on an innocent basis, the Melbourne evidence (including the conversation) is relevant to rebut this as a hypothesis consistent with innocence, and relevant to support the position contended for by the Crown. 
     
      
    109 Applying the Evidence Act test of relevance to the conversation, in the light of the manner in which the Crown will contend that the Melbourne evidence generally may be used in the trial, it will be seen that it is the relationship itself between Benbrika and the accused that brings about a situation where the conversation may properly be regarded as relevant. The relationship is one evidenced by the duration, frequency and content of the association between Benbrika and many of the accused on the other. It is that relationship, being one of religious and spiritual guidance, that makes relevant the fundamentalist attitudes expressed both publicly and privately by Benbrika. The relationship is one of spiritual guidance in connection with his views on the dictates of Islam. To Benbrika, jihad is a fundamental precept of his religion. This he makes clear in the interview in the 7.30 Report on the ABC in August 2005. He is an admirer and supported of Osama bin Laden. He does not tolerate other religions. Benbrika is what sections of the media have loosely described as “a fire brand cleric”. Tacitly, he appears to approve of the September 11 destruction of the Twin Towers and the loss of American civilian lives. He is reluctant to ascribe blame to Al-Quaeda, but if they were the perpetrators, their actions were justified. 
     
      
    110 It is clear that the relationship does not prove by itself the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. Nor does the conversation. The conversation, and indeed, the relationship, are but part of an overall circumstantial case that includes the actions of the Sydney accused themselves in ordering laboratory equipment, ammunition and other materials arguably connected with preparation for a terrorist act or acts. It includes as well their possession of extremist material supporting jihad. The nature of the association, in my opinion, is relevant as a circumstantial fact, in proof of the existence and scope of the conspiracy. The accused are men with strong religious views about their faith. They hold strong views about events relating to Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere. They are disconcerted by the attention paid to them by police and other authorities. They look to Benbrika as a religious leader.  
     
      
    111 The conversation may also be relevant (although I make no decision at this stage) as part of an act done in furtherance of the conspiracy. The conversation, after all, occurred as part of a wider discussion, which included aspects of religious guidance in the context of Islamic history. It occurred in the context of references to Islamic history including military action, warfare and martyrdom. It included the discussions referrable to a plan to organise an order for the supply to the Sydney accused of a large volume of laboratory equipment. The ordering of the laboratory equipment is alleged by the Crown to be an overt act within the conspiracy. Indeed, the general relevance of evidence relating to that act (including discussion about it) is, subject to some arguments about exclusion under s 137, not seriously put in issue by the accused. Whether the conversation might be relevant in this further way, I shall put to one side. The application of the co-conspirator’s rule will normally be considered at the close of the Crown case. 
     
      
    112 I return, however, to the primary basis on which the evidence of the conversation is sought to be adduced by the Crown. It is, as I have said, in the context of the relationship between Benbrika and the Sydney accused. It is in the context of his providing spiritual guidance over an extended period of time. The fact that the spiritual guidance is, on a number of occasions, focused on guidance about religious matters that do not extend to the waging of jihad is beside the point. It is the nature of the relationship that makes the evidence of Benbrika’s public and private espousal of violent jihad relevant to the facts in issue, and especially to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. 
     
      
    113 The conversation is not an admission by Sharrouf, Hasan or anyone else present on the February occasion. In so far as the evidence might be capable of reflecting on the state of mind of Hasan and Sharrouf, it is not tendered at this stage as an admission against them or, for that matter, against any of the other men. As to the state of mind of Sharrouf and Hasan, it is no more than a piece of circumstantial evidence. Indeed, as presently minded, I would think that the admission of the evidence might properly be accompanied by a direction indicating that it is not to be relied upon as an admission and that it is not being tendered for any hearsay purpose. If s 60 of the Evidence Act requires that a limitation be imposed on the tender of the evidence, that can be achieved pursuant to s 136 of the Evidence Act. The question of directions, however, is essentially one for the future. I intend to indicate no more than that directions of the kinds I have in have mentioned (and others as well) may well be appropriate when further consideration is given to the issue.  
     
      
    114 For the moment, I am content to state that, in my opinion, the evidence is at least relevant as going to proof of the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy in the way I have indicated. It needs to be borne in mind that the essential nature of the Crown case suggests that Benbrika, Joud (and perhaps others in Melbourne) were facilitators, in a general sense, of the objects of the Sydney conspiracy. One aspect of Benbrika’s position was to facilitate it especially by the provision of a wide range of spiritual guidance and inspiration. The Melbourne men provided material to the Sydney group and, at least in one instance, it is to be inferred, they provided or passed on instructional material or information (the Joud material) to them. The Crown case, as I have said, suggests that an appropriate inference may be drawn from Benbrika’s many communications with Sharrouf, his visits to Sydney, their visits to him, his giving of sermons and religious instructions (both publicly and privately) to them, that his extremist views were of value to the Sydney conspiracy. In this latter regard, the Crown case, in connection with the Melbourne men, likens the identified aspects of the Melbourne link to the extremist and instructional material found and seized from the Sydney men themselves. In that sense, it is material which points, at least, to the existence of the alleged conspiracy but particularly to its connection with violent extremism and violent jihad. The conversation presently under discussion fits into that category. 
     
      
    115 I appreciate that Ms Yehia, for example, has argued that, when one has regards to its precise context, the conversation does not have the weight sought to be attributed to it by the Crown. Ms Yehia argued that the outburst, if it might be so described, was in relation to the consequences of breaching Sharia law in an Islamic state. It was not in relation to committing an act of terrorism or any violence on Australian soil, or in a foreign country. The Crown, of course, argues that the conversation must be seen in its wider context. This includes the context that there was a range of spiritual matters being discussed during the evening, and there were extensive discussions about the ordering of laboratory equipment from Haines. These are each valid arguments for consideration but they really raise, in my opinion, a jury question. The question of the weight to be attached to the evidence, and whether it has any significance at all in an evaluation of the overall Crown circumstantial case is entirely a matter for the jury. That consideration does not have a bearing on its relevance nor does it impact upon its admissibility. 
     
      
    116 Messrs Waterstreet and Lange argued that much of the Melbourne evidence is being relied upon by the Crown as tendency evidence. In my opinion, it cannot be regarded as tendency evidence. Section 97 of the Evidence Act has no application at all. The ""relationship"" between Benbrika and the Sydney men (providing spiritual guidance and inspiration) makes relevant to the facts in issue in the trial the cleric's extremist/fundamentalist views. The ""relationship"" between some of the Melbourne men and a number of the Sydney accused (facilitating acts in furtherance of the conspiracy - the Haines order; and participating in an act of furtherance - Curranyalpa) flesh out and circumstantially enliven the actions of the Sydney accused. The Melbourne evidence is not evidence of previous conduct or of a previous state of mind (McIlwaine v Ramsay Food Packaging Pty Limited [2006] FCA 828). Rather, it is directly circumstantial in proof of actions which themselves may in turn point to the existence of a conspiracy, its nature and scope, and perhaps to its implementation by the accused.  
     
      
    117 The point needs also to be emphasised that evidence of the conversation (if I may return to that example) is relevant and admissible against all of the accused and not just the person or persons present when it occurred. It is relevant to the nature and scope of the conspiracy. The point is made clear by the authorities I have discussed earlier in these reasons. It is, in terms of the Evidence Act, provisionally relevant, provided there is subsequent evidence of a common purpose and evidence of the participation of each of those accused in the conspiracy. The conversation is ""provisionally relevant"" against each of the accused because it has the capacity, along with the other material in the Crown case, to give context and colour to the activities of each of the accused. It has the capacity to impact upon the question as to whether those activities were innocent day-to-day activities, or whether they were infected with fundamentalist notions. The evidence will cease to have relevance against a particular accused if there is no evidence of participation by that person, or if the jury is not satisfied that any such activity is referable to the agreement alleged by the Crown.  
     
      
    118 One further point needs to be made. The relevance of the conversation against a particular accused does not depend upon the frequency of contact between Benbrika and that accused. A few examples will make the point. Perhaps at the furthest extreme is the situation of Mr Mulahalilovic. I approach this matter with caution because I have not heard any separate submissions from Mr Turnbull on his client's behalf. It appears, however, from a preliminary reading of the Crown case, that Mulahalilovic came to the alleged conspiracy late in the piece. He does not appear to have had much, if any, contact with Benbrika. In my opinion, however, the conversation would be both relevant and admissible in the case against Mulahalilovic but limited, for the present, to being a piece of circumstantial evidence in proof of the existence and scope of the conspiracy. If there were subsequent evidence of Mulahalilovic's participation in acts that may be said to be in furtherance of the conspiracy, the Benbrika conversation may be used by the jury, along with other evidence, as relevant to its understanding as to whether a conspiracy existed and as to whether Mr Mulahalilovic's actions were referable to that conspiracy and within its scope.  
     
      
    119 A second example is the situation of Mr Jamal: He, by way of contrast with Mulahalilovic, had a reasonable level of connection with Benbrika. There is evidence to show, for example, that Benbrika valued Jamal's services in relation to his computer prowess; and that Jamal sought spiritual guidance from Benbrika in relation to aspects of strict Islamic law. On one occasion, Jamal brought Benbrika from Melbourne to Sydney to enable the cleric to give lessons to Sydney followers. This evidence is contained in the telephone intercepts under debate in the present application.  
     
      
    120 The ""maximum damage"" conversation would be relevant against Jamal, in the same way as it is against Mulahalilovic. As I have endeavoured to explain, its relevance arises notwithstanding that Jamal was not present when the conversation occurred. Equally, its relevance is not dispelled by any analysis of the number of contacts between Jamal and Benbrika, even though there were a number of those. The telephone intercepts involving Jamal would be relevant against him, not to constitute any admission on his part, but to show as a circumstantial fact that he (and no doubt others) did value Benbrika as a religious guide and inspiration. That fact, if it were circumstantially established, would reinforce the relevance of the February 2005 conversation as admissible against him, as it is against the other alleged conspirators.  
     
      
    121 The telephone intercepts between Jamal and Benbrika are themselves relevant and admissible against the other conspirators. Once again, they are not relevant because they are an admission by Jamal, but because they are relevant to the existence and scope of the conspiracy.  
     
      
    122 These comments concerning Jamal apply with equal, if not greater, force to the position of Khaled Cheikho and to the submissions made on his behalf. His involvement with Benbrika was perhaps less than that of Jamal, but it was not insubstantial. Moreover, he was at a camping trip with three of the Melbourne men, including Joud, who was closely involved with the Haines order. There are many facts, some for and some against, which may strengthen or weaken the level of association between a particular accused and Benbrika and his Melbourne associates. Those facts will no doubt be relevant as matters of jury address to test the strength or weakness of the Crown circumstantial case against each accused. I have no doubt that there will be vigorous debate in the trial about matters of that kind. Arguments about the strength or weakness of individual circumstantial facts, however, do not impair the anterior question of relevance and admissibility of the Melbourne evidence, including telephone calls and association relevant to the existence of the Sydney/Melbourne relationship.  
     
      
    123 It will be apparent from my remarks that I accept there is evidence capable of showing that many of the accused did look to Benbrika as a religious guide and valued the inspiration of his spiritual leadership. This appears from the listening devices and the telephone intercepts. It appears from other factual material which I have already touched upon. It appears as well from the wider chronology I will shortly set out in these reasons when examining in a little more detail the listening device and telephone intercept material.  
     
      
    124 For example, if one turns to Exhibit “F”, it will be seen to contain a considerable number of conversations between some of the accused. In those conversations, the accused are speaking to one another about Benbrika or his attendances in Sydney. These conversations provide but one firm basis for a finding that Benbrika was used by the Sydney men as a source of guidance and inspiration. In that regard, it is not necessary to identify each illustration of that kind as involving Benbrika in providing guidance as to “terrorist activities”, that is, activities involving the destruction of people or properties. It is sufficient, in my opinion, that the evidence shows the general provision of religious guidance and instruction in relation to a fundamentalist or strict approach to the application of Sharia law to Muslims.  
     
      
    125 It will also be apparent from these reasons that I accept that there was a level of sharing of material between Melbourne and Sydney. Many of the conversations show this to be so. The sharing related not only to hard copy publications, but extended to Internet communication and the possibility of sharing facilities such as Paltalk facilities and the like.  
     
      
    126 As Ms Yehia has argued, it is true that the evidence does not directly demonstrate, with some possible exceptions, that the shared material was necessarily extremist (i.e. terrorist related) or instructional. As Ms Yehia pointed out, sometimes it is not possible to know precisely the nature of the material being shared or being discussed as potentially available for sharing. But, once again, the sharing of material, whether fundamentalist or not, is proffered as a circumstantial fact in the Crown case. The prosecution will argue, no doubt, that it was unlikely the men were sharing information about sporting events or cooking recipes. The defence will respond, no doubt, that this is not good enough and that the facts in this regard may lead nowhere in the Crown case. These differences of approach, are, once again, matters of jury address. They do not impinge, in my view, upon relevance and admissibility. In any event, there is clearly a body of evidence that suggests that the sharing of material between the Sydney and Melbourne men often had a fundamentalist character. The material found in the possession of each of the accused is also of that character. In addition, there is ample evidence of a commonality of such material held by a number of the accused. Consequently, the nature of the relationship between the Melbourne group and the Sydney men is capable of providing a relevant context against which to judge the facts in issue in the trial.  
     
      
    127 Finally, it will be apparent that in analysing the relevance and admissibility of the conversation, I have in effect rejected Mr Dalton’s suggested qualification of the general principles. In addition, I am satisfied that the conversation does not, for the reasons I have given, constitute an admission nor is it being tendered for a hearsay purpose. It is not tendency evidence. It is simply a circumstantial fact which, together with other material, may be assessed by the jury in its overall evaluation of the Crown case in determining whether the Crown has proved the existence of the alleged agreement beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    128 I will shortly turn to an examination of the detailed material in Exhibits “A” and “B”. These are the folders containing the listening device and telephone intercept material. Before so doing, I will address Mr Dalton's arguments relating to evidence falling into the first, third and fourth categories he identified in his written submissions. They can be addressed without descending into the detail necessary to resolve the differences between the parties in relation to the listening device and telephone intercept material relating to Mr Dalton’s second category (Annexure 2 material).  
     
      
       
      Category 1 
       
      
    129 This relates to overt acts 10, 12, 19, 20, 21 and 26. There were a group of further overt acts subsequently brought into the argument, but I will deal with those separately when I deal with category 3. Overt act 10 relates to the listening device conversation concerning the ordering of laboratory equipment from Haines Educational. On 23 February 2005, at about 10.12pm, Hasan and Sharrouf are alleged to have discussed an order for laboratory equipment from Haines Educational. The discussion took place at Benbrika's house in Melbourne. Overt act 12 relates to the camping trip at Curranyalpa. The Crown alleges that three of the Melbourne men participated in that camping trip. Overt acts 19 and 20 relate to, first, a discussion between Hasan and Elomar regarding the preparation of an order for laboratory equipment from Haines Learning. Secondly, later that day there was a further discussion involving the same two men, but including as well Sharrouf, Joud and Benbrika.  
     
      
    130 Overt act 21 involves the sending of the order fax to Haines from a pharmacy which was situated a short distance from Joud's premises. Overt act 26 concerns the telephone number related to the Haines order. This had been activated in a false name and the address of the ""subscriber"" was in the same street and suburb as Joud's residence. A receipt for the phone was later found at Hasan's premises.  
     
      
    131 Mr Dalton confirmed, in his oral submissions, that there was no challenge to the relevance of the evidence underlying each of these overt acts for present purposes. The real concern was with the identification of Benbrika and the other Melbourne men, and with the fact that they came from Melbourne. The concern related to the trial of those men which is currently under way in the Melbourne Supreme Court.  
     
      
    132 The issue is whether s 137 requires the exclusion of the evidence because the jury in the present trial will be likely to make the wrong use of publicity emanating from the Melbourne trial. This is particularly likely to be the case, it was argued, should the Melbourne trial result in a conviction and should it conclude at or after the time the Sydney trial commences.  
     
      
    133 I accept that there is a genuine concern involved in this aspect of the defence submissions. It is probably too early at this stage to make a final decision about the outcome of the argument. Much will depend upon the timing of the conclusion of the Melbourne trial and the commencement of our own. If I assume, as I think I probably can, that the Sydney trial will not begin until about September, how will that affect the position? The best indication I have at the moment is that the Melbourne trial may finish in June 2008. In my opinion, the position is simply too uncertain to make a final decision about these contingencies at the present time.  
     
      
    134 I will say this: If the timing of the Melbourne trial throws into very close juxtaposition the commencement of our own trial, I would incline to the view that the use of the names of the Melbourne men ought be altered or shortened in some way to minimise the question of prejudice. I agree entirely with the Crown submission that appropriate directions to the jury to confine themselves to the evidence in this trial will be respected by the jury and obeyed. I have no doubt about that. It is my conviction, having been involved now in many criminal trials over the last eight years as a trial Judge. Prejudice and bias are difficult creatures to harness, however, and I do not consider that the Court should be restricted to the use of but one weapon in its armoury. It is for that reason that, depending on the way events turn out, I consider that some ""editing"" of the identity of the relevant Melbourne men may well be desirable. I put it no higher than that at the present time.  
     
      
    135 I propose to leave it to the parties, however, to discuss and agree about the form any such editing or cloaking of identity should take. I would expect the parties to agree to a sensible compromise. I will intervene if that is not possible, but that intervention should be left until the appropriate time, if it be necessary. I do not consider that the “admissions” drafted by Mr Dalton SC, helpful though they have been in considering this aspect of the argument, should be foisted on the Crown if it is unwilling to consent to that course. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Category 3 
       
      
    136 I have earlier set out the documents that were found in Joud's possession during the Melbourne search on 17 September 2004. Both Mr Dalton and Mr Buscombe, especially, have argued that there is simply no inference available to suggest that the documents seized were in fact utilised by the accused as resource material for their own endeavours to purchase ""weapon caching materials"" during the latter part of 2005. Secondly, Mr Dalton has argued that, if the Court is of the view that the seized material is relevant to the activities of the accused, s 137 would require its exclusion or the application of some form of cloaking the identity of Joud, and perhaps his geographical location.  
     
      
    137 Mr Buscombe made a point that, prior to the seizure, there had been but one telephone call between Joud and any of the alleged conspirators. That call occurred on 17 September 2004. It involved Mr Atik, Mr Sharrouf and Mr Joud. It was, Mr Buscombe said, an innocuous call. Secondly, Mr Buscombe pointed to the fact that the documents found on the computer were seized on 17 September 2004, but were never returned to Mr Joud. In those circumstances, Mr Buscombe submitted no inference could be drawn at all of any connection between the information in the seized documents and the activities of some of the accused late in the following year.  
     
      
    138 As might be expected, the Crown took a completely different view of the evidence. The Crown stressed that the activities of the accused in late 2005 were very focused and deliberate. The items purchased, according to the Crown case, were precisely the type of items referred to in the Joud manual necessary for weapon caching purposes and making pipe bombs. The Crown also pointed to the fact that, despite the arrest of the accused on 8 November 2005, the authorities have never found many of the items purchased, nor have they found the significant amount of ammunition that had been purchased. Whether the manual was physically provided to one of the Sydney accused, or whether the information was passed to one or more of them, the Crown argued, is neither here nor there. The Crown suggested that there was in fact “an overwhelming inference” that the accused obtained information from Joud in relation to their activities in late 2005.  
     
      
    139 My present task is simply to assess relevance. I would hold that the evidence sought to be adduced by the Crown of the seizure of the material in Joud's possession is relevant. As to the strength of the inference sought to be drawn, that will be a matter for the jury. Both the Crown and Mr Buscombe have respectable arguments in that regard, and it is not a matter about which the Court should express a view. I would simply hold that the evidence is relevant and admissible.  
     
      
    140 So far as s 137 is concerned, I would make the same remarks that I have made in relation to the earlier overt acts. Finally, there is no need for me to separately list or address the additional overt acts relied on by the Crown. They in fact fall within this category and the ruling I have made will encompass the relevance of the Joud seizure with those overt acts which essentially related to the purchase of the material said to be weapon caching items. 
     
      
       
      Category 4 
       
      
    141 This relates to the visit by Touma, Elomar and Hasan to the vicinity of the nuclear facility at Lucas Heights on 28 December 2004. At approximately 10.30pm they were stopped by police in Touma's vehicle. The men had in their possession a trail bike which they maintained they were in the area to ride. A box of latex gloves was also found in the vehicle. The Crown has made it clear that it does not intend to suggest the men were in the vicinity of the nuclear facility for the purposes of contemplating an attack on the facility. The relevance of the incident is the fact and nature of the police stoppage and search, and the fact that the next day at approximately 9am, Hasan is alleged to have arrived unannounced at Benbrika's home in Melbourne wanting to speak to him. After a brief discussion, arrangements were made for Hasan and Benbrika to meet in a park. The Crown says this was done so that they could have a discussion which would not be overheard. The significance of the event, according to the Crown, is that Hasan wished to inform Benbrika in a covert fashion about their apprehension by the police the previous morning.  
     
      
    142 The issue about terrorist plots against the nuclear facility at Lucas Heights is one that has generated considerable media interest and hype. Since the Crown makes no allegation that the men were contemplating an attack on the nuclear facility, I consider that the reference to Lucas Heights should be withdrawn from the evidence but that the evidence might otherwise be given as relevant to the Crown case. I have discussed this with the Crown and the defence during argument in Court. There is no need for me to say anything further on the topic. There is a separate issue regarding ""voice identification"" of Mr Hasan in relation to the alleged visit to Benbrika on the day after the Lucas Heights outing. It has been agreed that this issue should be dealt with in a separate pre-trial application. This will take place separately from the present considerations. If the defence succeed in that argument, it will be necessary to reconsider the relevance of the topic. 
     
      
       
      Category 2 
       
      
    143 It is now necessary to go to the detail of Exhibits “A” and “B” to consider the submissions made in relation to the relevance and the admissibility of this material. I propose to do this in the light of the principles of law I have concluded are applicable to the present conspiracy trial. I will not, unless absolutely necessary, repeat the analysis and conclusions contained in the earlier part of the decision. I will simply go through the contested material sequentially indicating whether I will allow or exclude the material. In areas where I consider some further discussion is warranted between the parties, I will indicate that situation.  
     
      
       
      The Crown Chronology 
       
      
    144 The Crown provided me with a chronology. This is relevant to aspects of the background relied on by the Crown as part of the context of the Crown case against which the relevance of the contested material is to be assessed. This chronology (which duplicates, in part, material I have referred to at an earlier part of this decision) places the accused and their association with Benbrika and Melbourne, against the background of a number of the acts alleged by the Crown, to be acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. I will now set out details of the Crown chronology.

      On 29 August 2004, Hasan, Elomar and Moustafa Cheikho travelled by car to Melbourne where they met with Raad and Benbrika on 30 August 2004. On the night of 30 - 31 August 2004, Hasan, Elomar and Moustafa Cheikho (who was driving) travelled back from Melbourne to Sydney. The vehicle was stopped shortly after midnight at Sutton Forest by the NSW police. A quantity of camping equipment which appeared to be new (including six sleeping bags; rain coats; camouflage pattern water bottles; two camp stoves; and a small quantity of food) was found in the vehicle. When questioned by the NSW Police as to where they had travelled from, Moustafa Cheikho stated ""We’ve been to Canberra"" - ""we were looking at buying a boat"".[CCS26]

      Benbrika visited Sydney. On 31 July 2005, at 7pm, Sharrouf collected Benbrika and Jamal from Sydney Airport, and drove to the Lakemba Prayer Hall. Sharrouf drove Jamal and Benbrika to the Lakemba Prayer Hall where Hasan and Elomar were amongst the approximately 10 males seen near the Prayer Hall. The same car later drove to Khaled Cheikho’s home, and then to Sharrouf’s home arriving by about 9.43pm. [CCS151] Benbrika gave a lecture that night at Sharrouf’s house. Sharrouf, Hasan, Touma, Moustafa Cheikho, Khaled Cheikho and others were present [CCS152].  
        
      Benbrika and Khaled Cheikho were seen together on 2 August 2005 at 11.45am.

      Sharrouf telephoned Benbrika and told him he wanted to speak to him face to face. Sharrouf asked him when he was going to come to Sydney to give a lesson. Benbrika told him that he would be there that week. Benbrika was in Sydney during the period between 11 and 15 August 2005 [CCS161]. 
       
       
      11 – 15 August 2005 
       
       
      Benbrika stayed in Sydney.

KS); surveillance at Chapel Café, Bankstown on 15 August 2005 (B, H, J, KS]. At 4.36pm on 15 August 2005, Khaled Cheikho invited Touma to have dinner with Benbrika and others. Touma said the invitation  
      “pleases me very much”.  
      Touma later drove Benbrika to the airport.

      Other background matters 
       
      
    145 In addition, the Crown has provided me with a summary of telephone calls between a number of the accused. In these calls they refer to Benbrika or to arrangements, concerning Benbrika. They refer to his talks or to discussions concerning the nature of talks he has given. I will not set these details out in this decision, but they are contained, as mentioned earlier, in Exhibit “F” on the present application. Secondly, the Crown has provided me with a summary of a selection of seized media commonality documents found in the possession of various of the accused. Once again, I will not set these out, as the detail is to be found in Exhibit “H”. One or two illustrations will suffice: Moustafa Cheikho, Hasan, Jamal and Sharrouf had in their possession a document described as ""Understanding Jihad (Islamic Holy War)"" by Mufti Khubaib Sahib. Another document was a document relating to a “justification” of the suicide operation against the Jews. There are many documents that fall into this category and most of them are of an extremist kind. They were commonly possessed by a number of the accused. 
     
      
       
      Listening device material 
       
      
    146 Exhibit “A” contains a summary of the Melbourne listening device material. It contains also the full listening device transcripts relevant to 29 December 2004, 10 January 2005, 23 February 2005, 4 May 2005, 27 and 31 July 2005, 1 and 11 August 2005. I note that the summaries are said to provide “a reasonable guide” to the contents of the entire transcript, although new transcripts will be prepared in some instances. This will include some editing of the material that is presently found in the exhibited transcripts.  
     
      
    147 The first listening device transcript (10 January 2005) contains material that is reflected in the Crown case statement at para 36. On 10 January 2005 Atik and Sharrouf had a conversation during which arrangements were made for Atik to book Sharrouf's travel from Sydney to Melbourne. Later that day Sharrouf flew to Melbourne under a false name, paid for by Atik using a credit card in a false name (for reasons I have discussed in argument during Court session, I do not consider that the use of the false name and credit card on this occasion is a relevant matter). Sharrouf and Atik visited Benbrika and part of their conversation was captured in a listening device. The conversation includes guidance from Benbrika as to Sharrouf's obligations regarding jihad. 
     
      
    148 In the context of this case, I regard the conversations as more than falls within the description of ""coffee table"" talk. I consider that it is relevant on the basis that it shows Benbrika providing spiritual guidance to one of the conspirators. It is evidence admissible generally against all the accused in relation to the existence and scope of the conspiracy, having regard to the relationship between Benbrika and the conspirators, including Sharrouf. The discussion is a two sided one and, insofar as it may throw light on Sharrouf's state of mind or be relevant to his intentions, it is also admissible against him in that additional sense. If, however, the Crown intend to place reliance on Sharrouf’s state of mind (as reflected in his contribution to any of the discussions) as evidence of the existence and scope of the conspiracy, or as evidence relevant to his activities, it may be necessary to give directions as earlier foreshadowed. Directions in that regard will need to distinguish (or may need to distinguish) between the two ways in which evidence of the discussion is sought to be used. 
     
      
    149 I next come to the conversation detected by way of listening device on 23 February 2005. This conversation, and the discussions contained in it, are relevant to para 39 of the Crown case statement. On 23 February 2005 Hasan and Sharrouf travelled in Hasan's vehicle from Sydney to Melbourne to visit Benbrika. Between 7.51pm and 11.26pm Hasan and Sharrouf were at Benbrika's home. During this meeting, the men appeared to be printing material from a CD entitled ""A Guide for the Mujahideen"" and they discussed another book entitled ""Martyrdom Operations"". Later, when Joud was present, Benbrika discussed living in an Islamic state and fighting against ""them"" if their law threatens Sharia law. Benbrika then discussed “preparing the mujahideen”, and made the statements that have been described as the ""maximum damage"" passage.  
     
      
    150 Importantly, during the lengthy discussions that evening there was a discussion about purchasing or ordering laboratory equipment from Haines catalogue. In my opinion, much of the conversation is relevant and admissible. Discussion about CDs and books relating to the mujahideen fall, for reasons I have already given, into an area of relevance. Similarly, the evidence regarding the publication describing the experience of jihad ""giving the experience everything what he has seen"" is relevant. Mr Dalton made the point that some of the conversations in this area were about historical matters. For example, he referred to the discussion concerning the defeat of the Ottomans at the Gate of Vienna in 1690 and the discussion about the Russian war in Afghanistan. Mr Dalton made the point that these matters of history could have no relevance to the subject conspiracy. In my opinion, they are relevant in relation to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. They emerge both in the context of the spiritual guidance being provided by Benbrika generally, and to the sharing of information, both religious and historical, in relation to Islamic matters. Further, I consider that the lengthy discussions about printing out matters from the Internet via the computer are relevant in the way contended for by the Crown.  
     
      
    151 There are a number of separate references throughout the listening device transcript of cataloguing, pricing and writing down items from the Haines material. Those discussions are interspersed throughout the evening's discussion and it is not possible, as a matter of practicality, to separate them out and treat them as if they were completely separate from the general nature of the discussions that were had between the participants. The conversations show both Sharrouf and Hasan seeking religious guidance from Benbrika. While I agree with Mr Dalton that a lot of the material is repetitious, and it often does not seem to be about anything terribly important, it is interspersed indistinguishably with matters of relevance. There is also a reference to the advantages of use of the Internet and Paltalk. These subjects are relevant to later conversations between Benbrika and some of the accused in relation to opportunities for further religious tuition from Benbrika. They occasionally “morph” into areas of different but obvious relevance. The conversations include, for example, at page 35 Hasan saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “So that way if you password is very hard for them to take your computer...see now if you change your password every day they don't...they open...they go...they have to through many things you know to...put your password.""  
        
       
      
    152 The men then discuss the advantages of wireless Internet, its cost and availability. The latter conversations are not particularly relevant, but I mention them to show how they are interspersed indistinguishably with relevant material.  
     
      
    153 At page 38 there is discussion about police surveillance on the roads at night and later, ironically, a reference to the possibility that Benbrika's house might be ""bugged"".  
     
      
    154 Then there are discussions about heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and painting. None of that appears particularly relevant. That leads on to discussion regarding the correct way to use the laptop and the software on the computer. In turn, this leads to discussions about connection to the Internet and use of the Internet. This is clearly reference to the ability to download material. This immediately leads to a discussion about (presumably) using downloaded material to order Haines equipment from its catalogue. There are references to stock codes, quantities and pricing.  
     
      
    155 In reference to material of that kind downloaded, there was a discussion about copying it and whether Joud should take a copy of it with him. The conversation continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Joud 
        : I don't want to have anything at home. 
        
       
       
        
        Hasan 
        : What do you mean? 
        
       
       
        
        Joud 
        : Because they could come any time.""  
        
       
      
    156 There then follows a rather inaudible conversation regarding a passport, the relevance of which may be doubtful. This is followed by a discussion regarding whether the call to prayer has to be made before prayers in one's own house. This in turn led to the discussion about the situation in an Islamic state where one of the prophet's instructions for the call to prayer had been ignored. The discussion then moved to another example of the same situation, namely, where the “zakat” (arms tax) had been abolished. While it is true this leads almost directly to the ""maximum damage"" passage, it appears Benbrika may be making a wider point, since he introduces the passage by saying: ""Especially now, the best thing now is to be as a mujahideen (freedom fighter) prepared - everyone has to prepare himself et cetera"". 
     
      
    157 Immediately after the ""outburst"" Benbrika discusses, so it seems, avoiding talking to people who come to his house and who want to interview him. The continuation of the conversation seems to indicate that this may be a reference to the authorities.  
     
      
    158 A little later Joud says: ""I'll have it done by tomorrow night"". There is a dispute between the Crown and the defence as to what this might refer to. I am not prepared to say that this is an irrelevant statement.  
     
      
    159 The ""maximum damage"" passage itself is relevant as I indicated much earlier in these reasons. It is relevant against all of the accused to show the existence and scope of the conspiracy. It may be considered, together with the whole of the evidence in the Crown circumstantial case, for that purpose.  
     
      
    160 I turn then to the remaining conversations. The 4 May conversation appears to refer to the Haines order and is relevant. Elomar seeks spiritual guidance. This too is relevant. The 27 July 2005 transcript is an example of Sharrouf asking for religious guidance from Benbrika. It is relevant in the same way as other material in the 10 January 2005 conversation was relevant. I do not, however, consider that the 27 July 2005 (4.18pm) transcript is relevant. The conversation at 7.09pm is relevant as is the 8.47 conversation on that evening. In relation to the last matter, Mr Dalton asked “how this could be relevant?” Counsel submitted that the man Taj el-Din had no association with the accused in connection with the present charge. The conversation, however, is relevant. This is because it shows Moustafa Cheikho and Sharrouf placing reliance on the religious guidance of Benbrika. It also shows the three men's attitude to any Muslim who provides assistance to the authorities.  
     
      
    161 The conversations on 31 July and 1 August are also relevant. The first is a conversation between Benbrika and Sharrouf. The second is between Benbrika, Sharrouf, Touma and Khaled Cheikho. Again, these conversations show the men accepting “information” from Benbrika in two areas. First, in relation to undertaking jihad and secondly, in relation to the number of people who have converted to Islam following the attacks upon the World Trade Center. There is also discussion about a person in the Islamic community giving information against the Muslim. He who “assists the infidels is an infidel"". Finally, the listening device of August 11 is relevant in the same way as the ""maximum damage"" passage.  
     
      
    162 It is not inappropriate to refer at this stage to the Crown chronology and to the details in Exhibit “F”. I accept that this body of evidence tends to show that it could not, by any means, be conclusively said that Khaled Sharrouf was, throughout the time of the listening device intercepts, on “a frolic of his own”. The chronology shows, with some force, that he was allegedly engaged in activities pursuant to the alleged conspiracy throughout the period, as were other of the accused. Some of those events “surround” the presence or involvement of Benbrika with the Sydney accused. There is a wide-ranging connection between Benbrika and the Sydney accused, not limited to Sharrouf. There is also the presence of Joud, Raad and Sayadi at the Curranyalpa camp. I do not say the argument cannot be presented before the jury. But for the purposes of this pre-trial argument, it is not particularly persuasive. 
     
      
    163 As to the camping trip, it is to be inferred that this was an arrangement that was organised by or with the consent of the Sydney participants at that camp. That has a relevance for the presence of the Melbourne trio at the camp. As to the Haines order, there were conversations on 20 May, 26 May and 27 May in which Khaled Sharrouf had been phoning Benbrika to try and contact Joud (it will be recalled 2 June was the date of the order placed at Haines). In relation to the television interview, details are to be found in the chronology, but they include the fact that Sharrouf, Touma and Hasan were making arrangements to watch The 7.30 Report involving Benbrika and to videotape it. Shortly after Benbrika's return to Melbourne on 15 August during which time he associated with a number of the men, including Hasan, the Cheikhos, Jamal and Sharrouf, there were a number of activities which the Crown says were in furtherance of the conspiracy involving a number of the accused. Finally, Exhibit “F”, as I have said, shows a general body of endorsement by a number of the accused for the publicly expressed views promulgated by Benbrika. Baladjam and Touma, for example, call him ""a beautiful man"". It is true that this is not in the immediate context of The 7.30 Report. By the same token, it is hardly a rejection of the views he expressed on the television program. 
     
      
       
      Telephone intercepts 
       
      
    164 The Crown provided me with a schedule setting out the grouping of a large number of telephone calls. These are calls that essentially relate to communications between some of the Sydney accused and the Melbourne men. The great majority of the calls involve Sharrouf. The admissibility of the material, however, cannot be determined by acceptance of the defence submission that Sharrouf was acting on a frolic of his own. I have already addressed that submission. Once again, this view of the defence submission is not calculated to prevent a submission of that kind being put to the jury. It means no more than that it is not an effective counter to the Crown's arguments on relevance and admissibility.  
     
      
    165 The Crown has selected six groupings. The first relates to ""meetings"" and the sixth relates to a catch all category described as ""association"". Both the Crown and the defence are hopeful that some of the calls in the first group may become the subject of agreed facts. For that reason, I will dwell but briefly on that group. In relation to the last category, a number of these calls are innocuous but some objections have been raised.  
     
      
    166 The second and third groups involve ""lessons"" and ""sharing material"". Much of the argument centred around these calls, although the general views I have expressed on relevance and admissibility will make it clear, I suggest, why it is I consider that calls in this category are generally relevant and admissible.  
     
      
    167 The fourth group relates to ""awareness"". This group is said to demonstrate an awareness of the authorities, and the existence of a common concern in relation to such awareness. Generally, I accept the Crown submission that calls of this kind are both relevant and admissible.  
     
      
    168 The fifth category relates to the Haines issue. This includes calls which occurred before or after various of the visits from which an inference can be drawn, according to the Crown, that they either relate to a particular visit or they are in a code around a time relevant to the Haines incident. There is dispute about a number of these calls.  
     
      
    169 I propose to deal with the disputed calls in a brief fashion. As I have said, the general statement of principles relevant to the admission of evidence in a conspiracy case provides a clear indication as to the evidence that is, in my opinion, relevant and admissible. I shall now pass to consider individual telephone calls.  
     
      
       
      Individual telephone calls 
       
      
    · Telephone call 19 July at 7pm. In this call Sharrouf discusses possible arrangements for Benbrika to come to Sydney and give lessons. It is relevant as showing the relationship sought to be relied on by the Crown.  
     
      
    · Telephone call 23 August at 8.29pm. This shows Sharrouf obtaining a mobile telephone number from Benbrika and obtaining religious guidance - relevant.  
     
      
    · Telephone call 4 October 2004 at 5.39pm. Sharrouf contacts Atik. Atik discusses borrowing religious material from Sharrouf and making arrangements to collect Moustafa so that he can take them to the airport - relevant.

      (I have concluded that this conversation should not be excluded under s 137. It will be sufficient, if Mr Scragg requires it, than an appropriate direction be given to the jury to avoid misuse and to dispel irrelevant prejudice). 
       
       
       
       
      The 7.30 Report 
       
      
    170 On 4 August 2005, Kerry O'Brien introduced the ABC's 7.30 Report. The initial commentary was: 
     
      
       
        
        “As Australians struggle to understand the threat from Islamic militants, we are told they are living amongst us. One of the men recently targeted by ASIO here has broken his silence. Algerian-born Melbourne man Abdul Nacer Benbrika, who is also known as Abu Bakr, says that recent ASIO raids on his home and the banning of his passport earlier this year are unjust...” 
        
       
      
    171 The program broadcast several portions of an unedited interview with Benbrika. At one stage, when asked about other religions, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am telling you that my religion does not tolerate other religion, it doesn't tolerate. The only one law which needs to spread can be here or anywhere else has to be Islam.""  
        
       
      
    172 Later, when speaking of Osama bin Laden, Benbrika says: 
     
      
       
        
        “Osama bin Laden, he's a great man. Osama bin Laden was a great man before 11 September which they said he did it, and until now nobody knows who did it.""  
        
       
      
    173 And later again he was asked whether he should tell his students that they should not engage in violence, that they should not go and train, Benbrika said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If I do this, it means I am betraying my religion...this is a big problem. There are two laws, there is an Australian law, there is an Islamic law."" 
        
       
      
    174 Finally, Benbrika said: 
     
      
       
        
        “According to my religion, jihad is a part of my religion and what you have to understand that anyone who fight for the sake of Allah, the first, when he dies, the first drop of blood that comes from him out, all his sins would be forgiven.""  
        
       
      
    175 The Crown originally stated that it wanted to tender the whole of both the edited and unedited version of the Benbrika interview. Consistently with my general analysis of the law and my understanding of the Crown case, the statements of Benbrika, in my opinion, are both relevant and admissible. The jury will be entitled to take into account the extremist views expressed by Benbrika together with the whole of the evidence, in assessing the activities of the individual conspirators. These activities extend to all the overt acts, including the possession of extremist material by each of the accused. The jury will be entitled to take the 7.30 Report evidence into account because of the special relationship between Benbrika and a number of the Sydney men, if they find the relationship is one of spiritual guidance and inspiration. They may do so because of the particular relationship between the Melbourne men and the Sydney group, if they find a mutuality of sharing of Muslim literature, including fundamentalist religious literature; and if they find the facilitation and participation by Joud and others in the Haines order, Curranyalpa and other of the overt acts alleged by the Crown.  
     
      
    176 The relationship and the views expressed by Benbrika are, however, but part of the Crown circumstantial case. The evidence concerning those expressions repeated on The 7.30 Report may, subject to the caveats I have mentioned, be brought to bear by the jury, together with other material, on the activities of the accused in assessing whether the Crown has made out its case as to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. On this basis, the evidence is admissible against all the accused.  
     
      
    177 The evidence may have a wider use in due course, but, for the moment, Benbrika's views are relevant at least in the way I have indicated. His statements on The 7.30 Report, while they may tell us a great deal about his attitudes, are not admissions by the accused. They are not hearsay evidence, nor are they to be used in a hearsay fashion. They are not tendency or propensity evidence, and are not to be used as if they were. There will plainly be a need for directions to make sure that the evidence is used in the appropriate manner. I would expect, as always, a significant degree of assistance from, and cooperation between, counsel in relation to the formulation of appropriate directions.  
     
      
    178 It remains only to address a number of the arguments raised by counsel in relation to The 7.30 Report. These arguments neatly fell into two categories. The first argued that the evidence was not admissible at all. The second sought its exclusion under s 137.  
     
      
    179 One of the arguments advanced by Mr Dalton drew on his argument that evidence of this kind might be regarded, in some way, as an admission by his client and therefore might be used by the jury in a hearsay fashion. As I have said, I do not consider that the evidence is sought to be tendered as an admission by any of the accused, even by those who may have seen the program or the video made of the program. It is trite to say that many people saw the program. Indeed, we all saw the program in Court when it was shown on the screens. It could not be said that, merely by watching the program, the viewers were admitting or representing agreement with Benbrika's statements. Some people may have been in agreement with those views. Others would have regarded them as repulsive. But they are not necessarily admissions by those of the accused who may have seen them. Nor are they tendered as such, at least so far as I understand the Crown case. 
     
      
    180 In the same way, they are not relevant to the case of only the accused who did see the program. Nor, for that reason, is it incumbent upon the Crown to prove that each individual accused saw the program and agreed with the views expressed by Benbrika. Its relevance arises out of the relationship I have described. Benbrika's views are relevant only because of the relationship, and those views are relevant, for present purposes, only as to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. In that way, they are admissible against all the accused.  
     
      
    181 Mr Scragg put Mr Waterstreet's argument in a nutshell. He suggested that the Crown wanted the jury to accept that, for example, Jamal adopted Benbrika's extremist views ""simply by reason of the association"". This is obviously not the way in which the Crown suggests the evidence is relevant. Indeed, as I have said, it would be appropriate to give a direction to make sure that the evidence is not used in that way. Similarly, the Crown case is not that every time Benbrika met any of the accused, he “exploded” into an outburst of extremist propositions. That is not the Crown case at all, as I have explained.  
     
      
    182 Mr Buscombe argued that the “demeanour” of Benbrika on the ABC program was not relevant. Rather, if the listening device and telephone intercepts went into evidence, it was his demeanour during those conversations that would be relevant. Mr Buscombe's submission, however, oversimplifies the statement made by the Crown. I understood the Crown to be suggesting that the jury are entitled to see Benbrika express the views he did, so as to form their own opinion about the seriousness with which those views were held. In that regard, I think the Crown submission is correct.  
     
      
    183 Ms Yehia argued that the introduction to the program and the comments about Benbrika should not form part of the material to go before the jury. The Crown accepted that those surrounding circumstances were not relevant and that only the views of Benbrika should be placed before the jury.  
     
      
    184 The final matter relates to s 137 of the Evidence Act. Should the name of Benbrika be cloaked or made the subject of a pseudonym for the purpose of the viewing of this material? I have touched upon this in an earlier part of this decision. I will not repeat those remarks. I accept that the Crown's suggestion that Benbrika be known as ""Abu Bakr"" may be sufficient. On the other hand, depending on the timing of the commencement of the present trial, it may be necessary to consider a more obscure pseudonym. While I am generally sympathetic to the defence position on this point, I continue to maintain that a jury will pay heed to and respect a direction given by a Judge that the trial is to be determined by reference only to the evidence given in the courtroom, and is not to be influenced by outside publicity, whether relating to this trial or any other trial.  
     
      
    185 For those reasons I propose, in general terms, to allow the Melbourne material

      JUDGMENT - Application for bail - Accused Elomar; see page 1233 of transcript 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application for bail sought by Mohamed Ali Elomar. I shall refer to him in the course of this decision as the applicant.  
     
      
    2 The applicant was arrested in November 2005, and he has been in custody since that time. He is presently situated at the MRRC at Silverwater and his trial is under way, in the sense that pre-trial applications are being determined by the Court. The applicant has been charged with conspiracy to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts contrary to ss 11.5 and 101.6 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code Act 1995. This is a serious charge. The legislation in s 101.6 provides for a maximum penalty for this category of offence of imprisonment for life.  
     
      
    3 There is no contest in the present matter but that the onus falls on the applicant to show exceptional circumstances before bail can be granted. This is as a consequence of s 15AA of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). As I observed in the case of the bail application of Mohammed Omar Jamal, (as it happens one of the co-accused in the present trial), the need to show exceptional circumstances poses a significant hurdle for an applicant. The traditional notion of a presumption in favour of bail for a person facing but not convicted of, a criminal charge has undoubtedly been significantly eroded by the provisions of s 15AA of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    4 The expression ""exceptional circumstances"" has been the subject of a number of recent decisions. One of those was the decision of Osborne J in Haddara v Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (2006) VSC 8 where his Honour noted at paragraph 4: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may be that the requirement to establish 'exceptional circumstances' has the potential to operate in a harsh manner. Nevertheless, this Court is required to implement the law as enacted by Parliament and it is necessary for the applicant to satisfy the threshold requirement of 'exceptional circumstances' before the Court turns to other considerations.” 
        
       
      
    5 Osborne J noted that the concept of exceptional circumstances is necessarily a flexible one, and it is clear that it may be constituted by a combination of matters which, when examined together, render the case exceptional.  
     
      
    6 A similar approach has been taken by judges in the Supreme Court. I will just briefly refer to some of those. A similar approach was taken by Studdert J in The Queen v Cheikho, 15 May 2006, and in The Queen v Mulahalilovic, a decision of Rothman J in August 2006.  
     
      
    7 Mr Ozen referred me to other authorities. These related to the expression “exceptional circumstances” in the New South Wales legislation. The first case referred to by counsel was the decision of Johnson J in The Queen v Young (2006) NSWSC 1499. In that case at paragraph 20 Johnson J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that exceptional circumstances may be found in a case by the coincidence of a number of features. These can include features subjective to the particular applicant, features which bear upon the nature of the alleged offence and features which emphasise that, absent this particular test, the applicant is otherwise a person who will answer bail.” 
        
       
      
    8 His Honour also noted that there is a need to determine the issue of exceptional circumstances on a case-by-case examination.  
     
      
    9 The second case referred to by Mr Ozen was a decision given only two days later. It was the decision of Rothman J in The Queen v Jacobs [2008] NSWSC 417. His Honour examined the parameters of the term ""exceptional circumstances"" and drew conclusions about the general nature of the hurdles faced by an applicant that were similar to those reached by Johnson J and in the other authorities to which I have made reference.  
     
      
    10 In the present matter there is no submission made that the Crown case against Mr Elomar is not a strong one. No submissions were made to me in that regard. It has not been necessary for me to address that aspect of the matter.  
     
      
    11 The “exceptional circumstances” relied upon in this matter appear clearly enough from the affidavit of Kate Kroon sworn 28 May 2008, and from the material annexed to that affidavit. Ms Kroon states in the affidavit that last Saturday she was contacted by the applicant's niece. She was informed that the applicant's mother had suffered a stroke and was in Bankstown Hospital. Thereafter, according to Ms Kroon, there were a number of contacts and attempted contacts with Mr Mick Hovey, the Corrective Services liaison person assigned to the applicant's case at Silverwater. The purpose of these calls was to see whether an escorted hospital visit could be arranged between the applicant and his mother. As at yesterday at lunchtime that had not been achieved, and it was in those circumstances that the Court was informed that a bail application would be made.  
     
      
    12 Annexed to the affidavit of Ms Kroon are two reports. The first in point of time, as I understand it, is from Dr Tien Chu. He is the Geriatric Registrar at Bankstown Lidcombe Hospital, the hospital operating under the auspices of Sydney Southwest Health Service. Dr Chu confirms that the applicant's mother was admitted to hospital on 23 May 2008 having suffered a major cerebral vascular accident. This was complicated by severe aspiration pneumonia. Her condition was made even more serious due to her background of renal transplant and immuno suppressive therapy. Dr Chu said that the applicant's mother was currently being treated in the hospital in Ward 2B.  
     
      
    13 The second medical report is an update. It is dated 28 May 2008. Once again, it is from Dr Chu, who confirms that the applicant's mother is still an inpatient at the hospital. He says, however, that her condition is “serious and critical with a likely poor outcome”.  
     
      
    14 Mr Ozen made no bones about the meaning of this last update. He said that it really is a certificate which indicates that the applicant's mother will not survive and is likely to pass away probably fairly soon.  
     
      
    15 The facts I have indicated in that material comprise, in essence, the exceptional circumstances relied upon by the applicant. Mr Ozen has put it quite bluntly. He says that unless bail is granted the applicant will not see his mother again.  
     
      
    16 I should mention that the Department of Corrective Services, quite apart from any recommendation I may have made, came to an independent decision to allow the applicant to see his mother in the hospital. A window of opportunity presented itself yesterday evening for that to occur. It is obvious enough, I suppose, that the applicant's position, the charges he faces, the classification he is under, and the generally emotive nature of the situation involving his mother could well involve security difficulties. Conscious of those difficulties, the Department apparently took advantage of the window of opportunity that presented itself yesterday and the applicant was able to see his mother yesterday evening, albeit for a fairly brief period of time, about twenty minutes.  
     
      
    17 Against the background of that visit, Mr Ozen developed his submission and said that this visit may be, unless bail is granted, the last time the applicant will see his mother alive. 
     
      
    18 Mr Ozen took me to the provisions of the New South Wales Bail Act 1978 and in particular to s 7. He pointed to the fact that bail may be granted to enable a person to remain at liberty “until the person is required to appear before a Court in accordance with the person's undertaking”. He argued that the language was sufficiently wide to allow what might be described as the grant of short-term bail. Mr 0zen, in that context, submitted that if bail were granted here, it would really be bail for a very short period of time, perhaps a matter of hours. So the threshold or subsidiary question is whether the Bail Act should be interpreted in that way. I must say that it is my view that the Bail Act should not be interpreted in that fashion. It appears to me that the Act does not contemplate short-term bail being granted. Bail should not, in general terms, be used to allow a visit or visits to a sick or dying relative or friend. I do not think, as a matter of policy, that such a construction is either desirable or appropriate. It should remain the province, I think, of the Department of Corrective Services to make decisions as to whether to allow an inmate who has been bail denied, to visit a sick or dying relative or friend. It is a difficult decision; and one would hope that it is one that is made with a degree of compassion, as indeed it seems to have been made in the present case. But I put to one side that consideration. It is not necessary, however, to make a final decision about the construction of the legislation. I think I have sufficiently indicated that I am not overly impressed or in favour of such an interpretation, for the reasons I have mentioned.  
     
      
    19 The real issue here though is whether exceptional circumstances have been shown. In my view, while I have considerable sympathy for the position of the applicant, exceptional circumstances have not been demonstrated. The prospect of the death of a close relative is not in a general sense an exceptional circumstance. Illness and death, sadly enough, are the common lot of all of us. It is something that is as much a part of our experience as any other factor of life; birth illness and death are on the common pathway trod by all human beings.  
     
      
    20 In any event, as I have pointed out, the applicant was given the opportunity and grasped it yesterday to see his mother. He was given the opportunity to say goodbye to his mother. It is sad that, perhaps, that made the visit harder for him, but I suppose one can only observe that even if he were given a second visit today for a short period of time, that too would not be suffice. The applicant might well come away from a second visit feeling a similar sense of frustration and disappointment. But this is perhaps speculation on my part. I am simply pointing to the fact that a visit was allowed and that, although it is unlikely that a further visit will occur before his mother's death, that situation does not in itself amount to exceptional circumstances in this case.  
     
      
    21 I would only add that, whilst I have said that it is the province of the Department to make decisions about whether an inmate should be permitted to visit a sick or dying relative, if the fact be that the applicant's mother does linger on, and if a window of opportunity were to present itself a second time, I would hope that the Department would give him the opportunity to see his mother once again.  
     
      
    22 For those reasons I refuse the bail application.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Magdi Boulos appealed, pursuant to s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act, against an interlocutory judgment by her Honour Judge Murrell in the District Court on 20 March 2008, refusing an application by the appellant for a permanent stay of criminal charges against him contained in an indictment which the Crown proposes to present at a trial of the appellant, a copy of which was enclosed with a letter dated 15 October 2007 from the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions to the appellant’s solicitors. On 27 March 2008 Judge Murrell gave a certificate that her judgment was a proper one for determination on appeal and accordingly an appeal lay to this Court, without the need for this Court to grant leave to appeal.  
     
      
    2 The indictment the Crown proposes to present at the trial of the appellant contains 10 counts, each charging an offence under s 29D (since repealed) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. These charges are different from the charges on which the appellant was committed for trial, which were charges under s 5 of the Crimes Act (also since repealed) and s 29D of the Crimes Act, alleging that the appellant was knowingly concerned in a company named Brendons Advanced Technology Pty Limited (“BAT”) defrauding the Commonwealth. However, the present charges and the charges on which the appellant was committed for trial are substantially similar. 
     
      
    3 The conduct of the appellant on which the charges are based is alleged to have occurred within various periods between about 25 January 1993 and about 11 February 1994. The amounts of which the appellant is alleged to have defrauded the Commonwealth range from $83,300 (count 2) to $188,222.40 (count 3) and total $1,140,789. 
     
      
    4 The evidence before the primary judge consisted of:-1. An affidavit by the appellant’s solicitor, to which were exhibited eight folders of documents 2. A further affidavit by the appellant’s solicitor to which was exhibited another folder of documents3. An affidavit by a solicitor employed by the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions 4. Some documentary exhibits 
     
      
       
      There was no affidavit from the appellant himself. Not all of the documentary evidence which was before Judge Murrell is before this Court. 
       
      
    5 The principal persons and companies involved and the events leading up to the bringing of the charges against the appellant were concisely and accurately summarised by her Honour in pars 3 and 4 of her judgment, which were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “3 Computer World Solutions (CWS) and Trio International (Trio) were computer trading companies that were part of a group of companies under the applicant’s effective control. Mr Andrews was the internal accountant and financial controller for the Boulos group of companies. He had shares in CWS and Trio. Brendons Advanced Technology Pty Ltd (BAT) was one of the applicant’s private investment companies. Mr Norman was BAT’s accountant. IDB Satellite (IDB) was an unrelated company that had discussed joining the Boulos group. Mr Andrews had access to IDB documents. 
        
       
       
        
        4 Between January 1993 and February 1994, BAT lodged with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) ten sales tax refund applications, seeking a total of $1,140,789. Each refund application was supported by an invoice from CWS, asserting that BAT had purchased computers from CWS for a tax-inclusive price, and a purchase order from either Trio or IDB, alleging that BAT had onsold the computers for a tax-exclusive price (as Trio and IDB were not required to pay sales tax). The applications sought a refund of sales tax paid by BAT to CWS. ATO refund cheques were deposited into an account held by Ubigold Pty Ltd (Ubigold) or Boulos Investments Pty Ltd (Boulos Investments). The Crown alleges that the transactions that were the basis for the applications did not occur.” 
        
       
      
    6 The companies Ubigold and Boulos Investments, into whose bank accounts the refund cheques were deposited, were companies controlled by the appellant.  
     
      
    7 In par 9 of the judgment the primary judge set out a chronology of events, which, subject to one matter which I have corrected, was accepted on the hearing of this appeal as being accurate. In her chronology her Honour referred to the Australian Taxation Office as “ATO”, the Australian Federal Police as “AFP” and the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions as “CDPP”. Her Honour’s chronology was as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
         
         1.2.91 
         BAT bank account closed

         10.5.94-28.6.94 
         Jull spoke to Andrews and the applicant. He asked for access to records, but failed to obtain it 
         
         
         15.7.94 
         Matter referred to the ATO investigations search 
         
         
         Late 1994 
         Norman says that a fire at his premises destroyed documents, including documents belonging to BAT and CWS. Although Norman was a Crown witness, the Crown questions whether there was a fire. 
         
         
         20.1094-July 96 
         Some witness statements obtained

         1998/99 
         Lapsing of the requirement under s127(1) of the Sales Tax Act 1992 to retain sales tax records for five years. Most records relating to the internal company transactions of BAT, CWS and Trio were lost or destroyed by 2000, prior to the applicant learning that there was a continuing investigation. 
         
         
         6.1.00 
         The AFP executed search warrants at the homes of the applicant and Andrews and at the Boulos business premises. No relevant documents were located. 
         
         
         2000/01 
         Further witness statements were obtained. 
         
         
         11.2.01 
         Andrews left Australia. 
         
         
         29.10.01 
         The AFP wrote to the applicant’s lawyers setting out the general allegations and requesting an interview. The applicant declined. 
         
         
         30.11.01 
         The applicant left Australia. The AFP obtained a warrant for his arrest (supporting documentation was faulty). 
         
         
         21.1.02 
         The applicant’s wife said that he would return at the end of January. 
         
         
         29.5.02 
         The AFP obtained a warrant for the applicant’s arrest. 
         
         
         13.8.03 
         The applicant’s solicitors contacted the CDPP and were told that the matter was still active. 
         
         
         29.6.04 
         The applicant’s solicitors contacted the CDPP and advised that the applicant wanted to return to Australia. There were discussions regarding his return. 
         
         
         20.12.04 
         The applicant returned. He was arrested at the airport and charged. Bail was granted. 
         
         
         17.1.05 
         The brief of evidence was served. 
         
         
         Aug 05-Aug 07 
         Committal proceedings. 
         
         
         31.8.07 
         The applicant was committed for trial on 10 counts of being “knowingly concerned” in frauds. 
         
         
         15.10.07 
         Amended indictment served, containing 10 counts of defrauding the Commonwealth. 
         
         
         18.1.08 
         Trial fixed for four weeks, commencing on 16.6.08. Stay application fixed for 17.3.08. 
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    8 It was common ground both before the primary judge and on the hearing of this appeal that Mr Andrews had created the documents for submission to the Australian Taxation Office and had submitted the documents and that in doing so he had acted fraudulently. However, the appellant’s defence case is that Andrews acted alone, without any knowledge or involvement on the part of the appellant. 
     
      
    9 The Crown case against the appellant that the appellant was a party to defrauding the Commonwealth is a circumstantial case. In par 8 of her judgment the primary judge listed the principal circumstances relied on by the Crown as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) In 1993/94, BAT did not have a bank account and did not lodge tax returns. The evidence suggests that it did not trade to any significant extent. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The applicant had a controlling role in BAT, CWS and Trio. The applicant and his wife were the sole directors of BAT, Ubigold and Boulos Investments. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The applicant was closely involved in the buying and selling of computers by CWS and Trio. During weekly sales meetings computer stock holdings were discussed.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) At the time that Zenith allegedly supplied computers to CWS, Zenith was winding up its Australian operations. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The relevant transactions concerned very substantial numbers of computers and very substantial sums of money. 
        
       
       
        
        (6) Each refund cheque was accompanied by a notice stating that the cheque was a sales tax refund. In addition, the ATO sent five other letters to BAT referring to a claim for sales tax refund. 
        
       
       
        
        (7) The ten refund cheques were sent to BAT’s registered office, a private residence occupied by members of the applicant’s extended family. 
        
       
       
        
        (8) Each refund cheque was substantial. 
        
       
       
        
        (9) Ubigold and Boulos Investments were property holding companies whose main income was rent. 
        
       
       
        
        (10) The refund cheque deposit slips contain handwriting that “looks like” that of the applicant. All cheques were deposited on days when the applicant was in Australia. One deposit was “delayed” until a date when the applicant had returned from overseas. 
        
       
       
        
        (11) At the time that each cheque was deposited, there was a low balance in the receiving account. 
        
       
       
        
        (12) Within a few days of deposit, funds were withdrawn. The authorised bank account signatories for Ubigold and Boulos Investments were the applicant and his wife. Some of the funds were applied to expenses such as credit card accounts, and the expenditure appears to have been of a personal nature. 
        
       
       
        
        (13) BAT made only 10 claims for sales tax refunds, and each was false. 
        
       
       
        
        (14) One month after the AFP asked the applicant to attend for an interview, the applicant left Australia on a one-way ticket. The Crown will seek to rely upon flight as evidencing consciousness of guilt. The applicant will object to admission of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    10 In her judgment under the heading “the power to grant a stay of proceedings” the primary judge stated a number of principles to be applied in determining whether a court should grant a permanent stay of criminal proceedings. On the hearing of this application it was not contended that her Honour had made any error in her statement of the principles to be applied by her. The principles stated by her Honour was follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(11) The Court has an inherent jurisdiction to permanently stay proceedings that are an abuse of process:  
        Barton v The Queen 
         (1980) 147 CLR 75. The onus is on the applicant to satisfy the Court that any trial would involve an abuse of process:  
        Barron v Attorney General for NSW 
         (1987) 10 NSWLR 215. The onus is “a heavy one” and the power to stay will be exercised “only in the most exceptional circumstances”:  
        Williams v Spautz 
         (1991-92) 174 CLR 509 at 529. 
        
       
       
        
        (12) The power to grant a permanent stay is discretionary:  
        Basha 
         (1989) A Crim R 337 per Hunt J at 339. 
        
       
       
        
        (13) The exercise of the discretion involves balancing the interests of the community and those of the applicant. There is a strong public interest in ensuring that persons accused of serious offences face trial:  
        R v Carver 
         [1999] NSWCCA 135 at para [33]. However, the public interest in holding a trial does not extend to holding an unfair trial:  
        Jago 
         per Mason CJ at 30. 
        
       
       
        
        (14) An abuse of process occurs when a trial is incapable of serving its purpose, ie is incapable of finally determining whether the accused has engaged in the alleged criminal conduct.  
        Jago v District Court of NSW 
         (1989) 168 CLR 23 per Brennan J at 47. A stay will be justified where any trial “will necessarily be an unfair one or … the continuation of the proceedings would be so unfairly oppressive that it would constitute an abuse of process”:  
        Jago 
         per Deane J at 60. 
        
       
       
        
        (15) Before a stay may be granted, there must be “a fundamental defect which goes to the root of the trial”, such that the trial judge will be unable to address the unfairness:  
        Barton 
         per Wilson J at 111,  
        R v Littler 
         [2001] NSWCCA 173 at para [5]. There must be no available means, such as jury directions, of bringing about a fair trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (16) Delay and associated general prejudice will not usually create an abuse of process. In relation to criminal proceedings, delay is not infrequently associated with the death of witnesses, memory loss, or the loss of documents. Where an absent witness’s likely evidence is not known, any disadvantage arising from the witness’s absence is speculative, and abuse of process cannot be established. Even where it is established that the missing evidence would be capable of creating a reasonable doubt, a fair trial can usually be achieved through the use of appropriate directions. 
        
       
       
        
        (17) In  
        The Queen v Davis 
         (1995) 57 FCR 512, the trial of a doctor on old sexual indecency charges was stayed because of special prejudice arising from the destruction of contemporaneous medical notes concerning the alleged patient/victims. 
        
       
       
        
        (18) In  
        Davis 
        , at 519, the Court noted that, on a stay application, it was relevant to consider the strength of the prosecution case. However, on stay applications, it is not unusual to rely on weakness in the prosecution case, and it is not a matter upon which the applicant relies in this application. 
        
       
       
        
        (19) In short, in the exercise of its discretion, the Court must determine whether the applicant has established that any trial will necessarily be unfair. The notion of fairness (or unfairness) “defies analytical definition” and is largely a matter of “essentially intuitive judgment”:  
        Jago 
        , per Deane J at 57.” 
        
       
      
    11 Having stated the principles to be applied by her, her Honour then proceeded to determine the application. Her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(20) Very soon after the alleged offences, the ATO commenced inquiries. However, for most of the ensuing six years from mid 1994 to April 2000 (when search warrants were executed), there was an unjustifiable delay by prosecuting authorities. I infer that, for most of the period to April 2000, the investigation was, in fact, dormant. During this period, company documents may have been lost, in a fire. To the extent that they had been operating, companies ceased to trade. The period prescribed by statue for the retention of sales tax documents expired, allowing the legitimate destruction of such documents. Between mid 1994 and 2000, the applicant was not told that he was still under investigation, and there is no evidence that he was aware that an investigation was continuing. 
        
       
       
        
        (21) The applicant’s contentions that, if he was within the jurisdiction, Andrews may have testified that the subject computer transfers were “real” and that, but for their destruction, company documents may have evidenced “real” transactions, are mere speculation. As Andrews is known to have falsified documents associated with the “transactions”, it is more likely that any reliable evidence would tend to confirm fraud. Any disadvantage to the applicant can be addressed in a trial. 
        
       
       
        
        (22) The applicant’s principal argument is that the unjustifiable delay and associated events have deprived him of documents and witness recall that may have undermined the Crown’s argument that the only available rational inference is that the applicant knew of, and was a party to, the frauds. 
        
       
       
        
        (23) The Crown argues that, in contrast to the position in a case such as  
        Davis 
        , the applicant is unable to identify a particular critical document that would very likely elucidate the situation. However, such an inability is far less significant in a circumstantial evidence case, where the Crown does not rely upon one witness’s evidence about one critical incident, but on a collection of circumstances, each of which, in isolation, is of no great significance. 
        
       
       
        
        (24) The Crown case is inherently problematic. The only direct involvement that the Crown may be able to establish is that the applicant received and banked substantial cheques that were described as sales tax refunds. Alone, that evidence is incapable of establishing that the applicant was a party to the frauds that yielded the refunds. The Crown’s attempt to rely on flight as evidencing consciousness of guilt will, at least, attract a judicial direction requiring that such evidence be approached with caution. Otherwise, the circumstances upon which the Crown relies are of a very general nature. The Crown will ask a jury to infer that, by virtue of his role in the companies, the receipt of monies, and associated direct or indirect enrichment, the applicant “must have known” of,  
        and been a party to 
        , the fraud. 
        
       
       
        
        (25) I accept the applicant’s submission that, in all likelihood, he has suffered significant forensic disadvantage because of the unjustifiable delay in prosecution of almost six years. For example, it may be that there were documents showing that, at the time when the refunds were received, the applicant received and banked similar sums, so that receipt of the refunds would not have caused him to question their legitimacy. It may be that the applicant was not personally enriched, but the funds went towards what were really business expenses. It may be that, had witnesses been questioned earlier, they would have recalled details of particular sales meetings or particular conduct by Andrews that would have supported the applicant’s case. It is possible that there were documents showing that, at the relevant time, BAT did trade to a significant extent. Indeed, it is possible that, but for the unjustifiable delay, documentary or verbal evidence would be available to, at least, put a gloss on each of the circumstances upon which the Crown relies. 
        
       
       
        
        (26) Apart from likely disadvantage to the applicant, it can be seen as “unfair” that the prosecuting authorities determined to prosecute alleged sales tax frauds at a stage when, because of the passage of time, it was permissible to destroy relevant documentation. It may be seen as “unfair” that, following the unjustifiable delay, the offender will stand trial fifteen years after the alleged offences, particularly because, in relation to the central issue, the Crown will rely upon circumstantial evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        (27) However, our criminal justice system ensures that, in all but the most exceptional circumstances, an accused will be tried by his or her peers. I expect that the trial judge will explain issues of forensic disadvantage to the jury and that the applicant will receive a fair trial. Although, at a general level, it may be said that the process has been “unfair” to the applicant, I am far from satisfied that any trial will necessarily be unfair in the sense required to establish an abuse of process. 
        
       
       
        
        (28) The application is refused and the trial date of 16 June 2008 is confirmed.” 
        
       
       
      The submissions 
       
      Submissions for the appellant 
       
      
    12 Counsel for the appellant disavowed making any submission that the primary judge had made any mistake of fact or any mistake as to the principles to be applied by her. 
     
      
    13 A ground of appeal that the primary judge had erred in that she had not given sufficient weight to a number of matters was not pressed as an independent ground at the hearing of this appeal. The relative weight given by a primary judge in the exercise of a discretion to matters which were clearly relevant to the exercise of the discretion can seldom be successfully challenged on an appeal.  
     
      
    14 The ground of appeal which was pressed by counsel for the appellant was a ground that, by reason of a combination of matters, any trial of the appellant on the charges would necessarily be an unfair trial. It was recognised by counsel for the appellant that a permanent stay of criminal proceedings should be ordered only in an exceptional case but it was submitted that the present case was such an exceptional case. Counsel referred to the primary judge’s own finding in par 25 of her judgment that the appellant had suffered significant forensic disadvantage and to her statement in par 26 of her judgment that a trial of the appellant could be seen to be unfair.  
     
      
    15 Counsel submitted that the facts in the present case were distinguishable from the facts in Jago. In support of this submission counsel referred to a passage in the judgment of Kirby P in the Court of Criminal Appeal in Jago, which was quoted by Toohey J in his judgment in the High Court at p 72. Kirby P had said in the Court of Criminal Appeal:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This is not, after all, a case the trial of which will involve, as many corporate offences do, complex documentation and interrelated transactions. In such cases the erosion of memory over time could work a serious injustice to an accused person ... No witnesses have died. The documentary evidence remains for the jury's consideration and, if so desired, for the accused's explanation.” 
        
       
      
    16 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the present case, in contra distinction to Jago, was a case involving complex documentation and interrelated transactions, where the erosion of memory over time could work serious injustice. In the present case, although no witness apart from a Mr Stephen Haig had died, Mr Andrews, a key witness, was unavailable. Much documentary evidence was no longer available for the jury’s consideration. 
     
      
    17 It was submitted that, although the primary judge in her judgment had spoken of an unjustifiable delay “of almost six years”, in fact more than seven years had elapsed before the Australian Federal Police wrote to the appellant’s solicitors on 29 October 2001, setting out the general allegations against the appellant and requesting an interview.  
     
      
    18 Counsel referred to s 127(1) of the Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 (since repealed), which was in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “127(1) Type and retention of records 
         
        A person who is the taxpayer for an assessable dealing, or the claimant for a credit, must: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) keep records that record and explain all transactions and other acts engaged in by the person that are relevant to that assessable dealing or credit claim; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) retain those records for at least 5 years after the completion of the acts or transactions to which they relate.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    19 The period of five years during which the appellant or companies controlled by the appellant had been required to retain records had expired in 1999, before the appellant was notified that there was a continuing investigation into the claims for sales tax refunds. 
     
      
    20 As observed by the primary judge in pars 7, 8 and 24 of her judgment, the Crown’s case against the appellant is a circumstantial one. It was submitted that, in order for any trial of the appellant to be a fair trial, it would be necessary to have evidence of all relevant circumstances, so that the circumstances sought to be relied by the Crown were put in a proper context and the jury could determine, in the light of all of the circumstances, whether the only reasonable inference to be drawn was that the appellant was guilty of the charges. However, the appellant had been deprived of the capacity to adduce evidence of all the relevant circumstances.  
     
      
    21 Counsel referred in some detail to some of the evidence given by some of the witnesses in the committal proceedings.  
     
      
    22 One of these witnesses was Mr David Sinclair, the sales manager of CWS from about 1991 to January 1994, who was called as a witness for the appellant in the second stage of the committal proceedings (that is the stage of the committal proceedings concerned with s 41(6) of the Justices Act, as then in force). A detailed summary of Mr Sinclair’s evidence was set out in the Crown’s written submissions in the committal proceedings (appeal book pp 175-179). It was submitted that the summary of Mr Sinclair’s evidence showed an inability on his part, at least initially, to recall a number of matters and also showed how the eliciting of further facts in cross-examination or re-examination affected any drawing of inferences from the evidence he had earlier given.  
     
      
    23 Counsel also referred to evidence given by Mr Coxhead, a principal of IDB, that he had trusted Mr Andrews as the financial controller of CWS, that he had observed that Mr Andrews was in charge of the paperwork at CWS and that the appellant had not concerned himself at all with the paperwork of CWS. 
     
      
    24 Counsel referred to a summary of the evidence given by Mr Norman in the committal proceedings. Mr Norman gave evidence that BAT “appeared to have some sort of trading in the period 92-94 – specific periods” and it was submitted by counsel that this was an example of a further piece of evidence qualifying one of the items of circumstantial evidence relied on by the Crown. 
     
      
    25 Counsel for the appellant referred to what he submitted was the weakness of the prosecution evidence that the handwriting on the deposit slips completed when the refund cheques were banked was the handwriting of the appellant. 
     
      
    26 Counsel for the appellant sought to respond to a submission he anticipated would be made by the Crown that counsel for the appellant had not identified any specific prejudice to the appellant. Counsel referred to two schedules which had become exhibits before the primary judge. 
     
      
    27 Exhibit 2 was a schedule headed “missing, unidentifiable and unreliable witnesses. Destroyed, lost, missing and incomplete documents”. In the schedule witnesses were listed, who, it was submitted, were not available (this list comprised Mr Andrews and Mr Stephen Haig, an employee of Zenith Data Systems, who could have given evidence about the distribution of computers by Zenith, including to Trio); witnesses who were not available and/or contactable, without recourse to records; and witnesses who were available but whose recollection of events had become unreliable. In this schedule were also listed documents which were said to have been destroyed, lost or missing, particularly as being records of companies which were no longer in existence. 
     
      
    28 In exhibit 3 a number of examples were given of evidence given by witnesses in the committal proceedings, where the witnesses had evinced an inability to recall matters about which they were being questioned.  
     
      
    29 Counsel submitted that, apart from any specific prejudice by reason of the delay in the prosecution and other events, it should be inferred that the appellant had suffered severe presumptive prejudice and counsel referred to what McHugh J said on the subject of presumptive prejudice in Brisbane South Regional Health Authority v Taylor (1996-1997) 186 CLR 541 at 551 (a civil case concerned with the extension of a limitation period for suing for personal injury). 
     
      
       
      Crown submissions 
       
      
    30 Counsel for the Crown, noting that it was accepted by counsel for the appellant that the primary judge had not made any error of fact or of principle, referred to what was said by the full court of the Federal Court in The Queen v Davis (1995) 57 FCR 512, a case in which the primary judge had granted a permanent stay. At p 518 the full court of the Federal Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “We suggest that an appellate court is likely to interfere only in a case where it considers a primary judge to have misunderstood the facts or misunderstood or misapplied relevant principles.” 
        
       
      
    31 As to the certificate which the primary judge had given, although in the certificate her Honour stated that she had found “the exercise of my discretion to be difficult”, in her judgment she had concluded that she was “far from satisfied” that any trial of the appellant would necessarily be an unfair trial.  
     
      
    32 Counsel for the Crown pointed out that on the appeal there was no evidence at all from the appellant and referred to R v Stringer (2000) 116 A Crim R 198, especially per Smart AJ at 229-231.  
     
      
    33 Counsel submitted that the only evidence in the body of the principal affidavit by the appellant’s solicitor about the consequences of the alleged delay was in pars 24 and 25 of the affidavit. In par 24 of the affidavit it was stated that Mr Andrews and Mr Haig of Zenith Data Systems, who had died, were not available to give evidence. In par 25 of the affidavit it was stated that a number of categories of documents were no longer available. These documents included:- 
     
      
       
      (a) an accounting system that recorded the number and size of transactions carried out by CWS, Trio and for a short time, IDB. In 1994 Mr Andrews had taken the computer that stored the accounting system. 
       
       
      (b) source and summary documents about the various companies had been destroyed, according to Mr Norman, in a fire at his premises in 1995. 
       
       
      (c) documents of IDB had also, according to Mr Norman, been destroyed in the same fire.  
       
       
      (d) BAT, CWS and Trio had all been deregistered. 
       
       
      (e) external computer suppliers who might have supplied computers no longer had records for the relevant period. 
       
       
      (f) the Australian Taxation Office, relying on statutory restrictions, had refused to produce certain documents.  
       
      
    34 As to Mr Andrews, it was submitted by counsel for the Crown that it was common ground that he had acted fraudulently. It was purely speculative that Mr Andrews would be able to give any evidence favourable to the appellant. Indeed, it would be unlikely that Mr Andrews would have acted fraudulently in a way which appeared to benefit only the appellant, and not Mr Andrews himself, if Mr Andrews had been acting independently of the appellant. Likewise, it was purely speculative what evidence Mr Haig, if he was still alive, might have given.  
     
      
    35 As to the documents claimed to be no longer available, it was again purely speculative whether the contents of any of the documents would have assisted the appellant’s case. Counsel contrasted the present case with Davis, where the accused, a medical practitioner, had been charged, many years after the offences had allegedly been committed, with offences of sexual indecency against females who had been his patients. By the time any complaint was made to the authorities by any of the alleged victims, most of the accused’s medical records of consultations with the alleged victims had been destroyed. As stated by Smart AJ in Stringer, in referring to Davis, the accused in Davis had over the years seen thousands of patients and “without his clinical records the doctor would not be able to say what he did and why”.  
     
      
    36 It was pointed out by counsel for the Crown that the documents referred to in pars (a), (b) and (c) of par 25 of the solicitor’s affidavit had ceased to be available in 1994 or 1995, that is not long after the offences had allegedly been committed and long before the expiration of the period of five years for which records were required to be kept under the Sales Tax Assessment Act. Accordingly, these documents had not been destroyed in reliance on the expiration of the period for keeping records required by the Act.  
     
      
    37 Even if certain documents were missing, the absence of the documents at a trial would be as likely to cause prejudice to the Crown, which would carry the onus of proof, as to the appellant. 
     
      
    38 Counsel referred to the power of a trial judge to give directions to a jury so as to obviate, or at least reduce, any prejudice to the accused at a trial.  
     
      
    39 Counsel made a number of submissions in support of a general contention that the Crown’s circumstantial case, so far from being weak, was a strong circumstantial case. Counsel referred particularly to evidence of circumstances rendering it improbable that BAT, a company set up as a management company, which had not traded or had traded very little (subject to any evidence from Mr Norman), which had no bank account, which, according to evidence from representatives of IDB and Trio had not made sales to IDB or Trio, which employees of CWS such as a Mr Naidoo and a Ms Grady-Tetley were unaware of, could have made purchases and on-sales of computers in the volume required to give rise to an entitlement to more than a million dollars in sales tax refunds. 
     
      
    40 In support of his contention about the strength of the Crown’s circumstantial case, counsel for the Crown also referred to evidence about the receipt, banking and disbursement of sales tax refunds.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    41 The decision by the primary judge on the application for a permanent stay of the criminal proceeding involved the exercise by her of a discretion. See Jago at 31 per Mason CJ and at 75 per Gaudron J; R v Tolmie (unreported 7 December 1994 NSWCCA). Accordingly, any appeal from the primary judge’s judgment is governed by the principles stated in the well known passage in the joint judgment of Dixon J, Evatt J and McTiernan J in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505. 
     
      
    42 I have already referred to a passage in the judgment of the full court of the Federal Court in Davis to the effect that an appellate court is likely to interfere on an appeal against the granting or refusal of a permanent stay of criminal proceedings, only if it considers that the primary judge misunderstood the facts or misunderstood or misapplied relevant principles. I note, however, that the full court used the word “likely” and introduced what it said by the words ‘we suggest”.  
     
      
    43 I consider that I should apply the statement of the principles to be applied by the Court of Criminal Appeal on an appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act, which is contained in R v Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 at 290 and in R v BWM (1997) 91 A Crim R 260 at 266 and which is derived from House v The King. In R v BWM Hunt CJ at CL said at 266: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court has already held that, in an appeal pursuant to s5F, the findings of fact and the exercise of any discretion by the trial judge .may be attacked only if error has first been demonstrated, as must be demonstrated in an appeal against conviction. Error may be demonstrated in relation to a finding of fact if there is no evidence to support it, or if the evidence is all one way, or if the judge has misdirected himself or herself leading to a miscarriage of justice; error may be demonstrated in relation to the exercise of discretion if the judge has acted on some wrong principle, or has given weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters' or has failed to give weight or sufficient weight to a relevant consideration, or has made an error in relation to the facts (as so demonstrated), or if the result is so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the judge must have failed properly to exercise that discretion.”  
        
       
      
    44 Consequently, even if the primary judge made no mistake of fact or of principle, the Court of Criminal Appeal could still interfere, if it considered that, by reason of a combination of matters, the conclusion of the primary judge that a trial of the appellant would not necessarily be an unfair trial was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the primary judge must be held to have failed properly to exercise her discretion. 
     
      
    45 Earlier in this judgment in summarising the submissions by counsel for the appellant I referred to the factors sought to be relied on as necessarily making any trial of the appellant an unfair trial. In my opinion, these factors, even when combined, were not such as to require a conclusion by the primary judge that any trial of the appellant would necessarily be an unfair trial.  
     
      
    46 As submitted by the Crown, it is significant that there is no evidence from the appellant himself but only from his solicitor. In R v Stringer Smart AJ said at 230 (129) that the absence of evidence from an applicant tends to weaken his case for a permanent stay of criminal proceedings against him. His Honour added, “if an accused wants the benefit of a permanent stay, there is nothing unfair as a general principle requiring him to verify his position”. 
     
      
    47 As to the distinction sought to be drawn between the facts of the present case and those in Jago, I would accept only to a limited degree that the present case involves complex documentation and interrelated transactions. In relation to each of the counts in the proposed indictment, the transactions and documentation summarised in par 4 of the primary judge’s judgment are fairly straightforward:- a purported invoice from CWS to BAT, a purported purchase order from Trio or IDB, an application to the Australian Taxation Office for a sales tax refund, a notice of refund and a refund cheque from the Australian Taxation Office and the deposit of the refund cheque into an account of Ubigold or Boulos Investments. 
     
      
    48 As to unavailable evidence, in Stringer Grove J said at 200 (11):- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is well established that a permanent stay should not be granted simply because witnesses or evidentiary material have become unavailable or lost:  
        R v Adler 
         unreported CCA 11 June 1992;  
        R v Goldberg 
         unreported CCA 23 February 1993;  
        R v McCarthy 
         unreported CCA 12 August 1994;  
        R v Tolmie 
         unreported CCA 7 December 1994;  
        R v Hatfield 
         [1999] NSWCCA 340.” 
        
       
      
    49 In some case it is known what evidence could have been given by missing witnesses or it is known what were the contents or what were likely to have been the contents of missing documents and, accordingly, it can be ascertained whether an accused person has actually suffered prejudice because witnesses or documents are unavailable. See Tolmie per Hunt CJ at CL at p 5. The case of Davis, which has already been referred to earlier in this judgment, can properly be regarded as such a case.  
     
      
    50 However, in the present case, it is entirely speculative what evidence Mr Andrews or Mr Haig would have given, if available to give evidence, and whether such evidence as they might have given would have assisted the appellant. As the primary judge remarked in her judgment, it is quite likely that any evidence Mr Andrews could have given would not have assisted the appellant. 
     
      
    51 Likewise, it is entirely speculative what the contents of allegedly lost, missing or destroyed documents would have been and whether any of the documents would have assisted the appellant. The examples given by the primary judge in par 25 of her judgment of ways in which the appellant might have suffered forensic disadvantage were introduced by the words “it may be” and were no more than speculation by her Honour.  
     
      
    52 In general, it is mere speculation in the present case that any evidence by a witness who is unavailable or any document which is unavailable would, if available, have weakened the probative value of any of the circumstances relied on in the Crown’s circumstantial case. In any event, as was submitted by the Crown, because the Crown carries the onus of proof, any gaps in the evidence are as likely to prejudice the Crown, as the appellant. 
     
      
    53 It is true that the primary judge found that there was an unjustifiable delay in the prosecution of almost six years or, if a submission made by counsel for the appellant is accepted, of more than seven years. During this period of delay the period of five years for which the Sales Tax Assessment Act required documents to be kept expired. However, many of the documents which are now unavailable did not become unavailable because they were innocently destroyed in reliance on the expiration of the period for which documents were required to be kept by the Sales Tax Assessment Act. The documents became unavailable as early as 1994, when Mr Andrews took the computer which stored the accounting system, or as early as 1995, when the alleged fire at Mr Norman’s property occurred.  
     
      
    54 In Davis the full court of the Federal Court said at 519 that in considering whether to stay criminal proceedings a judge is entitled to consider the strength of the Crown case. In par 18 of her judgment in the present case the primary judge observed that on stay applications it is not usual to rely on weaknesses in the prosecution case “and it is not a matter upon which the applicant relies in this application”. 
     
      
    55 At times on the present appeal to this Court the appellant did seek to rely on what were submitted to be weaknesses in the Crown’s circumstantial case. It is difficult for this Court, on the limited materials available to it and on the limited submissions made to it, to form any definite view about the apparent strength of the Crown case. However, to the extent to which it might be relevant, the Crown’s circumstantial case, so far from appearing to be weak, appears to me to be a quite strong circumstantial case.  
     
      
    56 On any application for a permanent stay of criminal proceedings or on any appeal from a decision refusing a stay, it is important to have regard to the powers of a judge at a trial to give directions and otherwise conduct the trial in such a way as to obviate or reduce prejudice. See Jago at p 49 per Brennan J, at p 71 per Toohey J and at pp 77-78 per Gaudron J.  
     
      
    57 Finally, as was stated by Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and McHugh JJ in Williams v Spautz (1991-1992) 174 CLR 509 at 519, even though in a slightly different context:- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is of fundamental importance that, unless the interests of justice demand it, courts should exercise, rather than refrain from exercising, their jurisdiction, especially their jurisdiction to try persons charged with criminal offences, and that persons charged with such offences should not obtain an immunity from prosecution.” 
        
       
      
    58 In my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    59 HOEBEN J: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    60 HALL J: I agree with James J.

   JUDGMENT1. Most adults have an interest in forming and pursuing sexual attraction to another person or persons. In general this interest is of no great moment to the criminal law. There are at least two crucial exceptions to this proposition; where there is an absence of consent the criminal law regards persistent pursuit of such an interest as anti-social conduct of such a degree that it amounts to criminal behaviour. 2. The second exception relates to children under sixteen and others of equivalent status, who are psycho-sexually immature lacking understanding of sexual options and appreciation of the significance and consequences of sexual relations whether casual or long established. As a child matures and comes to some understanding of the inequality of personal sophistication between himself and the adult, the power imbalance that existed between them, the measure of inappropriateness of sexual contact between them and the self-centred sexual greed and avarice of the adult in taking such advantage of the child, whatever pleasure that child may initially have taken from the experience can and should turn to resentment, outrage and a justified feeling of sexual exploitation and defilement. Equally, the criminal law regards the sexual exploitation of children and vulnerable adults as abhorrent anti-social behaviour of a high order. 3. There is little doubt that Jacob Charles Woods long before 16 January realised the abhorrent anti-social nature of his sexual relations with three of Bourke’s young Aboriginal boys; NB born 1995, DG born 1996 and ME born 1998. By January 5 2007 police were aware he had been showing pornographic videos to young Aboriginal boys and suspected him of having indecent dealings with NB. Police searched his premises. Items of interest to them were a .22 calibre rifle, ammunition and pornographic videocassettes. Police found material confirming their interests in these items was well founded. 4. They also found a suicide note. Among its contents was recognition by Woods that he required help, needed counselling services and expression of remorse, “for doing it”. A suicide attempt shortly before the search had failed because of a mechanical fault in the rifle. There is a world of difference between ending one’s life on account of depression caused by one’s anti­social behaviour, and accepting accountability to the community for one’s criminal conduct constituted by that behaviour. The first is conduct of a beaten man. The second is conduct of a man who accepts that there still may be feats to achieve. Sometimes that second course is by far and away the more courageous course. 5. Upon his arrest, Jacob Woods, began to accept accountability for his criminal conduct. He is to be sentenced for twenty-one offences, which I shall identify shortly to which he has pleaded guilty. 6. As a sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this Court committed by this offender harming these young victims in the Bourke community, Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80].7. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to this offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offences and to the offender. 8. My fact finding task has been somewhat circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts, to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court the judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of the agreed facts does not relieve him or her from his fact finding responsibility. It simply limits the material from which the facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred it must be remembered the Court can only find the facts from the evidence placed before it. 9. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality of sentence, Form 1 matters, back up charges brought from the Local Court to be finalised in this Court, whether any of these offences attract a standard non-parole period, the length of the parole periods and finally of course the ultimate overall length of term of imprisonment to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be determined see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Charges10. Sexual intercourse (fellatio) with child under ten years (x4) contrary to s 66A Crimes Act . Sexual intercourse (fellatio) with child between ten and under fourteen that is aged ten and under fourteen (x7). Attempt sexual intercourse (anal penetration) with child between the age of ten and fourteen (x2). Possess unauthorised firing arm (x1) (contrary to s 7A(1) of the Firearms Act 1966). There are two further matters to be taken into account on a Form 1, namely intimidating a neighbour on 6 January 2007 with intention of causing him to fear physical harm, and resisting police officer in the execution of his duty. There are also seven offences to be dealt with pursuant to s 166 Criminal Procedure Act ; four relate to indecent acts committed in the course of dealing with ME; one relates to a private exhibition of an R18+ film to a minor; one relates to possess unregistered firearm; and one to fail to ensure safe keeping of a firearm. I think that all adds up to twenty-one. Facts 11. These offences came to light through a detailed electronic interview conducted between police and the offender. Initially Woods had come to the attention of police in circumstances earlier referred to. He nominated his three victims to police. Police sought to interview by audio\visual means each of the boys nominated by Woods. Clearly the boys were too young to fully comprehend that their relationship with the offender was damaging to them. They were unwilling to disclose to police the real dimensions of the relationship, confused or unaware that they were not to blame and indeed were the victims. The youngsters were clearly uncomfortable and probably scared in the presence of police and with the topics being pursued. Their interviews must have been painful for them and difficult for the police. Reading the interviews one could not help but worry whether the interview process was contributing any damage to the boys. 12. Insensitively and also mistakenly the transcripts of each interview’s cover sheets carried the letters ERISP of the relevant child. The letters “SP"" in ERISP stand for “Suspected Person”. 13. It is inappropriate and unfortunate that those interviews should have been so described. One imagines and feels that the children may well have felt like suspected persons. Again I stress they were the victims. 14. The offences are scattered through a two-year period that appears to begin sometime after 6 February 2005 and ends sometime before 16 January 2007. Woods leased a two bedroom unit opposite the Bourke Police Station on 7 February 2005. T0hat lease terminated on 28 October 2005. During this period he committed three offences against NB to which I shall return. After 28 October 2005 Woods moved to Moree to be close to his then girlfriend, RK. He was twenty-three years old. He would return to Bourke to visit every couple of weekends or so. On 12 April 2006 Woods successfully sought the position of Aboriginal Community Liaison Officer (ACLO) with the Department of Education & Training in Bourke. On 5 June 2006 he was appointed. The position was administrative in nature; his office was not located on any school campus. Employment in the position saw him residing permanently in Bourke from late May 2006 until his arrest on 22 January 2007. 15. During the second period of residence he committed further indictable offences involving three victims, and an indictable firearm offence. As best I can calculate there were ten discreet occasions on which he offended, sometimes offending against two victims and sometimes more than two criminal charges arising from an occasion. 16. The offences, as best I can determine, appear to occur in this order; sequence number 23 an offence of oral sexual intercourse with child under ten years, namely NB. The agreed details are that between 6 February 2005 and 29 April 2005 the accused stated he was at his home in Richards Street, Bourke. He stated that the victim had come to visit him. He was watching a pornographic video when the victim started talking to the accused about the video and in particular, “sizes” on the movie. The accused stated that the victim said something about his being bigger. And the accused said, “No, it’s not”. The victim said, “Why don’t I stick it in your mouth?” The accused said, “I bet you don’t.” The victim then placed his penis into the accused’s mouth. The accused then performed oral sex upon the young boy. At that stage the boy was under ten. 17. The offence next occurring is offence sequence number 7, again an offence of oral sexual intercourse against NB. Between 28 April 2005 and 29 October 2005 the accused stated he was at his home in 2/24 Richards Street, Bourke. The accused stated the victim had come to visit him, “some long time later”, after the offence just mentioned. The accused stated that he had oral sex with the victim by placing his penis into the victim’s mouth. The accused cannot recall if he ejaculated or not. 18. The next offence, as best I can tell, is sequence 8 attempted sexual intercourse (anal) with child, NB, between ten years and fourteen years. Between 28 April and 29 October 2005 the accused admitted to attempting anal intercourse with the victim. The accused stated he was at home in Richards Street, Bourke with the victim. They commenced to fondle each other’s penises. The accused then stated that the victim was on the lounge room floor on his knees and elbows. The accused stated that he placed himself on his knees behind the victim, put spit on his hand and rubbed the spit onto his penis. The accused then attempted to place his penis into the anus of the victim. The complainant said that it hurt him, the accused ceased trying to place his penis into the anus of the victim. 19. Next in sequence are sequences 1 and 22; between 20 May 2006 and 16 January 2007 the offender stated that he was at his home in Church Street, Bourke. The victim, NB, came to visit him. He placed a pornographic video for them to watch in order to gain sexual arousal. The offender had oral sex with NB by placing his mouth over the victim’s penis. The victim then went on to give the offender oral sex by placing his young mouth over the offender’s adult penis. The offender cannot recall if he ejaculated or not. 20. The next offence would appear to be sequence 2 between 20 May 2006 and 16 January 2007. The offender admitted to attempting anal intercourse with NB. The offender stated that he was at his home in Church Street, Bourke when the complainant called by. The two commenced to fondle each other’s penises. The offender claimed that the young child was on the lounge floor on his knees and elbows. The offender then placed himself on his knees behind the young complainant, put spit on his hands, which he rubbed onto his penis. The offender stated that he sought to place his penis into the anus of the child. The child said it hurt, the offender ceased trying to place his penis into the victim’s anus. 21. The next offences are sequence 17 and 24 these are the first offences that involve the young person ME who was then under ten years of age. Between 20 May 2006 and 1 September 2006 the offender was at Church Street, Bourke lying on the lounge under a blanket. Young ME came and lay with the accused under the blanket. The offender started touching the child around his belly area before moving his hand downwards. He told the young child to let him know if he wanted him to stop. The offender then touched the victim's penis. That progressed to oral sex whereby the offender placed his mouth over the young child’s penis. The young ME spent the night at the offender’s premises sleeping on the floor, while the offender slept on the lounge. 22. The offence next in time would appear to be sequence 18 again with the young person ME. Between June 1, 2006 and 1 September 2006 the offender was at Church Street, Bourke. He indicated that other children were also at his home but they were outside leaving he and ME alone. The offender stated that the victim, “Wanted to do it then”. The offender stated that ME said, “Give us a suck”. To which the offender replied, “No, not now later”. All the other boys later went to sleep and the offender and young ME were alone in the lounge room. The offender stated that ME pulled his penis out and said, “Now”. And the offender responded by performing oral sex, by placing his mouth over the young child’s penis. 23. The offences next are sequence 3 and 4 these are offences of oral intercourse again with ME and oral intercourse DG. Between 1 September 2006 and 13 November 2006 the offender stated that he had oral sex with both victims, both were at his home and it was nighttime. Other boys were also at the home. They were, however, asleep. The offender said that both young boys began mucking around with each other in that they were fondling each other penises. He then commenced to masturbate his own. The offender then stated that he placed his mouth over the penis of ME for a couple of minutes. He then stated that the put his mouth over the penis of DG for a couple of minutes. He then witnessed both boys give each other oral sex. He stated he then masturbated his own penis and feel asleep. On that particular night he had been drinking alcohol. 24. The offences that next appear to have occurred are sequence 9 and 10 and these are offences involving young NB. Between 30 November 2006 and 5 January 2007 the offender stated he was at his home in Church Street, Bourke. NB had come to visit. The offender then placed a pornographic video on to watch in order to gain sexual arousal. He had oral sex with NB by placing his mouth over the young boy’s penis. The offender went on to state that NB also gave him oral sex by fellating him. The offender cannot recall if he ejaculated or not. Young DG was present during these acts and that boy was masturbating. The offender is unsure whether he suggested to DG that he should masturbate. 25. To complete the review of the sexual offending of the two-month period between 1 September 2006 and 30 November 2006 the sequences of offences are 11, 13 and 26. They are acts of indecency with a child under sixteen, aggravated indecent assault of a child under sixteen and aggravated indecent assault on a child under ten. The victims were DG for two of those offences and ME for one of them. Between 1 September 2006 and 30 November 2006 both DG and ME were at the offender’s home in Church Street, Bourke. It was nighttime. Other boys were also present but they were asleep. Both the young complainants began mucking around with each other in that they were fondling each other’s penis. The offender then commenced to masturbate his own penis. He allowed DG to masturbate his adult penis. He then masturbated the penises of both young victims. It was after that had occurred that the sequence offences 3 and 4 were committed. 26. While it is difficult to untangle the occasions from the charges it would appear that there were nine or ten occasions when there were sexual offending taking place over a two year period. 27. There are other offences that I am dealing with. Sequence 19 was the private exhibition of a RX18+ film or a R18+ film in the presence of minors. The offender stated that he would view pornographic videos for his own sexual gratification and often young males would be present or would arrive at the offender’s home while he was watching the pornographic videos. 28. Some of the facts that I have recounted indicated that the videos did not come on, on occasions until after the young persons had arrived. The offender admitted to watching pornographic videos at the time or shortly before the above sexual assaults occurred. He watched pornographic videos for his own sexual arousal. Police have obtained information by interviewing a number of young males as young eight in relation to watching pornographic videos with the offender in his premises. A number of pornographic videos were seized during the execution of a search warrant. 29. Then the next offences that need to be recounted as part of the offending conduct are sequence 20, 21 and 25. At 11.30am on Tuesday 16 January 2007 police interviewed NB then aged eleven. NB knew the offender had a gun, that he kept it in a cupboard or underneath the bed, that it was a point 22 calibre rifle and that he had both seen it and used it. NB claimed that he had “a shot out of it” when he went roo shooting with the offender and a number of other minors some three weeks prior to the interview. 30. Before commencing the execution of the search warrant on Church Street, Bourke, the offender was formally cautioned and questioned briefly about the firearm the police were looking for. The offender answered police questions, which were recorded on a video. He said there had been a .22 calibre rifle at the house but it was not there now; it belonged to him; it was not registered and he didn’t have a firearms licence. He also told police that it didn’t shoot properly and that he had “just dumped it” with some other rubbish on or about the preceding Sunday at the local tip. 31. During the execution of the search warrant police were searching the offender’s car. The offender told police the rifle was actually in the boot of the vehicle. Police opened the boot and found only a rifle case and some live and spent ammunition. The offender claimed the firearm had been in the boot that morning and he had no idea where it was. He later said a number of minors knew where the weapon had been 32. At 9.55pm on 16 January police observed the offender walking towards the police station at Bourke carrying a rifle. Police, not surprisingly, became alarmed and confronted the offender at the front door of the police station. He surrendered the firearm without incident. I am satisfied it was always his intention so to do. The firearm is a .22 calibre rifle, manufactured in Germany, with a serial number on it and “Tasco” brand sites fitted to the weapon. 33. In the record of interview conducted on 19 January at Orange Police Station, the offender gave another version of the firearm, (Q & A 562-584). He said that he knew that “one of the boys took it” out of the car and that “they told him” that “they” had it at the time police entered the front of the house. He said the rifle was not in the boot of the car; “it was actually sitting on the back seats” and that one of the minors just reached in and grabbed it through an open window. The accused goes on to say that the boy who took the rifle “possibly” also took twenty rounds of ammunition, but these had been subsequently returned to the house, but he could almost guarantee that they were probably not there any more. An Overview of Offending Conduct34. An overview of the offending discloses that NB was a victim dating from early 2005 through to the end of 2006. There were four occasions when the offender sucked the young boy’s penis, two occasions when the young boy fellated the twenty-four year old and two occasions when the offender tried to penetrate the boy’s anus. All offending against NB constituted indictable charges. 35. There were three indictable offences committed against ME, all constituted oral sex upon him. ME was also subjected to acts of indecency towards him and aggravated indecent assaults on a total of four occasions. This latter group of offences before me are not indictable matters but matters usually dealt with in the Local Court, being in my Court pursuant to powers given to the Crown pursuant to s 166 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 36. There were two indictable offences committed against DG, both oral sex upon him. There were also two aggravated indecent assaults against DG, that are Local Court charges being dealt with in this Court. 37. The two matters on the Form One concern a neighbour of the offender. Very late on Saturday night, 6 January 2007 the neighbour was watering his lawn. Numerous bottles and iron bars were thrown from the offender’s residence on to the neighbour’s roof. The neighbour saw a number of young boys running into the offender’s premises. Not surprisingly he called upon the young boys to stop throwing the items. Instead of supporting the neighbour, as would have seemed logical, the offender became aggressive towards his neighbour. He commenced to threaten the neighbour with violence. The abuse continued well past midnight. Police were called two times. By the second time the offender appears to have lost the plot entirely. Police arrested him and as they walked him to the paddy wagon the offender’s aggression shifted towards the police. He resisted arrest, was handcuffed and appears thereafter to have gone quietly with the police. 38. It is difficult to reconcile his behaviour in front of the young persons who were then at his home with the position in the Bourke Community as the ALCO with the Department of Education and Training. What lesson were these young boys to take from that bullying, violent and irrational behaviour. Need for Parental Vigilance 39. The facts disclose these young boys of very tender years were apparently permitted by their parents to stay overnight at the offender’s residence. The level of contact that the offender had with the boys’ parents is not before me. The level of knowledge of the offender by the parents is not before me. But this case again illustrates the importance of parents being highly vigilant about the sexual safety of their children. That vigilance can take many forms including warning the child, and investigating with appropriate inquiries the background and behaviour of the adult male disclosing an interest in children that includes long periods, including periods overnight, alone with the child. 40. It was the arrest for conduct towards his neighbour in irrational support of the young children that I suspect caused the police to have concerns about the offender. 41. At the completion of the search warrant the accused was released from custody, pending further inquiries. Among the items found by police was a handwritten suicide note. It was in the following terms:  
     
      
      “Dear All,  
       
      I am sorry. Tell my family I love them and I will look over them”.  
       
       
      There was then a short passage about his ward, then: 
       
        
       
      “To all my friends I am sorry. To the police please set up a counselling service for people like me to get help before they do something. I hated doing it afterwards and wanted help but nowhere to go for help...”  
      
    No doubt police were interested in the significance of and the reasons for the suicide note. 42. Upon his release from custody on 16 January Detectives Edmonson and Stuart spoke to Woods. Off the record he admitted he had a problem. He left the police to go to the Bourke Hospital. From there he made his way to the Bloomfield Hospital at Orange. It was while there that he was arrested for further questioning. There is no doubt the Prosecution case would depend almost entirely upon the accused’s willingness to cooperate fully with the police. All of the sexual assault charges were possible only because of his full and frank account to the police. Objective Criminality43. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing Judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences. This is an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the various offences I am dealing with, with criminality of offences of similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 44. The sections of the Crimes Act 1900 which create the offences that I am dealing with are all about the protection of young children from a range of experiences while their physical, emotional and psycho-sexual development is patently immature and the power imbalance between the child and the adult grossly favours the adult. The fact that consent of the victim is no defence to an offence under this section highlights its purpose in protecting the young. 45. Lee J in describing the jurisprudential philosophy behind this section said the following:  
     
      
      “One begins with the proposition that our community views with great concern the sexual molestation of children by adults and that has been acknowledged by the Legislature in providing for greater penalties when the victim is under sixteen. That acknowledgement has been in our Legislation over a long period of time. Little children are entitled to grow up free from defilement by sexual predators and free from risk of psychological upset, confusion and difficulties in later life caused by such conduct.”.  
      
      The psychosexual development of young children is just as important as the development of their minds, emotions and bodies. Crucial to the development of all aspects of the young person are age appropriate dealings, attitudes and conduct. Boys of a young age, the age that I am dealing with here, would normally becoming aware of the sexual differences between themselves and females. They may be experiencing the early stages of sexual awakening. Instead, thrown into the development of these three young boys are pornographic movies espousing sexual values that are as shallow as they are gross and being used as a means of arousing interest and a willingness to participate in the sexual acts that scream power imbalance between participant, and sexual gratification based upon a myth. 46. I am satisfied that each of the victims willingly cooperated with the accused. While this is a matter that can be taken into account, one has to bear in mind that children of this age are in no position to understand what is healthy or unhealthy for their psychosexual development. The purpose of the criminal law is to protect the tenderly young from this kind of activity and their willingness to participate in it through their innocence. 47. As against NB the offending constitutes eight offences over a two year period. On four occasions Woods sucked the young boy’s penis, on two occasions the youngster fellated the adult Woods and on two occasions there were attempts at anal penetration of the ten and later eleven year old. The attempt would not appear to have amounted to much more than a pressing, with some force, of the adult penis against the anus of the young boy who complained it was hurting. The offender thereafter ceased his attempt immediately. 48. Three indictable offences and one summary offences were committed by Woods against ME, the indictable offences were three counts of sucking ME’s penis and the remaining offences aggravated acts of indecency. Two indictable offences and two summary offences were committed against DG. The two indictable offences were oral sex upon DG, the remaining offence was two of aggravated indecent assault. 49. While the offender may not have been actively predatory in seeking out young persons for sexual gratification, he certainly welcomed them into his home, took steps to ensure his fridge was full. He was willing to share with them his R18+ DVDs, knowing they would arouse the curiosity and guarantee the return of the children to his abode. Further he was prepared to use the films to sexually excite the young persons, thereby making their willingness to participate in his illegal activities easier to achieve. Their sexual encounters became, for him, an extension of the pornography on the film and an expected outcome of the viewing. The abundance of food and pornography were grooming tools used to encourage their return. Such grooming constitutes an aggravating feature of this criminality. 50. The offender was himself sexually assaulted as a young person. A feature of child sexual assault offences is that numerous offenders have themselves been sexually offended against. Such a phenomenon does not necessarily establish in the individual case any nexus between the earlier victim becoming the later offender. This offender claims some nexus between his earlier experience as a victim and his later offending creating a new generation of victims. I do not rule it out, however, the nearest the psychiatric evidence comes is an opinion of the possibility of an over-identification with children. However the reasons for that over-identification have not been explored. 51. I should also note when assessed by the Regional Forensic Psychologist for the Sex Offenders’ Program, under the auspices of the Probation and Parole, Woods reported he had been sexually abused by a friend’s grandfather between the ages of nine and thirteen years. He told the psychologist that he then liked the abusive contact. It is significant that he sought to inculcate the same attitude to those he was abusing. However, there is a difference in seeking to inculcate an attitude in those being abused and the decision made to abuse them in the first place. I do not regard the attitude I have just described as a causative link. 52. There is evidence, which I accept, that the offender was on some occasions well affected by alcohol. Certainly during this two year time, he was consuming alcohol to a point of intoxication up to three times weekly. While intoxication may explain one aberrant episode it can hardly be an explanation for this series of offending. 53. Dr Allnutt, having read the accused’s record of interview observed, “He appears to attribute a degree of his responsibility to his offending, to the young boys”. The observation is one well justified, for example in respect of at least two offences he claims the children were the aggressive parties seeking the sexual encounter with him. Such a proposition ignores the grooming, the welcoming, the pornographic videos and his own part in reinforcing their behaviour on earlier occasions. Offences with ME and DG were committed in the company of each other and himself. The commission of the offences in the presence of another person is regarded as an aggravating feature. 54. The Crown sought to argue this offender was in a position of trust because his position in the community gave him credibility and because he opened his home. There is no evidence the children were aware of his position. In any event it must be a contemplated ingredient of these offences that there is always an adult-child relationship in these particular offences. 55. In the case of NB however there is an argument that there was a breach of trust. The offender’s initial contact with, and knowledge of, NB was in the role of his football coach. While there is no evidence that he used his role as a football coach to entice NB to his home, nonetheless NB was visiting the home of his football coach when he was sexually assaulted. When one accepts a position of responsibility in respect of children such as a football coach, that responsibility is not turned off and on as the football team runs out on to the field or comes from it. It is a position of community responsibility. Football coaches are looked to as mentors in a wide range of social situations apart from simply instilling football skills, tactics and giving half time speeches. NB was sexually assaulted by his football coach that is a feature of aggravation Standard Non-Parole Periods 56. Four of the offences, the first oral intercourse with NB, and the three oral intercourses with ME carry a standard non-parole period of fifteen years in certain circumstances. Firstly the offences must fall within a mid-range of seriousness. For reasons I shall explain none of these offences qualifies as falling within a mid-range of seriousness. Secondly as a general proposition the standard non-parole period only applies to offences in the mid-range of seriousness after a trial has been completed. In this case the accused has pleaded guilty to cases against him built primarily on his own admissions. 57. None of the offences has any suggestion of force, threats, or drugs, before during or after the sexual encounter. There is no suggestion in respect of these four offences of any pain or discomfort being experienced by the victims. There is no suggestion that any of the victims was unwilling, although as I said the use of pornographic videos was, in part, a factor in their apparent willingness. Each case was an episode of fellatio upon the victim. 58. The standard non-parole period applies to all offences created by s 66A, that is sexual intercourse with children under ten years. The law recognises many forms of intercourse between victim and offender. The definition of sexual intercourse in the Crimes Act is wider than used in common parlance. Fellatio, all other things being equal, is not regarded by the law as heinous as penile penetration of a female victim or anal penetration of both. 59. NB was nine years old. ME was younger, perhaps as young as seven, certainly eight, when the first offence was committed against him. The younger the child the more serious the offence, other things being equal. But it would not constitute a circumstance of aggravation as envisaged by s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 . For these reasons I do not find any of these four offences require the imposition of the standard non-parole period. The firearm Offence 60. The firearms offence is the least serous of the indictable offences. The objectives of the Firearms Act (1966) is to confirm possession of firearms as a privilege conditional upon the over-riding need to ensure public safety. A second aim is to improve public safety by imposing strict controls upon possession of firearms. The offender’s possession of the firearm I am concerned with was cavalier. The weapon was not maintained in working order. It was not kept in a closed weapon safe. It was left from time to time in the boot of his motor vehicle and at the time of his arrest he says on the rear seat of his motor vehicle from whence it disappeared. Children were given access to it and it would appear on at least one occasion unsupervised access to it in circumstances where they also had access to ammunition. While the criminality of the offence is the offender’s unauthorised possession of the weapon, given the objects of the Firearms Act , the very nature of the unauthorised possession can be, and in this case is, an aggravating feature of his offending conduct. 61. In country towns it may be that fathers, lawfully in possession of firearms, teach their children responsible and skilful use of firearms. But that is not this case. The defence rely on the weapon being of light calibre as mitigating the offence. While, I accept that the criminality is not as great as the unauthorised possession of a rifle of higher calibre, the potential for death and injury is as real, whether the weapon is a point 22 calibre, or a 303. The defence also sought solace that the weapon was inoperable at the time it was surrendered. For at least some of the time it was in the offender’s possession it would sometimes work and sometimes not. Such a weapon is more dangerous than one in proper working order. 62. Finally, the defence sought to rely upon the fact that the possession of the firearm as charged related to a defined and limited period on 16 January 2007. In assessing criminality of the possession charge, it is appropriate to take into account the background circumstances. The offender’s possession of the weapon on 16 January was more about securing the weapon and delivering it to the police. Victim Impact Statement 63. There is before the Court a Victim Impact Statement on behalf of DG. The material contained in the Victim Impact Statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. The Victim Impact Statement coming as it does after interview with the primary victim may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the impact of the offences upon him. The function of statements, such as this one, is to give to the victims an opportunity of being heard in the sentencing proceedings, by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of an offender. Secondly, it enables the sentencing proceedings to assist the victim as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender at least hearing first hand and perhaps gaining an insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon the victim. Finally, the Victim Impact Statement ensures that the Court has a continuing con sciousness of the impact violent crime has upon those ordinary men and women who are its victims. As such a Victim Impact Statement plays a very important part in the administration of criminal justice. 64. This Victim Impact Statement is a statement containing particulars of personal harm suffered by DG, usually as a direct result of the offences. The report from Dr Stephen Koder, specialist child psychologist was received in respect of DG. DG did not directly contribute to the history at the interview. There were other factors operating in the child’s life. An older brother aged 19 had spent a lengthy time in juvenile justice detention, another aged 15 was then in juvenile detention. He is the youngest child in a blended family. There is a six month history that the parents gave to, I imagine the parents gave to the psychologist, of the child running away from home for periods of several days at a time with consequent loss of school attendance, shoplifting, mainly snack food items, graffiti and impulsive destruction on other property such as windows; once riding in a stolen vehicle with older boys, frequently getting into fights with other boys at school, openly disrespectful behaviour towards adult authority figures, smoking cigarettes, possibly experimentation with petrol sniffing but no known use of alcohol or illicit drugs. 65. There is a twelve months history of anhedonia with some preserved reactivity at times; a generally flattened and irritable mood, impulsive aggressiveness, tearfulness over slight issues, social withdrawal from friends and family, low self-worth, and ominous utterances such as “I shouldn’t be here”, but no overt suicidal threats, gestures, or deliberate self harm. DG also tends to sleep too long and has lost much of has appetite with resulting weight loss/failure of weight gain. His concentration has become very poor and his academic performance has declined significantly. There is a twelve-month history of agitation, recurring nightmares involving a feared person coming to kill him; misinterpreting innocent sounds, signifying that this feared person is coming to his house and visual flashbacks of his presence; hyper vigilance, intense distress at any reminders of traumatic events; he may run and hide under his mother’s bed; avoidance of school and of any discussion that may be associated with issues around mistreatment, detachment and estrangement of others; a restricted range of affect; episodes of going black and the aforementioned difficulties with concentration. His bladder control has regressed, with episodes of both daytime and nocturnal anuresis, urinating. Dr Koder’s diagnosis was that DG was suffering, 1) post-traumatic stress disorder, 2) major depression, and 3) major behaviour disorder, that he meets the criteria of conduct disorder except for the duration of symptoms which need to be of at least twelve months duration. 66. Given the earlier history I earlier referred to, one cannot say this offender’s conduct is responsible for the complete set of symptoms suffered by DG, I am satisfied the offender’s conduct and his arrest, disclosure and police enquiries all flowing from his conduct have contributed to DG’s symptomatology. Subjective Circumstances 67. I turn now to the subjective factors, I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offences, but I am also sentencing this offender for them. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of these offences by this man or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. Background, Family Dynamics, Relationships68. Jacob Woods, age twenty-six is the father of two young children aged six and four. He was raised in country New South Wales by supportive parents. His father attended Court and gave evidence in the defence case. Jacob is the oldest of three siblings. His mother told the author of the Presentence Report there was a closeness in the family relationships. His relationship with his ex-partner lasted three years. She and the children live in a country New South Wales town, but not in Burke. His contact with his children was mostly during the school holidays since the separation. The offender’s mother has suffered from depression, although at what level is unclear. At the time of his arrest he was guardian to a 12/13 year old boy whom he regards as a member of his family. There is no suggestion of any untoward conduct towards this child. Education, Skills and Employment69. He completed Year 12 aged seventeen. His early employment included positions such as employment consultant for an agency and contact manager within the Aboriginal Employment Strategy. In June 2005 he was appointed as the ACLO with the Department of Education and Training stations in Burke. That involved him working with communities to give them a better understanding of how the Department of Education functioned. He was paid nearly $50,000 annually. His position was administrative. 70. He also had skills as a football coach. He has had several seasons of coaching young boys in Rugby League. Given these charges, it is important that those who appoint coaches should consider him only for adult teams hereafter. 71. Woods estimates he held six employment positions, the longest lasting a year. He claims to be a good worker. On one occasion he was made redundant. In his last position there was a complaint, although the precise terms of the complaint have not been ventilated in Court, but as a consequence of the complaint he was confined to his desk. Nonetheless, he does appear to have a strong work ethic. General Heath 72. So far as one can tell from appearance, Jacob Woods presents as a twenty-six year old man in good physical health, he reports no physical ailments. His interest in sports suggest he would maintain a reasonable level of physical fitness. Mental Health 73. Immediately prior to his arrest, the offender had sought to commit suicide using a firearm ultimately surrendered to the police. The firing pin failed to engage when he pulled the trigger. A couple of days after his arrest he was scheduled to Bloomfield, a psychiatric hospital in Orange, because of the risk of self-harm. 74. My sense of his conduct on the night when he was dealing with his neighbour is that it reached the bizarre, although whether that was alcohol or mental stress is difficult to tell. 75. Dr Allnutt, a well-known forensic psychiatrist reviewed the offender for the Aboriginal Legal Service (ALS). I put to one side matters that may impact upon risk assessment done by Dr Allnutt in relation to sex offending. I will deal with those issues shortly. Dr Allnutt’s view was that Woods was not suffering any significant symptoms of major psychiatric illness, although there were fluctuations in mood characterised by increased energy, euphoria, sleeplessness, racing thoughts and periods of depression. Dr Allnutt was prepared to offer a differential diagnosis that included mild bipolar affective disorder or cyclothymia. He is currently taking antidepressants. Alcohol and Drug Abuse 76. The offender abused alcohol, drinking to a point of intoxication three times weekly, during the offending period. He sees some correlation between his drinking and offending conduct. He has been diagnosed by a medical practitioner as an alcoholic, but did little while in the community to address his problem. His drinking was of a binge-drinking pattern. He was not a good drunk, becoming aggressive as demonstrated by the offending conduct towards the neighbour. He commenced alcohol consumption at the age of thirteen he used cannabis between fifteen to twenty-one. At the time of his offending, though, cannabis does not appear to have been an issue. Psychosexual Issues 77. Between nine and thirteen years, Woods was sexually abused by a friend’s grandfather, ceasing when he moved from the area. As already mentioned at the time, Woods liked the abusive sexual contact. However, his view of the significance of that earlier illicit sexual contact has now changed. Woods blames his own criminal behaviour as having a nexus from that earlier life experience, (transcript 09/04/08 page 2/54). As he pursued his sexual interest in prepubescent boys, he lost his sexual interest in women. He claims to have had sexual experiences with adult males. But his present attitude to adult homosexuality was not disclosed and I sense was not pursued. His offending behaviour spanned a number of months. His sexual activity broadened in focus from one to three boys. Dr Allnutt opined there was “some suggestion of over-emotional identification with children”. His behaviour towards his neighbour, on seeking to shield the children causing trouble, from any form of castigation by the neighbour, would seem consistent with this observation. 78. The offender’s alcohol played a part in many but not all episodes of the offending. 79. The offender’s psychosexual profile indicates he has insight into his past criminal behaviour towards the children and a strong desire to rehabilitate. Indeed, his attitude and insight nearly led to him taking his life. His interest in the boys did not extend to compulsion, or threats, or violence. He has a capacity to pursue realistic plans and is highly motivated to engage in treatment. On an actuarial assessment, he was placed in a group of individuals, 33% of whom re-offended within five years and 40% within fifteen years. 80. I note the predicting re-offending propensity for an individual offender is notoriously unreliable. The presentence report found the offender is suitable for and amenable to the CUBIT treatment program. I intend to recommend him for it. Dr Allnutt regarded his risk as directed to prepubescent victims with whom he had developed a relationship. Dr Allnutt thought any future offending likely to involve indecent touching and mutual masturbation. Re-offending prospects appear to be based on personal characteristics of the offender only. They do not appear to take into account the efficacy of and willingness to abide by segregation orders now mandatory in these types of cases. For my own part, I have difficulty putting his offending prospects as high as 33 or 40%, I think a more conservative figure would have been appropriate. Character and Criminal Antecedents81. The offender is a twenty-six year old father of two young children. He has a strong work ethic, has achieved a well-paid position of some significance in the Aboriginal community. He has given several years in service to coaching Aboriginal boys in Rugby League. He has been a good son for his parents, and but for this offending conduct, otherwise a role-model in employment and community services for others to follow. 82. There was a problem with drinking alcohol emerging. He had acquired what appeared to be a number of alcohol related convictions including malicious damage to property (x3), behaviour in an offensive manner (x4), drive with a midrange PCA, resist officer in the execution of the duty (x3), plus the one I am dealing with. There is also larceny. All of his offending previously has been dealt with in the Local Court by way of fines, an overview which suggests a serious nuisance type of offending in his past. I do not regard his offending as disentitling him to some leniency. He does not appear to have been previously incarcerated. Attitude to Offence 83.  I have already referred to the psychosexual issues. I do not seek to repeat findings made there under this heading. This offender clearly has issues of guilt relating to his criminal conduct when he sought to commit suicide. He has fully and frankly assisted police upon his arrest. He has pleaded guilty from the outset. He has written to the parents of each victim owning and acknowledging his criminal conduct and seeking professional assistance for his victims. And his suicide note, it is to be remembered said, “To all of my friends, I am sorry” and, “there was nowhere to go for help”. His post­arrest attitude is also consistent with deep remorse, constructive advice to and genuine concern for his victims. His letter to the parents was in these terms, “I know I am the last person you would want to hear from, but please hear me out.  
     
      
      I am so sorry I have hurt you all, the way that I have hurt especially [victim] I know no words can describe the terrible things I have done, I only hope that you will get help for[victim] It is very important that he talks about what has happened, to a counsellor. I can’t stress enough the importance of this help. If I had done it fourteen years ago, none of this would have happened. The last thing I want for [victim] to have to go through what I am having to go through, my past and present. Remember to get him help. Even if he doesn’t want it, never let up, I know from experience.  
       
        
       
      I know you may never forgive me, however, I am getting the help that I need so I never hurt another boy, ever.”  
      
    84. The early plea coupled with the detailed admissions make an otherwise weak Crown case relatively strong. In any event, the Crown case was never put to the test, because the plea alleviated the need for the children to be called as witnesses. The utilitarian value of the plea, his earlier full cooperation with the police in his interview, his saving these three young victims from the distress of giving their account and his profound remorse makes this one of those exceptional cases where it is appropriate to give a full discount of twenty-five per cent plus some, on the sexual assault offences. 85. I have read the interviews of each of the victims. Their interviews added nothing to the strength of the Crown case. Clearly each child was distressed. My sense is all felt betrayed by the accused for revealing his criminal activities upon them. I have no doubt, as a consequence, they felt guilty about their behaviour and possibly fearful of being labelled as homosexual. They have no cause to feel either, they did no wrong. The wrong was done to them. Nor are they necessarily homosexual. Each one’s sexual development is in its very early stages. Hopefully their choice of sexual preference will come after healing and an opportunity for healthy psychosexual development. The plea has saved each of these children the need to revisit these incidents and the raw and angry feelings about them. 86. I intend to give a discount of twenty-seven and-a-half per cent to each sentence I would have otherwise have set for sexual offending. It should be remembered the prosecution success rate against those defending paedophile charges is something less than fifty per cent. Strongly defended, in all of these sexual matters, success for the defence was “on the cards”. Rehabilitation Prospects 87. To some extent these have been canvassed earlier in the judgment. There are further positive rehabilitating factors; insight into the offending; profound remorse; strong family support; willingness to undertake a CUBIT sex offenders program; an offender who is still young in years; positive use of time whilst in custody; he has completed drug and alcohol courses and a good work ethic prior to arrest. There is a real difficulty predicting rehabilitation prospects for a sex offender, but in this case there are a number of positive indicators. He will certainly need close monitoring upon release in the community but solid resources to assist him redirect his sexuality towards adult males or females as the case may require will assist him. Impact of the Subjective Matters on the Standard Non-Parole88. The general impact of the subjective features is a positive one on the ultimate sentencing outcome. There is nothing in the subjective features that would require me to reconsider my earlier view that the standard non-parole period should not apply. Of course, that is not to say that the standard non­parole period has no role to play in the sentence. It’s creation by Parliament requires me to pay proper regard to the intention of Parliament, that generally sentences for the relevant offences will be drawn upwards from past sentences imposed. Custodial History 89. The offender has been in custody since his arrest on 22 January 2007, the overall sentence will commence from that date. Setting the Sentence 90. The maximum penalty for sexual intercourse with child under ten, is twenty-five years. The standard non-parole period which I said doesn’t apply, is fifteen years. Sexual intercourse with children between ten and fourteen years, the maximum penalty is sixteen years. Attempted sexual intercourse with a child of or above ten years of age and under fourteen years carries the maximum penalty of sixteen years; possession of unlawful firearms, two years imprisonment. Taking Form 1 Matters into Account 91. There are two offences to be taken into account on the Form 1. Had they stood alone, they would have been before a magistrate. It is unlikely the offender would have been sentenced to full-time custody for them. Should I be wrong in that, it is unlikely that he would have received more than three months full-time custody. Nonetheless, the criminality for these offences must be taken into account when sentencing for the offence of sexual intercourse with child under ten, contrary to s66A of the Crimes Act, which will be the first offence in respect of NB. It will therefore be a factor that will tend to drive upwards, in a restrained way, the selection of the overall sentence for that offence. Deterrence 92. In modern Australian society, there’s a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by Federal and State Parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by parliaments is to deter those who would be tempted to breach their provisions. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. 93. I have just reviewed the maximum penalties for the offences I am dealing with. Consequently, when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he or she is exposed to that possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires a sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large, by keeping in mind those maximum penalties available and their deterrent purpose. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to this offender, who but for such deterrence would be willing to commit offences similar to those for which this offender is being sentenced. 94. Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered which is personal to the offender with a view to deterring him and her from re-offending. Cumulative or Concurrent Sentences95. There are fourteen sentences on the committal document. There are three victims. The offending has been over two years. While there must, of necessity, be some accumulation of the offences, it will also be necessary to deal with the offences in groups. In addition to requirements that the criminality of each individual offence be identified in the sentences ( Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610) there is also the need for the overall sentence to reflect the total criminality. Necessarily, the requirement of Pearce must yield to some extent to that principle. This is also a case in which, for reasons I shall shortly develop, I would find special circumstances. Again the requirements of Pearce must yield for some extent for that to happen. For the purposes of sentencing, I have divided the sentences into four principal groups, namely, the firearm offence, the offences against DG, the offences against ME, generally the offences against NB. In that final category, there are four subcategories. Firstly, fellatio upon NB, fellatio upon the offender, attempted anal intercourse upon NB and fellatio upon NB when he was under ten. Special Circumstances 96. The defence seeks and the Crown does not oppose the finding of special circumstances. What this means is that the balance in the sentence between parole and non-parole may fall more favourably than the statutory requirement of the 25% sentence. Reasons favouring that, particularly in respect of the final sentence to be imposed are:- accumulation of the sentences, relative youth of the offender, offender’s rehabilitation prospects better served in the community and the need for close monitoring upon release in the community (Section 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 ); and him being unlikely to obtain entry into CUBIT until the balance of term is reached in the last sentence because of the high demand for the limited places available in that program. Setting the Sentences 97. But for the plea of guilty for the firearm offence, I would set a fixed term of three months. Applying a twenty-five per cent discount, that becomes a sentence of two months and seven days. In respect of the sexual intercourse offences committed against the victim DG, but for the plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of three years. Discounting that by twenty-seven and a half per cent it becomes a sentence of two years and two months. 98. For the sexual intercourse offences committed against ME when he was under ten years of age, but for the plea of guilty I would have set a sentence of four and half years, applying the twenty-seven and a half per cent discount I set an overall sentence for three years and three months. 99. In respect of the offences of NB. (A) For the sentence of sexual intercourse committed upon NB when he was under ten years of age, but for the plea of guilty I would have set a sentence of five years. Applying the twenty-seven and a half per cent discount, that becomes a sentence of three years seven months and fifteen days. Although this was the offender’s first offence, I have set a higher sentence than in the case of ME. That is because, while there is a partial accumulation, which in the offending against this victim the totality of criminality against this victim is higher than against any of the other victims, and the only way, given the way the sentence is structured for that to be reflected, is to go for the five year sentence. (B) For the offences of sexual intercourse against NB constituting fellating when he was over ten but under fourteen, I would have set an overall sentence of three years. Applying the twenty-seven and a half per cent discount that becomes an overall sentence of two years and two months. (C) For the offences of sexual intercourse against NB constituting the fellating of the accused by NB when NB was over ten but under fourteen, I would have set an overall sentence of three years and nine months. Applying the twenty-seven per cent discount that becomes an overall sentence of two years and nine months. (D) For the offence of attempted sexual intercourse of NB constituting attempted anal intercourse of NB, but for the plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of three years six months. Applying the twenty-seven and half per cent discount this became an overall sentence of two years six months and fifteen days. Imposing Sentences 100. The easiest way to do it Mr Woods is to convict you of all offences globally and then sentence you one by one. There may need to be some adjustment of the description of the offence, but if you would stand up. 101. In respect of the sentences upon which you have been committed for sentence, there are I think eleven of them. You are convicted of all of them. 101. In respect of the possession of the firearm offence, I sentence you to a fixed term of two months and seven days, commencing on 22 January 2007 and expiring on 29 March 2007, that sentence has already been served. 103. For the offences against DG, that is sequence number 4 and sequence number 15, you are sentenced to sixteen months, commencing on 22 February 2007 and expiring on 18 June, that is, the minimum term commencing on 22 February 2007 and expiring 18 June 2008. The additional term on my calculation will expire on 18 April 2009. 104. For the offences against ME, which were sexual intercourse offences represented by sequence numbers 17, 18 and 3, you are sentenced to a minimum term of two years to commence on 22 February 2008 and to expire on 21 February 2010. The balance of term will expire on 21 May 2011. Incidentally, that last date that I gave you, the sentence will expire on 21 June 2008 and the additional term will expire on 21 April 2008. 105. For the offences where you committed oral sex on NB which I think are sequences 7, 1 and 9, I set a minimum term of fourteen months commencing on 22 August 2008 and expiring on 21 October 2009, that has a balance of term expiring on 21 October 2010. 106. For the offence where NB committed fellatio on you, which I think is covered by sequences 10 and 22, you are sentenced to a minimum term of eighteen months, to commence on 22 November 2008 and expires on 21 May 2010, that has a balance of term of fifteen months expiring on 22 August 2011. 107. The offence of attempt anal intercourse against NB, which is covered by sequences 8 and 2, you are sentenced to a minimum term of eighteen months commencing on 22 February 2009 and expiring on 21 August 2010, that has a balance of term of twelve months fifteen days, expiring on 5 September 2011. 108. For the offence of sexual intercourse of NB when he was under ten, sequence 23, I set a minimum term of twenty-one months commencing on 22 May 2009 and expiring on 21 February 2011. There is a balance of term for that of twenty-two months fifteen days, expiring on 15 January 2013. I should indicate that it is in respect of that offence, the last one that I have taken into account the two Form 1 matters. 109. There are a number of s 166 matters. The sequence 11, the act of indecency towards DG, you are sentenced to six months, fixed terms in each of these cases, to date from 22 February 2007 and to expire on 21 August 2007. Sequence number 13 likewise, a six month sentence fixed term to run concurrently with the last one. Sequence 19, exhibit R+ films, six months to date from 22 January 2007 and to expire on 21 July 2007. Sequence 20, possessing an unregistered firearm to date from 22 January 2007, one month and to expire on 21 February 2007. The indecent assault of ME, sequence 24, eight months to date from 22 February 2008. Sequence 25, not keep firearm safely, four months to date from 22 January 2007 expire 21 May 2007. The sequence 26, the indecent assault of ME, the second one, eight months to date from 22 February 2008 and expire 21 October 2008. 110. The overall sentence imposed for the total criminality before the Court is one that could see the offender incarcerated from 22 January 2007 until 5 January 2013, that is, sixteen days shy of six years. The earliest release date is 21 February 2011, that is, the minimum period of four years incarceration. On the view most favourable to him, he could have a parole period of twenty-two and a half months. I recommend to the custodial offenders that the offender be offered at the earliest opportunity, a place in the CUBIT Program at Long Bay. I further recommend that until such a program is available to him, the offender be offered psychological counselling, particularly in respect of his earlier experiences of sexual abuse and anger management. I also recommend that he be placed in some other suitable program such as the USO, that is, Understanding Sexual Offending or the CORE Program.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: Oliver Silvano applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on him by Hulme J of this Court on 15 August 2006 for offences of:- 
     
      
    1. Assaulting a man named David Horin with intent to rob him, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon2. Murdering a woman named Tracey Lee Oliver 3. Maliciously shooting at David Horin with intent to do grievous bodily harm 
     
      
    2 The applicant had been found guilty of the three offences by a jury, after a trial presided over by Hulme J. 
     
      
    3 The sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were:- 
     
      
       
      For the offence of assaulting with intent to rob, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, a non-parole period of imprisonment of seven years commencing on 28 April 2004, with a balance of the term of two years four months. 
       
       
      For the offence of maliciously shooting at Mr Horin with intent to do grievous bodily harm, a non-parole period of imprisonment of four years with a balance of the term of one year four months, commencing on 28 April 2005. 
       
       
      For the offence of murder, a non-parole period of 16 years with a balance of the term of five years four months, also commencing on 28 April 2005. 
       
      
    4 Assaulting with intent to rob, whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, is an offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period for the offence. 
     
      
    5 Maliciously shooting at a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm was an offence under s 33 of the Crimes Act (since amended) for which the maximum penalty was imprisonment for 25 years and for which there was a standard non-parole period of seven years. 
     
      
    6 Murder is an offence under s 18 and s 19A of the Crimes Act for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life and for which there is a standard non-parole period of 20 years.  
     
      
       
      Facts of the offences 
       
      
    7 The facts of the offences were found and stated in considerable detail by his Honour in his remarks on sentence. Having regard to the only grounds of appeal against sentence, it is sufficient to give a concise summary of the facts found by his Honour. 
     
      
    8 At some time after midnight on 28 April 2004 the applicant and Tracey Lee Oliver, the victim of the offence of murder, left their room in a hotel in inner Sydney, which they had booked into the previous day. They intended to carry out a robbery. No victim had yet been selected. The applicant was carrying a backpack, which contained a loaded, sawn-off shotgun. 
     
      
    9 Near a shop in George Street in the city, Mr Horin, the victim of two of the offences, was accosted by the deceased, who asked him for help, claiming that she felt unwell. Mr Horin followed the deceased into a car park off the street. In the car park the applicant joined Mr Horin and the deceased. The applicant pointed the shotgun at Mr Horin, yelled expletives at him and threatened, if Mr Horin did not “get down”, to “blow off” Mr Horin’s head. This conduct on the part of the applicant constituted the offence under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    10 Mr Horin did not get down, as the applicant had demanded, and the applicant, now at close quarters to Mr Horin, pointed the shotgun towards Mr Horin’s stomach. Mr Horin pushed the barrel of the shotgun away from him, the gun discharged and the deceased Ms Oliver was struck by pellets which were discharged, receiving a major wound from which she later died. The Crown case against the applicant on the charge of murder was that the deceased had been killed during the commission by the applicant of a crime punishable by imprisonment for 25 years, being the crime charged under s 97(2) of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    11 After the deceased was shot, Mr Horin ran off. The applicant fired the shotgun at Mr Horin, one of the shotgun pellets lodging in Mr Horin’s shoulder. This conduct on the part of the applicant gave rise to the charge under s 33 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances of the applicant 
       
      
    12 In his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge made findings about the subjective circumstances of the applicant.  
     
      
    13 The applicant was born in Colombia in South America in 1977. He migrated to Australia with his mother in 1994.  
     
      
    14 Soon after the applicant arrived in Australia, he entered into a relationship with the deceased Ms Oliver. A child was born to them in 1996. Shortly after the birth of the child, the applicant and the deceased separated, the child remaining with the applicant. Not long before the offences were committed in 2004, there had been some resumption of the relationship between the applicant and the deceased. 
     
      
    15 The applicant had some criminal history but for comparatively minor offences of a different kind from any of those for which he was being sentenced and the sentencing judge found that the offences for which he was being sentenced were “completely out of character”.  
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge found that, since being imprisoned, the applicant “has made real and substantial efforts to improve himself both by way of courses and seeking psychological or other counselling”.  
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge found that the applicant had, as a result of causing the death of Ms Oliver, suffered grief and a degree of self-punishment.  
     
      
    18 In dealing with the applicant’s subjective circumstances the sentencing judge referred to two incidents which had occurred while the applicant had been in custody on remand. It will be necessary to refer to this part of his Honour’s remarks in detail in considering one of the grounds of appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    19 The sentencing judge found that the applicant had been housed in a Special Management Area Placement within the Correctional system for a substantial period and that it was likely that in the immediate future he would be given a higher protected custody classification. After discussing what allowance should be made because the applicant would serve at least part of his sentence in some form of protective custody, the sentencing judge said at par 37 of his remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a deal of authority as to the undesirability of the court specifying allowances for specific aspects taken into account on sentencing. However, in the circumstances of this case and in particular because of the nature and incidents of the topic with which I am presently dealing, and so that both the Crown and the prisoner are aware of my allowance in this regard, and may challenge it if so advised, I believe I should do so. On account of the matters to which I have just referred I propose to reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by 3 years.” 
        
       
      
    20 In par 49 of his remarks on sentence his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The only mitigating factors I regard as of significance are:- 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The prisoner does not have a record of previous convictions that I regard as significant; 
         
        (f) The prisoner is unlikely to re-offend; 
         
        (g) The prisoner has good prospects of rehabilitation; 
         
        (h) The prisoner has shown remorse; and 
         
        (i) There was some degree of pre-trial disclosure in the statement of agreed facts.” 
        
       
      
    21 Towards the end of his remarks on sentence the sentencing judge assessed the level of objective seriousness of the two offences for which there were standard non-parole periods. It is necessary to refer only to his Honour’s assessment of the level of objective seriousness of the offence of murder. At par 61 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As it is, I regard the offence as falling just below the middle of the range. The only factor that leads me to this view is that the person killed was a co-offender with the prisoner and someone who willingly undertook the risks that the night’s activities carried. I do not mean by taking this approach to suggest that the prisoner’s offence was other than extremely serious. However in numerous cases of murder including felony murder, the courts have placed emphasis on the fact that an innocent person, not responsible in any way for events, has lost their life. If that emphasis is not just empty air – and I do not so regard it – then the absence of that factor means the particular offence is not as objectively serious as when the factor is present.” 
        
       
      
    22 There were two grounds of appeal against sentence:- 
     
      
       
      1. The sentencing judge erred in failing properly to take into account the injuries inflicted on the applicant whilst in prison. 
       
       
      2. The sentencing judge erred in failing to give proper weight to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. 
       
      
    23 I will now consider each of these grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      1. The sentencing judge erred in failing properly to take into account the injuries inflicted on the applicant whilst in prison. 
       
      
    24 Earlier in this judgment I noted that the sentencing judge in discussing the subjective circumstances of the applicant referred to two incidents which had occurred while the applicant had been in custody. These incidents were described in pars 32-35 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence in which his Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “32 There are some other matters to which I shall refer. On 13 January 2005 the prisoner was anally raped while in the shower, soap being rubbed into his eyes, no doubt to help in the perpetrator’s anonymity. The prisoner did not report this for 9 days and there is no corroborative evidence. Nevertheless I accept this incident occurred. 
        
       
       
        
        33 On 15 August 2005 the prisoner was punched by another inmate and swelling to his face and bleeding from his eye was noticed by others. According to the prisoner, whose hearsay statements in this respect also I accept, he has lost substantial vision out of his eye. 
        
       
       
        
        34 The prisoner has been housed in a Special Management Area Placement for a substantial period. For reasons which I need not detail but which are the subject of evidence before me, it is likely that in the immediate future he will be given a higher protected custody classification. 
        
       
       
        
        35 Insofar as a prisoner may be subjected to more than normal restrictions in prison, a court may take this into account on sentencing. However otherwise, the fact that a prisoner may have suffered or may suffer injury or serious injury at the hands of other inmates is not, as I understand it, something of which a sentencing judge may take account. Accordingly, I do not propose to make any allowance for the injuries which the prisoner has suffered but I do propose to reduce the sentence I would otherwise have imposed on account of the fact of past and probably future protective custody.” 
        
       
      
    25 It was submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in not taking into account, and making some allowance for, the injuries inflicted on the applicant in these two incidents.  
     
      
    26 Counsel contended in written submissions that the injuries inflicted on the applicant came within the principle which I stated in R v Daetz; R v Wilson (2003) 139 A Crim R 398 at 411, that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A sentencing court, in determining what sentence it should impose on an offender, can properly take into account that the offender has already suffered some serious loss or detriment as a result of having committed the offence.” 
        
       
      
    27 It was acknowledged by counsel for the applicant that there was no evidence that the infliction of the injuries on the applicant had been motivated by a desire on the part of those inflicting the injuries to punish the applicant for the offences for which he was to be sentenced. However, it was submitted that there was a causal connection between the commission of the offences and imprisonment of the applicant and the infliction of the injuries, in that, but for the commission of the offences and the imprisonment of the applicant, the injuries would not have been inflicted.  
     
      
    28 I do not consider that these submissions should be accepted. 
     
      
    29 The principle stated by me in Daetz which was relied on by counsel for the applicant and which I have already quoted, was stated by me in the context of determining whether a sentencing court can properly take into account “extra-curial punishment”, that is loss or detriment imposed on an offender by persons other than the sentencing court, for the purpose of punishing the offender for his offence or at least by reason of the offender having committed the offence. Cases in which such extra-curial punishment occurred include the cases of R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 and R v Clampitt-Wotton (2002) 37 MVR 340, both of which are referred to in Daetz, and Daetz itself. 
     
      
    30 The concept of extra-curial punishment has on occasions been extended so as to apply in cases where the offender received serious injuries in the course of, or shortly after, committing the offence, the injuries being inflicted by others or being accidentally self-inflicted by the offender. Examples of such cases include R v Fletcher, a decision of a Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal noted at (1980) 4 Crim LJ 244; R v Noble [1996] 1 Qd R 329 (Queensland Court of Criminal Appeal); R v Barci (1994) 76 A Crim R 103 (Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal); and R v Haddara (1997) 95 A Crim R 108 (Victorian Court of Appeal). All of these cases were referred to in Daetz. Later cases include R v Webb [2004] NSWCCA 330, where the offender was shot by police in the course of being arrested after committing the offence and suffered significant and ongoing disabilities, which were taken into account in the sentencing of the offender. 
     
      
    31 In R v Sharpe [2006] NSWCCA 255, where the offender was shot by a security guard in the course of committing the offence, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that, on the very limited evidence about the extent of the offender’s injuries, a ground of appeal that the sentencing judge had failed to take sufficient account of extra-curial punishment should not be upheld.  
     
      
    32 In Alameddine v R [2006] NSWCCA 317 the offender had received serious burns, when, being about to be arrested, he accidentally caused a laboratory in which he was illegally manufacturing amphetamine to explode. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that the injuries suffered by the applicant should have been taken into account in the sentencing of the offender, notwithstanding that the injuries had resulted from illegal activities and had been self-inflicted.  
     
      
    33 In the recent decision of this Court in Christodoulou v R [2008] NSWCCA 5 May 2008 the Court held that injuries resulting from the offender having deliberately injected himself with battery acid at about the time of being arrested were not to be taken into account in the sentencing of the offender. 
     
      
    34 Notwithstanding these extensions to the concept of extra-curial punishment, the Court was not referred on this application to any case which would support taking into account in favour of the present applicant the injuries suffered by him in the two incidents. There is nothing in the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence or in the agreed facts or in the Correctional Services records which were included in the appeal papers, to suggest that the injuries were inflicted on the applicant by the other prisoners for the purpose of punishing him for having committed the offences of any of them. The first incident appears to have been simply a brutal sexual assault. The second incident appears to have arisen out of a dispute between the applicant and another prisoner with whom he was then sharing a cell.  
     
      
    35 In my opinion, it is not sufficient to enable injuries suffered by an offender in prison to be taken into account as extra-curial punishment, that the injuries would not have been suffered, if the offender had not been arrested and remanded in custody as a result of having committed the offences. If such a connection between the offences and injuries suffered by a prisoner was sufficient, then injuries suffered by a prisoner could be taken into account as extra-curial punishment, even if they had resulted merely from some mishap occurring in the prison, such as the prisoner accidentally falling.  
     
      
    36 Of course, if an offender has suffered injuries while he is in prison awaiting sentence, and as a consequence of the injuries the offender’s conditions of custody will be more than usually onerous, that matter can be taken into account in the sentencing of the offender.  
     
      
    37 I would reject the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      2. The sentencing judge erred in failing to give proper weight to the subjective circumstances of the applicant. 
       
      
    38 Counsel for the applicant’s argument in favour of this ground, which was directed only to the sentence for the offence of murder, contained a number of steps, which I will now summarise. 
     
      
       
      (1) As there is a standard non-parole period for the offence of murder (of 20 years), the sentencing judge was obliged to assess the objective seriousness of the applicant’s offence to determine whether the applicant’s offence fell in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of murder.  
       
       
      (2) The sentencing judge assessed the applicant’s offence “as falling just below the middle of the range”. His Honour distinguished the applicant’s offence of murdering Ms Oliver from other offences of murder in which the victim is not responsible in any way for what happened. 
       
       
      (3) The sentencing judge, in a part of his remarks on sentence which I have already quoted, quantified at three years the discount he was allowing because the applicant would serve at least part of his sentence on protection.  
       
       
      (4) Consequently, if, as his Honour had found, the objective criminality of the applicant’s offence of murder fell below the middle of the range and a discount of three years was allowed because the applicant would be serving part of his sentence on protection, the sentencing judge would have arrived at a non-parole period of 16 years, which was the non-parole period in the sentence his Honour imposed. However, the setting of such a non-parole period meant that no allowance had been made by the sentencing judge for the favourable subjective circumstances which the sentencing judge had found in his remarks on sentence, that the offences were out of character, that the applicant had shown remorse, that the applicant had suffered a degree of self-punishment, that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation, that the applicant had made real and substantial efforts to improve himself and that there had been some degree of pre-trial disclosure in the statement of agreed facts. 
       
      
    39 I do not consider that this argument by counsel for the applicant should succeed. 
     
      
    40 Although the sentencing judge’s own decision to quantify the amount of the discount he was allowing for protection might have encouraged such an argument, there are a number of statements of high authority that such a mathematical approach to sentencing as is manifested in the argument by the applicant’s counsel is to be avoided. For example, in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ said at 624 [46]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Sentencing is not a process that leads to a single correct answer arrived at by some process admitting of mathematical precision.” 
        
       
      
    41 In Markarian v The Queen (2005) 79 ALJR 1048 at 1058 [39] Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Following the decision of this Court in  
        Wong 
         (2001) 207 CLR 584  
        it cannot now be doubted that sentencing courts may not add and subtract item by item from some apparently subliminally derived figure, passages of time in order to fix the time which an offender must serve in prison.” 
        
       
       
      It is true that in the present case the standard non-parole period is not “a subliminally derived figure” but the passage is otherwise applicable.  
       
      
    42 Even if a mathematical approach of the kind advocated by counsel for the applicant is adopted, the argument should, in my opinion, be rejected. The argument depends, at least partly, on the final sentence in par 37 of his Honour’s remarks on sentence being read as expressing a decision by his Honour to allow a discount of three years from the non-parole period. However, the words used by his Honour in the final sentence of par 37 to describe what was being reduced by three years were “the sentence” and I consider that his Honour was distinguishing between “the sentence”, that is the head sentence, and the non-parole period. A discount of three years from the head sentence will produce a discount of less than three years from the non-parole period.  
     
      
    43 Furthermore, there was considerable overlap between the various favourable subjective circumstances found by the sentencing judge, for example that the applicant had shown remorse and that the applicant had suffered a degree of self-punishment; and that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend and that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation and that the applicant had made efforts while in custody to improve himself. His Honour found that the offence fell only just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness and, even after allowing a discount of three years from the head sentence for the applicant being in protective custody, there was still room for his Honour to make some allowance for the applicant’s favourable subjective circumstances, consistently with his setting a non-parole period of 16 years.  
     
      
    44 I would reject this ground of appeal and, as I have rejected both grounds of appeal. I would, while granting leave to appeal, dismiss the appeal against sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 20 April 2007, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of the indictable offence of having maliciously destroyed a dwelling house by means of fire contrary to s 195(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for that offence is 10 years imprisonment. The trial judge, his Honour Nield DCJ, imposed a suspended sentence of two years.  
     
      
    2 The appellant appeals against her conviction.  
     
      
    3 The Crown case was that in the early hours of 31 January 2004, outside the Post Office at Armidale Mall, Armidale, the appellant accused Sally-Ann Cutmore of “having an affair” with her husband. The appellant assaulted Ms Cutmore and threatened to kill her. Ms Cutmore escaped and hid from the appellant, who continued to search for her. Ms Cutmore complained of the incident to the police at the Armidale police station at about 2.10 am on 31 January 2004.  
     
      
    4 Ms Cutmore had, for some years prior to 2004, lived at 12 West Avenue, Armidale. She knew both the appellant and her partner but had not had a relationship with the appellant’s partner. The premises adjoining 12 West Avenue, being 10 West Avenue, were owned by John Moore, who conducted a second-hand bargain centre in Armidale. Mr Moore had, for approximately seven years, used the premises to store furniture and other stock for his business. There was a verandah at the front of the house, on which two easy chairs were stored. The chairs were covered with a cotton frilly fabric. From the verandah, there was a window through to the front room, which, during the time that Mr Moore had owned the premises had never been opened. Immediately under the window inside this room, there was an old iron-framed desk with a wooden top.  
     
      
    5 Between 2.30 am and 2.40 am on 31 January 2004, the appellant hired a taxi, driven by Peter Hooper, to drive her to 12 West Avenue. Mr Hooper gave evidence that the appellant was staggering and speaking in a slurred voice and that her breath smelt of alcohol at the time. Mr Hooper drove the appellant to 12 West Avenue and when he asked for the fare, which was approximately $6, she said she didn’t have any money and that she would have to go into the house to see “a lady … to get the money”.  
     
      
    6 Mr Hooper saw the appellant approach the premises, vigorously knock and kick the door and heard her yelling. He saw that the door was opened by an occupant of the premises. He did not hear the content of any of the exchange between the appellant and the person who had opened the door. The appellant returned to the cab, said she still didn’t have the money and that she would go to the premises next door, because the person she was looking for was not at 12 West Avenue. Mr Hooper said he moved his car down to 10 West Avenue and again, the appellant went to the front door and banged, kicked and yelled. He said that no one answered the door.  
     
      
    7 The appellant came back to the cab, stating she wanted to go further. Mr Hooper refused because he had not been paid. The appellant then paid him the $6 in change and again said she wanted to go further. Mr Hooper said he would not take her further unless she could prove that she could pay any further fare. The appellant could not do that and got out of the cab, slamming the door. Mr Hooper observed her going back into 10 West Avenue.  
     
      
    8 Mr Hooper left the vicinity and approximately half an hour later, he was paged in his capacity as a part-time fire officer and was informed that there was a fire at 10 West Avenue. Mr Hooper, who knew the appellant, said that she was wearing trousers and a coat and was not carrying anything that he had noticed. 
     
      
    9 Dennis Froome was resident at 12 West Avenue on 31 January 2004. He said that at about 2.15 am on 31 January, someone had started banging and kicking on his door and yelling “Sally-Ann, Sally-Ann get out here, I want to [fuck] you”. Mr Froome said that when he opened the door, there was a woman standing there. There was a strong smell of alcohol on her breath. He told the woman that Sally-Ann did not live there. He observed the woman leave his premises and get in the cab and he saw the cab reverse down to the next door property, 10 West Avenue.  
     
      
    10 Mr Froome said he recognised the sound of the gate to that property squeaking. He heard banging on the windows and doors and a female voice “screaming out for Sally-Ann”. He also heard the person go down the side of the house, where she continued to scream out “for Sally-Ann”. At about 2.30 am, the same person returned to his property and again started banging on the door. Mr Froome informed her that Sally-Ann didn’t live at 12 West Avenue and that she was to leave, otherwise he would call the police. He saw the person walk out of the gate and back down into 10 West Avenue. Mr Froome said he heard her go through the gate, heard her banging on the door again and then it was quiet, until about 2.45-2.50 am, when he heard an explosion and called the police. Mr Froome said that, having heard the explosion, he looked out the window and saw the flames and that by that time, the place was well alight. He went outside and saw “flames shooting out from the front of the verandah”. He estimated that about 10 minutes elapsed between the time he heard the woman at 10 West avenue and the sound of the explosion.  
     
      
    11 William Supple, who lived at 9 West Avenue on the opposite side of the road, was woken at about 2.30 am on 31 January 2004 by the sound of a female voice. Mr Supple went out onto his patio and saw a person walking away from 12 West Avenue, as well as his neighbour, Mr Froome, on his verandah. Mr Supple said he saw a taxi in the street. He next heard some knocking on 13 West Avenue, and the next sound he heard was that of glass breaking. He thought this was about 5 to 10 minutes later. He went back out onto his patio and saw a female person at the front door of 10 West Avenue.  
     
      
    12 Later, Mr Supple saw smoke appearing from near the front door. Mr Supple said the person he saw at the front door of 10 West Avenue was the same person he had seen shortly before. He said he heard an explosion, which sounded as if the front window had blown open. Mr Supple said that he saw no persons other than his neighbour, Mr Froome, and the person who walked away from Mr Froome’s premises in the street at that time. Mr Supple said that the only smoke that he saw was coming from out of the front door. He did not see any smoke in the left-hand corner of the verandah where, as the evidence established, the two easy chairs referred to above were located.  
     
      
    13 The Newcastle Communications Centre received a report of the fire at about 3.17 am and processed the call through to the Armidale Fire Brigade. 
     
      
    14 The premises at 10 West Avenue were extensively damaged, with most of the damage occurring in the front room. The north-eastern corner of the verandah also sustained heavy damage. A brick was found underneath the window between the verandah and the front room. The brick had previously been at the front fence before the fire. After the fire, the window leading from the verandah into the front room was found open. The debris of heavy sheets of fabric was also found on the floor. A can containing methylated spirits was located in the front room. However, the can had its lid on and was intact, despite the fire.  
     
      
    15 Detective Sergeant Carnell, the Forensic Supervisor who conducted the investigation into the fire, formed the opinion that the fire was not caused by the use of any accelerant. He also formed the opinion that the fire had commenced within the front room and travelled out from there. His opinion was based upon the extent of damage to the front room, including damage to items within that room compared to the area immediately outside on the verandah. He was not able to determine, however, what was the primary source of ignition within the front room. Detective Sergeant Carnell also expressed the opinion that the fire was not due to any electrical fault. He did not consider that the likely origin of the fire was on the front verandah. He expressed the opinion that the fire had not been caused by spontaneous combustion. 
     
      
    16 The senior fire officer who attended the fire was David Nixon. Mr Nixon had expressed an opinion that the fire started on the front verandah, because the lounge chairs that had been located on the verandah had burnt through the verandah floor onto the ground beneath. However, Mr Nixon recognised that Detective Sergeant Carnell was an expert and that he himself was not trained as a forensic investigator into the causes of fires. He confirmed that there was no smell of accelerant on the premises. Mr Nixon also gave evidence in cross-examination that a lit cigarette butt could cause a fire, by falling on lounge suite, if flammable material was exposed. He explained that it would depend upon the type of material, stating that “some materials … won’t burn by the start of a cigarette and others … will”. He also accepted that sheets or blankets might be set on fire by a burning cigarette butt. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    17 The appellant raises three grounds of appeal:  
     
      
       
      1. That the learned trial judge erred in giving the jury direction excluding accident as a reasonable possibility; 
       
       
      2. The learned trial judge erred in directing the jury that a conclusion inconsistent with guilt must be equally reasonable as that consistent with guilt; and 
       
       
      3. That the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or could not be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
       
      Ground 1: error in the trial judge’s direction excluding accident as a reasonable possibility of the cause of the fire 
       
      
    18 The trial judge gave the following direction to the jury in respect of the cause of the fire: 
     
      
       
        
        “Learned counsel for the [appellant] submitted to you that the fire may have been a consequence of some accidental act. In the way this trial has been conducted, having regard to the evidence that has been presented to you, you could not find that the fire was a consequence of some accidental act. To find that the fire was a consequence of some accidental act would be mere speculation. I have told you already that the jury is not entitled to speculate about anything. So it is not a matter of deciding whether the fire was lit intentionally or recklessly, or whether the fire resulted from some accidental act. It is a matter of deciding whether the evidence satisfies you beyond reasonable doubt that the fire was lit intentionally or recklessly. If you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt by the evidence that it was lit deliberately or recklessly, then your duty is to find the [appellant] to be guilty. If you are not satisfied by the evidence beyond reasonable doubt that it was lit deliberately or recklessly, then your duty is to find the [appellant] to be not guilty …”  
        
       
      
    19 Counsel for the appellant submitted that this direction was in error. She referred the Court to R v McIntyre [2000] NSWCCA 6; (2000) 111 A Crim R 211. That case also involved a fire. The trial judge, in his directions to the jury, pointed out that the Crown case depended on circumstantial evidence. He then directed the jury in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before you can find an accused person guilty of a crime on the basis of circumstantial evidence, you must be satisfied that such a finding is not only reasonable, but that it is the only reasonable finding to make. That is the only reasonable conclusion to draw. It follows that if there is another finding that is reasonably open, that is if there is another reasonable explanation based on evidence, ladies and gentlemen, not on speculation or guessing, based on evidence which is consistent with innocence, it is your duty to find the accused not guilty. 
         
         
        The accused says that there are other reasonable explanations which are consistent with him being innocent. He says that the fire may have been started with Miss West dropping a lighted cigarette onto a lounge chair and she, or the children, kicking the bean bag or doona against the radiator. The Accused says these things could have happened, either accidentally, in panic to get away or deliberately for the purpose of getting a housing transfer. That is a matter for you to judge but you cannot speculate or guess about it.” (See [29] ff of  
        McIntyre 
        ) 
        
       
      
    20 Prior to giving this direction, the trial judge in McIntyre had earlier stated to the jury during the course of the summing-up that there was no evidence that the fire in that case had been either accidentally or deliberately lit by the accused. He said that those matters were no more than suggestions and that the jury was not allowed to speculate.  
     
      
    21 Hulme J, with whom Sully and Hidden JJ agreed, stated at [30]-[34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “30 It is, of course, both proper and common for a judge in the course of a summing up to tell a jury that they must not speculate or guess, operations of the mind quite different from the drawing of inferences. However, as his Honour pointed out to the jury, this was a circumstantial evidence case. The appellant was entitled to be acquitted if the Crown could not exclude all reasonable hypotheses consistent with innocence.  
         
         
        31 Such hypotheses must, as I have said, be reasonable. But a jury does not have to be able to infer that an event, the subject of such an hypothesis, in fact occurred before relying on, or making allowance for, the possibility of such an event. A couple of examples demonstrate this point.  
         
         
        32 A rape is committed at night in the victim’s home. The Crown presents a case based on circumstantial evidence that the offender was A. There is clear evidence that the windows of the victim’s home were open and other persons were around and acting suspiciously. A would be entitled to be acquitted as there would be a reasonable possibility that someone else was the offender.  
         
         
        33 A fire commences on a wooden bench on which the owner was, earlier in the day, ironing. He says he thinks he turned the iron off. Clearly, there remains a reasonable possibility that he did not. A suspect against whom the Crown presented a circumstantial evidence case as to his involvement would be entitled to be acquitted. Although the circumstances might not justify an inference that the fire did start accidentally from the iron, those circumstances raised that cause as a reasonable possibility.  
         
         
        34 It would, of course be a matter of speculation, whether in fact that rape had been committed by someone else; or the fire had occurred accidentally due to a failure to turn the iron off; but there is no speculation involved in considering whether these are reasonable possibilities.” 
        
       
      
    22 Hulme J considered that notwithstanding the direction (set out at [19] above), the trial judge’s comments that there was no evidence that the fire had been lit, inter alia, accidentally, may have been taken by the jury as being a direction that they could not take account of the possibility of the fire being accidental. His Honour considered that to be an error.  
     
      
    23 McIntyre was considered by this Court in Kaliyanda v R [2007] NSWCCA 300. In that case, a direction as to circumstantial evidence was given in unexceptionable terms. The trial judge, however, elaborated the direction in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “In other words, if there is a reasonable possibility upon the whole of the circumstances proved then the accused is not guilty, then he is entitled to the benefit of that circumstance and is entitled to a verdict of not guilty at your hands. It is really just another way of saying of what I have said to you several times now that the crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.” (Set out at [60] of  
        Kaliyanda 
        ) 
        
       
      
    24 On appeal, the appellant submitted that that direction may have confused the jury,  
     
      
       
        
        “… as they may have thought that it was necessary for them to be able to infer that a circumstance, the subject of such a rational conclusion, in fact occurred before relying on, or making allowance for, the possibility of such a circumstance.” (Set out at [61] of  
        Kaliyanda 
        ) 
        
       
      
    25 McClellan CJ at CL, Hulme and Harrison JJ agreeing, rejected this submission. He considered, at [63]-[66], that the jury would not have been misled into believing that the hypothetical possibility must be proved. His Honour considered that the jury had been clearly directed to reject possibilities that were inconsistent with the appellant being guilty before the Crown could get “to first base” on its case.  
     
      
    26 The case with which this Court is presently concerned was also a circumstantial case. The appellant was seen at the house at about the time of the fire. She had expressed animus towards Ms Cutmore. There was evidence that she was a smoker and there was evidence that she was drunk. The Crown case against the appellant was that she had either deliberately or recklessly started the fire. The appellant’s case was that there was a reasonable hypothesis that the fire had occurred accidentally.  
     
      
    27 The intentional lighting of a fire is easy to understand. In this case, the person responsible may have struck a match, or used a cigarette lighter, or used a cigarette to ignite some flammable material, of which there was a considerable quantity, inside the house. Reckless and accidental acts are not necessarily so easily described and the line between the two is not necessarily clear-cut. A reckless act might occur where a person, knowing there was flammable material in the room, flicks a cigarette butt, not caring whether the butt landed near or on the flammable material. An accidental act might be where a person, smoking a cigarette, stumbles and drops the cigarette onto some flammable material, and is either unable to retrieve it, or the flammable material ignites almost instantaneously. Another example might be where a person drops a cigarette butt and it happens to fall onto flammable material. However, that circumstance, taken in combination with other circumstances, might be considered by a jury to be reckless.  
     
      
    28 In this case, where the case against the appellant was based upon circumstantial evidence, a hypothesis that the fire was started accidentally was a reasonable hypothesis. Likewise, the hypothesis that the fire was ignited as a result of a reckless act was also a reasonable hypothesis in the circumstances. The rejection of the appellant’s case that there was a reasonable hypothesis arising from the evidence that the fire was lit accidentally should therefore have been left to the jury. However, his Honour directed the jury on the basis that there were only two hypotheses that they were to consider. If the jury accepted either of those hypotheses, the appellant would be found guilty. There was, as I have indicated, a third reasonable hypothesis of an accidental act that was consistent with innocence and which should have been left to the jury’s determination.  
     
      
    29 It follows, therefore, that ground 1 should be upheld.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: that his Honour erred in directing the jury that a conclusion inconsistent with guilt must be equally reasonable as that consistent with guilt 
       
      
    30 Having given the direction subject of ground 1 of the appeal, the trial judge returned to the meaning of circumstantial evidence and gave the jury a number of examples. No issue is taken as to the use of the examples. His Honour then said that in respect of each of the examples he had given, the jury might think that the evidence was quite strong, but that, nonetheless,  
     
      
       
        
        “… in a circumstantial evidence case, for the jury to draw the conclusion that A had shot B with the firearm [that being the example], it must be the  
        only reasonable and rational conclusion to draw from the proved facts 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour returned to the example he had been explaining and then continued his directions in respect of the jury’s task when dealing with a circumstantial case. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So that is why, members of the jury, in a circumstantial evidence case,  
        the conclusion that the jury is asked to draw must be the only reasonable and rational conclusion to draw 
         from the proved facts. If there is another reasonable and rational conclusion to be drawn from the proved facts inconsistent with guilt, then a conclusion of guilt cannot be drawn, simply because there are competing reasonable and rational conclusions. So, members of the jury, in a circumstantial evidence case, for a jury to find an accused person guilty on the basis of circumstantial evidence,  
        the conclusion of guilt must be the only, and I emphasise the word only, reasonable and rational conclusion to be drawn from the proved facts 
        . If there is another reasonable and rational conclusion that can be drawn from the proved facts inconsistent with guilt, then a conclusion of guilt cannot be drawn because, obviously,  
        if there are two equally reasonable and rational conclusions to be drawn, one of guilt and one inconsistent with guilt 
        , then it cannot be that the only reasonable and rational conclusion to be drawn is one of guilt.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    32 This direction was contrary to clear High Court authority. In Martin v Osborne [1936] HCA 23; (1936) 55 CLR 367 Dixon CJ stated at 375: 
     
      
       
        
        “If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      Plomp v R 
       [1963] HCA 44; (1963) 110 CLR 234 per Dixon CJ at 243.  
       
      
    33 In Knight v R [1992] HCA 56; (1992) 175 CLR 495, Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ in their joint judgment held that a direction given in almost identical terms in the trial of Knight was erroneous. The direction in that case was that Knight: 
     
      
       
        
        “… could only succeed in his argument if the two inferences said to be open - one consistent with innocence and the other consistent with guilt - were equally open.” 
        
       
      
    34 Their Honours stated, however, that the correct test was that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if a reasonable jury ought to have found that an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence  
        was open on the evidence 
        , then it ought to have given the appellant the benefit of the doubt necessarily created by that circumstance.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    35 The Crown, whilst not conceding that the direction given by his Honour in this case was wrong, accepted that if the reference to there being two equally reasonable and rational conclusions to be drawn was part of the direction, then such a direction was wrong. The Crown submitted, however, that properly understood, that statement was part of an explanation. It was submitted that his Honour was not, at that point, giving a direction, as was apparent from the adequate and correct directions otherwise given in the passage that I have quoted.  
     
      
    36 With respect to this careful argument advanced by the Crown, I do not agree that the trial judge was merely providing an explanation of the principle upon which he was directing them. But even if was, it was an unequivocal statement to the jury from which the jury could understand that if an hypothesis consistent with innocence was open on the evidence, it was an hypothesis that had to have equal weight with a hypothesis consistent with guilt before the jury could act upon it. Such a statement is contrary to established principle as discussed in the authorities to which I have referred. 
     
      
    37 Ground 2 should also be upheld. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: the verdict of guilt should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence 
       
      
    38 The appellant submitted that a properly directed jury, having regard to the circumstantial nature of the evidence, could not reasonably return a verdict of guilty. It was submitted that the evidence did not exclude a reasonably possible hypothesis consistent with innocence: see Knight v R. In M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487, the High Court said at [6]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where a court of criminal appeal sets aside a verdict on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence, it frequently does so expressing its conclusion in terms of a verdict which is unsafe or unsatisfactory. Other terms may be used such as ‘unjust or unsafe’. In reaching such a conclusion, the court does not consider as a question of law whether there is evidence to support the verdict. Questions of law are separately dealt with by s.6(1). The question is one of fact which the court must decide by making its own independent assessment of the evidence and determining whether, notwithstanding that there is evidence upon which a jury might convict, ‘none the less it would be dangerous in all the circumstances to allow the verdict of guilty to stand’. But a verdict may be unsafe or unsatisfactory for reasons which lie outside the formula requiring that it not be ‘unreasonable’ or incapable of being ‘supported having regard to the evidence’. A verdict which is unsafe or unsatisfactory for any other reason must also constitute a miscarriage of justice requiring the verdict to be set aside. In speaking of the Criminal Appeal Act in  
        Hargan v. The King 
        , Isaacs J said:  
         
         
          
          ‘If (the appellant) can show a miscarriage of justice, that is sufficient. That is the greatest innovation made by the Act, and to lose sight of that is to miss the point of the legislative advance.’” (Citations omitted) 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 This lays down the approach to be taken to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases 
         
         
        (1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. 
         
         
        (2) Subject to the special provisions of this Act, the court shall, if it allows an appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction, quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered. 
         
        
       
      
    40 The test in M was confirmed by the High Court in MFA v R [2002] HCA 53; 213 CLR 606, where the Court stated at [47]: 
     
      
       
        
        “When attention is focussed on the actual language of s 6(1) of the Act, it appears to confer a very large power to be applied by reference to criteria that are not stated in restrictive or narrow terms. On the face of things ""unreasonable"", in particular, seems to state a very broad test.” 
        
       
      
    41 In my opinion, this is not a case where the jury verdict should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The evidence of the appellant being at the house for a period of 10 minutes to half an hour before the fire started; that she believed that Ms Cutmore resided at that house; and that she had an intention to do harm to Ms Cutmore that evening, was strong circumstantial evidence of the guilt of the appellant. As I have explained above, there was no necessary clear line in this case between an hypothesis of reckless conduct, that would result in verdict of guilty, and an hypothesis of accident, that would result in a verdict of not guilty. It was a matter for the jury whether they considered there was an inference of a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence. However, I do not consider that this is a case where it could be said that the jury could not reasonably return a verdict of guilty. 
     
      
    42 Accordingly, I would reject ground 3. 
     
      
    43 It follows that the appeal should be allowed and the orders I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Conviction quashed; 
       
       
      3. Order that there be a new trial.

    1 GILES JA: I agree with Barr J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: Tyson Stokes seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. For knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug on 6 January 2006 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of one year six months with a non-parole period of one month and fourteen days. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug on 13 January 2006 he was sentenced to imprisonment for a period of one year and six months with a non-parole period of one year one month and fourteen days. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug other than cannabis on three occasions during thirty consecutive days for financial or material reward committed between 30 December 2005 and 27 January 2006 the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for three years with a non-parole period of two years. The sentences for the first two counts were ordered to run concurrently. That for the third count was accumulated by one year upon the non-parole period for the first two. The resulting sentence was a non-parole period of three years and a balance of term of one year. The maximum penalty for each of the first two counts was 15 years and for the third 20 years. 
     
      
    3 In December 2005 and January 2006 police conducted a controlled operation in a nightclub in Gosford. Their operatives approached the applicant and negotiated the supply of prohibited drugs. On the first occasion, 30 December 2005, the applicant said that he could supply as many pills as the operatives required and provided his mobile telephone number for future transactions. On that occasion he supplied for $70 two pills which he said were ecstasy but which in fact contained the prohibited drug ketamine. The weight was 0.55g and the purity 36.5%. That was the first of the three transactions contemplated by the third count, the charge of ongoing supply. 
     
      
    4 The second incident contemplated by that count took place on 7 January 2006. One of the operatives, calling herself Sarah, telephoned the applicant, who was at the nightclub, and asked for a gram of cocaine. The applicant said that the price was $200 per gram and that he would telephone her to confirm that it was available. He later returned the call and said that he could supply only a few points of cocaine at $50 per point. A point is 0.1g. They came to an agreement that the applicant would sell the operative five ecstasy pills for $25 each and that he would throw in a point of cocaine. Eventually the operative handed over $120 and received from the applicant a plastic bag containing five pills. They talked about cocaine and the applicant said that he normally sold grams rather than points. It turned out that the pills did not contain ecstasy at all but 1.26g methylamphetamine at 6% purity. 
     
      
    5 The third transaction in that count took place on 27 January 2006. Three operatives spoke to the applicant at various times at the nightclub and one of them came to an agreement to purchase two ecstasy pills. A second joined in the conversation and asked him to increase the supply to five pills. The applicant said that he could supply the pills within an hour. A short time later he told one of the operatives that he could sell ecstasy pills at $40 per pill and that they cost him $30 each. The operative said that she would take only three at that price. The applicant handed over three pills for $120. Those pills proved on analysis to contain ecstasy, two of them weighing 0.5g altogether at 27% purity and the other weighing 0.24g at 25.5% purity. 
     
      
    6 The offence the subject of the first count was committed on 6 January 2006. One of the operatives, who was at the nightclub, telephoned the applicant on his mobile phone. He was not in the vicinity. A series of text messages followed, with the applicant supplying a further telephone number for the operatives to call. They did so and an anonymous person agreed to supply two ecstasy pills for $60. There were further calls and the operatives asked for five pills at the same price. A deal was made. The anonymous person told the operatives to wait in the car park and look for a red Lancer car. They did so and the car arrived. A man introduced himself as Keith. One of the operatives gave the man $150 and he gave her five tablets in exchange. The operative asked whether they could contact Keith in future but he told them to go through Tyson. In a telephone conversation that took place later on the same night the applicant asked whether Josh had met the operatives. He was told that he had not and that Keith had met them. The conversation ended with the applicant promising to get “the good stuff” on the following day. The pills supplied on that occasion weighed 1.8g and contained ketamine at 36.5% purity. 
     
      
    7 The second count was based upon the events of 13 January 2006. One of the operatives, calling herself Felicity, telephoned the applicant at the nightclub. He asked her whether she wanted the same as the week before and told her that he had cocaine. Felicity asked for about a gram and he said that he had it on him. They agreed on a price of $200. They met as arranged. The operative had a drink with her and the applicant said that he wished to place in the drink the gram of cocaine which he had. That was because he was worried about her having a bag with his fingerprints on it. The operative refused. She said that she wanted the whole gram to use. She declined a taste test. The applicant went to the toilet and on emerging told the operative that he had used most of the cocaine. There was one point left, he said, which the operative could have for $20. The operative paid $20 and the applicant supplied the substance. It turned out not to contain any prohibited drug.  
     
      
    8 The first ground of appeal asserts that the sentencing judge erred in finding present the aggravating factor referred to in s21A(2)(n) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    9 Features which aggravate the criminality of an offence are dealt with in s21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Relevantly, the section is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        (1)In determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, the court is to take into account the following matters:  
         
          
          (a) the aggravating factors referred to in subsection (2) that are relevant and known to the court, 
          
         
        
       
       … 
       
        
        The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law. 
        2)Aggravating factors 
        The aggravating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence are as follows: 
        … 
         
          
          (n) the offence was part of a planned or organised criminal activity, 
          
         
        … 
        The court is not to have additional regard to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
        
       
       … 
       
      
    10 The sentencing hearing took place on 3 April 2007. After the close of the evidence the legal representative of the applicant made his submissions. He did not mention any aggravating feature. The Crown responded, saying this among other things -  
     
      
       
        
        …In relation to s21A(2) there are no aggravating features I put before you… 
        
       
      
    11 Understandably, the representative of the applicant did not take issue with that statement. His Honour adjourned the matter to 13 April 2007 for sentence.  
     
      
    12 On 13 April 2007 his Honour imposed sentence, and as part of the remarks on sentence said this - 
     
      
       
        
        In determining an appropriate sentence to impose upon the offender for each of the offences to which he has pleaded guilty, I must recognise the purposes of sentencing outlined in section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and I must take into account such of the aggravating factors referred to in s21A(2) of that Act as are present…I consider that the only aggravating factor is that lettered (n) in s21A(2)… 
        
       
      
    13 It was submitted on appeal the hearing had been conducted unfairly to the applicant. His representative had been led to believe that the Crown was not asserting the presence of any aggravating feature. No mention was made of any fact which might be seen as aggravating the offences. His Honour did not express any intention of taking into account any feature as aggravating the applicant’s criminality. If the matter had been aired, the legal representative of the applicant would have been able to deal with it and, perhaps, persuade the sentencing judge that no such aggravating feature was in fact present or should be taken into account in imposing sentence. 
     
      
    14 As Howie J said in R v Tadrosse [2005] NSWCCA 145 at [19], it is prudent for sentencing judges to raise with the parties during addresses whether any of the factors listed in s21A(2) apply to the sentencing exercise being undertaken. If the sentencing judge considers that any of the aggravating factors listed is present, in fairness to the offender, the judge should indicate to the offender’s legal representative that he or she is considering taking that matter into account so that, if necessary, the court might be persuaded that the aggravating feature is not present or for some reason it should not be taken into account in the peculiar circumstances of the case under consideration. 
     
      
    15 In the result, the ultimate sentencing decisions were made on a basis of fact which included a feature that the applicant believed was absent and with which he had no opportunity to deal. In my opinion this ground of appeal has been made good.  
     
      
    16 The power of the court in such an instance lies in s6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which provides (for present purposes) that the court, if it is of opinion that some other less severe sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefor, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    17 The question whether any sentence less severe than that imposed on the applicant is warranted in law requires a consideration not only of the question of aggravation but of every factor going to sentence.  
     
      
    18 In addition to the facts of the offences themselves, which I have extracted from the agreed statement of facts tendered on sentence, these are the most important of his Honour’s unchallenged findings of fact. The applicant and his younger sister were raised by their mother after their parents separated. That had happened when the applicant was about four years of age. He no longer had any relationship with his mother or father, though he was trying to re-establish that with his mother. He pursued an apparently normal school career until leaving with the School Certificate at the end of Year 10. That was in 1999. He began consuming intoxicating liquor and smoking cannabis when he was about 14 years old. He began an apprenticeship as a mechanic but terminated it after 14 months. Since then he had held various casual labouring and unskilled jobs.  
     
      
    19 He moved onto the use of other prohibited drugs when he was about 16. He limited his consumption of intoxicating liquor, however, and stopped using prohibited drugs when he was about 20 years old. He was not using any prohibited drug when he committed these offences. He was then 22 years old and unemployed. He was in good physical and mental health, though he believed he might have an undiagnosed mental illness.  
     
      
    20 He was arrested on 21 March 2006 and charged with having committed the present offences. On 24 August 2006 he pleaded guilty to them all at the Local Court. He appeared in the District Court on 3 April 2007 and maintained his guilty pleas. 21 At the hearing before his Honour the offender said that he was depressed, following the breakdown of a relationship he had had with a girl, and that, not thinking clearly, he agreed to supply the drugs to the undercover police officers. His Honour rejected that evidence and concluded that the offender knew what he was doing and was in control of what happened.  
     
      
    22 His Honour noted a submission made on behalf of the applicant that he gained little from the sale of the drugs. His Honour thought that that observation might have been accurate but concluded that the applicant nevertheless did what he did for financial or material reward. The point was that the applicant was in the business of dealing in drugs and was not, as some persons sometimes are, selling drugs in order to finance their own habit. His Honour noted the variety of drugs the applicant was able to supply.  
     
      
    23 A pre-sentence report was put before his Honour. The author of the report noted the prior custodial history of the applicant and reported him as having performed poorly while supervised. He thought him unsuitable for any further supervision or for any Community Service Order or Order of Periodic Detention.  
     
      
    24 His Honour noted that the offender had been dealt with in the past for 17 offences, four of them concerned with drugs. He had spent two periods of time in gaol, totalling together somewhat less than a year. One of them was for the supply of a prohibited drug early in 2004.  
     
      
    25 His Honour said no more about aggravating features than the passage I have extracted.  
     
      
    26 His Honour rejected the applicant’s claim to be remorseful and regarded the pleas of guilty as an acceptance of the inevitable. He thought the prospects for rehabilitation impossible to assess because of the lack of family support, accommodation and employment. He considered the applicant likely to re-offend in order to derive money to live on. 
     
      
    27 His Honour drew attention to the need for general and personal deterrence.  
     
      
    28 His Honour took as the starting point for the offence of the ongoing supply imprisonment for four years and for the other offences imprisonment for two years. His Honour reduced those periods by 25 percent to take account of the early pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    29 His Honour found no circumstances which were special for the purposes of s44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and expressed the intention by partly accumulating the sentences to impose an overall sentence of four years with a non-parole period of three years. 
     
      
    30 The arguments put on appeal against the finding of aggravation constituted by planning and organisation were as follows. It was submitted first that there was nothing out of the ordinary in the way the applicant went about the business of selling drugs. Selling drugs directly to consumers ordinarily requires some planning and organisation. Suppliers have to be available. Means of communication have to be set up between those suppliers and the seller and between the seller and those who might buy for consumption. It was submitted that some aspect of the applicant’s operation going beyond that normally expected in offences of this kind had to be identified and had not been identified. Even if this aggravating feature were found to apply to one or more of the offences, it did not follow that it should apply to them all. Reference was made to R v Tadrosse, R v Fahs [2007] NSWCCA 26 and R v Elyard (2006) NSWCCA 43. Some expression of reasoning was required to explain why any offence was thereby aggravated. Reference was made to R v Dougan [2006] NSWCCA 34. 
     
      
    31 In R v Hewitt (2007) NSWCCA 353 Hall J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Price J agreed, said at [25] - 
     
      
       
        
        (25) The provisions of s.21A(2)(n) have been the subject of consideration on a number of occasions. The following propositions may be derived from relevant decisions:-  
         
          
           
          (a) The wording of the provision conveys more than simply that the offence was planned:  
          Fahs v Regina 
           [2007] NSWCCA 26 per Howie J at [12] (Simpson and Buddin JJ agreeing). His Honour further observed:- 
           
            
            “… The fact that there was a ‘level of planning in the offences’ as found by the judge does not necessarily give rise to the aggravating factor in s.21A(2)(n). In  
            Wickham 
             [2004] NSWCCA 193, the Court stressed the importance of making findings under s.21A in accordance with the words of the provision ...”  
            
           
           
          (b) In a case where an offender has been charged with multiple drug trafficking offences, a conclusion may be drawn that it is part of a planned or organised criminal activity. In  
          Fahs 
           (supra), Howie J observed:- 
           
            
            “… In this case, it would have been open to the judge to find that such a factor existed in respect of each of the offences because it was clear that the applicant was committing the crimes as part of a drug trafficking organisation capable of supplying large amounts of different types of drugs to order.” 
            
           
           
          (c) The expression “organised criminal activity” may embrace the activities of several people or it may involve activity carried out by one person. In  
          NCR Australia v Credit Connection 
           [2005] NSWSC 1118, Campbell J observed at [72]:- 
           
            
            “In deciding whether the aggravating factor in para (n) is present, there is first a question of construction about what is meant by ‘organised criminal activity’. In one sense, ‘organised criminal activity’ involves the activities of several people that are planned or co-ordinated to carry out the crime. That is the sense involved in media discussion about whether organised crime is on the increase. In another sense, however, it can include activity that is carried out by just one person, concerning which that person engages in planning or preparation.”  
            
           
          
         
        His Honour also observed:-  
         
          
           
            
            “… as a matter of ordinary English, to think that ‘planned criminal activity’ has any necessary element in it of there being more than one person involved … For these reasons, I conclude that the factor in para (n) can be present if there is planned organised criminal activity engaged in by just one person.” (at [74] and [75]). 
            
           
           
          (d) Offences committed over a period of time may involve sufficient repetition and system to lead to the conclusion that they were organised within the meaning of paragraph (n):  
          NCR Australia 
           (supra) at [76]. 
           
           
          (e) In determining whether the facts give rise to “planning” as an aggravating factor, it is necessary to consider and refer to both the evidence that may affirm, and the evidence that may negative the drawing of such a conclusion. This Court in  
          Regina v Reynolds  
          [2004] NSWCCA 51, in determining on the facts of that case that evidence of planning was very limited but that it did exist and was of greater significance than that considered by the sentencing judge, observed at [39]:- 
           
            
            “It may be that, had he considered the evidence in detail, his Honour would nevertheless have reached a factual finding similar to that which he did. The error lies in his failing to make reference to evidence pointing to a contrary conclusion. In particular, the list of businesses was, in my view, quite strong evidence of a degree of planning. The absence of a disguise is only one factor pointing in the other direction, or pointing to poor, rather than no, planning.” 
            
           
           
          (f) Planning that is “…somewhat haphazard, clumsy in many respects and bound to fail…” may nevertheless be sufficient so as to enliven the application of s.21A(2)(n):  
          Regina v Willard  
          [2005] NSWSC 402 per Whealy J at [32]. 
          
         
        
       
      
    32 It may be accepted from those authorities and from what Hulme J said in R v Smiroldo (2000) NSWCCA 120 about the likely attributes of those who offend against s25A, that something over and above the ordinary attributes of a dealer must be identified before a conclusion under para (n) may properly sound in sentence. 
     
      
    33 Returning to the facts of the present case, it seems to me that there were several attributes of the applicant’s operation that might amount to organisation and planning that was somewhat more extensive than that which one would ordinarily expect to find in the operation of a person selling directly to consumers.  
     
      
    34 First, the applicant was not a man dealing at the simple level necessary to fund his own habit, as to which see the remarks of Howie J in R v Fahs at [22].  
     
      
    35 Secondly, there was the variety of drugs he was able to supply, with the implied variety of contacts and sources from which they could be obtained. Mr Gartelmann, for the applicant, submitted that the applicant was not always able to supply that which he said he could supply. That may be true, or it may simply be that he was a liar, as he was over the final deal. However that may be, the fact remains that he was able to supply a range of goods. 
     
      
    36 Thirdly, the events show that the applicant had a rather more extensive organisation than one would ordinarily expect to find. In particular, provision was made for supply while he was absent. There were the means to send and receive text messages by which to divert the enquirer to a deputy supplier. It seems also that there were at least two deputies and a system for bringing them into contact with consumers.  
     
      
    37 Mr Gartelmann pointed to the small quantities of drugs dealt in and the modest amounts of money involved, but to my mind they were precisely the quantities and amounts one would expect to be involved in sales direct to consumers. I do not think that it could be said that a seller direct to consumers was by reason of that fact alone incapable of being categorised as more than usually planned or organised. 
     
      
    38 Then it was submitted that even though the applicant might be found to be planned or organised above the norm for one or more of the offences it did not follow that he was so planned or organised for all of them. There was particular reference to the three sales constituting the offence on the third count.  
     
      
    39 I do not know of any principle by which a Court which concludes that a dealer in drugs is particularly well planned and organised on one occasion cannot use that evidence to imply that he was so planned or organised on another which was close in time and similar in circumstances. The inference seems inescapable. I think that his Honour’s not attributing aggravation to any particular count shows that he drew it. I would reject that submission. 
     
      
    40 My conclusion is that the finding was and is open that the offences, and each of them, were aggravated by the planning and organisation apparent in the applicant’s operation. 
     
      
    41 The second ground of appeal was that the sentences were manifestly excessive, and it is appropriate to consider the submissions made under that ground in answering the question whether any less severe sentence is warranted than that which was imposed by his Honour. It was submitted that the offences contemplated by the first and second counts took place within the period of time spanned by the ongoing supply offence. It was pointed out that the facts relied on to prove the offence of ongoing supply often, if not usually, include more than three individual sales. It would not be unusual or unexpected to find five sales, which is all that took place here, constituting a single offence of ongoing supply. 
     
      
    42 Then it was submitted that all the offences occurred in the context of a relationship established by the undercover police operatives. No particular transaction involved conduct significantly disparate from that involved in the other transactions. The offences thus shared common features, a factor pointing towards concurrency. Reference was made to R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540 in the judgment of Simpson J at [7]-[12]. 
     
      
    43 It was further submitted that the offences the subject of the first and second counts did not involve substantial criminality in addition to that contemplated by the third. The small quantities involved were pointed to. 
     
      
    44 I have taken all these matters into account. The applicant was still a young man, but a man of some experience, having previously served prison terms and having previously dealt in prohibited drugs. He did his business on these occasions for profit. The deterrence of him and others who would act likewise was bound to feature large in the imposition of sentence. There were the aggravating features that I have identified. In my view there is nothing remarkable about an overall sentence of four years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. In my opinion no lesser sentence is warranted in law. 
     
      
    45 I propose that leave to appeal against the sentences be granted but that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    46 HALL J: I agree with Barr J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: This is a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentences imposed on the respondent in the District Court following his conviction of a large number of armed robbery offences.  
     
      
    2 On 4 October 2007, after trial, the respondent was sentenced for 14 offences, which occurred on Christmas Day 2005 (the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences). The overall sentence imposed for these offences was nine years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of five years and six months. The following day the respondent was sentenced by the same Judge for a further series of armed robberies to which he had pleaded guilty in the Local Court. These consisted of five offences of armed robbery under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), one count of aggravated armed robbery involving the use of a firearm under s 97(2), and one count of possession of a prohibited weapon. In relation to these offences, which occurred between 1 January and 15 February 2006 (the January and February offences), the respondent asked the Judge to take into account under s 33 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Sentencing Procedure Act) a further 22 armed robbery offences and one offence of breaking, entering and stealing.  
     
      
    3 The Judge sentenced the respondent to terms of imprisonment in respect of the January and February offences that were subsumed by the sentences for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences. The effective non-parole period was extended by six months and 15 days.  
     
      
       
      The facts - the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences 
       
      
    4 The respondent, in company with at least two other men, entered the Woolwich Pier Hotel in the early hours of 25 December 2005. The manager of the hotel and a number of young employees were inside the premises cleaning up after closing. Each of the robbers was armed: one had a knife, one had an axe and one had a replica pistol. Their faces were covered with balaclavas or similar disguises. One of them forced the manager into the office, pointed a gun against her head and demanded that she open the safe. He threatened to chop her fingers off if she did not comply. At another point in her ordeal he threatened her, saying, “do you want this axe through your forehead?” She was struck to the back of her head and was kicked after she fell to the floor. He stole $24,179.90 from the safe. In the meantime the other robbers took charge of the staff, directing them to lie on the floor and demanding that they hand over items of personal property. The demands were accompanied by threats of violence. Personal property was stolen from several of the staff.  
     
      
    5 It is not known which of the three robbers assaulted the manager. The respondent was convicted of this and the other offences on the basis of his participation in the joint criminal enterprise.  
     
      
    6 Count 1 charged the respondent with the robbery of the manager. Counts 2, 3, 4, 7, 9 and 10 charged the armed robbery of each of the staff members who had handed over personal property to the robbers. Counts 5, 6, 8, 11, 12 and 13 charged the armed assault with intent to rob of the members of staff whose property had not been taken. Count 14 charged the theft of the motor vehicle that was used by the robbers to flee from the scene. The offences in counts 1 – 13 were contrary to s 97(1). Each carried a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. The offence in count 14 was contrary to s 154A(1)(b) and carried a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    7 The Judge found that the offences were objectively serious. He commented on the following features in this respect: they were committed in company; they involved the use of a number of weapons; the victims had been threatened and were vulnerable because they were working late at night and the offence was planned, involving the use of a stolen vehicle, weapons and disguises.  
     
      
    8 The Judge imposed concurrent sentences in relation to each armed robbery, specifying that the non-parole period (five years and six months) was to date from 1 June 2006 and to expire on 30 November 2011. The balance of term (three years and six months) will expire on 31 May 2015. On each of the counts of assault with intent to rob while armed the respondent was sentenced to a sentence which was wholly concurrent with the sentences imposed for the armed robbery offences and comprised a non-parole period of five years and six months and a balance of term of two and a half years. A fixed term sentence of four years’ imprisonment was imposed for the larceny of the motor vehicle. This sentence, too, was wholly concurrent with the sentences imposed on counts one to 13.  
     
      
      The sentencing of the co-offenders for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences 
       
      
    9 The Judge sentenced a co-offender, Christopher Carr, for his role in the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences. Christopher Carr pleaded guilty to two counts of armed robbery (including the armed robbery of the manager) and to two counts of armed assault with intent to rob arising out of the incident. Ten related offences were taken into account on a Form 1. The sentences were discounted to reflect the utilitarian value of Carr’s plea of guilty. Christopher Carr was sentenced to a non-parole period of four and a half years for the armed robbery of the manager, with a balance of term of three years. The ten Form 1 offences were taken into account in sentencing him for this offence. He was sentenced for the second armed robbery count to a non-parole period of four and a half years with a balance of term of two years and three months. This sentence was wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed on the first count. For the remaining two counts of assault with intent to rob, Christopher Carr was sentenced to concurrent sentences that were subsumed by the sentence imposed on count one.  
     
      
    10 On 13 December 2007 the Judge sentenced John Carr for his role in the Woolwich Pier Hotel armed robberies. John Carr had been jointly arraigned with the respondent on the indictment containing the 14 counts. On the fourth day of the trial he pleaded guilty to each of the counts. He asked the Judge to take into account matters on a Form 1 in sentencing him for the offence involving the robbery of the manager. He was sentenced for this offence to a non-parole period of five years, with a balance of term of three years. In relation to count 2, a further armed robbery offence, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of five years, with a balance of term of two and a half years. This sentence and all the remaining sentences (which were of the same length or less than the sentence for the offence in count 2) were wholly concurrent with the sentence imposed on count 1. 
     
      
    11 There was no distinction between the culpability of the three offenders in relation to the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences. There was no relevant distinction between the three, having regard to their age or history.  
     
      
    12 The Crown has not appealed against the inadequacy of the sentences imposed on Christopher Carr or John Carr.  
     
      
       
      The January and February offences 
       
      
    13 The January and February armed robbery offences (including those specified in the three Form 1 schedules) all followed a similar pattern. The respondent entered shop premises and threatened a member of staff with a knife (in one case a screwdriver), demanding that the cash from the cash register be handed to him. In some instances he took property belonging to the shop assistant in addition to the cash in the till. On more than one occasion the shop assistant was taken at knifepoint to a storeroom and made to hand over the contents of his or her bag.  
     
      
    14 On those occasions when the respondent stole personal property belonging to the shop assistant he was charged with separate offences under s 97(1) in respect of the property belonging to the business and the property belonging to the assistant. In the period between 1 January 2006 and the date of his arrest, on 15 February 2006, the respondent committed 26 armed robbery offences under s 97(1) and one aggravated offence under s 97(2), which involved the use of a pistol. The 27 offences related to 17 separate events.  
     
      
    15 The majority of the armed robbery offences committed over this period were taken into account on a Form 1 under s 33 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. There were three Form 1 documents. The first, dated 4 October 2007, specified eight armed robberies that were committed between 1 and 9 January 2006 (the first Form 1). The second specified eight armed robbery offences that were committed between 4 and 11 February 2006 (the second Form 1). The third specified six armed robberies which were committed between 17 January and 4 February 2006 and one break, enter and steal offence, which occurred in July 2005 (the third Form 1).  
     
      
    16 The first offence was the armed robbery of David Warat, at the Regent Hotel, Kingsford, on 1 January 2006. The respondent approached Mr Warat, who was working behind the counter in the bottle shop, and threatened him with a knife, demanding that he open the cash register and give him the contents. During the course of the robbery Mr Warat was required to lie on the floor. The respondent removed the cash from the till and took Mr Warat’s iPod, which was lying next to it. The Judge was asked to take the first Form 1 into account in sentencing for this offence. He sentenced the respondent to a non-parole period of four years to date from 31 January 2008 and to expire on 30 January 2012. The balance of the term was two years, which will expire on 30 January 2014.  
     
      
    17 The second offence was the further armed robbery of Mr Warat at the Kingsford Hotel, which was committed on 17 January 2006. The respondent again approached Mr Warat at the counter of the bottle shop, and produced a knife, saying, “I’m back again. Open the till”. Mr Warat did as he was instructed. The respondent removed $250 in cash from the till and demanded that Mr Warat hand over his wallet, which he did. The robbery of the wallet was separately charged and was taken into account on the third Form 1. The Judge sentenced the respondent to a non-parole period of four years, which will date from 31 January 2008, with a balance of term of two years to expire on 30 January 2014.  
     
      
    18 The third offence was the armed robbery of Maria Ferrer, at the Best Cellars Liquor Store, Darlinghurst, which was committed on 15 February 2006. The respondent entered the liquor store and produced a small silver coloured handgun, directing Ms Ferrer to “give me all you’ve got”. He took $241 from the till and ran from the store. Minutes later he was arrested and the police located a silver coloured firearm in the course of searching his motor vehicle. This was an aggravated offence charged under s 97(2) and carried a maximum penalty of 25 years’ imprisonment. The respondent asked the Judge to take into account the second Form 1 in sentencing him for this offence. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years and four months to date from 15 February 2008 and to expire on 14 June 2012. The total term of the sentence was six years and six months, which will expire on 14 August 2014.  
     
      
    19 The fourth offence was the possession of a prohibited firearm (the firearm located at the time of his arrest on 15 February 2006), under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. This offence has a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment. The Judge sentenced the respondent to a non-parole period of three years to date from 15 February 2008 and to expire on 14 February 2011. The balance of term is 18 months and will expire on 14 August 2012.  
     
      
    20 The fifth offence was the armed robbery of Subhash Gupta at Anita’s Newsagency in Surry Hills, which was committed on 10 January 2006. The respondent came behind the counter of the newsagency and took hold of Mr Gupta. He produced a knife and said “get down, get down. Open the till”. Mr Gupta opened the till and the respondent took an amount of cash between $600 and $700. He then ran out of the store. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years to date from 31 January 2008 with a balance of term of two years and three months, which will expire on 30 April 2013.  
     
      
    21 The sixth offence was the armed robbery of Geoff Schmaman, an assistant working at the Godfreys vacuum cleaner store, Bondi Junction. This offence occurred on 8 January 2006. The offender approached Mr Schmaman and produced a knife, which he pressed against Mr Schmaman’s abdomen. He instructed him to open the till. He then directed Mr Schmaman to lie down, which he did. The respondent took the cash from the till and ran from the shop. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of three years to date from 31 January 2008, with a balance of term of two years and three months, which will expire on 30 April 2013.  
     
      
    22 The seventh offence was the armed robbery of Robert Said, who was working at the Uber Stone Clothing store, Paddington. The respondent approached Mr Said, who was standing behind the counter and produced a knife, which he pointed towards Mr Said’s stomach. He instructed him to open the till, which he did. The respondent removed about $280. He asked Mr Said for his wallet. Mr Said said he did not have any money in his wallet. The respondent walked Mr Said at knifepoint into the storeroom in order to retrieve the wallet. He removed $60 in cash from it and then left the store. The latter offence was separately charged and was recorded on the third Form 1, which was taken into account in sentencing him for this offence. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of four years to date from 31 January 2008 with a balance of term of two years, which will expire on 30 January 2014.  
     
      
    23 The respondent was apprehended on 15 February 2006 and he was refused bail. His parole was revoked and he served the balance of parole until 1 June 2006, which was the date on which the sentences for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences were fixed to commence.  
     
      
       
      The structure of the sentences 
       
      
    24 It will be noted that the sentences for the January and February offences are structured such that for offences one, two, five, six and seven the sentences were fixed to commence on 31 January 2008 and were thus partially accumulated on the sentences imposed for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences. The sentences for the two offences committed on 15 February 2006, which was the date of the respondent’s arrest, were fixed to commence from that date. They were, thus, accumulated on the sentences imposed for the other offences by 15 days. The reason for this very modest degree of accumulation is not entirely clear.  
     
      
    25 The Judge allowed a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of the pleas of guilty in each case. 26 The Judge said of the structure of the sentences for the January and February offences: 
     
      
       
        
        “I proposed to date the sentence from 31 January 2008. A sentence from 31 January 2008 was proposed because of the number of offences which occurred in January, and I considered it appropriate even though the commencement date was in the future but well within the period of imprisonment for which the prisoner has been sentenced on 4 October of this year, because that date reflects – that is, 31 January 2008, or at least 31 January – reflects the fact that a number of offences were committed in January.” (ROS 05/10/07 2-3) 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        … 
         
        
       
       
        
        So as we be clear in relation to this, the actual period of the sentence yesterday, that is, following the jury verdict, was for the period from 1 June 06 to 31 May 2015. I had set a non-parole period in relation to those offences of five and a half years, which would have brought it up – that is, the non-parole period – to 30 November 2011. The sentences which I have imposed on these charges, it is correct, have to take into account the plea of guilty. And as I have stated, I consider that so far as the plea of guilty, considering the criminality involved, but requiring that there be additional punishment for those offences, that it is more appropriate to, if you like, add on the non-parole period. In effect, the non-parole period would expire on 14 June 2012. And that is a date which, Madam Crown, I have selected, in particular, having regard to the fact that there would still be a requirement, I consider, that he acquire some skills in his fortieth year, to live independently. In effect, he would still be on parole from 15 June 2012 up until 31 May 2015. And for the reasons which I stated in the sentence yesterday, I consider that it is appropriate that there be some time allowed for him to acquire some skills to live independently.” (ROS 05/10/07 13-14) 
        
       
       
      The respondent’s subjective case 
       
      
    27 The respondent was aged 32 at the date of sentence. He had a lengthy criminal record dating back to when he was aged 16 years. He had been fined for offences including resisting arrest and assaulting police. Thereafter he had been dealt with in the Children’s Court for offences ranging from breaking, entering and stealing, stealing motor vehicle and a variety of driving offences. As an adult he had been convicted of breaking, entering and stealing and sentenced to perform 200 hours’ community service. On a subsequent occasion he was sentenced to imprisonment for the offence of breaking, entering and stealing. In December 2000 he was convicted of aggravated robbery and breaking and entering with intent to steal and sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for five years, with a non-parole period of three years. In October 2005 he was sentenced by the Local Court for offences, including the possession of prohibited drugs and shoplifting, to seven months’ imprisonment, commencing on 15 September 2005, with a non-parole period of three months to expire on 14 December 2005. He had been at liberty on parole for less than a fortnight at the date of the commission of the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences.  
     
      
    28 The respondent had an unfortunate childhood. He never knew his father. He was principally raised by his grandparents. He described to the probation officer a childhood characterised by physical and emotional abuse. He had left home at the age of 13 years. At around this time he commenced abusing alcohol and not long after this he moved to the abuse of heroin, cannabis and other drugs. He had never been in paid employment. His Honour observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has lived on social welfare benefits and the proceeds of crime which he says has been necessary for the purpose of fuelling his drug habit. He has, then, from the age of thirteen, received no guidance other than from institutions, or prison authorities, whilst he has been serving various sentences.” (ROS 04/10/07 6.5) 
        
       
       
      The Crown appeal 
       
      
    29 The Crown appeals against each sentence imposed for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences and each sentence imposed for the January and February offences as manifestly inadequate. The Crown submitted that the sentencing for both sets of offences was attended by patent error and that the structure of the sentences produced an effective sentence that was an inadequate reflection of the respondent’s criminality.  
     
      
    30 The Crown asserted that it was an error to make each of the sentences for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences concurrent. In the result, it was said, no greater punishment was imposed upon the respondent for the armed robbery of 14 people than for the armed robbery of one. The second asserted error was the Judge’s failure to differentiate between the armed robbery offences, the robbery of the manager being more objectively serious because of the extent of the violence and the amount stolen. It was submitted that the Judge failed to apply the principles explained in Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. 31 Mr Ramage QC, who appeared for the respondent, submitted that the sentences for the Woolwich Pier hotel offences were “unusually harsh and severe”. This submission drew on the pattern of sentencing for cases in the category to which the Henry guideline judgment applies. He also pointed to the sentence of four years for the car stealing offence. The maximum penalty for this offence is five years. The Crown conceded that a fixed term of four years for the theft of a motor vehicle may appear harsh, but it was submitted that in the context of this sentencing exercise it remained unduly lenient because the structure of the sentences was such that the respondent had received no additional punishment for the offence.  
     
      
    32 The respondent did not appeal against the severity of any of the sentences imposed for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences. 33 I will return to a discussion of the Henry guideline judgment in dealing with the January and February offences. For the present, it is sufficient to observe that the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences fell well outside the category of case to which the Henry guideline applies. The submission that the sentences for the armed robbery offences were unusually harsh and severe is unsustainable. Each was an offence committed by offenders acting in company, wearing disguises, armed with an array of weapons carrying out the planned robbery of commercial premises. The robbery of the manager involved a considerable degree of violence.  
     
      
    34 The Woolwich Pier Hotel offences formed part of one episode of criminal offending. In cases involving multiple victims it will often be appropriate to provide some measure of accumulation in sentence, but this is not an invariable rule. The question is whether the sentence for one offence adequately reflects the criminality involved in the commission of the other offences: Mill v R (1988) 166 CLR 59; Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1; 168 A Crim R 41. The High Court has emphasised on more than one occasion the flexibility which is to be allowed to sentencing judges: Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 per Gummow, Callinan and Heydon JJ at 624, [26]; Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Callinan JJ at 1055, [27]. In my opinion, the sentence of nine years which was imposed for the offence charged in count 1 is capable of adequately reflecting the criminality involved in the series of offences that were committed by the respondent in the course of this episode. It was not an error of principle to determine that the remaining sentences would be served concurrently. It is to be noted that no Crown appeal has been brought against the sentences imposed on Christopher and John Carr. The sentences imposed on John Carr, after allowance for the discount reflecting his late plea, were comparable to those imposed upon the respondent.  
     
      
    35 The central issue raised by the Crown’s appeal was his Honour’s approach to the sentencing of the respondent for the January and February offences. The Crown challenged the structure of the sentences and asserted that his Honour erred in two respects and that these errors led to sentences that were inadequate. The first claimed error was the discount of 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty. The vice in this, it was said, was that it overlooked that the Henry guideline assumes a discount of 10 per cent for a late plea of guilty. Mr Ramage QC complained that the Crown had taken a different position at the sentencing hearing, on which occasion the Crown Prosecutor acknowledged that a discount at the top of the range was appropriate. (T’cpt 14/09/07 18.34) At the sentencing hearing the Crown Prosecutor drew to the Judge’s attention the fact that the range promulgated in the Henry guideline assumed a discount of 10 per cent to reflect a late plea of guilty. (T’cpt 14/09/07 18.40) There is no inconsistency in the approach taken by the Crown.  
     
      
    36 To the extent that a sentencing judge applies the Henry guideline in dealing with an offender for a s 97(1) offence, it is necessary to take into account the fact that the range includes a 10 per cent discount for a late plea of guilty. It follows that, in the application of the guideline, no more than 15 per cent ought be allowed on account of a plea of guilty entered at the first opportunity: R v Collins [2005] NSWCCA 198, [16]; R v Thomas [2007] NSWCCA 269 per Basten JA at [26] and Rothman J at [96]. This is not to say that the Judge necessarily erred in discounting the sentences by 25 per cent. This is because the range promulgated in the Henry guideline was not appropriate in sentencing this offender for multiple armed robbery offences that were committed while he was on parole, he having previously been convicted of serious offences, including aggravated armed robbery.  
     
      
    37 In a case in which the judge determines that the circumstances of a s 97(1) offence, or of the offender, or both, require the imposition of a sentence exceeding the range promulgated in the Henry guideline it is open to him or her to allow a discount of 25 per cent to reflect the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty entered at the first opportunity. What is required is that the sentence bear an appropriate relationship to the Henry guideline in the sense that the increment is a proper reflection of the extent to which the offence is more aggravated than the category of case to which the guideline is directed. 38 The second error of which the Crown complained was the asserted failure to take into account the Form 1 offences consistently with the principles explained in Attorney General’s Application under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 per Spigelman CJ at [40]-[42]. The Crown illustrated this by pointing to the fact that the same sentence was imposed in respect of the first and second offences, each of which was committed against Mr Warat at the Kingsford Hotel in similar circumstances. However, in respect of the first offence, the Judge was required to take into account eight additional armed robbery offences detailed in the first Form 1.  
     
      
    39 The Judge explained that he was imposing the same sentence in relation to the second offence because the respondent had targeted the bottle shop as an easy mark, and Mr Warat was vulnerable. Each of the shop assistants was vulnerable in the way that Mr Warat was vulnerable. As I understand his Honour’s reasons, it was that targeting Mr Warat on the second occasion made this offence more deserving of punishment than the similar offences because of the likely impact on Mr Warat of being held-up on two occasions over a short interval. The sentences imposed for each of the offences in which his Honour was asked to take into account offences on a Form 1 were higher than the sentences imposed for offences five and six. I do not accept that the Judge overlooked the fact that it was necessary to take into account the Form 1 offences. It remains that the sentences imposed for each of the armed robberies involved a very modest increment on the guideline range, which given the respondent’s age, history and that he was on parole at the date of their commission exhibited marked leniency. Nonetheless, I do not hold that the individual sentences are manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    40 The strength of the Crown’s challenge to the sentences imposed for the January and February offences is to their structure.  
     
      
    41 Mr Ramage submitted that it was open to the Judge to view the entire episode from Christmas Day 2005 to 15 February 2006 as a single episode of offending and, having regard to the principle of totality, to determine that the sentences for the later offences should be subsumed in the sentence for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences, subject to the modest increase in the non-parole period.  
     
      
    42 The effect of the Judge’s sentencing order was that the sentences for the January and February offences were subsumed in the sentences for the Woolwich Pier Hotel offences. This was a clear error. The January and February offences were discrete, serious offences which involved a number of victims. It was necessary that the sentences be accumulated in some measure in order to ensure that the respondent is punished for them. The principle of totality required that the extent of accumulation of be telescoped such that the overall sentence is just and appropriate: Postiglione v R (1997) 189 CLR 295 per McHugh J at 307-308. However, considerations of totality did not justify this sentencing order.43 The principles that the Court applies in the determination of appeals brought by the Crown are collected by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70]. It is not necessary to restate them. The structure of the sentences imposed for the January and February offences produces a result that is so plainly unjust that it is necessary for the Court to intervene to redress it. Because this is an appeal by the Crown it is appropriate to exhibit restraint in re-structuring the sentences so as to produce an aggregate sentence that is at the lower end of the range.  
     
      
    44 I propose to structure the sentences such that the effective aggregate sentence will be one of 11 ½ years. To the extent that the Judge found special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act in relation to individual sentences, this was not the subject of challenge on the appeal. Taking into account the effect of the accumulation that I propose, it is necessary to reduce the non-parole period for the aggravated armed robbery offence. This will result in an effective non-parole period of eight and a half years, which is slightly below 75 per cent of the aggregate sentence. A non-parole period of three years is appropriate in order to give effect to the sentencing judge’s intention that the respondent have the benefit of a lengthy period of supervision on parole. For these reasons the orders that I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ORDERS 
        
       
       
        
        1. Allow the appeal, confirm the sentences imposed in the District Court on 4 October 2007 in respect of the 14 convictions for the offences charged in the indictment presented on 30 April 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Vary the orders made by the District Court on 5 October 2007 with respect to the commencement dates of each of the sentences and in relation to the third offence with respect to the proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of the term as follows:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Offence 1 - armed robbery – 1 January 2006 (taking into account the eight offences on the first Form 1) – the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of four years to commence on 1 June 2008. The non-parole period will expire on 31 May 2012. The balance of the sentence is two years and will expire on 31 May 2014; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Offence 2 - armed robbery – committed 17 January 2006 – the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of four years to date from 30 November 2008. The non-parole period will expire on 29 November 2012. The balance of the sentence is two years and will expire on 29 November 2014.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Offence 5 – armed robbery – committed 10 January 2006 – the respondent is sentenced to a three year non-parole period to date from 30 November 2009. The non-parole period will expire on 29 November 2012. The balance of the sentence is two years and three months and will expire on 28 February 2015.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Offence 6 – armed robbery – committed 8 January 2006 – the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years to date from 30 November 2009. The non-parole period will expire on 29 November 2012. The balance of the sentence is two years and three months and will expire on 28 February 2015.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Offence 7 – armed robbery – committed 4 February 2006 (taking into account the seven offences on the third Form 1) the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of four years to date from 1 June 2010. The non-parole period will expire on 31 May 2014. The balance of the sentence is two years and will expire on 31 May 2016.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Count 4 – possession of prohibited firearm – the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years to date from 1 June 2011. The non-parole period will expire on 31 May 2014. The balance of the sentence is one year and six months and will expire on 30 November 2015.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Offence 3 – aggravated armed robbery – committed 15 February 2008 (taking into account the eight offences on the second Form 1) the respondent is sentenced to a non-parole period of three years and six months to date from 1 June 2011. The non-parole period will expire on 30 November 2014. The balance of the sentence is three years and will expire on 30 November 2017.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 The plaintiff is a single man, born in December 1980. At approximately 10.15 am on 19 January 2002 he was riding a motorcycle north along the Putty Road near Oakey Creek when he lost control of the motorcycle, resulting in him being thrown off and striking an Armco railing. He was then struck by the motorcycle as it slid across the road into the railing. He sustained severe injuries in the accident. 
     
      
    2 The plaintiff has brought these proceedings seeking damages for his injuries from the first defendant, who was the driver of an automatic Commodore station wagon travelling north on the Putty Road, and from the second defendant, the road authority which had the care, control and maintenance of the road. It is alleged each defendant was guilty of negligence which caused the plaintiff’s injuries. 
     
      
    3 In essence, the plaintiff’s case against the first defendant is that the plaintiff was overtaking the first defendant’s car in an overtaking zone when the car increased speed causing the plaintiff to remain on the incorrect side of the road beyond the end of the overtaking zone. This left the plaintiff with inadequate time and distance to return to the correct side of the road and prepare to safely take an approaching bend, with the result he lost control of the motorcycle. 
     
      
    4 The plaintiff’s case against the second defendant is essentially that the second defendant had failed to comply with Australian Standard AS 1742.2-1994 and its own guidelines, had provided an overtaking zone in a location where it was unsafe and had failed to provide adequate warning signs. 
     
      
    5 The defendants have denied liability to the plaintiff and, in the alternative, have alleged the plaintiff’s injuries were the result of his contributory negligence. 
     
      
    6 Damages have been agreed by the parties in the event the plaintiff is successful in his claim, save for funds management which is to be calculated by the parties in the event the plaintiff receives a verdict. The agreement as to damages was considered by Harrison J who concluded the sum agreed was appropriate and one which he would approve. 
     
      
    7 The second defendant has cross claimed against the first defendant seeking indemnity or contribution from him pursuant to s 5(1)(c) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946. The first defendant has not filed a cross claim against the second defendant but relies upon the comments of Handley JA in HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd v Pluim Constructions Pty Ltd [2000] NSWCA 281; (2000) 11 ANZ Ins Cas 61-477 at [82] that the absence of formal claims for contribution does not prevent the court from making appropriate orders. 
     
      
    8 The original statement of claim was filed on 15 July 2002. The first defendant was the only defendant named therein. The second defendant was joined by an amended statement of claim filed on 19 May 2003. It was agreed by the parties that the liability provisions of the Civil Liability Act 2002 were applicable to the claim against the second defendant though not applicable to the claim against the first defendant. 
     
      
       
      Factual findings 
       
      
    9 The following facts, which, together with the background facts in the introduction, I accept, were either common ground or not the subject of significant dispute. 
     
      
       
      General 
       
      
    10 The plaintiff, his cousin, Aaron Burgess (born 1978), and two friends of Mr Burgess, John and David Clarke, had agreed to go for a ride to Broke and Wollombi. Mr Burgess and John Clarke were very experienced motorcyclists. David Clarke less so. The group set out from Castle Hill that morning. At that stage each was riding his own motorcycle. The plaintiff was riding his Honda CBR 250 and Mr Burgess was riding his Honda CBR 600. The CBR 600 motorcycle had an “incredibly loud” exhaust system. Its engine was twice as big as the CBR250 and it weighed 20 kilograms more. Its top speed was 280-odd km/h. It was very responsive, with a quick acceleration. The route taken was via Colo and the Putty Road. David Clarke rode ahead of the others, meeting up with them at agreed stopping points. 
     
      
    11 The last stopping point before the accident was a service station on the Putty Road known as the Half Way House. It was approximately 13 kms from the accident scene. The plaintiff and Mr Burgess swapped motorcycles at the Half Way House. Thereafter the plaintiff rode Mr Burgess’ motorcycle until the accident and Mr Burgess rode the plaintiff’s motorcycle. 
     
      
    12 The first defendant was born in 1934 in The Netherlands. He settled in Australia in 1958. He had held a driver’s licence in The Netherlands and obtained a licence in Australia in August 1962. He was an experienced driver and had driven the Putty Road on occasions prior to the accident. At the relevant time he was driving from his home to Tamworth. His wife was a front seat passenger in the car. There was no collision between his car and the plaintiff, the motorcycle ridden by the plaintiff or any other object.  
     
      
       
      The plaintiff’s qualifications and experience as a rider 
       
      
    13 Records kept by the second defendant reveal that: 
     
      
       
      (a) A learner’s licence to drive cars was issued to the plaintiff on four occasions between 1997 and 2001. There was no record he obtained a driver’s licence at any stage. 
       
       
      (b) On 18 May 2001 a learner’s licence to ride a motorcycle was issued to the plaintiff. 
       
       
      (c) On 18 May 2001 the plaintiff acquired his CBR 250 motorcycle. 
       
       
      (d) On 15 June 2001 the plaintiff incurred a traffic infringement fine for negligent driving, which was paid. 
       
       
      (e) On 10 November 2001 a provisional licence to ride a motorcycle was issued to the plaintiff. 
       
      
    14 The provisional licence issued to the plaintiff was subject, relevantly, to the following conditions: 
     
      
       
      (a) The motorcycle must have a red P plate on the back clearly visible. 
       
       
      (b) A maximum speed limit of 90 km/h must be observed. 
       
       
      (c) The motorcycle’s engine capacity must not be more than 260 ml and must have a power to weight ratio of no more than 150 kilowatts per tonne. The CBR 250 did not exceed those limitations. The CBR 600 did. 
       
      
    15 The plaintiff did not display a P plate on either of the motorcycles he rode on the day of the accident. 
     
      
    16 The plaintiff was a relatively inexperienced rider. He had “had nothing to do” with motorcycles whilst growing up. He had ridden his motorcycle to Port Macquarie from Sydney in December 2001 and had ridden it in Sydney. He had had an accident when he slid off the road whilst riding the motorcycle, probably in June 2001. 
     
      
    17 There was no evidence that the plaintiff had any experience of riding a motorcycle more powerful than 250 cc apart from riding Mr Burgess’ motorcycle. His experience of riding Mr Burgess’ motorcycle prior to the day of the accident was limited to riding it for about twenty minutes at low speed in the street and in the carpark of an apartment building. This occurred about a week after Mr Burgess purchased his motorcycle. 
     
      
       
      The location 
       
      
    18 The Putty Road runs generally north-south from Windsor to Singleton. In the section of road between the Half Way House and the accident scene the road is winding and there are a number of steep climbs and descents. There are overtaking zones varying in length from 200 to 800 metres. The adjoining land is generally forest or pastures. 
     
      
    19 The section of the road with which this case is primarily concerned is divided by painted centrelines into a southbound and a northbound lane. The road has a sealed bitumen surface. The lanes are approximately 3.3 metres wide from the centre line to the edge line marking with variable gravel and bitumen shoulders. 
     
      
    20 The relevant section commences at a crest and then descends to Oakey Creek where it describes a right hand bend for vehicles proceeding north. Thereafter the road continues on to the Howes Valley where roadwork was being performed at the time of the accident.  
     
      
    21 The relevant section of the road had been the subject of road works which were completed in July 2001 when a single span bridge at Oakey Creek was replaced by a three cell box culvert structure and the approaches thereto were reconstructed with improvements to the vertical and horizontal alignments and width. Photographs were tendered, taken in about 1999, which showed that before the reconstruction the creek was crossed by a wooden bridge, there was no foliage of note and that northbound there was a broken centreline leading right up to the bridge. 
     
      
    22 Points of reference on that section of the road on the day of the accident and their approximate distance from the crash site were as follows: 820 metres - the crest - traffic lanes divided by an unbroken barrier line for vehicles heading north, then an information board advising bridge construction ahead; at 580 metres - 95 km/h advisory speed sign on western side of road which was followed by a right hand curve; then a “Roadworks Ahead” sign; at 420 metres - broken centre line for northbound traffic commences; then a “Reduce Speed” sign on western side of road; at 230 metres - reverse curve warning sign with 55 km/h advisory speed plate underneath; at 215 metres - southern end of new approaches to Oakey Creek culvert; at 170 metres - recommencement of unbroken barrier line for northbound traffic; at 160 metres - commencement of southern end of Armco fence (guardrail); at 104 metres - northbound Oakey Creek sign; at 95 metres - commencement of bend; at 68 metres - southbound Oakey Creek sign; then the apex of bend. 
     
      
    23 The critical speed (ie the threshold speed at which a curved path can be negotiated in a motor vehicle) for the right hand bend for northbound vehicles as at the date of the accident was 100 km/h. The bend was signposted at 55 km/h by the advisory speed sign.  
     
      
    24 The speed limit was 100 km/h. The weather was fine and sunny and the road dry at the time of the accident. 
     
      
    25 At all relevant times there was no traffic travelling south on that section of the road and the only vehicles travelling north were those of the plaintiff, Messrs Burgess and John Clarke, and the first defendant. The fourth rider in the group, David Clarke, had left the Half Way House before the other riders and was out of sight at the time of the accident. 
     
      
       
      Disputed facts 
       
      
    26 Save as above found, there was conflict in the evidence as to most relevant events. Apart from the plaintiff, who was unable to give evidence due to the consequences of his injuries, there were allegedly four witnesses to the accident, Mr Burgess and Mr John Clarke, who were called to give evidence on behalf of the plaintiff, and the first defendant and his wife. The evidence of the lay witnesses was complemented by the evidence of a number of expert engineers. The experts were Mr Stuart Smith (plaintiff), Mr McDonald (plaintiff), Mr Hall (first defendant) and Mr Fishburn (second defendant) Although there was much expert evidence, the crucial question was “what happened?” and that largely was a matter to be determined by weighing the evidence of the lay witnesses. Senior counsel for the plaintiff asserted in his address “This is a lay witness case”. 
     
      
    27 The essence of the evidence of each of the lay witnesses and my impressions of the witnesses may be shortly summarised as follows. 
     
      
       
      Aaron Burgess 
       
      
    28 Mr Burgess gave evidence he had not ridden with the plaintiff prior to the day of the accident. He said that after leaving the Half Way House “Daniel was riding very, very conservatively. Very, very within the law and very, very competently.” He also said he “wasn’t exceeding the speed limit, he was travelling along at probably 80-90 km/h for most of the trip.” He said he had his eye on the plaintiff “like a hawk”. He first saw the car when it was on top of the crest. The car was travelling at a speed of between 60 and 70 km/h and the plaintiff would have been half way up the hill approaching the crest. Mr Burgess was 50-60 metres behind the plaintiff. Mr John Clarke was a fair way behind him, more than 150-200 metres. As the plaintiff crested the hill, the car would have, at the most, been probably 20 metres ahead of the plaintiff as the plaintiff was approaching it quite quickly. The plaintiff was on the first defendant’s bumper bar and pulled out the moment that he had an opportunity to overtake which was when the broken lines started. As the plaintiff overtook the car, both vehicles increased speed down the hill. As they headed down the hill, the plaintiff was riding at 80-90 km/h. He increased his speed. The car accelerated. It had been going at a slow speed and its speed increased dramatically as it went down the hill. They continued to be alongside each other to the very bottom of the hill. They were both travelling at 110 km/h at the bottom of the hill. The motorcycle at all times until it lost control remained in the southbound lane. At a point where its rear wheel was in line with the driver, the motorcycle appeared to increase speed slightly, then the brakes were applied very heavily at the Oakey Creek sign on the western side of the road. The first defendant’s brake lights came on roughly where that sign was. Immediately after the plaintiff applied the brakes, fishtailing occurred. He high-sided at the second Oakey Creek sign. The plaintiff was thrown forward. He and the motorcycle slid in front of the car. The plaintiff slammed into the Armco railing and the motorcycle followed, striking the rail and the plaintiff simultaneously before bouncing back onto the road. Mr Burgess was probably 150 metres behind the plaintiff on impact. He pulled up at the scene. He did not agree he pulled up after the first defendant was out of the car. He said the first defendant pulled up about 80 metres north. “He barely got out of the car, did yell something, then jumped back into the car and sped off.” Mr Clarke joined him some one minute after (later revised to 15-20 seconds in cross examination), just as the car drove off. Shortly after the accident a four wheel drive vehicle stopped. The driver had not seen the accident. Mr Burgess asked him to get an ambulance and call the police in regards to the purple Commodore. The driver of the four wheel drive vehicle contacted someone on his two-way radio. 
     
      
    29 Mr Burgess gave a number of statements in respect of the accident. 
     
      
    30 The first of these was a statement which he gave to the police at the scene of the accident. The unsigned statement is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was riding north on the Putty Road with Daniel and John. We were doing about 80 to 90 Kph, Daniel was in front of me about 50 to 60 metres. 
        
       
       
        
        He came up behind a VS purple coloured Commodore wagon, he started to overtake it, as they were going down the hill the car seemed to speed up and they were side by side for sometime. He tried to get in before the broken line finished. Then he got out of control at the bottom of the dip, the bike fishtailed, went down and then the bike slid into the Armco railing. Daniel was sliding beside the bike and then Daniel hit the Armco. The guy in the Commodore said, ‘He’ll get help’.” 
        
       
      
    31 In a statement dated 10 February 2002 he said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “At 10:30 we left the half way house Daniel riding ahead, followed by myself about 50 - 60 metres behind. We were riding at approximately 80 - 90 km/h, we approached a main straight section in which the road was clear with the exception of one vehicle. The vehicle in front (Purple Commodore Wagon) was travelling at approximately 50-60Km/h. 
        
       
       
        
        Daniel crested a hill and at that time the Commodore was about 20 meters ahead and still maintaining his original speed. As I was about 70 meters behind I was to far back to over take and decided I would wait until the next clear section. Daniel indicated and proceeded to overtake the Commodore, at the same time the Commodore also started to accelerate quiet rapidly. 
        
       
       
        
        Daniels speed increased and at the same time the Commodores speed increased. It looked from where I was like the Commodore was holding Daniel out on the opposite side of the road. Due to the Commodore accelerating Daniel was forced to accelerate faster to get in front of him and get back into the left lane. At this stage the broken lines had ended and the Commodore was tail gating Daniel, both Daniel and the Commodore were travelling at about 110Km/h into a 60Km/h corner. 
        
       
       
        
        The Commodore then rapidly applied the brakes as he was very close to Daniel and there was a corner approaching. Daniel hit the brakes very late, the Commodore at this stage was no more than 3 meters behind Daniel. 
        
       
       
        
        The rear of the bike then lost traction and the rear of the bike swerved left, then right, then left, as it swerved to the right for the second time it threw Daniel forward. I actually thought that the Commodore had grazed Daniel as he lost control of the bike. Daniel then hit the metal railing closely followed by the Bike, which then bounced onto the road. 
        
       
       
        
        The Purple commodore pulled up and a man got out of the vehicle, he looked at me and another bike rider who was with me at the time. He then got back into his vehicle and drove away, we then told a man in a (snowy mountain hydro electric 4X4) to get an ambulance and ring the police about the purple Commodore.” 
        
       
      
    32 Mr Burgess also gave a statement to an insurance investigator dated 23 May 2002. In this statement he said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “We were riding at a speed of about 100kph, and we came up onto the Holden Commodore Wagon that was later involved in this accident, pretty quickly. It was purple in colour. Daniel was still in front of me, and John was behind me. Daniel was fifty metres at the most in front of me and John was about twenty metres or so behind me. We were riding up a slight incline and when I first saw the Commodore it was still going up the hill, but near the crest. I saw at this time that Daniel was behind the Commodore, probably about ten to fifteen metres behind it. The Commodore was being driven fairly slowly, at a speed of about 70kph at the most. It was being driven wholly within it’s lane of travel in the direction of Singleton. Daniel slowed to the speed of the car. At this time I was about half way up the hill and John who was behind me was at the bottom of the hill.” 
        
       
      
    33 Whilst it may be accepted Mr Burgess was keeping a general eye on the plaintiff, I do not accept the submission by senior counsel for the plaintiff that Mr Burgess was “an excellent witness”. In my opinion, there were a number of unsatisfactory aspects to the evidence of Mr Burgess, in particular: 
     
      
       
      (i) He had a tendency to give non responsive answers where it appeared a responsive answer may be damaging to the plaintiff’s case or where a non responsive answer would be helpful to the plaintiff’s case; 
      
     
     
      
      (ii) He exaggerated, favourably to the plaintiff, eg he said he remembered the plaintiff buying his motorcycle “2 years at a minimum, two to three years” before the accident. In fact, the motorcycle had been purchased about eight months before the accident. Similarly he described the plaintiff as riding “very, very conservatively. Very, very within the law” and that he wasn’t exceeding the speed limit, whereas the plaintiff was riding a motorcycle which he was not licensed to ride, he was not displaying a P plate and he exceeded the speed limit. He said, in evidence, that he saw the plaintiff after the plaintiff had moved to Sydney in 2000, probably twice a month, whereas he later said in evidence he used to see the plaintiff’s motorcycle “all the time” and would see the plaintiff riding the motorcycle “very frequently”; 
      
     
     
      
      (iii) Mr Burgess had returned to the accident scene a short time after the accident to make observations and notes and to take photographs. There is nothing intrinsically wrong with so acting save that it can result in a witness reconstructing matters such as observing and describing objects which would not have been observed at the time of the accident and thereby seek to “build a case”. Mr Burgess’ evidence as to his asserted recollection of the physical features of the location was suggestive of a degree of reconstruction; 
      
     
     
      
      (iv) He denied the accuracy of the contents of the statement contained in the police notebook and said that the police officer had not had a notebook with him when he spoke to him. The police officer said he had a notebook with him, that he wrote Mr Burgess’ statement into it contemporaneously and what was recorded was what Mr Burgess had said. I accept the evidence of the police officer; 
      
     
     
      
      (v) Mr Burgess corrected the typescript of the statement to the investigator dated 23 May 2002 by making and initialling numerous handwritten alterations to the document. One handwritten alteration on the document was in para 22. The paragraph read: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The police came to the accident. I spoke to the policeman and I gave him a statement” 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        to which was added “which was noted on a small pad”. The alteration was initialled. Mr Burgess said the added words and the initials were not his, though he accepted all other alterations and initials and signatures on the document were written by him; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (vi) The first defendant obtained expert evidence that the disputed initials were those of Mr Burgess and that it was highly probable the handwritten amendments were written by him. Senior counsel for the plaintiff did not seek to cross examine the expert or oppose the tender of her report. He did not submit in address that the handwriting and initials were not made by Mr Burgess. Counsel for the second defendant characterised Mr Burgess’ evidence in this regard as a lie. It seems it must be so; 
      
     
     
      
      (vii) Mr Burgess denied the plaintiff lost control on re-entering the northbound lane contrary to the evidence of other witnesses, contrary to what was recorded by an ambulance officer, and contrary to his statement dated 10 February 2002 in which he said: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Due to the Commodore accelerating Daniel was forced to accelerate faster to get in front of him and get back into the left lane. At this stage the broken lines had ended and the Commodore was tailgating Daniel.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        In order to explain this comment Mr Burgess was forced to place an unusual and unconvincing meaning on the expression “tailgating”; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      (viii) He denied the first defendant said “I’ll get help”, contrary to his statement in the police notebook; 
       
       
      (ix) He asserted the motorcycle had high sided and that as a result there were scrape marks to the nearside of the motorcycle. However, photographs revealed that major scrape marks were to the offside, not the nearside of the motorcycle. 
      
    34 These matters give rise to difficulty in accepting Mr Burgess’ evidence. Careful assessment is required in determining what evidence should be accepted, see, generally, Makita (Australia) Pty Ltd v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705 at [35] per Heydon JA. 
     
      
       
      John Clarke 
       
      
    35 John Clarke was born in 1944. He said the plaintiff rode first, then Mr Burgess and then himself. They travelled from the Half Way House “doing the limit, 100, round about, give or take a bit”. Daniel rode a bit quicker, his (600cc) bike accelerates a bit quicker than the others. He was hard to keep up with on one occasion. He “appeared excited by the prospect of riding the bike”. He said he came over the hill and noticed the plaintiff behind a car which the plaintiff proceeded to overtake. The plaintiff commenced his overtake at the beginning of broken centrelines. As the plaintiff overtook over the hill, both vehicles increased speed down the hill and the plaintiff “looked like to me that he held out”. Mr Clarke was 100 metres or so behind the plaintiff when the plaintiff commenced to overtake. The plaintiff pulled back in to the northbound lane approximately where the double lines started again - just past the northernmost Oakey Creek sign. The car was just marginally behind him. You could see a bit of smoke coming from the back tyre, and then he fishtailed, high-sided over the top and hit the guardrail next to a post. The bike skidded behind him, hit him and bounced back onto the road…the brakes came on at the same time as he was moving in. He applied his brake and turned the steering at approximately the same time. Mr Clarke pulled up at the accident scene. He noticed the car stop and the driver get out but they did not speak to each other.  
     
      
    36 Mr Clarke said he gave a statement to the police at the scene. However, the police officer gave evidence that Mr Clarke had declined to make a statement to the police at the scene. He made a statement to an investigator in May 2002 in which he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “5. I remember that the accident happened on the Putty Road at Howes Creek. The Putty Road where the accident happened has one lane for traffic in either direction, with a very wide bitumen shoulder on the left hand side of the road heading towards Singleton. The road is made from bitumen and was in very good condition. There is a centre line and it was definitely broken, but whether there was an unbroken line as well I am not sure. The speed limit is 100kph. The accident was on a corner in the roadway. There was an advisory speed sign of 95kph as you approached the corner, it wasn’t a sharp corner. Visibility is fairly open through the corner. Travelling towards Singleton there is a decline towards the corner, the roadway through the corner is flat. I know this area well, I had ridden through the area five or six times before the day of this accident… 
        
       
       
        
        14. As we reached the area of the accident, Aaron was riding at a distance of about twenty metres to the rear of Daniel, and I was riding at a distance of about thirty metres to the rear of Aaron. Approximately half a kilometre before where the accident happened we caught up to a Holden Commodore Station Wagon, this was the car that was later involved in this accident. The Holden wasn’t being driven fast, probably at a speed of around 70 to 80kph, he wasn’t going terribly fast because we caught him fairly quickly. 
        
       
       
        
        15. We followed this Holden through a couple of bends. During this time Aaron and Daniel were riding fairly closely together. I stayed perhaps about fifty metres behind Aaron. Aaron and Daniel stayed fairly close to the Holden, getting ready to overtake it I assume when the occasion arose. The Holden I saw appeared to be driven at a constant speed and was staying to it’s correct side of the roadway. 
        
       
       
        
        16. I lost sight of the Holden and Daniel and Aaron, momentarily as they were going through a bend ahead of me. I then regained my sighting of them and at that time, the Holden and Daniel and Aaron were just going over the crest of a hill, about fifty or so metres ahead of me, although I was probably closing up on them a bit by then. 
        
       
       
        
        17. As they were going over the crest, I was travelling up the incline towards the crest. As the Holden, Daniel and Aaron started to go down the hill on the other side of the crest, I reached the crest and I saw Daniel just commencing to move to the right onto the incorrect side of the roadway to overtake the Holden. Aaron was behind the car, still on his correct side of the roadway, waiting for Daniel to finishing [sic] overtaking the Holden. 
        
       
       
        
        18. Daniel commenced to overtake the Holden well before the corner, just after the crest in the road. I saw him move over the broken line. There was definitely a broken line for traffic heading towards Singleton, but I am not sure at this time if there was any other line to the right of that broken line. I saw the Holden picking up speed going down the hill, I can’t say to what speed, but I could see Daniel accelerating drawing alongside the Holden, trying to get past the Holden. I can’t state the speed of either the Holden or Daniel, but certainly the Holden increased speed as Daniel commenced to overtake him. They stayed side by side to the bottom of the hill. There was no traffic coming from the opposite direction during this time. I didn’t see the Holden’s or Daniels brake lights come on as they travelled down the hill. 
        
       
       
        
        19. I could see both the Holden and Daniel approaching the corner in the roadway. This was a right hand corner, a sweeping corner. I could see double unbroken lines marked on the roadway through the corner. I saw Daniel try to get back to his correct side of the roadway before the corner. By that time he was in front of the Holden, but not very far in front. He came back to his left normally, he didn’t veer in sharply. I am not sure if he had regained his correct side of the roadway before where the double unbroken lines commenced or not… 
        
       
       
        
        23. The driver of the Holden came half way back, and I told him to go to a house and get some help. The driver of the Holden was a male person and I didn’t see him again. I think there was a passenger in the Holden as well. 
        
       
       
        
        24. Aaron stayed with Daniel. I rode away to find David. I came upon him within three or four minutes, he was returning to see where we were. He hadn’t seen the accident at all. He only stayed at the accident scene for a few minutes and then he left. 
        
       
       
        
        28. My thoughts are that the driver of the Holden could have allowed Daniel in. I am unable to state if the Holden driver sped up on purpose, or if it was just the decline, but the Holden certainly sped going down the hill.” 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Clarke conceded his recollection was somewhat limited. He said that the whole thing was hazy except the plaintiff losing control and falling off. He was uncertain whether the plaintiff and Mr Burgess swapped motorcycles at Colo or the Half Way House. He said he only saw the car when he came over the hill whereas he had told the investigator he and the plaintiff had followed the car through a series of bends. The evidence as to how far he was from the plaintiff at various times was uncertain. His evidence is inconsistent with Mr Burgess’ evidence of him arriving at the accident scene one minute after the accident, just as the first defendant was driving off. It is also inconsistent with the evidence of the first defendant and his wife. These matters give rise to a degree of doubt as to the accuracy of his recollection and whether he was in a position to observe some of the matters of which he gave evidence. 
     
      
       
      The first defendant 
       
      
    38 The first defendant gave evidence he remembered approaching the crest which commenced the descent to Oakey Creek. He was not aware at that time of any other traffic being on the road. He was travelling at about 80 km/h. When he got to the top of the crest he could see a straight road with a very slight bend. As soon as he came up the crest he put his foot down and sped up to 95 km/h and he put the cruise control on at the same time. His vehicle picked up a couple of kilometres in speed as it descended the hill but he flicked the cruise control to slow it back to 95 km/h. He did not become aware of any other vehicle on the hill as he descended it. He wanted to slow down on reaching the guardrail for the sharp corner further down. He looked in his rear vision mirror and saw the motorcycle very close behind him, a matter of only metres, in the northbound lane. He was about 200 feet away from the beginning of the guardrail at its southern end when he observed the motorcycle. At about 150 feet from the southern end of the guardrail he commenced to gently brake to slow down his speed ready for the sharp corner. He saw the motorcyclist in his side mirror. The motorcyclist was on the wrong side of the road near the first defendant’s tail lights and was on the other side of an unbroken line. At that stage the first defendant was travelling at about a speed of 80 km/h. He then saw the motorcycle rider beside his driver’s side window with his head bent down and his face pointing forward. They were inside the guardrail. The motorcyclist did not turn his head toward him. The motorcyclist went past him travelling about 15 km/h faster than the first defendant and pulled in in front of him about a car and a half length in front of him. The first defendant still had his foot on the brake and was in the centre of the northbound lane, probably a little bit more to the left than to the right. The motorcyclist pulled in front of him and went away from him. He had no problem with the plaintiff coming in front of him. The first defendant was then travelling at about 78 km/h. The motorcycle went approximately four or four and a half car lengths ahead of the car and started to fishtail. The point where the motorcycle pulled in front of him was at the Oakey Creek sign on the western side. The plaintiff hit the guardrail and the motorcycle slid across the road and then came back toward the first defendant. He turned his steering wheel to the right and went some way over the white line to miss the motorcycle. At no time did the first defendant apply his foot to the accelerator when aware of the motorcyclist being on the other side of the road to him.  
     
      
    39 He stopped his car after the accident. He and his wife got out of the car. He commenced to run to the scene. His wife remained with the vehicle. When the first defendant was approximately 20 metres from the plaintiff’s motorcycle, a motorcycle pulled up at the scene. The motorcyclist called out “Get an ambulance”. The first defendant acknowledged the request with a hand gesture. He started to turn back and another bike appeared and stopped. He returned to his car, dialled his mobile phone but could not get tone. He drove to the nearest house. No-one answered his knocking on the door. A utility was parked across the road. A man with it said he would ring from the shed in front of which the utility was parked. The first defendant then drove to Bulga Police Station because he wanted to be absolutely sure the ambulance had been called. He knew there was a police station in Bulga but thought it was a lot closer than it was. He did not return to the scene of the accident. He continued on to Tamworth, leaving his contact details with the police at Bulga. Whilst en route to Tamworth, he received a mobile phone call from a police officer with whom he had a very short conversation.  
     
      
    40 The first defendant gave statements. 
     
      
    41 The first statement was by telephone with the police whilst the first defendant was driving to Tamworth. The police notebook contained the following entry: 
     
      
       
        
        “TELEPHONED Peter Van EIJK 
        
       
       
        
        Supplied version 
         
        Travelling north cruise control on and saw one cycle in front and 3 behind, one of the cycles commenced to overtake while he was going down the hill to the curve continued on over unbroken line, lost control when in front of me and fell off, bike and rider into armco.” 
        
       
      
    42 A fuller statement was given to the police on 22 January 2002. That statement contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “I was travelling at 85Kph at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        In my side mirror I saw a motor bike commencing to overtake me, he was on the wrong side of the road and over unbroken lines approximately 20 metres in front of me he came back to the proper lane. He would have been doing close to 95Kph. When he came back into the left lane approximately 20 metres in front of me he appeared to miscalculate his entry back onto the correct side of the road. 
        
       
       
        
        He made a reasonably sharp right turn of the motor bike handles as he did the bike slipped out from under him and the bike and the rider continued into the safety rail. It appeared to me that the bike actually hit the upright posts where the guard rail is mounted to it, it turned and bounced back into the centre of the road and the rider remained up against the guard rail. 
        
       
       
        
        I would say that the impact of the bike and the rider into the rail was very heavy, as the bike continued to the centre of the roadway after impact. I had to steer around the bike and I actually ended up on the side of the roadway, in doing so to avoid the bike. I came back to the correct side of the road and became stationary at roadworks some 60 to 70 metres further up the road. I grabbed my mobile phone and walked back to where the accident happened but I couldn’t contact anyone because of the location. Phone contact was made to emergency personnel from nearby road works. 
        
       
       
        
        Prior to the accident there was no other vehicle travelling in the other direction and no other obstructions on the roadway. I am of the firm opinion that the accident was caused by the rider and the manner in which he re entered the correct lane and attempted to correct his path to the right when he entered that lane.” 
        
       
      
    43 On 17 May 2002 the first defendant gave a statement to an insurance investigator. The statement states, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “The accident occurred on a right hand bend but not a real sharp bend… 
        
       
       
        
        The Putty Road is windy all the way and I had driven through numerous bends before I reached the area where this accident happened. I was driving with my cruise control on. I usually set it for about ten kilometres less than the speed limit, and as the speed limit is 100kph, I most likely set it for about 90kph. On any bend that I had to have control of my car, I would re set the cruise control by touching the brake pedal. 
        
       
       
        
        I was aware that I was approaching another bend in the roadway. This was a right hand bend. It wasn’t a sharp bend, it was just an easy bend. I could see a fair distance through the bend. I could see there was no traffic coming from the opposite direction. I can’t remember at this time if there were any speed or corner advisory signs approaching the bend. As I approached the bend I was driving at a speed of about 90kph, and I touched the brake pedal, to re set the cruise control. From memory there were double unbroken lines marked in the centre of the roadway through the bend, and those lines started well before the bend. 
        
       
       
        
        At the same time I touched the brake pedal I looked in the rear vision mirror and I saw one motor cyclist behind my car. The cyclist would have been about twenty metres behind my car, but this is only a guess. This was the first time that I had noticed the cyclist, but I do recall some distance before that, a long way back a ‘dot’ in my rear vision mirror. I could make out that it was a motor bike and not a car, but this was some distance before this bend. I took no further notice of that ‘dot’ until I glanced in my mirror as I approached this bend. When I glanced in my rear vision mirror as I approached the bend, the motor bike was in my lane of travel. I didn’t see the motor cycles right hand blinker on. I would have noticed it straight away. I can’t say if the motor cycles headlight was on. I can’t estimate the speed of the motor cycle at that time. I only saw the one motor cycle at this time. 
        
       
       
        
        I wasn’t concerned about the motor bike behind me at that time, it was not doing anything unusual. I glanced away from the mirror, and looked directly ahead of me and commenced to drive into the bend. At this time I was driving at a speed of about 85kph. I was driving on my side of the road. I was wholly on my side of the road. I wasn’t over the centre line. I could see the line in my side mirror. 
        
       
       
        
        I was about a third of way into the bend and in the corner of my eye I noticed the motor bike rider alongside my drivers door. His helmet was near my shoulder. I could only see his upper body. I couldn’t see his bike. I was still driving at a speed of about 85kph. The motor cycle continued on past me, perhaps about ten kilometres faster than I was driving. The motor cyclist as he passed me was on the wrong side of the unbroken lines. I remained on my correct side of the road. I didn’t increase my speed. I just let him go. The motor cyclist didn’t acknowledge me as he went past me. He didn’t look at me at all, he was looking straight forwards with his head down a bit. 
        
       
       
        
        The motor cyclist stayed on the wrong side of the road. I noticed there was no traffic coming from the opposite direction, and I would be guessing, but he would have continued onto a distance of no less than four car lengths in front of me before he turned to move back to his correct side of the road. The rider was in control of his motor bike when he passed me. When he turned to the left to cross back to the correct side of the road he still was in control of his bike. When he commenced to return to his left, we were in the middle of the bend, in the sharpest part of the bend. 
        
       
       
        
        When the motor cyclist returned to his correct side of the roadway he was veering to the left, but when he returned to his correct side of the roadway, to compensate for the right hand bend he had to make a sharp turn to the right. At this time the motor cycle began to fishtail and he lost control of his bike. At no time had I increased my speed. The bike was fishtailing violently, the rider couldn’t keep control of it, and the bike and the rider went down together. The bike and the rider slid across the road to the left and they hit the safety rail on the left hand side of the road. The rider was thrown off when the bike hit the safety rail, and the bike then bounced back in the opposite direction towards my car. I braked lightly, and swung to the right to miss the bike. My drivers side wheels may have gone over the centre line a little bit, maybe a foot or so, but I am not sure. I hadn’t seen any other cyclist’s at this time. There was never any collision between my car and the motor cycle. 
        
       
       
        
        I drove onto the nearest place that I could pull up, which was a few hundred metres down the road. I got out of my car and I ran back and when I was about thirty metres from where the bike was, in the middle of the road, a second motor bike appeared, and the rider pulled up at the accident scene. He called out to me ‘get an ambulance’. I ran back to my car and got my mobile, but I got no reception. I drove my car further down the road, where there were two houses. I went to the house on the right hand side of the road and there was no answer. A car pulled up heading towards Singleton and the driver asked me if I had rung for an ambulance. I told him that nobody was at the house. He said that he would ring the ambulance from road maintenance workshed. 
        
       
       
        
        There appeared no reason for me to go back. I knew there was a Police Station further down the road at Bulga. I stopped at the Police Station to make sure that the ambulance had been called. I told the Policeman there about the accident. The Policeman told me that he didn’t know anything about it. He then contacted Singleton police Station to go out to the accident. I told the Policeman what had happened and gave him my details. A few hours later I toook a telephone call on my mobile which was the investigating Police Officer from Singleton. He asked me to come in and make a statement. A couple of days later when I was returning to Sydney I went to the Singleton Police Station and made a statement to Police. The Police have never indicated to me that I was at fault in this accident, it was never considered, I was just a witness to the accident. 
        
       
       
        
        I only ever saw a second rider at the accident scene. I never saw a third rider.” 
        
       
      
    44 The first defendant was cross examined at length with particular emphasis upon alleged inconsistencies between his statements and his oral evidence. He was recalled at the request of senior counsel for the plaintiff on two occasions for further questioning. Senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted the first defendant’s statements were inconsistent with his oral evidence, did not contain all relevant details and were consistent with some aspects of the evidence led by the plaintiff. The first defendant had not given evidence before and had not returned to the scene since the accident. There were, undoubtedly, some discrepancies between the content of the various statements and between the statements and his oral evidence. Some difficulties arose in the course of his cross examination. This was in part because the first defendant had used the end of the Armco fence as his point of reference. He was asked to mark the position of various matters on a plan which did not show the end of the fence. He was asked to mark photographs which depicted the road from the opposite direction to which he had been travelling. He was asked to indicate various points on a model which did not encompass the whole of the relevant section of the road from the crest to the point of impact, thus distorting its apparent scale. This, it seemed to me, led to a degree of confusion and misunderstanding. There were also occasions when counsel inadvertently misled the first defendant as to the content of other evidence and there were occasions when counsel was at cross purposes with the first defendant. However, in my opinion, the versions of events which the first defendant had previously given were not inconsistent, so far as the critical issues were concerned, with the evidence given by him at the hearing. The overall impression which I gained of the first defendant was that he was an honest witness who, though probably in error on some matters of detail, nevertheless had a recollection of the critical events which was essentially reliable.  
     
      
       
      Mrs Van Eyk 
       
      
    45 Mrs Van Eyk, in her evidence in chief, described the accident in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        A. Well, I was sitting next to my husband. He was driving normal speed, came bit down the hill and then Peter slowed down and then - then I hear a noise next to the car and then the motorbike just flew past us, you know, very fast, and then when he went past, then about, say, three and a half, four cars in front of us, the motorbike went back and then, well, he couldn't - you know, he went zigzagging and then I saw him flew over the - from the motorbike into the rail and then the motorbike came back over the road and then - and then I said to Peter, ‘Oh, we going to’--“ 
        
       
      
    46 She gave evidence she had seen a 55 km/h advisory speed sign and had felt the car slow down before the sign though she was unable to say how far before the sign the first defendant may have slowed. The car was travelling at about 80 km/h before she felt it slow down. She turned her head and looked to the right when she heard the motorcycle. She saw the motorcycle coming past very fast. It took a split second for the motorcycle to pass the car from the time she looked for the motorcycle. 
     
      
    47 After the accident her husband had brought the car to a halt and had run half way back to the scene when another motorcyclist stopped at the scene. The rider called out something, she did not hear what was said, and the first defendant returned to his vehicle. She described the events thereafter generally as the first defendant had done.  
     
      
    48 In cross examination, Mrs Van Eyk exhibited some confusion as to whether the motorcycle had moved back onto its correct side of the road before it commenced to fishtail or whether the zigzagging had occurred as the motorcycle commenced to move back in approximately four car lengths ahead. She confirmed that she could feel the vehicle slowing down. She was not able to be precise as to the speed to which it slowed. She had difficulty recognising the scene from photographs and exhibited considerable difficulty when invited by senior counsel for the plaintiff to draw a plan of the accident scene. She could not recall the presence of various signs apart from the 55 km/h advisory speed sign. She was asked if the accident occurred as they were driving through a right hand bend in the roadway to which she replied: “No the bend was like this, left”, at the same time indicating right. She stated the first defendant always puts cruise control on. 
     
      
    49 Senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Mrs Van Eyk was making no bona fide effort to assist the Court in giving her evidence and that her evidence should be rejected. However, Mrs Van Eyk was 75 years of age when she gave evidence. Although she said she had travelled the Putty Road three or four times before the accident, she had not since then returned to the scene. In those circumstances, and particularly as she was not the driver, it is not surprising she had difficulty in recollecting details of the scene. I did not get the impression she was not being frank with the Court but by reason of the matters previously referred to, it is necessary to consider her evidence closely.  
     
      
       
      Additional evidence 
       
      
    50 The ambulance report contained, inter alia, the following information: 
     
      
       
        
        “19/01/2002 10:17:22 KG Response Motor bike went off rd Male pt injured… 
        
       
       
        
        Police Services notified 19/01/2002 10:30:01 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Companions stated rider overtaking car which ? sped up - rider lost control on re entering lane - rider slammed into guard rail at speed > 90 km/hr.” 
        
       
      
    51 The accident was notified to the ambulance by the person who told the first defendant he would contact the ambulance. The ambulance officer who made the latter entry gave evidence in respect of his use of the question mark. The overall effect of that evidence, in my opinion, was that the question mark would have been used to either mean “allegedly” or “query”. It is notable the plaintiff’s speed was said to be in excess of 90 km/h per hour (after he had braked hard) and that the loss of control occurred on re-entering the lane. 
     
      
    52 The COPS report contained, inter alia, the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Date Time reported: 19/01/2002 10:30… 
         
        M/cyc acco

        Cyclist run off road into bush - in Howes Valley, south of Howes Valley Creek bridge.” 
        
       
       
      The plaintiff relied upon the allegation of “forced off rd by purple Commodore”. The source of that allegation is unclear. It was not repeated in later police entries or other police documents. The ambulance records indicate that the police were notified by the ambulance authority of the accident. The ambulance records do not contain such a history. It is not alleged by either party. In my opinion, significant weight cannot be attached to that comment. 
       
       
      Factual conclusions 
       
      
    53 The determination of the factual issues joined between the parties is one of difficulty. However, on the evidence before me, I find that essentially the scenario advanced by the first defendant and outlined in [38] and [39] hereof is to be preferred. I do so for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
      (a) I have made a favourable demeanour finding in respect of the first defendant. This is of assistance in advancing the case for the first defendant. I have also taken into account my impression of the other lay witnesses. However, I am mindful that demeanour can be misleading, and I do not rely upon that alone to reach my conclusion. 
       
       
      (b) The first defendant’s description of how he drove after reaching the crest until he stopped after the accident was consistent with what might be expected of an ordinary reasonable motorist. 
       
       
      (c) The first defendant’s evidence in respect of the area of overtaking, the car reducing speed and the events after the accident was corroborated in general outline by the evidence of his wife.  
       
       
      (d) There was objective support for the proposition that the motorcycle had returned to the northbound lane by reason of the presence of scrape marks and broken glass in the northbound lane. This accorded with the evidence of all witnesses except Mr Burgess. In respect of Mr Burgess it was consistent with his statement dated 10 February 2002 but later denied. 
       
       
      (e) The motorcycle did not collide with the car when control was lost which suggests it is unlikely the motorcycle was braking in the southbound lane when control was lost. 
       
       
      (f) The first defendant’s ability to avoid the motorcycle as it rebounded across the road and to take the bend safely indicates the car was not travelling at 110 km/h, as suggested by Mr Burgess, but, as the first defendant said, was reducing speed and he had his foot on the brake. There were no skid marks to confirm the rapid braking of the car, as asserted by Mr Burgess. 
       
       
      (g) Senior counsel for the plaintiff submitted the first defendant and his wife “slipped away” from the scene, something a reasonable person would not have done, the suggestion being the first defendant and his wife fled the scene by reason of feelings of guilt because he had caused the accident. However, the first defendant initially headed back to the accident scene to see what he could do but before he reached that scene Mr Burgess was there and he then went to seek to contact an ambulance. He then proceeded to report the accident at the nearest police station. In my opinion, the actions of the first defendant and his wife were not unreasonable. No adverse inference is open to be drawn from this behaviour. I note there was evidence (in the statement by John Clarke) that David Clarke rode back to the accident scene but departed after a few minutes at the scene. 
       
       
      (h) It is improbable the first defendant would have driven down from near the top of the hill oblivious to the presence of this particular noisy motorcycle beside him in the southbound lane. Thus, if the overtake commenced near the crest and the first defendant had increased speed keeping the plaintiff out, the likely inference is that the first defendant did so deliberately. 
       
       
      (i) It would make no sense for the first defendant to increase speed half way down the hill as he could see what lay ahead. It would however be consistent with deliberately keeping the plaintiff out. 
       
       
      (j) When it was suggested to the first defendant that he had speeded up so he would not let the plaintiff in, he replied  
       
       
        
         
          
          “That’s absolute lie. I wouldn’t - I don’t do that.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q. Don’t you? 
           
          A. I don’t worry - I don’t - I never in me life would do that.”  
          
         
        
       
       
      (k) It is inherently improbable that a person of mature years, accompanied by his wife, would deliberately drive at or about 110 km/h approaching a signposted 55 km/h bend in order to prevent a motorcyclist returning to his correct side of the road and thus exposing not only the motorcyclist but himself and his wife to the risk of serious injury, particularly when there was no evidence of other than conservative earlier driving by the first defendant and no evidence of any altercation between him and the plaintiff. 
       
       
      (l) It is far more likely that the plaintiff, riding at or about 100 km/h per hour came up on the car near the end of the broken lines and the plaintiff at that time decided to overtake. 
       
      
    54 I find that the plaintiff was riding, probably for the first time, a powerful motorcycle on a challenging country road. He and his companions were “doing the limit, 100, round about, give or take a bit”. The plaintiff rode a bit quicker, his bike accelerated a bit quicker than the others and he was hard to keep up with, at least on one occasion. The plaintiff caught up to the car. The motorcycle was then in the northbound lane and just before the broken centreline came to an end. The plaintiff moved into the southbound lane and commenced to overtake the car at or near the end of the marked overtaking zone. He succeeded in completing the overtaking manoeuvre and returned to the northbound lane and, in attempting to reduce speed and/or straighten up the motorcycle to take the bend, he lost control of it and injury resulted. 
     
      
       
      Liability - the first defendant 
       
      
    55 A person using the highway as a driver has a duty to exercise reasonable care not to cause injury to persons on the highway. The ordinary standard of care is “measured objectively by the care to be expected of an experienced, skilled and careful driver” - see Cook v Cook (1986) 162 CLR 376 at 381. The onus of proving breach is upon the plaintiff. 56 The obligation to exercise reasonable care must be contrasted with an obligation to prevent harm occurring to others. As observed by Gummow J in Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer [2007] HCA 42, (2007) 81 ALJR 1773 at [51]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The former, not the latter, is the requirement of the law. In  
        Modbury Triangle Shopping Centre Pty Ltd v Anzil 
        , Gleeson CJ pointed to the remarks of Brennan J in  
        Sutherland Shire Council v Heyman 
         and observed that ‘the common law distinguishes between an act affecting another person, and an omission to prevent harm to another. If people were under a legal duty to prevent foreseeable harm to others, the burden imposed would be intolerable.’ In  
        Heyman 
        , Brennan J had emphasised that the common law recognises ‘a duty to take reasonable care to avoid doing what might cause injury to another, not a duty to act to prevent injury being done to another by that other, by a third person, or by circumstances for which nobody is responsible.’” 
        
       
      
    57 The plaintiff submitted the first defendant, by his actions, created a situation of danger for the plaintiff and the plaintiff, in seeking to deal with that situation, lost control of his motorcycle and suffered injury. I am unable to accept this submission. 
     
      
    58 The first defendant was driving within the speed limit, wholly within his lane. At no stage did he increase the speed at which he was driving after the plaintiff commenced to overtake him so as to enliven reg 145 of the Australian road rules nor did he create a situation of danger for the plaintiff.59 On the contrary, the situation of danger in which the plaintiff found himself was the consequence of his own actions. The plaintiff was aware of his relative lack of experience and that he was riding a motorcycle which was more powerful than that which he was permitted by law to ride and which he had had little experience in riding. On the findings of fact which I have made, the plaintiff deliberately commenced to overtake the car at or near the end of the overtaking zone in circumstances where it was apparent that completion of the overtaking manoeuvre would require him to ride the motorcycle at a high speed and that completion of the overtaking manoeuvre would occur well beyond the end of the overtaking zone and near to the apex of a reasonably tight bend, giving rise to a need to adjust his speed and direction when he re-entered the northbound lane in order to take the bend safely. He, in effect, commenced to overtake when he should have been reducing speed in response to the signs and nature of the road ahead. He should not have attempted to overtake in that location. His injuries were caused solely by his actions and either his failure to safely deal with the situation he had created or due to some other deficiency in his riding. 
     
      
    60 In these circumstances, applying the principles from Dederer quoted above [57], the first defendant owed no duty to prevent harm being done to the plaintiff due to his own actions. 
     
      
    61 Even if such a duty was owed, there was no breach of it by the first defendant. The first defendant was entitled to assume the plaintiff was an experienced rider. This was seemingly confirmed by virtue of the type of motorcycle and the absence of any P plate. The plaintiff was in control of the motorcycle until it had passed the first defendant. It was appropriate for the first defendant to assume the plaintiff had factored in the position and speed of the car and that it was appropriate that the first defendant continue to proceed as he did and not to slow to enable the plaintiff to more quickly regain the northbound lane. Furthermore, it has not been established that if the first defendant had slowed the plaintiff would not have lost control of the motorcycle in any event. 
     
      
    62 As senior counsel for the plaintiff conceded: 
     
      
       
        
        “If Mr Van Eyk is to be believed, that the bike was behind him and he applies the brakes and this boy commences to overtake, if that occurred, then the case against Mr Van Eyk is difficult to see.” 
        
       
      
    63 In my opinion, there was no negligence on the part of the first defendant. The plaintiff’s injuries were not caused or contributed to by the first defendant. The plaintiff’s action against the first defendant fails. 
     
      
       
      Liability - the second defendant 
       
      
    64 A transitory sight restriction for northbound vehicles was created by foliage growing on the eastern side of the Putty Road. 
     
      
    65 Australian Standard AS 1742.2-1994 provided a table applicable to situations of sight restriction. 
     
      
    66 It was submitted for the plaintiff that, properly applied, the Standard required a minimum overtaking zone of 250 metres and a barrier line (ie an unbroken centreline) of 215 metres calculated to the centre of the bend. 
     
      
    67 As the distance of the barrier line from the end of the overtaking zone to the centre of the bend was 119 metres it was submitted no overtaking zone should have been permitted in that location, with the consequence that if there had been no overtaking zone the plaintiff would not have overtaken the first defendant and no injury would have occurred. 
     
      
    68 The second defendant submitted that the Standard did not require there be no overtaking zone at that point. It submitted, correctly, that the Standard was merely a guideline, it had no legally binding effect (Chicco v The Corporation of the City of Woodville (1990) Aust Torts Reps 81-028). It also submitted the terms of the Standard admitted of exceptions which were applicable in this case, and that a lesser figure for the V85 (the speed at or below which 85 percent of vehicles were observed to travel under free flowing conditions past a nominated point) of 91-100 km/h chosen by the plaintiff could legitimately be applied, the V85 being determinative of the selection of the relevant distances from the table in the Standard. It also submitted that even if there had been no overtaking lane, the evidence of the plaintiff’s riding enabled an inference to be drawn that he would have overtaken regardless of the absence of an overtaking zone. 
     
      
    69 I do not consider it necessary to determine the proper application of the Standard in this case. The purpose of the Standard was primarily (Mr Stuart Smith) or solely (Mr Fishburn) to determine the distance required to avoid a risk of collision between two vehicles approaching each other at speed in the same traffic lane when there was a sight restriction. That risk did not materialise. The distance required for that purpose would ordinarily be considerably greater than the distance required to avoid collision with a stationary object or to avoid losing control of a vehicle on a bend. In my opinion, different considerations arise in the latter case.  
     
      
    70 A road authority is obliged to exercise reasonable care so that the road is safe for users exercising reasonable care for their own safety - Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Dederer at [45]. A road authority is not obliged to ensure that a road be safe in all the circumstances (Dederer at [46]). 
     
      
    71 Where use is made of an overtaking zone on a country road where the speed limit is high and there is but a single lane in each direction, reasonable care on the part of the road user requires not only that the overtaking motorist ensure that there are no approaching vehicles with which there is a risk of collision, but that there will be sufficient time and space to overtake and pull back safely in front of the vehicle being overtaken, and that he or she will complete the overtaking manoeuvre within the overtaking zone and will have sufficient time to prepare for any hazard ahead and will respond appropriately to any change of circumstances occurring during the course of the overtaking manoeuvre. 
     
      
    72 The plaintiff submitted the second defendant failed to take reasonable care to adequately warn of the bend and provided an overtaking zone where it was not safe to do so. 
     
      
    73 Photographs tendered in evidence make it clear that in daylight, not only were the reduced speed sign and the reverse curve warning sign with a 55 km/h advisory speed plate underneath it clearly visible to motorists coming down the hill, but so too was the existence of the curve, the direction of the curve and the Armco fence demonstrating the curvature. The view of the bend increased the nearer one got to it. Mr Stuart Smith agreed that in daylight the curve and signage were there to be observed and assessed by an approaching motorist, in this case, by the plaintiff. 
     
      
    74 Subsequent to the accident, chevron hazard markers (a series of markers like arrowheads pointing sideways) were located by the second defendant around the western guardrail. Mr Stuart Smith considered the presence of such markers was consistent with good engineering practice. He said their earlier absence was excusable as the bend was otherwise satisfactorily signposted. In cross examination by the first defendant, Mr Stuart Smith said, in answer to a leading question, that chevron alignment markers were “very much indicated in this case”. However, in cross examination by the second defendant, he conceded that chevron markers were intended to assist drivers as to the existence or direction of a curve, their importance increased in respect of night time driving and that in daylight the curvature and direction of the curve was observable to drivers as they came down the hill and that the curvature was demonstrated by the Armco fence. 
     
      
    75 Ultimately, there was little, if any, support for this allegation of negligence. Mr Fishburn confirmed that the signage was satisfactory. I accept that evidence. In my opinion, the second defendant did not fail to take reasonable care to adequately warn of the bend. 
     
      
    76 There was expert evidence that the bend, although subject to an advisory 55 km/h sign, could be taken comfortably in good conditions at speeds of 65-75 km/h in the case of average motorcyclists and up to 90 or 95 km/h in the case of expert motorcyclists. As Mr Hall said, 75 km/h would certainly be a comfortable speed for a rider of moderate capabilities. A road user, consistently with the road rules, could overtake in the overtaking zone at a speed of 100 km/h per hour, returning to the northbound lane at the end of the overtaking zone. This would be a “worse case scenario” in terms of reducing speed and preparing for the bend, short of the road rules being disobeyed. 
     
      
    77 The distance from the end of the overtaking zone to the commencement of the bend was 79 metres. Mr Stuart Smith did not dispute that a motorist could reasonably reduce speed from 100 to 60 or 65 km/h in 79 metres if in the northbound lane. He agreed the distance was adequate and that people could achieve higher deceleration rates than that. He agreed most motorists would go around the bend above 55, maybe at 65 km/h.  
     
      
    78 Mr Hall considered if the plaintiff was travelling at 95-100 km/h when he passed the first defendant, he would require 40-50 metres of moderate braking to reduce speed to 75 km/h and, allowing for a set up period, would have needed to apply moderate braking for 60-70 metres prior to the bend for it to be taken comfortably. 
     
      
    79 In a joint expert report (Exhibit B) it was stated the northbound line marking consisted of a dashed separation line of approximately 252 m in length, followed by a solid single barrier line approximately 119 m in length before the commencement of the double barrier lines at the start of the curve at Oakey Creek. The “start of the curve” here referred to (unlike earlier references) was to the start of the apex of the bend, which the report stated was 10 m after the Oakey Creek signs. In another joint expert report (Exhibit S), it was stated: “The experts define the start of the true curve to be 25 metres north of the southern most Oakey Creek sign.” The photographs exhibited make it clear that the road remains near straight from the end of the overtaking zone to near the apex of the bend. Thus there is approximately 119-134 metres from the end of the overtaking zone to the apex of the bend. 
     
      
    80 As senior counsel for the plaintiff observed “One could readily decelerate from 95 ks per hour to the 50 or 60 - to a much lesser speed - to accommodate the bend.” 
     
      
    81 In my opinion, the second defendant owed a duty to take reasonable care to provide an adequate distance for motorists using the overtaking zone and exercising reasonable care for their own safety to reduce speed and prepare to safely proceed through the bend. Reasonable care did not require the second defendant to guard against the risk of a motorcyclist commencing to overtake at speed at or near the end of the overtaking zone. Having regard to the available distance and to the likely infrequency of vehicles overtaking in the overtaking zone at 100 km/h and returning to the northbound lane at the end of the overtaking zone and the improbability of injury being sustained thereby, I do not consider that there was any breach of the second defendant’s duty of care following the completion of the roadworks at Oakey Creek. 
     
      
    82 However, the plaintiff contends the second defendant subsequently was put on notice of incidents of vehicles losing control at the bend and should have taken appropriate action to remove the risk that was then apparent. 
     
      
    83 The evidence in support of this submission consisted of documentary evidence (Exhibit P) produced by the second defendant as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) on 25 October 2001 an email was sent from Mr McTackett, the second defendant’s project manager in the construction of the Oakey Creek bridge, in the following terms: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “As discussed, I am concerned with a safety issue at Oakey Creek 55.9km south of Singleton on MR503. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          By way of background, replacement of the single span bridge at Oakey Creek, was completed in July 2001. The new structure is a three cell box culvert and the approaches have also been reconstructed with improvements to the vertical and horizontal alignments and improved width. Work is currently underway on the replacement of the bridge over Howes Valley Creek, 55.5 km south of Singleton and this work will include some realignment of the road, ultimately tying in to the new Oakey Creek approaches. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Since the work at Oakey Creek has been completed, there have been some reported incidents of northbound vehicles losing control on the first curve north of Oakey Creek. The curve has a posted advisory speed of 55kph, which was the same prior to the upgrade. I don’t know if the incidents are related to the temporary tie in to the roadworks at Howes Valley Creek, if it is due to traffic travelling faster on the improved alignment at Oakey Creek or if it is a combination of the two. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Will you please arrange for a general inspection of this site, preferably at an early date, to assess the problem and recommend a solution. I am happy to attend the site if necessary to discuss this. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The work should be charged to Subjob PP00195 and I would appreciate if it you or Shane could first contact me to discuss the approximate costs involved.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (b) The message was responded to as follows on 21 November 2001 by Shane Kerr, a senior technical officer of the second defendant: 
       
       
        
         
          
          “I met Brian Griffiths on site early in November. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I have made several recommendations which are contained on a 385 work request (sent out today). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The recommendations are: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Provide additional RRPM’s around the Oakey Creek curve. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Provide 10 x CAMs on the Oakey Creek bend for northbound traffic. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Provide supplementary C size 55 kph curve warning sign. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Relocate Reduce Speed sign further south and increase to B size and provide B size supplementary. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Extend existing double unbroken centre line 100m south from the curve.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (c) An installation authority which indicated the material would be supplied from stock at Waratah sub depot and a plan which stated: “Extend existing BB line south 800 m (to past crest). 
       
      
    84 Exhibit 8 (2D) consists of documents which are apparently the order form for the upgraded signposting and linemarking referred to in Exhibit P. These documents disclose that the work was completed on 11 February 2002. The work involved was the upgraded signposting and linemarking as detailed. The unbroken centreline was extended to the crest rather than 100 metres south from the curve. The reason for this is not apparent. 
     
      
    85 The second defendant called no witnesses other than Mr Fishburn. The other parties therefore had the benefit of the principle in Jones v Dunkel, at least insofar as the second defendant’s continuing employee, Mr McTackett, was concerned. However, that principle cannot be used to fill gaps in the evidence, or to convert conjecture and suspicion to inference. 
     
      
    86 The second defendant made the following submissions in respect of the plaintiff’s contention: 
     
      
       
      (a) Section 5C(c) of the  
      Civil Liability Act 
      , 2002 provides that the taking of action which would have avoided a risk of harm does not of itself give rise to or affect liability in respect of the risk and does not of itself constitute an admission of liability in connection with the risk.  
       
       
      (b) The significance to this case of the reported incidents of northbound vehicles losing control depends upon the occurrence and causes of the reported incidents ( 
      Roads and Traffic Authority v Royal 
       [2008] HCA 19 at [28]). The causes were not established by the evidence. Mr Fishburn gave evidence that on the crash history he obtained there were no reported incidents of northbound vehicles losing control on the first curve. He could not exclude the possibility there had been some minor incidents not included in the database. There was no evidence any incidents were due to persons using the overtaking zone. Any incidents may have been due to a temporary tie-in in the roadworks, as Mr McTackett hypothesised, or simply a driver choosing to travel at excessive speed wholly within the northbound lane. The relevance of these incidents, if they occurred, to the duty to the plaintiff was not established. The removal of the overtaking zone would appear to be an excessive response to the situation. 
       
       
      (c) The obligation of the second defendant, if there was a relevant risk, was to take reasonable steps within a reasonable time to address that risk. Regard must be had to competing and conflicting responsibilities of the second defendant, the availability of materials and skilled labour -  
      Brodie v Singleton Shire Council 
       [2001] HCA 29; (2001) 106 CLR 512 at [150]-[151], [162]. There was nothing about the information which indicated any particular urgency. The time taken by the second defendant implementing those changes was not overlong, particularly as it extended over the vacation period. The fact that the proposed work was not implemented until after the injury to the plaintiff did not, in the absence of impermissible hindsight reasoning, show a lack of reasonable care in all the circumstances.  
       
       
      (d) It was necessary for the plaintiff to establish that had the second defendant extended the barrier line so as to remove or reduce the overtaking zone, he would not have attempted to overtake the car and thus would not have sustained injury. The plaintiff’s mother described the plaintiff as “very careful, very cautious and probably quiet”. She was not however in a position to comment on the plaintiff’s attitude as a motorcyclist. Mr Burgess described the plaintiff as, on the relevant occasion, riding “very, very conservatively, very, very within the law”. That was not an accurate description. The plaintiff was riding, contrary to the conditions of his licence, on a very powerful motorcycle, exceeding the speed he was permitted to travel at and without displaying a P plate. The question to be addressed has regard to the particular circumstances which might affect the plaintiff’s conduct -  
      Hoyts Pty Ltd v Burns 
       [2003] HCA 61; (2003) 77 ALJR 1934 at [25]. The evidence before the Court was that the plaintiff had been prepared to overtake at speed at the end of or beyond the end of the broken centreline when approaching a bend which was signposted 55 km/h. In these circumstances, the plaintiff has not established, and the onus is upon him, that he would not have attempted to overtake the first defendant if the overtaking zone in the relevant section had been reduced in length or removed. 
       
      
    87 I accept those submissions for the reasons set out in [86] above. 
     
      
    88 The second defendant also submitted that the plaintiff’s claim against it would fail by reason of the absence of proof of the necessary causative link. I agree with that submission for the reasons set out in para [59] hereof. 
     
      
    89 I therefore conclude there was no negligence on the part of the second defendant and the plaintiff’s injuries were not caused or contributed to by the second defendant. Accordingly, the plaintiff’s action against the second defendant fails. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    90 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Verdict and judgment for the first defendant. 
       
       
      2. The plaintiff pay the first defendant’s costs. 
       
       
      3. Verdict and judgment for the second defendant. 
       
       
      4. The plaintiff pay the second defendant’s costs. 
       
       
      5. Verdict and judgment for the first defendant on the cross claim by the second defendant. 
       
       
      6. The second defendant pay the first defendant’s costs of the cross claim.

      Background 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Nine men have been accused of conspiring with each other to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. The Crown case is largely circumstantial and will involve a detailed examination of the activities of the accused over a period of about fourteen months. There will, for example, be evidence of intercepted telephone conversations, listening device conversations and there will be surveillance evidence as well. 
     
      
    2 It is the Crown's intention to call surveillance evidence from persons who are officers within the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation (""ASIO""). In fact, were they all to be called, there would be, I understand, approximately forty-eight ASIO witnesses called to give evidence of their observations over varying periods of time. 
     
      
    3 One of the accused is Khaled Cheikho. His lawyers, Messrs Waterstreet and Lange, have asked the Court to stay the proceedings against their client. It has been submitted that the proposed reliance by the Crown on surveillance evidence to be given by members of ASIO will constitute an abuse of process. This is because, so it is argued, ASIO officers are absolutely debarred from divulging intelligence information in court proceedings, or, alternatively, are debarred from doing so without the requisite and necessary approval under the Australian Security and Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (""ASIO Act""). In fact, were an ASIO officer to give evidence it would constitute a serious criminal offence, one aided and abetted by the prosecution. 
     
      
    4 Mr Lange provided both written and oral submissions to the Court in support of these contentions. The Crown submissions were made by Mr Bellew SC in both written and oral form. At the conclusion of the argument I reserved my decision. 
     
      
       
      Arguments on behalf of Khaled Cheikho 
       
      
    5 As I have indicated above, Mr Lange's submissions were made in the alternative. The primary submission was that the giving of evidence by an ASIO officer was absolutely prohibited by the provisions of the ASIO Act. Mr Lange pointed to the provisions of s 18(1) and (2) of the ASIO Act. He argued that these provisions made it clear that the giving of evidence in criminal proceedings would be the commission of an offence by the relevant ASIO officer. It will be convenient to set out ss 18(1), (2) and (3) of the ASIO Act:

          (iv) the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission or a member of the staff of the ACC; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) where the information has come into the possession of the Organisation outside Australia and the Director-General or the person so authorised is satisfied that the national interest requires the communication – the information may be communicated to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) a Minister; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) a Department; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) an intelligence or security agency; or

          (v) a member or special member of the Australian Federal Police; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (via) the Integrity Commissioner, a staff member of ACLEI or a special investigator; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (vi) the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Crime Commission or a member of the staff of ACC; or

        Privacy Act 1988) 
         is in force – the information may be communicated in accordance with Part VIA of that Act”. 
        
       
      
    6 Mr Lange argued that support for his contention was also to be found in the nature of the work done by ASIO, and in the provisions of ss 8, 17 and 20 of the ASIO Act. Further support again could be found in the provisions of s 18(3)(a) and (b) of the Act. 
     
      
    7 Section 8 of the ASIO Act provides, in particular, that the Organisation shall be under the control of the Director-General. Section 17 outlines the statutory functions of ASIO. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “17.  
        Functions of Organisation 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The functions of the Organisation are:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) for purposes relevant to security and not otherwise, to communicate any such intelligence to such persons, and in such manner as are appropriate to those purposes; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) to advise ministers and authorities of the Commonwealth in respect of matters relating to security, insofar as those matters are relevant to their functions and responsibilities. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ca) to furnish security assessments to a State or an authority of a State in accordance with paragraph 40(1)(b); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) to advise Ministers, authorities of the Commonwealth and such other persons as the Minister, by notice in writing given to the Director-General, determines on matters relating to protective security; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) to obtain within Australia foreign intelligence pursuant to s 27A or 27B of this  
          Act 
           or s 11A, 11B or 11C of the  
          Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 
           1979, and to communicate any such intelligence in accordance with this  
          Act 
           or  
          Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 
          .  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) It is not a function of the Organisation to carry out or enforce measures for security within an authority of the Commonwealth.” 
        
       
      
    8 Section 20 of the ASIO Act requires the Director-General to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the work of the Organisation is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the discharge of its functions.  
     
      
    9 In relation to his primary submission, Mr Lange advanced a number of other general arguments. I shall outline these as necessary when I come to resolve the issues between the parties.  
     
      
    10 Mr Lange's alternative argument was that, if there be an ability for ASIO officers to give evidence in criminal proceedings, they can only do so with appropriate authorisation. Counsel argued that the material relied on by the Crown for this purpose did not give adequate authorisation or approval.  
     
      
       
      Arguments on behalf of the Crown 
       
      
    11 The Crown took issue with Mr Lange's primary argument. First, the Crown said a proper examination of the provisions of s 18(1) and (2) demonstrated that, far from there being a prohibition against ASIO officers giving evidence in proceedings, there was support for the contention that, with approval, communication of intelligence in this way would be permissible and not tainted by criminality. The Crown sought to draw support for its argument from s 17(1)(b) of the ASIO Act and from a number of the definition sections in the legislation. In particular, the Crown drew attention to the definition of ""Security"" in s 4 of the ASIO Act. 
     
      
       
        
        “’ 
        Security 
        ’ means:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) the protection of, and the people of, the Commonwealth and the several states and territories from:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) espionage; 
           
          (ii) sabotage; 
           
          (iii) politically motivated violence; 
           
          (iv) promotion of communal violence; 
           
          (v) attacks on Australia's defence system; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) the carrying out of Australia's responsibilities for any foreign country in relation to a matter relating to any of the subparagraphs of paragraph (a).” 
        
       
      
    12 The Crown, in that context, drew attention to the definition in the same section of ""Politically motivated violence"". This is defined to mean ""acts that are terrorism offences"". In turn, terrorism offences are defined to include an offence against part 5.3 of the Criminal Code (the present proceedings relate to an alleged conspiracy that involves in its implementation an offence against s 101.6 of the Criminal Code, being an offence within part 5.3 of the Code). 
     
      
    13 Against this statutory background, the Crown submitted that s 18 of the ASIO Act, in its own terms, clearly contemplated that in certain circumstances intelligence might be communicated by a person with the requisite authorisation of, or the approval of the Director-General. The Crown argued that provisions of this kind are to be broadly construed. This is especially so in relation to s 18 of the Act (Church of Scientology v Woodward (1982) 154 CLR 25). Particular reliance was placed upon a passage in the judgment of Gibbs CJ at 53 where his Honour had observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Obviously subs 18(2) does not prevent the Director-General or an officer authorised by him from making a communication of whatever information the Director-General authorises to be communicated.” 
        
       
      
    14 The Crown also submitted that the interpretation suggested by Mr Lange was one, which would render the legislation ""absurd and unworkable"" (Church of Scientology v Woodward at 51 per Gibbs CJ). 
     
      
    15 In relation to Mr Lange's alternative submission, the Crown argued that the approval of the Director-General to the calling of the ASIO evidence was to be inferred from a number of matters. The first of these was that the Director-General has, since the commencement of the proceedings on 25 February 2008, been represented in this trial all times by a solicitor and/or counsel. It was suggested that the appropriate inference to be drawn from that fact is that the Director-General authorises and consents to the relevant witnesses giving such evidence as may be required, subject to any claims for public interest immunity which might arise in the course of their doing so.  
     
      
    16 Secondly, the Crown drew attention to the contents of a document Exhibit “A”. This document was tendered as a “confidential” document, but, in any event, there is no need to detail it in this decision. The Crown argued that the contents of the document enabled the Court to draw an inference that the Director-General had approved, in effect, the procedure sought to be adopted by the Crown in the trial, so far as it related to ASIO officers.  
     
      
    17 During argument I expressed some misgivings about this manner of demonstrating the approval of the Director-General. I did so because it seemed to me that, were an individual ASIO officer to place himself in a possible position of committing a serious criminal offence by giving evidence, the question of approval should not be left to mere inference but should be a matter demonstrated plainly and conclusively. 
     
      
    18 In the light of those comments, senior counsel for the Crown later sought the Court's leave to tender a further document. That document has been admitted for the purposes of this application as Exhibit “B”.  
     
      
    19 The document reads as follows: - 
     
      
       
      “ 
      AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION ACT 1979 
       
       AUTHIORITY TO COMMUNICATE INFORMATION 
       
       
      Pursuant to section 18 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, I, Paul O’Sullivan, Director-General of Security, noting that with my authority: 
       
       
        
        (a) statements of persons known for the purposes of the proceeding by the names given in the attached list (initialled by me), being officers or employees or former officers or employees of the Organisation, have been prepared and served on the parties in the matter of R v Cheikho and Ors; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) some of those persons have given evidence in the committal proceedings in the matters 
        
       
       
      hereby authorise those persons to give written and/or oral evidence in the proceedings, including evidence relating to intelligence, information or matters that have come to their knowledge by reason of them being officers or employees of the Organisation”. 
       
      
    20 The document is signed by Mr Paul O’Sullivan, Director-General of Security and is dated 5 June 2008. Attached to the document is a list of 55 “names”. 
     
      
    21 The Crown submitted that the Court can be readily satisfied that the Director has given his approval, within the meaning of s 18(2)(b), to the giving of evidence in these proceedings by each of the proposed ASIO witnesses.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    22 Although Mr Lange's argument raised the broader question of whether an ASIO officer could ever legitimately give evidence in any proceedings, the narrower and more precise question I am concerned with is whether the proposal to call ASIO officers in this trial to give evidence concerning their surveillance of the accused will involve a criminal offence under s 18(2) of the ASIO Act. If the answer to that question is in the negative, no question of abuse of process can arise and the present application must fail. The abuse of process argument is aimed directly at the present trial. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion, the answer to the question posed by Mr Lange is that, provided the giving of evidence is approved by the Director-General of Security, the communication of the information represented by the giving of that evidence would not amount to or involve any criminal offence under s 18(2) of the ASIO Act.  
     
      
    24 In my opinion, s 18, on its proper interpretation, would permit ASIO officers, with the approval of the Director-General, to give evidence of surveillance of the accused in a prosecution of the accused for an offence of the kind charged in the present indictment. I shall state my reasons.  
     
      
    25 First, s 18 does not prohibit communication of intelligence on behalf of ASIO. In fact, it permits it, but only where that communication is made by the Director-General or by a person acting within the limits of authority conferred on the person by the Director-General.  
     
      
    26 Secondly, the more precise question involves the interpretation of s 18(2) of the ASIO Act. This plainly establishes an offence where an employee of ASIO makes a communication of any information that has come to the knowledge or into his or her possession by reason of his or her being, or having been, an officer or employee of ASIO. No crime will be committed, however, where the communication is made by a person acting within the limits of authority conferred on the person by the Director-General, or where the communication is made with the approval of the Director-General.  
     
      
    27 Thirdly, it is clear that, in the present matter, the giving of approval for an ASIO officer to give evidence about surveillance of the accused (or other persons connected with the conspiracy) may properly be said to be for a purpose ""relevant to security"". In this regard, I consider that the Crown's submissions are correct. The statutory framework I have earlier set out makes it clear that the giving of surveillance evidence in the present matter would not be a matter that falls outside the scope of the statutory functions in s 17, especially those mentioned in 17(1)(a) and (b). More precisely, it may be stated, first, that the giving of evidence would not be a criminal offence under s 18(2) because it had been approved; and secondly, it would not be beyond the scope of the statutory functions because the statutory definitions in s 4 clearly enable it to be categorised it as a task ""for purposes relevant to security"". In other words, once a broad construction is given to the sections under consideration, a prosecution for a terrorism offence, and the process of giving of evidence within that trial, will be seen to be a proceeding relevant to the protection of the community from the implementation of an agreement that would, by its very nature, involve acts of violence, and would, in any event, answer the description of a terrorism offence in the ASIO Act.  
     
      
    28 Fourthly, this construction of both s 17(1)(a) and (b) and s 18(1) and (2) of the ASIO Act is further aided by ss 8, 18(3), 19 and 20 of the Act.  
     
      
    29 Section 8 confirms the broad powers of the Director-General to act as the controlling figure of ASIO. Section 20 confers a wide ambit of authority on the Director-General (""take all reasonable steps"") to ensure the Organisation operates within the confines of its statutory functions and is not diverted or distracted into partisan or political paths. Section 18(2), as I have said, gives the Director-General a broad power to approve the communication by employees of intelligence information in circumstances, no doubt, deemed by him to be appropriate. Section 17 ascribes, as a core ASIO function, the ability to communicate intelligence for purposes that are both relevant and appropriate to the broadly defined notion of ""security"". 
     
      
    30 Indeed, s 18(3) travels well beyond the concept of “security” to enable the communication by employees of intelligence on an even broader basis: for example, where the intelligence reveals the commission by a person of any indictable offence against the laws of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory. Section 18(3)(b) enables the dissemination within Australia of information captured outside Australia, where the Director-General is satisfied that the ""national interest"" requires the communication (there could hardly be a wider concept than this). Finally, s 19 provides that, so far as is necessary or conducive to the performance of its functions, ASIO may cooperate with, for example, nominated police agencies and the like, both in Australia and overseas. It may also communicate information to an overseas authority where such information is ""relevant to the security of that country"".  
     
      
    31 Consequently, it will be seen that the statute gives very substantial powers to the Director-General, and hence to the Organisation, to communicate intelligence to individual persons, bodies, other countries and generally. For that reason, it seems to me to be fanciful to suggest that, where ASIO has been acting in cooperation with police agencies to provide surveillance of terrorist suspects, the calling of those ASIO officers with the approval of the Director-General, in a subsequent prosecution for a terrorism-related offence, will or could involve the commission of a crime. Such a consequence would be completely unexpected, at variance with the terms of the legislation and, in terms of the principles of statutory construction, an absurd result. Indeed, one would expect the legislature to cater for the very situation that is envisaged and intended in the present trial. In my opinion, the legislation plainly allows for that result and any contrary interpretation is, with respect, misconceived.  
     
      
    32 Mr Lange advanced four specific reasons in support of his suggested interpretation of the legislation. I will deal with these briefly.  
     
      
    33 The first related to s 18(3)(a) of the ASIO Act. Mr Lange placed particular reliance on the opening words of the sub-section. These were ""Notwithstanding paragraph 17(1)(b)"". Mr Lange submitted that this phrase was inserted because the provision of information for reasons of investigation for prosecution was not covered by the language of s 17(1)(b). I am unable to agree with this submission. The phrase appears where it does in s 18(3) because the clear intention of the legislature was to allow the communication of information where the offence revealed by the intelligence related to the commission (or intended commission) of any indictable offence in the relevant criminal legislation, even if it were not a ""security"" related offence. Similarly, Mr Lange argued that the language of s 18(3)(b) was restrictive. I would, however, regard the concept in this sub-section as very broad indeed, namely, the concept of ""national interest"".  
     
      
    34 Secondly, Mr Lange argued that there is in fact no provision in the legislation expressly permitting the giving of evidence by ASIO employees in a trial of the present kind, or, for that matter, in any trial. One answer to that proposition is that there is no provision in the legislation expressly prohibiting it. Moreover, for the reasons I have explained, there is, in any event, ample scope within the legislation for a finding that the Director-General's powers of approval extend to allow the giving by ASIO officers of evidence in a trial such as the present. 
     
      
    35 Thirdly, Mr Lange argued that ASIO is essentially an intelligence gathering body and is not normally regarded as being involved in investigative matters. In general, I accept that this is an accurate description of the functions of ASIO. However, the power, and perhaps obligation, to cooperate with other authorities (as evidenced by ss 18 and 19) has meant that ASIO on occasions has provided its intelligence gathering services within the umbrella of an investigative process. Such a level of co-operation is likely to increase rather than to lessen. This can have awkward results for the agency, as I found in the Lodhi trial. That is, however, not to the point in the present discussion. In this trial, ASIO witnesses would simply be called to give evidence of surveillance. That might properly be described as intelligence gathering within the umbrella of a criminal investigation by the police.  
     
      
    36 Whatever label is ascribed to the ASIO task, the question is whether the giving of evidence by an ASIO officer about matters he has observed in the course of carrying out an intelligence gathering exercise would fall outside the scope of the statutory functions of ASIO? In my opinion, for the reasons I have already given, it would not. A prosecution for a terrorism offence must be, as I have said, a proceeding that is itself relevant to the protection of the Australian community from the implementation of an alleged agreement that would or might involve acts of violence against the community. If that be so, the giving of evidence in such a trial must be regarded as an activity carried out ""for purposes relevant to security"". In that sense, it is very much within the scope of ASIO's statutory functions. 
     
      
    37 Finally, Mr Lange argued that, since s 8 of the ASIO Act envisages that the Director-General will control the activities of the Organisation, it would be a matter for concern if ASIO witnesses were to be cross-examined about matters that might unexpectedly and perhaps inadvertently throw up important issues of national security. The Director-General, counsel argued, would have no control over this situation. There are a number of answers to this submission. First, the Director-General has the power and discretion to decide whether a particular ASIO officer will give evidence in a prosecution. The Director-General has the capacity to reflect upon the identity of the witness, the nature of the evidence to be given and the likely ambit of relevant cross-examination. I stress the word ""relevant"" because the duty of a Court would be to stop in its tracks cross-examination that passed beyond the permissible to the irrelevant. The first point of control, however, is the Director-General's decision itself.  
     
      
    38 The second point of control is the important obligation placed on counsel not to ask questions that are scandalous, embarrassing, confusing, time wasting or off the point. In a trial where national security issues are clearly involved, counsel would be expected to be particularly focused and diligent in this regard. 
     
      
    39 The third point of control is the Court itself, which would, with stern but polite detachment, prevent any of these boundaries from being improperly transgressed.  
     
      
    40 The fourth area of control lies in the continued presence of solicitor and counsel for the Commonwealth. The Attorney General, by virtue of the National Security Information legislation, is taken to be a party to the proceedings. In that context, there are already in force, by agreement, a raft of security related orders arising from the operation of the security protection legislation. The lawyers for the Commonwealth are there to ensure those orders are obeyed. 
     
      
    41 Finally, there are the provisions of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 itself. This legislation includes provisions such as s 25. This section prevents a witness from disclosing national security information in federal criminal proceedings by not allowing the witness to answer “the question” until a national security hearing has been held, or a certificate has been issued by the Attorney General. This is but one example of the way in which the legislation protects the inadvertent or careless disclosure of national security information. There are many other instances in the legislation, but they do not require detailed examination on the hearing of the present application.  
     
      
    42 The presence and combination of all of these control points, if I may so describe them, seem to me to rob Mr Lange's final point of any real substance or significance. 
     
      
    43 The remaining matter to be determined is whether the Court can be satisfied that the Director-General has given his approval to the procedure that the Crown intends to adopt in the present trial. Has the Director-General given approval for each of the witnesses to give evidence of the surveillance and other matters intended to be relied upon as part of the prosecution case?  
     
      
    44 The answer to that question, given the contents of Exhibit “B”, is plainly in the affirmative. In those circumstances, the asserted foundation of Mr Lange’s argument cannot stand. Consequently, the application for a stay of proceedings must fail. No abuse of process has been demonstrated. I order that the application for a stay of proceedings be dismissed.

      15516/07 MICHAEL AHIO v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) & ANOR 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
       
      Introduction 
       
      
    1 On 21 March 2007 the plaintiff was found guilty by the second defendant in the Downing Centre Local Court of the offence of assault, contrary to the Crimes Act, 1900, s 61, and of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, contrary to the Crimes Act, 1900, s 35(1)(b). 
     
      
    2 On 8 May 2007 the second defendant sentenced the plaintiff by placing him on a good behaviour bond for a term of 12 months pursuant to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, 1999, s 9, in respect of the first offence and placing him on a good behaviour bond for a term of two years, pursuant to s 9, in respect of the second offence. Her Honour also imposed a fine of $800 in respect of the second offence. 
     
      
    3 The circumstances giving rise to the offences may be shortly stated as follows: the plaintiff was a licensed security guard employed by a hotel in the Manly area. On 29 August 2004 he was driving his employer’s courtesy van when it apparently “nudged” two pedestrians as it drove slowly along a part pedestrian/driveway area. The plaintiff alighted from the van. He commenced to punch the male pedestrian a number of times about the head, causing him to sustain a black eye and fall to the ground, twisting and fracturing his right ankle as he did so. The second pedestrian, the first pedestrian’s wife, became involved and was pushed by the plaintiff. The plaintiff struck the male pedestrian because of his mistaken belief that the male pedestrian had deliberately kicked the van and damaged it. In fact, the male pedestrian had struck the van with his hand and the van had sustained no damage. The first offence related to the female pedestrian, the second to the male pedestrian. 
     
      
    4 The plaintiff, by summons filed in this court on 31 October 2007, sought to appeal (or obtain leave to appeal) against conviction and sentence in respect of each offence pursuant to the provisions of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, 2001 (“the Appeal Act”), Pt 5, Div 1. The summons also sought orders under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act, 1970 but these orders were not pursued at the hearing. Incidental orders as to the extension of time were also sought in the summons. 
     
      
    5 On 4 March 2008 the plaintiff filed an amended summons limiting the appeal to the sentence for the second offence. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    6 The plaintiff was aged 42 at the time of the offences. He had no prior convictions and produced favourable character references. He apparently worked two jobs, one as a storeman and the other as a security guard in the evenings. In respect of the latter employment, the plaintiff required a licence under the Security Industry Act, 1997 (“SIA”). 
     
      
    7 Under the SIA, the Commissioner of Police is required, by s 26(1A), to: 
     
      
       
        
        “…revoke a licence where the Commissioner is satisfied that, if the licensee were applying for a new licence, the application would be required by this Act to be refused.” 
        
       
      
    8 In accordance with s 16(1)(a) of the SIA, the Commissioner must refuse to grant an application for a licence if the Commissioner is satisfied that the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        “has, within the period of 10 years before the application for the licence was made, been convicted in New South Wales or elsewhere of an offence prescribed by the regulations in relation to the class of licence sought, whether or not the offence is an offence under New South Wales law, or…” 
        
       
      
    9 Clause 11(c)(i) of the Security Industry Regulation 1998 (as then enacted) provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purposes of section 16(1)(a) and (b) of the Act, the following offences are prescribed offences regardless of whether they are committed in New South Wales: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Offences involving assault 
        
       
       
        
        An offender under the law of any Australian or overseas jurisdiction involving assault of any description, being: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) an offence in respect of which the penalty imposed was imprisonment, or a fine of $200 or more, or both, or…” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 As a result of the foregoing provisions, the plaintiff’s security licence was automatically revoked on 5 October 2007. It is alleged that as a result of the revocation of the licence he has and will suffer a loss of his income as a security guard in the order of $50,000 gross per annum. 
     
      
    11 I note the Commissioner may revoke a licence if he considers it is not in the public interest of the person to whom it is granted to continue to hold it (s 26(1)(d) of the SIA, cl 18 of the 1998 Security Industry Regulation). 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    12 The grounds of appeal in the amended summons are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. …[The second defendant] failed to properly take into account the plaintiff’s consequential loss of employment as a licence holder under the  
        Security Industry Act 
        , 1997 which arose under that Act by operation of law as a result of the particular sentence imposed by the court. 
        
       
       
        
        2. [The second defendant] failed to properly appreciate, and therefore failed to properly take into account, all sentencing options available to the court and their respective consequences for the plaintiff. 
        
       
       
        
        3. [The second defendant] erred in law in the sentencing of the plaintiff for the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm on 8 May 2007 in that her Honour’s sentencing discretion miscarried.” 
        
       
      
    13 The argument of counsel for the plaintiff involved a number of steps which may be summarised as follows. 
     
      
    14 A sentencing court may take extra-curial punishment into account on sentence. 
     
      
    15 In R v Daetz (2003) 139 A Crim R 398 at [62] the Court of Criminal Appeal held: 
     
      
       
        
        “In sentencing the offender the court takes into account what extra-curial punishment the offender has suffered, because the court is required to take into account all material facts and is required to ensure that the punishment the offender receives is what in all the circumstances is an appropriate punishment and not an excessive punishment. How much weight a sentencing judge should give any extra-curial punishment will, of course, depend on all the circumstances of the case. Indeed, there may well be many cases where extra-judicial punishment attracts little or no significant weight.” 
        
       
      
    16 In the Application by the Attorney General under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (2004) 61 NSWLR 305 Howie J, with whom the other members of the court agreed, said: 
     
      
       
      (a) “Generally, when sentencing for a criminal offence, a court is entitled to consider all the consequences to the offender arising from the commission of that offence in determining what penalty to impose. Extra curial punishments are routinely taken into account by sentencing courts and it would be unjust to do otherwise”; 
       
       
      (b) “Similarly, the fact that a particular sentence would have the consequence that the offender would lose his employment has been taken into account in allowing an appeal and substituting a different sentence”; 
       
       
      (c) “[A] court can have regard to prospective penalties, those that will arise as a result of a conviction or a particular sentence, when determining what punishment should be imposed on the particular offender before the court”; 
       
       
      (d) “Licence disqualification is such a significant matter and can have such a devastating effect upon a person’s ability to derive income and to function appropriately within the community that it is a matter which, in my view, must be taken into account by a court when determining what the consequences should be, both penal and otherwise, for a particular offence committed by a particular offender”; 
       
       
      (e) “[117] 
        
      This is not to say that the sentencing discretion should be controlled by one particular factor alone, such as the offender's need for a licence or the consequences to that offender of being disqualified for a significant period. Nor can the court in fixing the sentence disregard the clear intention of the Parliament as to the effect that the commission of an offence is to have upon the offender's right or privilege to drive a motor vehicle on public streets.” 
       
      
    17 The plaintiff’s legal representative at the sentencing hearing informed her Honour that  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “As a result of this conviction, of course, he can no longer get a security licence, so that part of his income which is attributed to security work that he has been involved in for eight years, since 1999, has ceased.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 The representation was erroneous. A conviction for such an offence did not automatically result in the revocation of the security licence. The automatic disqualification depended entirely on whether the penalty imposed was imprisonment or a fine of $200 or more or both (see [7], [8] and [9] above). 
     
      
    19 Division 1 of Pt 5 of the Appeal Act permits an appeal as of right where the ground involves a question of law only (s 52(1)) and an appeal where the ground involves a question of fact or a question of mixed law and fact, but only by leave of this court (s 53(1)).  
     
      
    20 It should be inferred her Honour proceeded to sentence on the basis the representation that at law a conviction alone would result in an automatic revocation of the plaintiff’s licence was correct. In consequence it should be inferred her Honour failed to consider whether the sentence should be structured in such a manner as to adequately punish the plaintiff but avoid automatic revocation of the security licence. Thus error of law occurred in that her Honour failed to take into account a relevant matter and acted upon a wrong principle. 
     
      
    21 The sentencing discretion should be re-exercised by taking into account the effect of the sentence to be imposed on his security licence and the sentence so structured as to ensure the automatic revocation provisions were not attracted. 
     
      
    22 Sections 52(2) and s 53(4) of the Appeal Act provide that the appeal or application for leave to appeal must be made within such period after the date of the conviction or sentence as may be prescribed by rules of Court. The Supreme Court Rules provide that the appeal or application for leave to appeal is to be made within 28 days of the material date, being the date on which the decision from which the appeal or application for leave to appeal is brought is announced or given (Supreme Court Rules Pt 51B, rr 5 and 6). In either case this court may at any time extend the time fixed. 
     
      
    23 The merits of the appeal were such that if leave to appeal was required it should be granted as should an extension of time. Although there was no evidence from the plaintiff which explained the delay in lodging the appeal or application for leave to appeal, it was apparent that the plaintiff had filed the summons promptly upon being notified of the revocation of the licence and the merits were such that an extension of time should be granted. 
     
      
    24 Counsel for the first defendant (the second defendant having filed a submitting appearance) stressed that her Honour had concluded this was “quite a serious offence”. She had approached the matter on the basis that the plaintiff would suffer an extra curial financial loss and that a bond was being sought. She imposed a penalty after due consideration of the circumstances and sentencing statistics. It was submitted, relying particularly upon the judgment of Howie J in Application by the Attorney General under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act at [117] (quoted above [15(e)]) that “one shouldn’t be structuring a sentence to avoid one or other result of what would ordinarily be the court’s decision as to sentencing.” 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    25 The Supreme Court has power under the Appeal Act to set aside the sentence, vary the sentence, set aside the sentence and remit it to the original Local Court or to dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion, the plaintiff was entitled to have taken into account on sentence the correct situation as to the automatic revocation of his security licence. I would infer her Honour was misled as to the correct situation by the comments by the plaintiff’s legal representative and as a result she did not accurately direct herself on this question, acted upon a mistake as to the law and as a result failed to take into account a material consideration. 
     
      
    27 The plaintiff requires an extension of time to appeal or to seek leave to appeal. The first defendant’s counsel indicated that the attitude of the first defendant was that an extension of time should be granted and leave should be granted in the event the Court considered there was merit in the substance of the appeal. In my opinion, the merits are such that it is appropriate to grant an extension of time and leave to appeal insofar as the latter is required. 
     
      
    28 It does not follow however that this is a matter where necessarily the sentence should be structured in such a way as to avoid the application of the automatic revocation provisions or that the original sentence cannot stand. What is required is that appropriate matters for consideration in the exercise of the sentencing discretion are taken into account. 
     
      
    29 The legal representatives for the plaintiff have endeavoured, unsuccessfully, to obtain copies of the Probation and Parole Service report and two testimonials tendered to the second defendant. In all of the circumstances, particularly as the second defendant has read those documents and has had the advantage of seeing and hearing the plaintiff give evidence, I consider that the appropriate course is to remit the matter to the second defendant for reconsideration of sentence. 
     
      
    30 Accordingly, I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. The time in which to appeal or seek leave to appeal is extended to 4.00 pm on 4 March 2008. 
       
       
      2. Leave is granted pursuant to s 53(1) of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
      , 2001 to appeal to this court against sentence on grounds that involve a question of mixed law and fact. 
       
       
      3. Set aside the sentence in respect of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and remit the matter to the Downing Centre Local Court for redetermination of sentence, if possible by the second defendant, in accordance with the directions of this Court. 
       
       
      4. Each party to bear his or her costs of this appeal.

   JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: Application to dismiss charge1. Songsangkong Chanthasaeng is charged with two counts of supply prohibited drug, namely 30.2 grams of methylamphetamine and 7 grams of heroin. He is also charged in the alternative with being knowingly concerned with the supply of each drug. 2. The offences are said to have occurred on 27 July 2007. He was arrested in respect of these charges on 27 July 2007 and has been in remand custody since that date. When he was presented for arraignment the Court was informed that there was a question as to his unfitness to be tried. However, before that issue was determined I was invited, pursuant to s 10(4) Mental Health (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1990, to determine not to conduct an inquiry, dismiss the charge, and order his release. 3. The facts alleged by the Crown are these; police were patrolling south on Pennant Hills Road, Normanhurst at about 2.50am of 27 July. They were close to an intersection at Dartford Road. They observed an Hyundai Xcel parked in a carpark attached to Kenley Park, on Kenley Road, Normanhurst. As police drove past, the vehicle was seen to reverse quickly from the carpark, drive off in a northerly direction along Pennant Hills Road. Police became suspicious because that area is known to them for drug related offences. In observing the car they saw that there were two people in the car. The passenger was seen to look towards the police and move the back of his seat down so that he was lying down. Police facts allege that that was consistent with him trying to hide from them. It seems to me that jury may so find. Police turned and activated warning devices attempting to pull the vehicle over. At that time they were close behind the vehicle, and, as one can imagine, at ten to three in the morning there were no other vehicles on the road. The driver continued to drive slowly and accelerating erratically. Ultimately the vehicle came to a stop near the intersection of Pennant Hills and Buckingham Roads, Normanhurst. Police received some information via their computer and radio system. They approached the driver and spoke to him. At this time the accused, Mr Chanthasaeng, was lying on the passenger seat with it as flat as one can make it, not looking at the police. His hands were fidgeting, police say he was gaunt in appearance, and appeared to be nervous. 4. The driver’s account to police was that they were waiting at the park to meet a friend but he was unable to give any further information about the address or name of the friend, or any directions on how to reach the street. Police then turned their attention to the passenger door of the vehicle. They noticed material in the car, particularly a cut cigarette package, consistent with equipment or being used for snorting illicit drugs. When Police spoke to the accused as to why he was there, his initial answer was that they were just going for a drive, that he was feeling depressed and wanted to go for a drive. Later he gave yet another account. There was a concession given to the police that he had previously been arrested on drug related matters, a fact not likely to go to the jury but nonetheless in these proceedings is not a matter that I need to pay much attention to. 5. He was asked numerous times whether there were any drugs or syringes in the vehicle. He said, “no, not that he could remember, but that friends had used the car and he could not be sure”. He did not know whether there were drugs in the car. 6. He was asked if he was currently using drugs and he said that he used to do heroin and that he used to snort it. They conducted a personal search of him. There is no suggestion it was unlawful. Located in his bum-bag was a small aluminium foil and an aluminium tin with marihuana leaves printed on it. They examined again the cut cardboard cigarette box on the floor and came to a view that it could be used to snort drugs. 7. The accused offered that he was the owner of the vehicle and they commenced a search of the vehicle. They saw two cylindrical pieces of cardboard made from cigarette packaging and the accused conceded that those were used for snorting heroin. There was a small bottle, which police recognised as a consequence of their previous work that it was an intravenous drug use. Upon completing the search of the interior of the vehicle, they removed keys and used those keys to open the fuel cap compartment door. Located within that fuel cap area was a large resealable plastic bag folded a number of times and fitted above the fuel cap. Both this accused and the driver were questioned in respect of the resealable bags. 8. The accused indicated that it contained one ounce of ICE, and 7 grams of heroin. Both men were arrested and informed of the reason for their arrest. 9. They were asked a number of questions. The accused told police that the items that had been seized were drugs. The accused agreed to take part in an interview which was electronically recorded. He told police he owned the drugs and that they were secreted in the fuel cap area of the car. He then said that he was conveying the drugs to the Newcastle area for a drug syndicate in the Cabramatta area who, he believed, would harm him if he did not convey the drugs. 10. That would be of course the third account that police had of what the vehicle was doing when it was arrested - at least it was capable of being construed that way. He claimed that he was to be contacted by a syndicate when on the F3 freeway, and would receive instructions of where to drop off the drugs. He was unable to name, or would not name, identify or supply any contact detail for the persons. 11. The drugs were subsequently analysed. One is commonly known as ICE, and was weighed at 32.4 grams. The foil containing what was believed to be heroin was weighed and found to be 9 grams. He was then charged with the charges currently before me. 12. It is unclear on these facts whether the accused’s companion has been charged or not. I have assumed for the purposes of these matters that he has not been charged. Given that the accused readily identified the quantity and identity of the drugs concealed, I am prepared to deal with this application that the Crown could have proved on the limited evidence available, that the accused was intending to supply some or all of those drugs in his possession in the Kenley Park carpark. The quantity of heroin captured by the police amounted to 7 grams when weighed without the foil, that is two times the trafficable quantity. The amount of methylamphetamine captured amounted to ten times the trafficable quantity, and five times the indictable quantity. The significance of that finding is that both drugs were of a sufficient quantity to be supplied to somebody who himself or herself could have been an on supplier. Indeed, if one thinks about the deeming provision it would have been the responsibility of the person being supplied with all of those drugs, to establish the contrary. That is particularly so in respect of the methylamphetamine. 13. For the purposes of this application I am prepared to accept the street value of the drug was approximately $16,000. What flows from this is that it would be difficult to resist an inference that the accused was supplying for financial gain even if he was also supplying to feed his own addiction. 14. Although the antecedents have not been tendered, I am prepared for the purposes of the application to assume the accused had the drugs in his possession for supply in circumstances when he was then on a charge of supply prohibited drugs that was making its way through the Local Courts and that he was on bail in respect of that charge when this conduct was uncovered. I have accepted for the purposes of the application that the accused has other encounters with police in respect of drug related offences. But what I do not have, and have not assumed, is that he has other encounters with the courts for the same matters. 15. I have accepted a Magistrate of the Local Court regarded these charges, as sufficiently serious as to refuse formally, or perhaps by consent, the grant of bail. 16. Section 10(4) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 provides that  
     
      
      ”The Court may determine not to conduct an inquiry as to the unfitness of an accused in circumstances where it would be inappropriate to inflict any punishment, having regard to the trivial nature of the charge or offence, the nature of the person’s disability, or any other matter the Court thinks proper to consider. Where a Court determines not to conduct an inquiry it may dismiss the charge and order the accused person to be released.”  
      
     17. While the defence urged this is a proper case for such a determination and such orders, the Crown opposes that application. While certainly not determinative of the issue, the JIRS statistics for supply prohibited drug (amphetamines) less than the commercial quantity, for the higher courts provides a broad overview of penalty types for 770 cases. None of those cases received a s 10 dismissal, three received a s 10 bond, none received a s 10A conviction only, none of the cases received a sentence to the rising of the Court, only two were subject to a fine only, and eighteen were given a s 9 bond. Thus, less than three per cent received a sentence disposition less than a s 9 bond with supervision. 18. I accept that a s 10 discharge whether conditional upon entering a bond or outright, can be given in circumstances where the appropriate sentencing range can extend into monetary penalties, perhaps even community service orders and beyond. 19. Section 10(4) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act was the subject of close examination as to its purpose, scope and proper interpretation, in a recent Court of Criminal Appeal case , Newman v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 103. The leading judgment was given by Chief Justice Spigelman, with Justices Bell and Price agreeing. His Honour said:  
     
      
      “ 
      34 
      …The purpose of the [ 
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
      ] is not in my opinion to provide “specific and flexible procedures for the disposal of offences committed by persons who have a cognitive or mental disability. The appellant's reference to the “diversionary/disability” purposes of the legislative scheme, is also in my opinion incorrect. Similarly it is not correct to infer that a focus “on disability” as distinct from a “focus on guilt” is required. I am unable to detect any such purposes in the legislative scheme. Finally the appellant’s contention that the discretion is “broad” is likely to lead to error. The section confers a judicial discretion for specific purposes.  
       
        
       
      35 
      . The relevant part of the Act is concerned to establish a regime for the determination of criminal guilt or innocence in circumstances where normal criminal procedures could not apply by reason of the mental condition of an accused at the time of trial. It is incorrect to describe procedures as “diversionary” or as “flexible”. They are alternative procedures designed to ensure that justice is done, having in mind the possibility of a person’s unfitness to be tried. Justice must, however, be done not only to the accused but to the victim, bearing in mind the public interest in resolving allegations of criminal conduct.  
       
        
       
      36 
      . Section 10(4) is expressly directed to the appropriateness of the infliction of punishment. A judgment that punishment would be “inappropriate” leads to the result that the inquiry called for would not occur and the charge will be dismissed. Significant weight is to be attached to this consequence. A person charged with the crime will never be tried.

       Section 10(4) is expressly directed to the appropriateness of the infliction of punishment. A judgment that punishment would be “inappropriate” leads to the result that the inquiry called for would not occur and the charge will be dismissed. Significant weight is to be attached to this consequence. A person charged with the crime will never be tried.  
       
        
       
      37. 
       The use of the word “punishment” indicates, in my opinion, that what the parliament had in mind was an end result in which the person accused was in fact convicted, either expressly, or by special hearing, of the relevant offence. The section is not, in my opinion concerned with the possibility of a finding of not guilty, whether simplicita, or on the grounds of mental illness at the time of the offence. Nevertheless the result of the process is that the proceedings are dismissed without trial.  
       
        
       
      38 
      . I do not share any of the difficulties of interpretation identified by Maher JA in  
      DPP v Mills 
       [2000] NSWCCA 326….The two circumstances in which an issue of “punishment” arises can only be either as a result of conviction after normal trial, where the person has been found fit to plead, or as a result of a finding of guilty of the offence “on limited evidence available”, following a special hearing within the meaning of s 22(1). The latter finding is identified in s 22(3) as a qualified finding of guilt. Upon such a finding a Court can determine under s 23 a limiting term of imprisonment or some other penalty or make any other order which the Court could have made “on conviction ...in a normal trial of criminal proceedings.”  
       
        
       
      39 
      . In my opinion s 10(4) has in mind both situations. i.e. where a person is found fit to plead and is convicted and where the qualified hearing of guilt is made after a special hearing. The principal purpose of the subsection is to avoid the unnecessary delays, cost and complications of the special procedure which arises only in a case where an issue of unfitness to plead has arisen at or about the time of trial and which operates irrespective of whether or not any mental illness was pertinent at the time of the commission of the offence.  
       
        
       
      40 
      . The principal purpose of the fitness hearing is to facilitate the administration of criminal justice. The administration of criminal justice would be enhanced in any manner whether from the point of view of an accused or from that of a victim, or from the point of view of the public interest, if the considerable added expense and delay of a fitness hearing is to be undertaken in circumstances where the Court would, in any event, not inflict any punishment.  
       
        
       
      41 
      . The reference to “any punishment” in s 10(4) would in my opinion extend to the recording of a conviction which of itself without any additional penalty, has effects, such as the consequent effects on the prospects of employment, loss of licenses, or a range of statutory consequences and possibly public opprobrium…In my opinion the recording of a conviction is itself a “punishment” within s 10(4) of the Act. In any event it is well established that the orders of the Court after a special hearing constitute punishment…  
       
        
       
      42 
      . The formulation in s 10(4) is analogous to the long-standing formulation which permits a Court to dismiss a charge without recording a conviction, even where the charge is proved. This provision is now found in s 10 of the Crime  
      Sentencing Procedure Act 
       1999. At the time s 10(4) of the Act was first enacted in 1983 as s 428F(5) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900, the relevant section was 556A of the  
      Crimes Act 
       . 
      43. Section 556A relevantly state;  
       
        
        “556A, where…the Court thinks the charge is proved but is of opinion that having regard to the character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the person charged, or to the trivial nature of the offence, or to the extenuating circumstances under which the offence was committed it is expedient to inflict any punishment…the Court may without proceeding to conviction, make an order…dismissing the charge.”  
        
       
      44 
      . The basic structure of s 10(4) and 556A is the same. In each case, relevantly the ultimate power of the Court is to dismiss the charge that has been or may be proven. The respective tests are equivalent. Further “inexpedient”, is replaced by what may appear to be a more apposite terminology in the context of mental disability i.e. “inappropriate”.The list of matters to which regard may be had overlaps considerably although the list in 556A has been shortened and a general but not unrestricted provision relating to “any other matter” inserted.  
       
        
       
      45 
      . Nevertheless in my opinion, the general approach adopted by s 556A and now s 10 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       is the correct general approach to adopt for the purposes of s 10(4) of the Act. The task is to be conducted in anticipation of a finding of guilt by either of the two courses which can now flow from a fitness hearing - i.e., a normal criminal trial or a special hearing (citation and references omitted.)  
      46. “Section 10(4) requires the court to approach an application on the assumption of a finding of guilt, including a finding of qualified guilt and then to apply a similar range of considerations as now arise under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. It permits the court to dismiss a charge without proceeding to a fitness hearing on the assumption there would be a finding of guilt if the matter did proceed to either a trial or special hearing. Where the court would not impose any punishment, including the element of punishment implicit in a conviction, then the proceedings should be dismissed in limine without the need for a fitness hearing.”  
      
    20. Thus Newmanstands for the proposition that s 10(4) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act is analogous to situations where a court is permitted to dismiss a charge and dismiss an offender without recording a conviction. Section 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and s 556A of the Crimes Act were given as examples. It may be convenient for the exercise of my discretion to have regard to the criteria in the now repealed s 556A for consideration of circumstances in which it is inappropriate to inflict any punishment. That is, having regard to character, antecedents, age, health or mental condition of the person charged or to the trivial nation of the offence, or to extenuating circumstances. 21. I should also note the Chief Justice’s opinion that a conviction without more (see s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) amounted to punishment. 22. The defence in this case concede the offence is not trivial. Indeed, there is authority that trafficking in prohibited drugs for financial gain, but for extraordinary circumstances, in a normal criminal trial result in imprisonment upon conviction (It should be noted that I am assuming guilt as required by Newman, rather than making a finding of fact, when I use the term “offence”). Given the quantity of drugs, in a normal criminal trial, a failure to imprison this accused may well be regarded as an appealable error. There is nothing in the evidence upon which I have been invited to make this determination that suggests there are any extenuating circumstances under which the offence was committed. 23. There is little I know of the character and antecedents of the accused. On the evidence before me he was on bail in respect of a charge of supplying prohibited drug. He has other dealings with police in respect of drugs. He has been sentenced to eight months imprisonment in respect of domestic violence offences. 24. He was, at the time of his arrest, a full-time student, although those studies have no doubt been interrupted by his being in remand custody. He was born in Thailand, came to Australia at the age of two. He achieved Year 11 in High School at the age of 17, but was expelled from school because of fighting. He is the eldest child in a family of four. He was raised in a loving family. He has worked as a salesman/factory worker. He has had one serious relationship lasting two and a half years, but in November 2006 that relationship appears to have come to an end. 25. There is nothing in the character or antecedents that sets this accused apart from others who stand or who have stood for trial, or as meriting a finding that it is inappropriate to impose any punishment. 26. At twenty-two years of age, there is nothing in the age of the accused - taken on its own - or in connection with any other criteria that merits a finding that it is inappropriate to impose any punishment. It is not clear from the material before me whether the accused would be relying upon a defence of mental illness. 27. As I understand Newman , I should assume a finding on the limited evidence that he committed the offence, as well as assuming after a normal trial there would be a finding of guilt. Such a finding can only then be predicated upon a recognition that a defence of mental illness would have failed. I have assumed as much. 28. That then leaves open the question of whether the mental condition of the accused at the time of the offence was such as to call it in aid in mitigation, in the commission of the offence, to an extent where it would be inappropriate to inflict any punishment. 29. I note that Dr Nielsen does speak of his mental condition as perhaps being a mitigating factor. As matters presently stand, though, there is otherwise a silence as to the state of the offender’s medical health at the time of the offending from the other two medical experts. 30. There is material contained in submissions that would suggest severe depression at his separation from his de facto in November 2006. Strong suicidal ideation on occasions resulting in self-attempts on his life. There is an admission to Campbelltown Hospital on July 16. The complaint was an inability to sleep. The cause of that condition is not in evidence. Frankly, I cannot rule out that the absence of sleep may have been drug induced. 31. It is to be remembered ten days later the offender is dealing in ICE, a stimulant. Depression can also be a side effect of drug taking, and indeed of over use of alcohol. 32. Some of the hospitalisations give a history of the accused having consumed liquor prior to his admission. It would be inappropriate to mitigate punishment to a point where the Court regarded it as inappropriate to inflict any punishment, including a conviction, in circumstances where the consumption of drugs and/or alcohol had caused - or perhaps more likely, contributed to - the depression or mental health problem. Such a problem would be self inflicted or self exacerbated. 33. Inappropriateness of complete mitigation entitling a s 10 discharge would be particularly so if the self-induced mental health problem played no causative role in the offending conduct. On the evidence before me, a causative link has not been exposed. 34. Finally, the issue of the accused’s mental illness at the time of the application for dismissal needs to be assessed to see what, if any, impact it has on the question of whether it is inappropriate to impose punishment. Indeed, that may well have been the intent of s 556A. As a general proposition, health issues can be called in aid to mitigate punishment. The greater the illness, all other things being equal, the greater the mitigation. Severe frailty, the near approaching of death, the enormity of handicap are all matters that may mitigate the imposition of punishment. 35. Whether though in a normal criminal trial the mitigation would extend to the level where the conviction was not made or recorded is, given the Court of Appeal’s criminal attitude to drug trafficking for gain, unlikely in the extreme. It is to be remembered “conviction” is regarded as punishment. Likewise with mental health, the more profound, established, severe and incapacitating the symptoms, the more likely mitigation is to be achieved, but again in only extraordinary cases is it likely to create a complete mitigation so that punishment would be inappropriate. The symptoms disclosed by the psychiatrist in the accused’s case do not reach such a degree of profoundness, incapacity of severity to render any punishment inappropriate. 36. For completeness, I record that I have also considered whether “any other matter” as set out in s 10 can be relied upon to argue that punishment is inappropriate. I have not found, nor has my attention been drawn to, “any other matter” that would make punishment inappropriate. 37.  The application for an order declining to engage in the enquiry dismissing the charge and releasing the offender is refused. 38. The question of the accused’s unfitness, having been raised, it now becomes necessary to conduct an inquiry to determine whether he may be unfit. The Crown has tendered the statement of facts earlier referred to as exhibit A, and Dr Allnutt’s report, exhibit B, and this morning an updated report, exhibit B (2). The defence has tendered a sample letter written by the accused, exhibit 1, reports from Dr Olaf Nielssen, exhibit 2, and Dr Jonathan Carne, exhibit 3; and hospital records from Liverpool and Campbelltown Hospitals, exhibit 4. 39. The accused was represented at the hearing by Mr Lynch, a solicitor advocate with the Legal Aid Commission. The inquiry has been conducted in a non-adversarial manner. Indeed, the Crown position is that the accused is unfit. The Law40. The court’s task is to determine whether the accused is unfit to be tried. The reason the court is concerned as to whether an accused is unfit to be tried is because each person coming to be tried on a criminal matter must measure up to certain minimum standards of mental understanding and mental health. To try in criminal proceedings an accused who did not reach those minimum standards would result in an intolerable unfairness or injustice to him. 41. There are a number of matters I am required to assess. The starting point for my inquiry is a presumption that the accused is not unfit to be tried. Therefore, his unfitness is a matter which will need to be proved on the balance of probabilities. I also begin by presuming qualified and competent lawyers will legally represent the accused at any trial that may be required. The minimum standards that I am concerned with are not those needed for an accused to represent himself at trial. 42. The accused will be unfit to be tried where because of a mental defect or mental illness he fails to come up to certain minimum standards which he needs to equal before he can be tried without unfairness or injustice to him. Queen v Presser [1958] VR 45 at 48. The question of an accused’s unfitness to be tried is not limited to any unfitness by reason of mental illness or mental disorder, and is not to the exclusion of developmental or intellectual disability. R v Mailes [2000] NSWCCA 326. 43. The question of unfitness is not determined on the mental state of an accused at the time of the alleged offences. Whatever his mental state was then would not necessarily govern his fitness to be tried at the time of trial. The critical question to be resolved is upon the evidence of his state at the time of trial. R v Dennison NSWCCA 03/03/1988. An accused should be able to understand the nature and the alleged circumstances of the charges brought against him so he can formulate a proper plea to them. That would depend upon his capacity to understand the nature of the charges. 44. An accused should have a capacity to determine whether it is in his forensic interest to be tried by a judge sitting alone, (assuming the Crown would so consent), or by a jury. An accused should be capable of sensibly exercising his right to challenge a jury panel member from joining the jury. Challenging a potential juror requires firstly an understanding that each juror participates with others in determining whether the Crown has brought evidence sufficient to prove the charges beyond reasonable doubt. All this requires that an accused at least intuitively base his challenge upon the notion that he will leave on the jury persons he feels are likely to regard his case more favourably and strike off those potential jurors who feels are likely to regard his case less sympathetically. That is to say, his choice of jurors should at some level be related to his hoped for outcome of the case and not upon some matter unrelated to the outcome of the trial. 45. Challenging a potential juror requires a capacity to form a view that there may well be something about the appearance or presence of the potential juror to allow an accused to form a view he would prefer the jury deliberations be made by others not including the challenged jury panel member. Even thought the making of challenges can be delegated to counsel, it is important that an accused be able to exercise the challenges personally, so that in the event he felt the need to do so he could withdraw the delegation or indicate to counsel he did not agree with the proposed challenge or non­challenge prior to that opportunity to challenge passing. 46. An accused should be able to follow the course of the proceedings, so as to understand what is going on. That is, he will need to understand at some level the proceedings are a formal inquiry, conducted usually before a presiding judge and jury. If there is no jury, he will need to understand the judge is the tribunal of both fact and law. He will need to understand the prosecutor is charged with presenting evidence in support of the Crown allegations; that defence counsel is tasked with answering those allegations as best they can be answered. 47. He will understand the tribunal of fact, however constituted, is tasked with determining whether the prosecution has proved from the evidence in the trial the allegations made in the charges. In following the course of the proceedings, he will be able to follow the evidence. The accused must have at least a rudimentary understanding of the reception of evidence adverse to him, whether orally or by exhibits, and the effects of cross-examination. An accused must be capable of giving instructions to his legal representatives both prior to and during the trial, so that his lawyers can properly defend him in proceedings. 48. He must be able to decide what defence he will rely upon. He must be able to make out that defence, not in the sense of persuading a jury to accept it, but in the sense of articulating it so that his counsel and the court can understand it. He must be capable of articulating his defence so that he has a meaningful option as to whether he will enter the witness box, should he choose to do so. Put simply, he must be able to make his version of facts known to both his counsel and the court both through evidence of others and, should he wish, through his own evidence. This may require some assessment of his capacity to give evidence in chief and to submit himself to cross-examination. 49. Finally, an accused must be able to sustain his participation in the trial for its duration. 50. A person will be unfit to be tried where one or more of these matters is outside the capacity of the accused because of some mental defect or mental illness. The Evidence51. Dr Allnutt in his report made the following observations. When speaking about what the accused had told him, in the history, Dr Allnutt noted the accused said:  
     
      
      ""The court is not listening to my side of the story. My defence is duress. The court is going to look at it, that there was temptation. I am reluctant to pursue this matter further."" He would not go any further into the account with me at that stage. He then bought out a bunch of papers with a letter that he had written...  
      He believed that there was a conspiracy against him. He said his father had died on 19 March 2008. Prior to going to the funeral, he thought the gaol was very ‘nosy’ towards him. On the day of his father’s funeral, the gaol staff and welfare told him someone was going to ‘knock me’. Welfare was concerned because someone was going to get him. He said they were putting a conspiracy by the way they were acting towards him. He believe that there was a conspiracy against him.  
      52. Dr Allnutt expressed an opinion, the relevant portions of which I now refer to.  
      “In my opinion at this stage, it is, that currently your client manifests symptoms of a psychotic disorder, characterised by disorganised speech. In my opinion, he manifests a psychiatric disorder with psychotic features. I note that other clinicians have raised a diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder. I saw limited evidence in my interview with him.However he manifested thought disorder at the time that I saw him, and this could have affected the manner of his presentation to me. Having regard to the paranoid thoughts that he presented with when he saw me, his presentation to me was one of psychotic disorder with possible mood component.  
      Re. fitness to stand trial: he manifests capacity to understand what he is charged with. In interview with me it appears he becomes easily preoccupied with probably irrelevant aspects of the charge. He has capacity to understand the general nature of the proceedings and the substantial effect of the evidence, but as with his understanding of the charges seems to be distracted by aspects of the proceedings and evidence that might not be relevant to his defence. He manifests capacity to plead to the charge but in my view given his thought disorder and preoccupation with aspects of his defence that are likely influenced by mental illness symptoms, his approach to his defence and decision making in that regard is, on balance, likely to be influenced by a disorganised mind.  
      Based on my interview with him I would expect his representatives are having difficulty getting satisfactory instructions from him. With the assistance of counsel I believe he has the capacity to exercise his rights of challenge. He might have difficulty deciding on a plea.  
      On balance I would regard him as unfit to stand trial. [His m]ental states fluctuate, and I will however endeavour to review him again in the next few weeks to clarify my view of his mental state of fitness at that time.”  
      
    53. As I earlier remarked, an updated report has been provided. Dr Allnutt in this updated report says that:  
     
      
      “I continue to be concerned that your client manifests symptoms consistent with a psychotic disorder, characterised by disorganisation in his thought process causing difficulties in communication. The nature of the diagnosis remains unclear to me at this stage. I note that the diagnosis has varied. In my opinion there is most likely a psychotic process. However, suffice to say that he manifests a mental disorder of a nature and severity that could impact upon the  
      Presser 
       criteria.  
      I believe that your client has a capacity to understand what he was charged with. He was able to communicate what the allegations were, that he had - in possession of an indictable quantity of drugs. He had capacity to understand the general nature of the proceedings. He understood the roles of the various individuals in the court. He understood the purpose of the hearing. I believe he probably has capacity to exercise his right of challenge.  
      He has capacity to understand the purposes of the challenge, and with assistance could probably achieve this. As a consequence of his thought disorder, I have concern about his capacity to understand the substantial effect of any evidence, to plead to the charge or to make hisdefence or answer to the charge. In particular I have a concern about his capacity to give instructions because of his communication problems and his tendency to become tangential.  
      He probably would be able to let his counsel know his version of the facts and would be able to tell the court what it is, but those listening might find him somewhat confused and difficult to understand, would likely perceive his communication of those facts to the court (sic). In my opinion, there is some question about his capacity to decide what evidence he would rely upon, particularly having regard to the written documentation that relates particularly to the legal issues.  
      Overall, I believe that the defendant should be regarded as unfit to stand trial. There has been a degree of improvement since my first interview with him. This suggests some improvement secondary to the medication he is receiving, which would support a prognosis of fitness within twelve months.”  
       
      
    54. Dr Olaf Nielssen also reviewed the accused on this occasion for the defence. 55. He found:  
     
      
      “Mr Chanthasaeng presented as a neatly groomed man of South-East Asian appearance with wiry build and heavily tattooed forearms. He had an intense state and seemed inappropriately cheerful during the interview. He spoke with a slight Asiatic accent, despite living most of his life in Australia. He spoke rapidly with a slight stammer. He gave a number of odd answers that seemed to miss the point of the question put to him and his written work was even stranger. The content of his speech was grandiose in the sense that he described his thinking as very clear and was able to see solutions to many of the world’s problems. However he denied ever experiencing typical symptoms of psychotic illness and no distinctly delusional beliefs were elicited.  
      Mr Chanthasaeng maintained attention, but his concentration was assessed to be mildly impaired. He was able to retrieve factual information quite promptly and his intellectual performance was assessed to be largely intact from his knowledge of the case and the current events. His premorbid intelligence was estimated to be within normal range.  
      Mr Chanthasaeng gave a good account of the role of participants in a trial and the procedure following an adversarial trial. He was also assessed to be able to follow any proceedings in a general sense. However, it was difficult to assess the validity of his proposed defence, and whether the defence he said he planned to rely upon was affected by grandiose and unrealistic thinking associated with untreated hypomania.”  
      
    56. The psychiatric diagnoses reached by Dr Nielssen was (1) bipolar disorder (manic-depressive illness) hypomania phase; and (2) a substance abuse disorder in remission. 57. On the question of the accused’s unfitness, Dr Nielssen expressed the following opinion:  
     
      
      “Mr Chanthasaeng demonstrated a good understanding of the charges, the nature of the proceedings and the procedure followed in an adversarial trial. However, I believe there is some doubt about his fitness for trial because he was thought to be hypomanic at the time of the recent assessment in a way that affected his judgment and his capacity to appraise his legal situation in a realistic way, or to give rational instructions about how to conduct his case. At the time of the recent assessment, I formed the view that Mr Chanthasaeng was unfit for trial.  
      Mr Chanthasaeng has a condition for which treatment is readily available and he should become fit for trial within 12 months if he receives appropriate treatment. Any treatment would begin with the cessation of antidepressant medication which is known to trigger manic episodes in patients with bipolar disorder, and I advised Mr Chanthasaeng to speak to his doctor about ceasing the medication and starting treatment with a mood stabilising medication such as lithium or valproate.”  
      
    58. Dr Jonathan Carne also reviewed the accused for the Legal Aid Commission. He made the following observations:  
     
      
      “I found no evidence from my psychiatric assessment that at the time of the assessment Mr Chanthasaeng was suffering any symptoms of a mental illness. Particularly, there was no evidence of a psychotic illness of intoxication or of a mood disorder. There was no sign of an abnormally elevated or depressed mood. There was no sign of loss of insight or loss of contact with reality. From reading Mr Chanthasaeng’s document ‘Is There Justice’, ‘Is There a God’, ‘ To Sydney Water’ and ‘To His Honour’, the element of grandiosity in these reports suggests that at the time he wrote them, he may have been suffering from an elevated mood and that his grasp of reality may have been fragile, or that the reports were written at the time when he was affected by alcohol or stimulant drugs.  
      Similarly, in my review of the file note by Louise Jardim on 23 November 2007, suggested that at the time Mr Chanthasaeng would have been suffering from symptoms of a psychotic illness and delusions of reference (where the individual expresses the belief that the television is directly referring to things in his life). However, when I interviewed Mr Chanthasaeng about this on 12 December, he gave me a rational explanation for the observations made by Ms Jardim. In summary, therefore, it is possible that Mr Chanthasaeng has at times suffered an abnormally elevated mood, whether from mental illness such as the manic phase of a bipolar disorder or as the result of intoxication from recreational drugs or alcohol.  
      From his account of events to me, there was no evidence that at the time of the alleged offence, he was mentally ill as defined in the M’naghten rules.  
      Similarly, at the time of my assessment of him, there was no evidence that Mr Chanthasaeng was unfit to stand trial according to the Presser criteria. I formed the impression that he was aware of the charges against him and the nature of the court proceedings, that he would be able to follow evidence, decide on his defence, and offer his version of facts to his counsel and the court.  
      I would add only the qualification that if it transpires that Mr Chanthasaeng does suffer from a mental illness as he has in the past, his mood may alter under the stress of the trial, which might affect his ability to participate, hence he would benefit from a repeat psychiatric assessment during the course of the trial if his mental state appears to deteriorate.”  
      
    59. Finally, I have regard to a document entitled ‘Please Help’. There is a note in handwriting in respect of this document on the upper right-hand margin, “Client gave this document to Nathan Steele and KR on 17/04/08 before mention. He advised he had sent it to the High Court.” And that note is dated 17/04/08. I only read parts of the document. It is two pages in length.  
     
      
      “It’s injustice of me being in custody for the crime I didn’t attend to do in the line or duress that the NSW Police put me through.  
      The drug offence on 27/07/2007 is what I stand trial for. I've received an injustice treatment for two earlier matters which I bite my tongue and walk away...  
      I've been going through natural therapy to over come severe depression and anxiety left by the miss conduct of the NSW Police who miss behave towards me. That’s now left my life in danger of self harm and UN meaningful thoughts of not knowing who’s after me.  
      I received an injustice treatment since day one. All three cases that occurred in 2007 has a moral that ends with an injustice treatment towards me. It’s backed up by strong facts, not alligations.  
      I stand by rights to have a fair trial; the more they delaying my court case, I'm losing the plot and my memory.  
      Anger of not being able to prove my innocents is getting to my head. I don’t know how long I can hold it for the prosecutor’s indictment is all true. Duress existed and has warned by the Police Integrity Commission along with the NSW Ombudsman in June 2007, one month before I was arrested.  
      During the process of calling for help, I have written a diary in June which is a statement Address to the media and Royal Commission, stating my traumatised mind and the un-meaningful relationship that the police put me through.  
      I have no assistance when an attempt to avoid matters that was out of reached.  
      That’s why the crime was conducted in an UN willing way. Not even the police or higher commission can help.  
      
    FINDINGS60. I am satisfied that the accused is suffering from a mental illness, however described. Dr Allnutt, who expresses a desire to review the accused a second time in his first report, diagnosed a psychotic disorder with psychotic features. He noted thought disorder and paranoid thinking. Dr Allnutt recognised the possibility of a mood component to the psychotic disorder. There is nothing said in the second report that really takes Dr Allnutt away from those initial findings. He does speak of a psychotic process and “thought disorder” in his second report. 61. Dr Nielssen noted an abnormally elevated mood, grandiosity in contrast to earlier periods of anxiety and depression, hence his diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Dr Nielssen diagnosed hypomania at the time of his assessment that would impact upon the accused’s judgment and capacity to appreciate his legal situation or give rational instructions. 62. Dr Carne was not prepared to diagnose a mental illness. He noted no sign of abnormally elevated or depressed mood. However, he did recognise the accused’s mood may alter with the stress of a trial. I see nothing inconsistent between Dr Carne’s opinion and Dr Nielssen’s diagnosis. After all, that is what bipolar disorder is, a fluctuation of mood. 63. I am satisfied from reading the accused’s letter to the High Court there is thought disorder and a misconception of that court’s role in the criminal justice system. I am also satisfied that the accused, as a consequence of that thought disorder, would have difficulty in instructing his solicitors and articulating his defence. 64. From the evidence before the court, it would appear the accused understands the nature and alleged circumstances of the charge brought against him. However, he may have morphed into those circumstances some of the paranoid ideas observed by Dr Allnutt. In speaking about this trial, the accused said, for instance:  
     
      
      “...the prosecutor’s indictment is all true, duress existed and was warned by the Police Integrity Commission along with the NSW Ombudsman in June 2007, one month before I was arrested.”  
      
     If those thoughts are connected with his potential defence, it seems to me that there is some paranoia being morphed into the defence. 65. I am not satisfied he has the necessary capacity to determine whether he should be tried by a judge alone or by a jury. Nor am I satisfied he is capable of sensibly challenging the jurors. I note that Dr Carne makes no reference to this particular criteria. 66. The accused’s thought processes have a paranoid and conspiratorial flavour to them. There is a real chance that the jurors or a judge alone would become incorporated into his paranoid conspiratorial thinking during the course of the trial, if not before. He is capable of observing what is happening in the court, capable of understanding the evidence led for and against him, however his paranoid/conspiratorial thinking is likely to give to that evidence a skewed impact as the evidence and witnesses become incorporated into his present thinking and disordered thoughts. 67. I am satisfied the accused is unable to make out his defence or to instruct his solicitors. A reading of his letter to the High Court is compelling testimony of his inability to articulate any defence that could be understood by a jury or to convey sensible instructions in relation to the real past history. The evidence satisfies me on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit to be tried.  0O0

    1 Beazley JA: I agree with McCallum J.  
     
      
    2 Johnson J: I agree with McCallum J.  
     
      
    3 McCallum J: This appeal came before the Court as an appeal against conviction and sentence. At the outset of the hearing, however, the appellant, who was not legally represented, stated that he did not wish to proceed with the appeal against conviction because he had been unable to obtain the paperwork he needed for the purpose of that part of his appeal. The Court enquired whether the appellant wished to seek an adjournment of the hearing of the appeal. The appellant did not seek an adjournment and the appeal against conviction was abandoned. The appellant asked the Court to proceed with the hearing as listed because he holds a fear that his ex-partner is about to remove his son from Australia. He wanted to be released from custody as soon as possible so that he could pursue proceedings commenced in the Family Court to prevent that from occurring. The appellant’s anxiety about that issue is understandable but it is not, of course, relevant to the question of error in the sentence. 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeared for initial sentence in the Drug Court of New South Wales before Senior Judge Dive on 7 March 2007, having entered pleas of guilty to eleven substantive offences and two offences of failure to appear. All of those offences had been referred from the Local Court so that the jurisdictional limit on sentence available to the Drug Court was that applicable to the Local Court: s 24 of the Drug Court Act 1998; ss 267, 268 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The appellant was on parole at the time all of the offences were committed. 
     
      
       
      Facts of offences  
       
      
    5 The charges to which the appellant pleaded guilty may broadly be classified into two groups. The first group of charges arose out of the appellant’s arrest on 31 October 2006 when he was stopped by police whilst he was driving a 2005 Toyota Landcruiser utility that had been reported stolen. In respect of that event, he was charged with receiving and also with knowingly driving a stolen conveyance.  
     
      
    6 Police then went with the appellant to Mittagong Caravan Park where they discovered that the caravan in which the appellant was living was also stolen. There was a second charge of receiving in respect of the caravan.  
     
      
    7 The appellant was granted bail in respect of those three offences on 31 October 2006.  
     
      
    8 The caravan was seized by police and collected by its owners. The owners identified two ambulance field equipment bags stored under the sink in the caravan that they said did not belong to them. It transpired that those bags had also been reported stolen. When the appellant attended Bowral Police Station to collect his own possessions that had been left in the caravan, he was arrested and agreed to participate in a record of interview in respect of the ambulance property. He was charged with possession of unlawfully obtained goods. He was then released from custody but was arrested later that day in possession of a stolen camera and a jerry can of stolen petrol. He was charged with a further charge of possession of unlawfully obtained goods in respect of the petrol and a charge of larceny in respect of the camera.  
     
      
    9 He was granted bail in respect of the further charges on 5 November 2006. 
     
      
    10 The two charges of failure to appear arose from the appellant’s failure to appear at Moss Vale Local Court on 7 November 2006, apparently in respect of the two separate bail undertakings referred to above. He remained at large until his arrest in relation to the second set of charges.  
     
      
    11 The second group of charges arose on 17 December 2006 when police commenced a chase of an unregistered vehicle, a red Ford Falcon, being driven by the appellant. The car was chased from Liverpool through to Prestons where it was eventually stopped. It had not been reported stolen at that stage but was later identified by the owner as having been stolen from his wrecking yard whilst he was away on holiday. Arising out of that incident, the appellant was charged with possession of unlawfully obtained goods (in respect of a quantity of tools and other items including a camera located in the car), drive whilst disqualified, drive in a manner dangerous to the public, larceny in respect of some garden tools located in the car and one charge of take and drive conveyance in respect of the car itself. 
     
      
       
      Initial sentence 
       
      
    12 The initial sentencing judge noted that the appellant had been in and out of gaol many times and said that he was going to impose lengthy terms of imprisonment which would be suspended to give the appellant an opportunity to take part in a Drug Court treatment plan.13 His Honour noted the pleas of guilty and noted that, although pleas of guilty had not been entered previously, there was still a utilitarian value to the pleas. He noted that the appellant had a lengthy criminal history and that the offences were committed whilst the appellant was on parole. He also noted, as to the later offences, that they were committed whilst the appellant was on bail for the earlier offences and that the last offences were committed whilst the appellant was at large, having not answered his bail.  
     
      
    14 His Honour noted that the appellant had a motivation to succeed on a Drug Court programme, because he wished to re-establish some contact with his son. 
     
      
    15 The sentences imposed by the initial sentencing judge were as follows:

     16 The longest term for the first group of sentences was two years imposed in respect of the charge of receiving the Landcruiser. The sentences imposed in respect of the second group of charges were expressed to be consecutive on that sentence. Accordingly, the effect of the initial sentences was that there was a total term of three years. No non-parole period was set at that stage. The sentencing judge noted that the appellant had, at that stage, spent eighty-seven days in custody and that, if he had to be sent back to gaol, the sentence would be backdated to make allowance for those days.  
     
      
    17 The initial sentences were suspended upon the appellant’s agreeing to enter into a Drug Court treatment plan under which he was required to attend the William Booth Centre.  
     
      
    18 The appellant left William Booth the morning after the day he arrived. In a letter to the Drug Court, he identified his reason for doing so as being that he had not appreciated, prior to entering into the programme, the level of religious content that the programme would involve. He complained that he had been required to undertake Christian instruction that was inconsistent with his own Catholic upbringing. However, he did not return to the Drug Court immediately. In due course a warrant was issued for his arrest and, after that occurred, he surrendered himself to police on 12 March 2007. 19 On 11 April 2007 the appellant entered into a varied treatment plan which required him to go to Adele House. However, he fled from Central Railway Station before ever reaching the premises of that institution at Coffs Harbour. On 16 April 2007, the drug programme was terminated and a bench warrant issued for his arrest. The warrant was executed on 3 May 2007. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Final sentence 
       
      
    20 The appellant appeared for final sentence before Judge Barnett on 15 June 2007. Judge Barnett expressly relied on the matters taken into account at the initial sentence hearing. As to the appellant’s participation in the Drug Court programme, the Judge observed that other Drug Court participants have also found the religious content of the William Booth programme difficult but noted that the appellant had not then returned to Court as required by his undertaking to the Court.  
     
      
    21 There was evidence before Judge Barnett from a psychologist which indicated that the appellant had been diagnosed with bi-polar disorder and schizophrenia three years earlier. In the light of that evidence, Judge Barnett considered whether to make a finding of special circumstances to allow for rehabilitation but declined to do so on the basis that there did not appear to be any real desire on the part of the appellant to undertake such rehabilitation. His Honour found that the appellant had simply used the treatment plans as a means of getting out of gaol. 
     
      
    22 In those circumstances, Judge Barnett was not prepared to find special circumstances but, in view of the mental health issues and the need to find a sentence that was just and appropriate, decided not to accumulate any of the sentences. As a consequence, the total term was reduced from three years to two years imprisonment. 
     
      
    23 In his remarks on sentence, the Judge stated, “the head sentence will continue to be number one on the list. There will be a non-parole period of 18 months and a total term of 2 years”. The reference to number one on the list appears to have been a reference to the charge of receiving in respect of the Landcruiser. His Honour otherwise confirmed all of the sentences imposed at initial sentence. 
     
      
    24 The sentences were fixed to commence from 14 January 2007 which was stated to be an agreed date taking into account the eighty-seven days of pre-programme custody noted at the initial sentence and, in addition, twenty-one days sanctions and forty-four days bail refused, making a total of one hundred and fifty-two days.  
     
      
       
      Grounds identified by the appellant 
       
      
    25 The Notice of Appeal filed by the appellant did not identify any grounds of appeal in respect of the appeal against sentence. During the hearing, the appellant advanced the following arguments: 
     
      
       
      a) he complained that the judge that imposed the initial sentence did not give due consideration to the mental health report and that the appellant should have had an opportunity to undertake a treatment plan at Morisset, which treats people with both a drug addiction and a mental health diagnosis. Evidence adduced by the appellant disclosed that Adele House does not accept dual diagnosis patients; 
       
       
      b) the appellant contended that the sentence should have dated from the date when bail was refused on 17 December 2006 rather than from the date identified in the Remarks on Sentence of Judge Barnett on 15 June 2007; 
       
       
      c) the appellant said that he was given no discount for his plea of guilty. 
       
      
    26 The appellant noted that his current release date is 16 July 2008 and said that even if he had been given as little as ten percent by way of discount for the utilitarian value of his plea, he would be entitled to be released now.  
     
      
    27 The first ground relates to the terms of the treatment programme, not the initial sentence imposed by Senior Judge Dive or the final sentence imposed by Judge Barnett. There is nothing to suggest that the programme was not voluntarily entered into by the appellant. As noted in the Remarks on Sentence of Judge Barnett, the appellant did not endeavour to comply with the treatment plan at all, absconding each time without spending more than a night in either programme.  
     
      
    28 As to the ground relating to the date from which the sentence should have run, the commencement date was an agreed date and the calculation of the date one hundred and fifty two days before the day of the sentence hearing was correct. The appellant’s argument ignored the fact that, after bail was refused, he spent some time at large each time he absconded from his treatment programmes. 
     
      
    29 As to the question of there being no discount for the plea of guilty, there is some force in the appellant’s complaint. In the sentencing remarks at the initial sentence hearing, Senior Judge Dive stated that there was “most clearly a utilitarian value” to the pleas of guilty. Having made that finding, His Honour imposed a total term of two years where that was the jurisdictional limit on penalty for that offence: s 267 of the Criminal Procedure Act; R v El Masri [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30]. 
     
      
    30 The position is effectively the same in respect of the second charge of receiving (relating to the caravan) in respect of which, at final sentence, a fixed term of eighteen months was imposed, being the same as the non-parole period imposed in respect of the first charge, in circumstances where there was no finding of special circumstances such as to warrant adjusting the normal ratio. 
     
      
    31 In R v Doan (2000) 50 NSWLR 115 at [35], this Court drew a distinction between a jurisdictional maximum and a maximum penalty and stated that, where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that Court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. The jurisdictional limit is not to be regarded as some form of maximum penalty reserved for the worst possible case: Doan at [35]; approved in Re Attorney-General’s application (No 2 of 2002) (2002) 137 A Crim R 196 at [27]. 
     
      
    32 In the present case, it is not possible to ascertain whether the imposition of a sentence that was the jurisdictional maximum reflects a failure to give any discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. The sentencing judge made no express finding as to the objective seriousness of each individual offence, although it is implicit in his adoption of the remarks of the initial sentencing judge that he regarded them as warranting “lengthy terms of imprisonment”. 33 To complicate the question, the approach taken in the present case is difficult to reconcile with the requirements of Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. The sentences imposed in the present case are more consistent with the custom before the decision of the High Court in that case, when, where there were multiple offences, the Court would select the most serious and use it as the vehicle for reflecting the totality of the offender’s criminality, imposing concurrent sentences in respect of the remaining offences: see Kerr v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 44 at [32].  
     
      
    34 Following Pearce, a sentencing judge is now required to fix “an appropriate sentence” for each offence before considering questions of accumulation, concurrence or totality. The statement made by the sentencing judge referred to above that the “head sentence” would continue to be the first charge on the list tends to confirm that His Honour did not strictly apply the approach required by Pearce. The imposition of a sentence in respect of the first charge at the jurisdictional maximum may reflect a failure to apply Pearce rather than a failure to give a discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. 
     
      
    35 In any event, this Court would not quash the sentence unless it is satisfied that a less severe sentence is warranted in law: s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    36 In the present case, whether or not the approach of the sentencing judge was wrong, it cannot be said that the result was wrong. Having regard to the number of offences, the period over which they were committed and the fact that the appellant was on parole or bail when they were committed, no lesser sentence than a total term of imprisonment for two years with a non-parole period of eighteen months was warranted in law. In those circumstances, there is no requirement for the Court to restructure the sentences to achieve the same overall result: cf AJO v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 28 at [33]; Kerr at [35]. 
     
      
    37 I note the abandonment of appeal against conviction. The order I propose is that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Buckman who appears for the accused has applied to discharge the jury. The issue raised by his application is whether an application by a juror to be excused for two days earlier this week for a holiday indicates an attitude by that juror that he or she is not undertaking their duties responsibly. A secondary issue is whether if such an attitude existed it has infected the other jurors.2. This trial commenced on Monday 26 May 2008. The jury was told that the trial may run into a second week, that is the week commencing Monday 2 June 2008. On the second day of the trial, namely 27 May, a juror was sick and we lost the whole day. On the fifth day of the trial, namely Friday 30 May, I had sentence matters which were essential to attend to because they had been not reached previously. We lost half a day. We went into the second week. On the Wednesday of the second week, namely 4 June, a juror had a medical appointment and the result of that was that we lost a whole day.3. On Thursday 5 June I sent the jury out to consider its verdict. It returned on Friday 6 June with various questions. One series of questions indicated that there was the possibility of deadlock and asked for assistance. Another note, MFI 31, which was brought to my attention late on Friday 6 June indicated the jury would sit to 4 o’clock on Friday to try to reach a decision but one of the jurors had to leave at four. It further indicated that Tuesday and Wednesday of the following week, that is the Tuesday and Wednesday of this week, one of the jurors has a holiday booked. 4. Mr Buckman and Mr Moberley for the accused and the prosecution respectively agreed that the matter should be adjourned until today but Mr Buckman specifically reserved his position upon whether he may make an application to discharge the jury. He has made that application this morning.5. On his application his arguments are these. The first is that one of the jurors, namely the juror who took the two days holiday, is not taking their duties seriously enough. The second point is that because of the lapse of time of five days and the indication that the jury may be deadlocked there is a danger that some of the remaining jurors may be infected by the perceived cavalier attitude of the one juror going on holidays and be persuaded of a different view inappropriately. Related to that is a concern that the other jurors may be persuaded to other views because they no longer wish to be here given the lapse of time. Mr Buckman’s final point is that these problems cannot be remedied by directions because it is too late. Indeed the only direction that might have been given is that jurors should take their jobs more seriously.6. It can be seen that an important aspect of Mr Buckman’s argument is that the one juror who was going on holidays for two days this week is not taking their duties seriously enough. I do not accept that submission. That is a conclusion which may be available but which I expect is unlikely. The holiday may have been pre-booked some time ago. It must have been pre-booked to some extent at least because we were warned as early as 2 June 2008, that is the Monday before the Friday 6 June, that a juror had commitments the following week and was not available after Friday. In addition the jury were told that the trial may run into a second week impliedly at the latest.7. I think it also needs to be borne in mind that juries are not as familiar with the procedures that can accompany jury trials as counsel and judges are. We, counsel and judges who are regularly involved in these processes, understand that there can be unexpected delays caused by illnesses. We also understand that parts of the process such as counsel’s addresses and summing-up can take longer than juries might expect. Although they are told when it is anticipated they might be sent out, nevertheless it must be difficult for them to know in advance whether the time available will be sufficient for them to reach a decision or not.8. I do not conclude that the indication that one juror needed to take their booked holidays on Monday and Tuesday of this week points to an inappropriate attitude on the part of that juror. It would have been quite reasonable for that juror to make that arrangement as late as the first day of the trial when they were given the estimate and even at the commencement of the second week when it would not be known that we would lose an extra day and when the jurors may not have known how long the process may take.9. It follows that I do not regard there being any danger of the other jurors being infected by any inappropriate attitude displayed by the juror who has taken their holidays. I agree with Mr Moberley’s submission that the fact that the jury has indicated that there is a possibility of a deadlock points more to them taking their jobs seriously than in the other direction. He reminded me that they had expressed a preference to sit as a jury as twelve and wait until Thursday when all twelve were available. I agree with him that that points to an attitude that they value the twelve of them being together and therefore do not regard the juror who took the holidays as a person whose opinion would not be valued because of a particular cavalier attitude.10. I too am somewhat concerned about the lapse of time of five days. I should observe that last Monday 9 June was a public holiday so that there would have been a lapse of three days anyway. I do not regard it as necessary for any direction about jurors doing their jobs properly because I do not think that there is any evidence that any juror is not doing his or her job properly. But I do think it appropriate to acknowledge in directions that the jurors should be aware of distractions which may have occurred during the five days and for the necessity to refocus on their task. I think it is probably also appropriate in addition to giving them the usual direction in circumstances of a possible deadlock to remind them that they may have access to transcripts and further directions.11. For those reasons I reject the application.Thank you both for your assistance with that, I have been assisted. Now I will just give back the MFIs. Yes Mr Buckman. 
    BUCKMAN: Does your Honour propose to give a Black direction now?HIS HONOUR: Yes I think I should don’t you?BUCKMAN: Yes.HIS HONOUR: And I think I ought, as I said, acknowledge the lapse of time and say it is important that they refocus and remind them that, if they need to be reminded, of evidence or directions then they should.BUCKMAN: Yes, thank you.HIS HONOUR: Mr Moberley? Anything to add?CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, nothing to add.HIS HONOUR: We are ready for the jury.BUCKMAN: If I can just speak to my client?HIS HONOUR: Yes, yes go ahead.

    1 HIS HONOUR: On 15 May 2008, Robert Black Farmer (who I shall refer to as “the offender”), was convicted of three counts on the indictment, the trial having commenced on 2 April 2008. 
     
      
    2 The three counts in these proceedings, of course, relate to the one person who I shall refer to, in these remarks, as “the victim”. I do so, I wish to emphasise, not to impersonalise her in any way but I consider that to do so is consonant with the fact that Count 1 involves a prescribed sexual offence and s.578A of the Crimes Act 1900 is directed to protecting persons who have been the victim of such an offence from having that fact publicly exposed by publication. I am aware, of course, that in respect of Counts 2 and 3, there has been extensive publication of the facts and of her identity relating to those counts in the media. 
     
      
    3 The three counts were:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Count 1: That on 9 November 2005 at Northmead, contrary to s.86(1)(b) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900, the offender detained the victim without her consent and with intent to obtain an advantage, namely sexual gratification. The maximum prescribed penalty for an offence under that provision is a term of imprisonment of 14 years. 
       
       
      (2) Count 2: That on 9 November 2005 at Northmead, contrary to s.27 of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , the offender caused grievous bodily harm to the victim with intent to murder her. The maximum prescribed penalty for an offence under that provision is a term of imprisonment of 25 years. 
       
       
      (3) Count 3: That on 9 November 2005 at Northmead, contrary to s.198 of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , the offender maliciously damaged by means of fire a dwelling house, with intent to endanger the life of the victim. The maximum prescribed penalty for an offence under that provision is a term of imprisonment of 25 years. 
       
      
    4 The jury having returned verdicts of guilty in relation to all three counts, it is necessary for me, as the sentencing judge, to make the findings upon which the sentences to be imposed are to be based. That, in turn, requires that the facts to be adopted by me for that purpose must be consistent with the verdicts of the jury and that the findings of fact for the purpose of sentencing the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    5 The verdicts of the jury indicate that they were satisfied that the offender was present at the victim’s home on the afternoon of 9 November 2005 and there committed each of the offences. 
     
      
    6 In determining the appropriate sentence in respect of each of the offences on Counts 1, 2 and 3, the jury’s verdicts decided the issues joined by the pleas on the indictment. However, they did not decide, either expressly or by implication, all of the facts of possible relevance to sentencing. The High Court observed in Cheung v The Queen [2001] 209 CLR 1 at 10, that a jury’s verdict on the black and white issue of guilt may leave to a sentencing judge a very difficult task of deciding questions of degree involved in assessing an offender’s culpability, and the proper measure of punishment. 
     
      
    7 The Crown case was a circumstantial one based upon a wide range of evidence including forensic evidence recovered from the crime scene, DNA material found on certain items located at the crime scene (including, in particular, the eastern bedrail of the victim’s bed and the surface of a fuel tin lid found in the garage), together with evidence of the offender’s conduct both on the evening of 9 November 2005, on 10 November 2005 and thereafter on what were said to be episodes of flight following the commission of the offences. It was the Crown case in relation to Count 2 that the offender repeatedly struck the victim with a set of fibro cutters that were located in the garage at her home and where she was found by police on the floor in a severely injured and unconscious condition. 
     
      
    8 The evidence established that there had been no known association or relationship or connection between the offender and the victim or any member of her family. There was, accordingly, no suggested motive or reason based upon matters such as hatred, jealously or revenge involved in this case. 
     
      
       
      Particular events on 9 November 2005 
       
      
    9 Evidence was given by members of the victim’s family that she was well and in good spirits when she left with her mother to attend her TAFE College that day. 
     
      
    10 It was accepted at trial that, by reason of the very severe head injuries sustained causing brain damage, she had no memory of the events either immediately preceding the attack or during the attack itself. 
     
      
    11 The evidence established that at 2.06 pm, she alighted from the bus which took her from Baulkham Hills TAFE College on the day of the offences, which was a Wednesday. She had attended a presentation as part of her Diploma in Business Marketing course. 
     
      
    12 The evidence established that she arrived home by about 2.30 pm on that day and that the offences were committed during the period 2.30 pm and 4.30 pm. The fire call was received at the Sydney Communication Centre at 4.39 pm. By the time police arrived at 4.50 pm, the house was on fire and a number of fire brigade units were already in attendance and in the process of extinguishing the fire. 
     
      
    13 The garage was detached from the house. Fire had not reached it when police arrived. Police proceeded to inspect the premises and, in the course of doing so, entered the garage. There, they found the victim on the floor. She was lying in blood and there was a strong smell of petrol on and about her. The blood and swelling made her face unrecognisable. 
     
      
    14 A black electrical cord was found tied to and wrapped around her left wrist and forearm and a computer monitor cord was across her chest. There was blood spatter noted over the wall and on a timber box or chest and on surrounding areas. 
     
      
    15 She was found naked apart from a pink and white striped top or blouse. When the intensive care paramedic from the New South Wales Ambulance Service arrived, she was found in a critical condition with a Glasgow Coma Score of approximately 4 to 5. It was apparent to the paramedic that she had sustained, what were described in evidence as “massive blunt and penetrating head injuries”. These included a number of fractures, discolouration around the eyes, cheeks and the right side of her face and massive open lacerations to the temporal and scalp regions. There appeared to be, to the paramedic’s observation, four to five massive lacerations running from the front and side of her head towards the back of the head. 
     
      
    16 Dr Ellis, specialist forensic pathologist, gave evidence that, if there were four or five separate lacerations, then that would certainly have been consistent with four or five separate blows with something long and hard or straight and hard. 
     
      
    17 The nature and extent of the injuries and disabilities inflicted and suffered were the subject of evidence from Dr Mudaliar, who, at the relevant time, was Director of the Intensive Care Unit at Westmead Hospital. 
     
      
    18 On clinical examination, he said that the following injuries were detected:- 
     
      
       
      (1) A compound compressed skull fracture of the left frontal and parietal occipital region. 
       
       
      (2) Frontal sinus fractures (between the eyebrows and above the ridge of the nose) and in the area just under the eye socket. 
       
       
      (3) A small extradural haematoma in the area of the membrane outside the brain. 
       
       
      (4)  
      “Le Fort 3” 
       injury (describing the entire structure of the facial bones as it fits into the skull cavity). The entire frontal part of the bone had become fractured and avulsed forward. 
       
       
      (5) Intercranial dural tears (coverings of the brain and dura being torn in multiple areas internally). 
       
       
      (6) Multiple cuts on the face. 
       
       
      (7) Dislodgment of blood from blood vessels extravasated into other areas. 
       
       
      (8) Leakage of cerebral spinal fluid with fluid exuding from the ear and nose (due to fractures). 
       
       
      (9) Superficial and partial thickness burns to the back, the buttocks and all limbs attributed to exposure to petrol. 
       
      
    19 Surgical procedures were undertaken including, in particular, laparotomy on 9 November 2005, surgery to the facial lacerations, and on 10 November 2005, debridement and elevation of the left temporal compound bone depressed skull fracture, suture of dural lacerations and of multiple facial lacerations. On 16 November 2005, the patient underwent bifrontal flap, craniotomy, cranialisation of frontal sinus and operative fixation of the comminuted facial fractures. She has also undergone several facial reconstructive procedures. 
     
      
    20 The initial surgery was undertaken over a four hour period and she was subject to blood transfusions. 
     
      
    21 Clinical examination revealed deep and middle section burns to the upper layers of the victim’s skin, the middle layers of the skin and the lower layers, presumed to be chemically induced by hydrocarbons whilst lying in petrol. Dr Mudaliar stated that she would need to have been lying in petrol for a substantial period of time, not a few minutes, in order for such chemical burns to have occurred. He estimated that it would have been more than one hour for the burns to have resulted. 
     
      
    22 The victim remained in Intensive Care from 10 November until 2 December 2005 and in that period, she was on life support intensive care monitoring, artificial ventilation and assisted respiratory support to maintain breathing. Dr Mudaliar described her injuries as “life threatening”. 
     
      
    23 In the intensive care stage, she underwent two main operations involving fixation of facial fractures to the mid and upper third of the face (the “le Fort 3” facial fractures). 
     
      
    24 In all, the victim spent 23 days in intensive care management. She was subsequently discharged to another section of the hospital for rehabilitation. 
     
      
    25 The evidence established that, but for medical intervention, she would have died from her injuries. 
     
      
    26 Dr Joseph Gurka, rehabilitation specialist, had her under his care from 14 December 2005. On admission to Westmead Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit, she was described as being “in a minimally responsive state”. She demonstrated slowed information processing and was fully dependent in all respects of care at that stage. 
     
      
    27 She spent three and a half months as an in-patient in the Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit. 
     
      
    28 During that period of time, she demonstrated improvement. She remained in a state of post-traumatic amnesia for a period of three months which Dr Gurka stated indicated “an extremely severe traumatic brain injury”. He observed that her “thinking speed” was slow and memory was impaired as were her planning and organisational skills. 
     
      
    29 She was discharged from the Westmead Brain Injury Rehabilitation Unit following an intensive rehabilitation programme. She then went into the Transitional Living Unit for two months focusing on the rehabilitation of her living skills. 
     
      
    30 She was subsequently discharged from the Transitional Living Unit on 26 May 2006 to live with her family. She remained in ongoing rehabilitation with the hospital’s community rehabilitation unit. She has had and has required enormous support from her family. 
     
      
    31 Dr McCarthy, rehabilitation specialist, furnished a report which was tendered by the Crown. The report is dated 28 May 2008 and it is Exhibit D in the sentence proceedings. I will refer to Dr McCarthy’s most recent assessment when dealing with the assessment of the offence in Count 2 for the purpose of determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    32 Returning to the injuries sustained, Dr Ellis, specialist forensic pathologist, examined a number of statements and photographs taken at the crime scene and at the hospital. He gave evidence that the facial fractures made it likely that there were a number of hard impacts to the front of the face, possibly with an increased concentration of the left side, and that the impacts were likely to have been with an object such as a weapon. He stated that the fractures were obviously indicative of multiple applications of force which were capable of causing bleeding in and around the brain. 
     
      
    33 In relation to injuries on the victim’s torso, Dr Ellis referred to a very distinctive marking on the victim’s back. He said that the object responsible for inflicting the wound on the back must have been used with considerable force. 
     
      
    34 The nature of the injuries inflicted on the victim in the garage was also elucidated by the evidence on blood stain pattern interpretation. The evidence established that there were signs of what was termed “cast-off blood”. This referred to blood flying off a weapon or implement. The evidence was that the blood was thrown off the implement when it was drawn back from the floor in an upwards direction and then downwards. The evidence revealed that there were several impact marks on areas of the chipboard chest consistent with having been caused by an implement such as the fibro cutters. 
     
      
    35 The blood stain evidence established that the victim was struck whilst on the ground with several blows of sufficient force to cause the factures and the blood spatter patterns detected. 
     
      
    36 So far as markings to the head and face, Dr Ellis stated that it was evident that considerable force must have been used to inflict them for such swelling to have occurred. He further stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The overall impression is that of a woman who has suffered very severe, life-threatening blunt force injuries to her head. Additionally, other injuries suggested chemical burns on some parts of her body as well as possible signs of restraint …” 
        
       
      
    37 The evidence established that after the victim was rendered unconscious, the offender set about putting in place the means to destroy the house and garage by fire. The placement of the electric toaster on the stove with the gas turned on is, on the evidence, consistent with an intention in the offender to create an interval of time before ignition actually occurred, thereby permitting him time to escape before the premises were set alight. I am satisfied to the requisite standard that an inference to that effect may and should be drawn. 
     
      
    38 The evidence was that the primary ignition or the seat of the fire was on the gas stove in the kitchen. The probable cause was the ignition of gas vapours or perhaps a mixture of gas and petrol vapours from the stove top as a result of heat from the toaster. 
     
      
    39 In relation to the steps taken by the offender to set the home alight, the crime scene evidence established the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The presence of blood soaked clothing items located in the garage. 
       
       
      (2) The presence of petrol in the kitchen area. 
       
       
      (3) A metal fuel tin was located on an island bench in the middle of the kitchen. The fuel tin had no lid on it. The red fuel tin lid was located, as I have earlier stated, on the floor of the garage. 
       
      
    40 Examination of the crime scene also revealed the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The fibro cutters wrapped in a sheet and located on a rocking chair in the family room. Blood stains and hair were found on the fibro cutters. 
       
       
      (2) A large number of items of clothing, bedding and assorted items had been strewn around the floor in the victim’s bedroom. 
       
       
      (3) Three apparent blood stains were found on the mattress of her bed. 
       
       
      (4) Apparent blood stains were found on a cream coloured pillow case located in her bedroom. 
       
      
    41 The evidence also established that petrol had been poured over items in the house including a pink Sussan brand top in the third bedroom, on an area on the mattress from which a sample was taken and on a grey coloured handbag which was located on the floor of the kitchen. 
     
      
    42 A review of the evidence establishes, beyond reasonable doubt, the following facts:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That a struggle took place between the offender and the victim in her bedroom.  
       
       
      (2) That she was detained against her will. 
       
       
      (3) The presence of the offender’s DNA on the eastern bedrail, the location of a used tampon on the floor of the victim’s bedroom and the fact that she was semi-naked when found in the garage support the inference, beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender in some way had sexually interfered with her. 
       
       
      (4) That the telephone in the main bedroom was, at some point during the detention, was disconnected from the wall socket. 
       
       
      (5) That the victim moved or escaped from her bedroom to the garage where she was confronted and repeatedly struck in the face, head and body with the fibro cutters. 
       
       
      (6) In consequence of the repeated striking, she suffered grievous bodily harm by the offender using the fibro cutters as a weapon. 
       
       
      (7) That the offender took the fuel tin from the garage and poured it on clothing and other items to which I have referred in the bedroom, the family room and kitchen and, at some point, placed the toaster on the stove as a source of ignition of gas and/or fuel vapours. 
       
       
      (8) The offender poured petrol on the victim herself and in the area in which she was lying on the garage floor and that at the time she was lying on the garage floor, she was then exhibiting signs of life that would have been apparent to the offender. 
       
       
      (8) That she was lying on the garage floor for a period of up to one hour or so in consequence of which she suffered chemical burns to her skin on various parts of her body. 
       
      
    43 In relation to those findings of fact, issues as to the offender’s state of mind or intent must be considered in this case at two stages:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The first stage relates to time of the offender’s action in inflicting grievous bodily harm upon the victim by means of the fibro cutters in the garage. 
       
       
      (2) The second stage relates to the period when the offender poured petrol on her, as she lay in the injured condition. 
       
      
    44 In light of the number, the nature and the extent of the physical injuries inflicted by the use of the fibro cutters, the evidence supports the conclusion, beyond reasonable doubt that, at the time the offender inflicted those injuries, he intended to kill the victim. 
     
      
    45 On the findings of fact to which I have referred, the evidence, in my opinion, also establishes to the requisite standard, that on the occasions on which the offender poured petrol on the victim and about her and in the house, he intended to bring about her death by setting alight the petrol-doused premises. 
     
      
    46 The offender’s state of mind at each of the two stages to which I have referred are central to the determination of the level of criminality involved in Counts 2 and 3. 
     
      
    47 The Crown put to the jury that there were two possible explanations as to why the offender entered the victim’s home on 9 November 2005. The first possibility suggested was a chance sighting by the offender of the victim who was described in evidence as a “striking girl”. Such a possibility would suggest a sexual motive. 
     
      
    48 The second possibility, which was put as the more likely of the two, was that the offender went to the victim’s home with the intent to commit robbery, that he was surprised by her presence and that things escalated to the point described by the Crown as the “brutal assault”. 
     
      
    49 Either possibility, of course, would involve serious criminality. In Regina v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270, the High Court (Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Hayne and Callinan JJ) at 278 stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… very often prosecuting authorities (and a sentencing judge) will have only the most limited and imperfect information about how it was that the accused came to commit an offence for which he or she stands for sentence …” 
        
       
      
    50 See also Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629 at 636. 
     
      
    51 In the circumstances of the present proceedings, there is a need to distinguish between the offender’s motive or reason for entering the victim’s home and the motive or reason for inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to kill. 
     
      
    52 The former, if known, may be an aggravating factor in assessing the criminality of the offender. But the last-mentioned motive or reason on the prosecution case was the offender’s desire to avoid apprehension. On the findings made and to which I have earlier referred, it is clear and I find to the requisite standard that the motive or reason for inflicting such harm with intent to kill her was to prevent the victim as the only person who could identify him from doing so and so avoid apprehension for the offences. 
     
      
       
      Count 1: Detention contrary to s.86(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 
       
      
    53 From the jury’s verdict, it can be concluded that the offender detained the victim against her will. The evidence as to the condition of her room, with clothing and other items found scattered on the floor and the bed out of its customary position, establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offender detained the victim in the house by overpowering her. 
     
      
    54 The gravamen of the offence under s.86(1)(b) is the unlawful detention of a person. There can be a number of factors that determine the seriousness of the offence. The purpose of the offence is one factor. However, in Regina v Newell [2004] NSWCCA 183, the Court of Criminal Appeal observed that serious offences under the section are not restricted to cases of kidnapping for ransom. 
     
      
    55 The matters that are relevant in making an assessment of the seriousness of an offender under s.86 include the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1)  
      The period of the detention 
      . In the present case, it is impossible to be precise as to the period of the detention. The evidence would support an inference that the period of the detention was over a number of minutes in the house before the physical attack in the garage, where she was again detained for a short period before being rendered unconscious. However, given the circumstances of the detention, I do not consider the duration of the detention in the house can be said to be a factor that detracts from the seriousness of the offence. 
       
       
      (2)  
      The circumstances of the detention 
      . In this case, the circumstances would include the fact that the detention occurred in the victim’s home, in particular, including in her bedroom, an aggravating factor under the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999, s.21A(2)(b).  
        
      During the detention, she was detained in a state of undress. 
       
       
      (3) 
       The person being detained 
      . In this case, the victim was a young woman 18 years of age who must have suffered extreme fear and terror during the detention. 
       
       
      (4)  
      The purpose of the detention 
      . The evidence establishes beyond reasonable doubt, as I have earlier stated, that the offender detained the victim to prevent her from escaping and identifying him. But the evidence also supports the finding to the requisite standard that, during the detention, the offender in some way sexually interfered with her. Given the offender’s denial of the offence, there is no evidence from him as to his intention or his state of mind. 
       
      
    56 The evidence, however, does, as I have stated, permit a finding to the requisite standard that the violation of the victim undertaken by the offender for the purpose of obtaining sexual gratification was an incident of the detention and, as I have said, committed by him with the requisite specified intent. 
     
      
    57 Whilst no direct comparison of one case with another is usually possible, an examination of comparable sentences may be of assistance in indicating the general range which a court has regarded as appropriate for offences of this kind. Examples include the sentences considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Chaplin v The Queen (2006) 160 A Crim R 86; [2006] NSWCCA 40; Regina v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335 and Regina v Harkin (1989) 38 A Crim R 296.  
     
      
    58 I intend to impose a sentence that is appropriate, having regard to the factual matters and findings to which I have referred and issues of accumulation of sentences and to the principle of totality. 
     
      
       
      Count 2: Causing grievous bodily harm with intent to murder contrary to s.27 of the Crimes Act 
       
      
    59 The objective seriousness of the offence on Count 2 is apparent from the factual findings to which I have already referred. The repeated striking of a defenceless young woman with a heavy metal implement such as the fibro cutters as she lay on the garage floor, constitutes an offence involving almost an unimaginable level of ferocity and callousness. The subsequent actions in pouring the petrol over the gravely injured young woman would confirm, if any confirmation had been required, that at the time of striking the victim, the offender was intent on killing her. 
     
      
    60 The Crown submitted that Counts 2 and 3 are offences that are in the worst case category for such offences. 
     
      
    61 The relevant principles in that respect are established by various decisions, the most commonly cited being the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Twala (unreported, 4 November 1994) and the following dicta was relied upon by the Crown in its submissions in the present proceedings:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, in order to characterise any case as being in the worst case category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed).” 
        
       
      
    62 The principles and their application have been considered in a number of cases including, in particular Regina v Kalache (2000) 111 A Crim R 152; [2000] NSWCCA 2. In the present case, as in Kalache, the offender did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing although, of course, as in these proceedings, he did at trial. 
     
      
    63 The Crown pointed to the features which are said to be of very great heinousness:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Severe traumatisation and extreme fear which the actions constituting the second offence must have produced. 
       
       
      (2) The offender’s actions placing the victim in, what was said to be, a situation of complete and absolute indignity. 
       
       
      (3) The nature of the weapon and that the offender must be taken as knowing that he would cause extreme injury to the victim. 
       
       
      (4) The infliction of harm by repeated blows. 
       
       
      (5) The fact that the victim was completely defenceless. 
       
      
    64 It is essential to have regard to the fact that the offence under s.27 of the Crimes Act involved in Count 2, includes two components to the offence both of which require consideration in determining whether Count 2 is in a “worst case” category. The first physical element of the offence is the concept of “grievous bodily harm”. This is not limited to the physical injuries but includes their impact or effects. 
     
      
    65 The injuries suffered by the victim in the present case were very substantial, as is apparent from my earlier description of them. So also are the effects of those injuries. 
     
      
    66 However, in evaluating where Count 2 in this case lies in terms of a worst case category, a fundamental matter to be assessed is the nature and extent of the grievous bodily harm. In Regina v Mitchell & Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296, the victim suffered extensive brain injury that had a profound impact. He was confined to a wheelchair, had limited speech and very severe cognitive problems from which he would never recover. His condition was described as being a “vegetative state”, or “like a living death”. The offence in that case was under s.33(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and involves causing “grievous bodily harm to a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm …”. 
     
      
    67 Although the Court of Criminal Appeal in that case was concerned with such an offence, the following observations made by the court I consider to be also relevant in considering an offence under s.27:- 
     
      
       
        
        “27. A very important aspect of an offence under s.33 is the result of the offender’s conduct. The nature of the injury caused to the victim will to a very significant degree determine the seriousness of the offence and the appropriate sentence. This is not to underestimate the intent component of the offence, after all that is the element that makes the offender liable to a maximum penalty of 25 years as opposed to 7 years for a s.35 offence. But there is less scope for variation in the nature of the intention to do grievous bodily harm when determining the seriousness of a particular instance of the offence than there is for variation in the nature of the injury inflicted. It should be borne in mind that, if the victim had died, the respondents would have faced a charge of murder. The injury suffered by the victim was, as her Honour noted, little short of death. 
        
       
       
        
        28. The nature of the injury suffered by the victim was in the very worst category that could be envisaged for the offence. That itself brought the offence into a very serious category …” 
        
       
      
    68 Whilst the possibility of envisaging a worst case than the present is not, such as in Gallagher (supra), itself determinative of the Crown’s submission that Count 2 is in a worst case category, the objective assessment must have regard to the nature and to the extent of the grievous bodily harm referred to in s.27 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    69 In terms of assessing the extent of culpability in terms of premeditation and planning, the evidence establishes that the offender did not bring a weapon to the premises with him, but that, at about the time of forming the intent referred to in s.27, the offender had resort to the fibro cutters that he found on the premises. 
     
      
    70 Whilst I have concluded that I should not accept the Crown’s submission on this issue of the categorisation of the case, I do, of course, accept that this case is one involving such grave culpability that it should be assessed at above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such an offence in terms of s.54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and that both the non-parole period for the offence and the balance of term to be imposed should appropriately reflect that culpability. 
     
      
    71 It is necessary for a sentencing judge to bear in mind that the purposes for which a sentence is to be imposed on an offender are various. The High Court observed in Veen v Regina (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The purposes of criminal punishment are various: protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, retribution and reform. The purposes overlap and none of them can be considered in isolation from the others when determining what is an appropriate sentence in a particular case. They are guideposts to the appropriate sentence but sometimes they point in different directions.” 
        
       
      
    72 A sentencing court is required by s.21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence, to take into account the aggravating and mitigating factors that are relevant and known to the Court as referred to in s.21A(2) and (3) and which are applicable to the offence in question together with any other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    73 The aggravating factors under s.21A(2) that are applicable to the present case are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Section 21A(2)(c) –  
      the actual use of a weapon 
      . In the present case in relation to Count 2, the offender used the fibro cutters, a substantial steel implement, as a weapon to inflict injury on the victim. 
       
       
      (2) Section 21A(2)(d) which provides as an aggravating factor to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence:- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “(d) The offender has a record of previous convictions (particularly if the offender is being sentenced for a serious personal violence offence and has a record of previous convictions for serious personal violence offences).” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The offender in this case has a record of previous convictions and, accordingly, this may be taken into account although, as set out in s.21A(5) of the Act, not necessarily increasing that sentence. The High Court considered the impact of the criminal history of an offender upon sentence in  
        Veen (No 2) 
         (supra) at 477. 
        
       
       
        
        The effect of the prior criminal record of the offender, where it is relevant to sentencing, is not to increase the objective seriousness of the offence. However, an antecedent criminal history may be relevant on the issue as to whether the instant offences in these proceedings reveal a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. If so, in that case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. 
        
       
       
        
        In the present case, the offender’s prior criminal record indicates a conviction in the District Court for an offence of armed robbery causing grievous bodily harm on 1 December 1993 for which he was sentenced to penal servitude for a minimum period of 5 years with an additional term of 5 years. In that matter, the offender’s co-offender fired a revolver saying it was a warning shot. A fragment of the bullet struck one of the victims in the eye causing severe damage. The sentencing judge noted that the offender did not hold the firearm during the robbery. 
        
       
       
        
        In 1997, the offender was convicted of driving offences, in 2001 he was in breach of parole, being returned to former custody for approximately three years between 12 December 2003 and 19 January 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        In 2004, the offender was sentenced in Burwood Local Court to terms of imprisonment of 12 months for an offence of steal property, he being released subject to supervision and to a term of 18 months for an offence of possessing ammunition without holding a licence and being released subject to supervision. 
        
       
       
        
        Parole was revoked on 2 December 2005 for breach of parole, the offender being returned to custody for 1 year and 4 months. I will return to discuss this aspect further. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst the offender’s criminal history reveals a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law, it does not in my opinion require that the sentences to be imposed are to be increased on account of that prior history. The history is, however, relevant in that it disentitles the offender to leniency. 
        
       
       
      (3) Section 21A(2)(eb) –  
      the offence was committed in the home of the victim 
      . A citizen is entitled to the privacy and to the security of their own home. The offender’s actions in entering the victim’s home where she was alone at the time and assaulting her, plainly constitutes an aggravating factor to Counts 2 and 3. 
       
       
      (4) Section 21A(2)(g) –  
      the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence if it was substantial 
      . In this respect, the victim has been left with seriousness cognitive deficits that will impede and limit her capacity for an independent life and will limit her in her employment and her capacity to undertake academic studies. In a young woman of the victim’s age, such losses are substantial indeed and add to the seriousness of the offence in Count 2. 
       
       
      (5) Section 21A(2)(j) –  
      the offence was committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty in relation to an offence or alleged offence 
      . In the present case, in considering Counts 1, 2 and 3, the offender was on parole and had been, not long before, granted bail in respect of outstanding charges concerning the theft of petrol from a petrol station. It is acknowledged that it will be more aggravating if the offence is one similar to that for which the offender is being sentenced. 
       
      
    74 Taking these aggravating factors into account, the offence of which the offender was convicted in respect of Count 2 involved a high level of objective criminality. I will deal separately with the offence in Count 3. 
     
      
    75 The evidence does not, in my opinion, establish any mitigating circumstances and no submission was made on behalf of the offender seeking to identify any mitigating circumstances in terms of s.21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act or otherwise. The absence of mitigation is a relevant factor in the assessment of the level of criminality to which I have referred. 
     
      
    76 The Crown observed that the psychiatric report of Dr Westmore dated 12 July 2007 (Exhibit 1) indicated that the offender had no underlying psychological illness and that he must be taken as having full awareness of what he was doing. The Crown also observed that the offender has not acknowledged his guilt and this reflects adversely on his prospects of rehabilitation. The circumstances of the offences, including the absence of mitigation, was said to point to the offender being, at this stage, dangerous and that caution should be exercised in terms of his release back into the community: Veen (No 2) (supra) at 477. 
     
      
       
      The appropriate sentence in respect of Count 2 
       
      
    77 The maximum penalty for an offence under s.27 of the Crimes Act (count 2), is a term of imprisonment of 25 years. The offence is also subject to a standard non-parole period of 10 years under Division 1A of Part 4 – Standard non-parole periods of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
     
      
    78 The determination of the appropriate sentence in respect of Count 2 is to be assessed by reference to two statutory guideposts or benchmarks. The first is the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence, namely, the term I have referred to, 25 years imprisonment. The second is found in the provisions of s.54B(2) in relation to the standard non-parole period for the offence. I have, accordingly, had close regard to both. In relation to s.54B(2), it is necessary to have regard to the principles enunciated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, [2004] NSWCCA 131. 
     
      
    79 Section 54B(2) states:- 
     
      
       
        
        “When determining the sentence for the offence, the Court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the Court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    80 The reasons for which a Court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in s.21A: s.54B(3). A Court is required to make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. In that respect, the Court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account: see s.54B(4). 
     
      
    81 Applying the provisions of s.54A(2) to Count 2 in the present case, the standard non-parole period of 10 years represents the non-parole period for such an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences identified in the Table to Division 1A of the Act. In Way (supra), the Court has stated at [66]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… a purposive interpretation needs to be applied, by which s.54B(2) should be understood as permitting a departure from the standard non-parole period, wherever the objective seriousness of the individual offence is either lesser or greater than that of an offence in the middle range of seriousness.” 
        
       
      
    82 In the present matter, I have had regard to the observations and to the principles stated by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Way (supra), in particular at pp.185 to 187. The critical focus in the present case is upon both the objective seriousness of the subject offence, and also upon the abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. It is necessary to have regard to what is a mid-range offence so that a meaningful comparison can be made between it and the offence at hand. The Court, in Way, stated (at [85]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “The multiplicity of purposes of sentencing set out in s.3A of the Act … do not suggest a narrow perspective as to the range of facts and matters that are to be regarded as ‘objective’ facts and matters which may affect the judgment involved in assessing ‘seriousness’. It is too narrow a perspective to confine attention to the physical acts of the offender and their effects, as those acts or effects could be observed by a bystander. The inquiry which we consider to have been intended is one that would take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, and those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender …” 
        
       
      
    83 Accordingly, it is relevant in the present matter to have regard to the findings made as to the nature and to the number of the acts committed by the offender against the victim and to his mental state or state of mind at the time of committing the offence and the effects of his actions. In other words, the circumstances that are relevant both to the offence and to the offender are assessed in determining the appropriate level of punishment including, in particular, the appropriate non-parole period. 
     
      
    84 The offence in Count 2 committed by the offender has clearly had a devastating impact upon a young woman who was, at the time of the attack upon her, on the threshold of her adult life. Having successfully completed her secondary schooling she embarked upon her tertiary course of study whilst also holding part-time employment. Her future was full of promise. The progress she has made since the offences were committed has been the product of a combination of highly skilled medical treatment, the help and support of a loving family and her own determination and remarkable courage. 
     
      
    85 It is clear, however, that she has not, on the evidence, regained the level of independence that she previously enjoyed. Dr McCarthy referred in her report of 27 May 2008 to the fact that she has learnt to manage most community tasks but with supervision and prompting. She noted, “without this support, she could not manage independent community living”. Dr McCarthy’s observations were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “10. [The victim] attempted TAFE study but could not cope with the cognitive demands. She also attempted part time work but again her cognitive impairment means that she is likely to be unable to maintain open employment. High level balance and word retrieval difficulties persist and she has difficulty with complex information.” 
        
       
      
    86 Dr McCarthy concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “17. The cognitive difficulties described above are consistent with the extremely severe brain injury that was sustained on 5 [sic] November 2005. There are significant mild improvements from the initial assessment, however further gains are likely to  
        [sic]  
        modest. 
        
       
       
        
        18. I consider that [the victim] will have long-term and permanent effects due to her injury on thinking and memory that will impact adversely on work , study and lifetime goals. [The victim] has learnt to drive. She shows difficulties in areas that may impact on driving safety, particularly speed of information processing, judgement  
        [sic] 
        , quick decision making and visual search. It is considered that these difficulties will impact adversely on her safety with respect to driving. 
        
       
       
        
        19. [The victim] demonstrates the capacity for study at a supported TAFE level.” 
        
       
      
    87 Having regard to the matters which I have identified in the factual findings, and, in particular, the number and nature of assaults which the offender executed with a degree of callousness and ferocity and the effects on the victim, I consider that the offence in Count 2 involves a high level of objective seriousness and moral culpability on the offender’s part. His multiple acts in striking the victim on the head and face with a heavy implement, his state of mind and the consequences of his conduct for the victim constitute the bases or reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period and for the conclusion that they together warrant a longer non-parole period than the standard non-parole period of 10 years. 
     
      
    88 On that basis, I have concluded that an appropriate non-parole period of 14 years, being the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to this offence, together with a balance of the term of the sentence of 4 years and 6 months imprisonment to be appropriate. That non-parole period will be reflected in the sentence that I intend to impose in respect of Count 2. 
     
      
    89 I should add that I have borne in mind the offender’s is presently aged 39 years, his date of birth being 7 December 1968. 
     
      
       
      Count 3: Maliciously damaging by means of fire a dwelling house with intent to endanger life contrary to s.198 of the Crimes Act 
       
      
    90 As I have earlier stated, the maximum penalty for an offence under s.198 is, as I have earlier noted, a term of imprisonment of 25 years. The Crown’s submission was that the offence in Count 3 can be seen as an attempt by the offender to prevent him from being caught for the offences in Counts 1 and 2. As such, the Crown contended it falls within the category of offence described in Kalache (supra) at [18]. In that case, a corruption offence was designed to and had the effect of preventing detection of, and the proper prosecution and punishment of serious drug trafficking offences which fitted within the “worse case” category. In those circumstances it was held that the corruption offence itself had about it those special qualities of unmitigated heinousness apt to bring it also within the “worst case” category. 
     
      
    91 In relation to Count 3, the evidence does not, of course, establish that prior to going to the victim’s house, the offender had an intention to commit and offence under s.198. It is clear on the evidence that he formed that intent at some point after the commission of the offence in Count 2. A worst case under s.198, in my opinion, would include a case where, for example, through vindictiveness or revenge, an offender planned prior to the date of the offence to destroy or damage a dwelling house to endanger the life of another. Premeditation and planning of that kind, of course, is not open on the evidence in the present proceedings. 
     
      
    92 In addition to the factual matters previously referred to concerning Count 3, the Crown relies, in particular, upon the fact that in a very calculating way, the offender doused the victim with petrol as part of the arrangements he implemented to destroy the home and that it must be taken at that time that he was aware that she was still alive and wished to prevent her from ever identifying him. 
     
      
    93 I accept that the evidence does establish beyond reasonable doubt that the offender set upon a course of dousing the house and the victim with petrol, as earlier described, in the knowledge that she was still alive and determined that he would bring about the destruction of the dwelling house and garage thereby endangering her life. I accept the Crown’s submission that the offender’s actions in this regard displayed a calculated course of action by him. I also add that his actions displayed a criminal culpability in relation to Count 3 which calls for a sentence in the upper range for offences of that kind. 
     
      
    94 The absence of evidence of premeditation and planning prior to the offender entering the victim’s home, in my opinion, would prevent Count 3 from the “worst case” categorisation, the subject of the Crown submission, but that in every other respect, it remains, as I have stated, an offence involving a very high level of culpability which I intend to reflect in the sentence to be imposed in respect of Count 3. 
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statement 
       
      
    95 By reason of the provisions of s.27 and s.28 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the Court, if it considers it appropriate to do so, may receive and consider a victim impact statement after conviction and before sentence. In these proceedings, the statement of the victim dated 2 May 2008 was read, without objection, to the Court by her sister. The statement referred, in what I consider to be restrained and unembellished terms, to her difficulties with studying and work and the impact on her in the particular respects to which the statement refers. 
     
      
    96 In considering it, I have done so with regard to the observations in Regina v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; Regina v Berg (2004) 41 MVR 399, [2004] NSWCCA 300 at [48] to [49]; Regina v Slack (2004) NSWCCA 128 at [58] to [62] and to Regina v King (2004) 150 A Crim R 409, [2004] NSWCCA 444. I also take into account that the harm to the victim is a relevant factor at sentence and it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt by evidence tendered by the Crown. The medical evidence to which I have referred establishes to that standard the severity of the harm occasioned to the victim including the continuing disabilities from which she suffers and will continue to suffer indefinitely. 
     
      
       
      Accumulation and totality 
       
      
    97 Because these proceedings involve not one, but three offences, it is essential that each offence is considered individually and an assessment made as to the appropriate sentence for that particular offence. However, it is then necessary to proceed further and to review the aggregate or combined sentences for the three offences and to consider whether the aggregate of the sentences or the sentences in combination are “just and appropriate”. 
     
      
    98 This approach, referred to as the totality principle, must be applied in the present case. It is accepted that the appropriate result may be achieved either by making the sentences partly or wholly concurrent or by lowering the individual sentences below what would otherwise be appropriate in order to reflect the fact that a number of sentences are being imposed. Where practicable, the former is to be preferred: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59, 63, Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, 624 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616. In this case, I intend to adopt that preferred course. 
     
      
    99 In sentencing an offender, a court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody “in relation to the offence”: s.24(a), Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The date for the commencement of a term of sentence is commonly back-dated pursuant to the statutory discretion in s.47(2) of that Act to the date when an offender was first taken into custody for the offence for which he or she is to be sentenced. The Crown has submitted that in this case, the offender was on parole as at the date of the present offences which was subsequently revoked. The offender was convicted on 24 November 2005 for an offence of larceny on 18 September 2005 in Parramatta Local Court. His parole was revoked on 2 December 2005. 
     
      
    100 The Crown submitted that the appropriate commencement date for the sentences to be imposed is 1 April 2007. Exhibit B confirms that the balance of the parole period was a period of 1 year and 4 months, to which I have earlier referred, commencing on 1 December 2005 and expiring on 1 April 2007. 
     
      
    101 The Court has a discretion where pre-sentence custody may be partly referable to the crime for which the offender is to be sentenced for the crimes and partly to some other circumstance, as discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Callaghan v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 58. In that case, Simpson J referred to observations in Regina v SAE (CCA, unreported 3 April 1997) wherein Gleeson CJ referred to the usual principle that allowance is made for pre-sentence custody but only in circumstances where the pre-sentence custody is exclusively referrable to the crime for which the offender is sentenced. Whilst Simpson J in Callaghan observed that this was not to be taken as prescribing an absolute rule and there may be circumstances that warrant the exercise of the discretion. 
     
      
    102 Ms Davenport SC, for the offender, submitted that I had the discretion to determine the commencement date for the sentences back to 1 December 2005 or a date in between that date and another, given the substantial sentence likely to be imposed for the present offences. She submitted that the “more appropriate” date would be 1 December 2005. 
     
      
    103 Simpson J observed in Callaghan (supra), that the time of re-offending in relation to the date of release to parole and the length of the balance of the term to which an offender is exposed may be considered relevant to the question as to whether the time spent in custody up to the expiration of the parole period is referable to the earlier offence and not to subsequent offences. 
     
      
    104 I consider that, having regard to the length of the aggregate non-parole period under the sentences to be imposed, the length of the balance of the parole period of 1 year and 4 months to which I have referred and the principle of totality that the commencement date for the sentence to be imposed in respect of the sentences, should be 8 months prior to 1 April 2007, namely, 1 August 2006, that is, 50% of the 16 months parole period in question. 
     
      
    105 On the basis of the factual findings to which I have referred, upon a consideration of the objective seriousness of the offences together with the aggravating circumstances to which I have referred, I have determined that the appropriate sentences to be imposed are as follows:- 
     
      
    106 In respect of Count 1 (s.86(1)(b), Crimes Act 1900): a non-parole period of 5 years and 6 months to commence on 1 August 2006 and to expire on 31 January 2012 with a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year and 9 months to expire on 31 October 2013. 
     
      
    107 In respect of Count 3 (s.198, Crimes Act 1900): a non-parole period of 12 years to commence on 1 August 2009 and to expire on 31 July 2021 with a balance of the term of the sentence of 4 years to expire on 31 July 2025.  
     
      
    108 In respect of Count 2 (s.27, Crimes Act 1900): a non-parole period of 14 years to commence on 1 August 2012 and to expire on 31 July 2026 with a balance of the term of the sentence of 4 years and 6 months to expire on 31 January 2031.  
     
      
    109 Accordingly, the effective total non-parole period intended and imposed in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3 is a period of 20 years commencing 1 August 2006 and expiring 31 July 2026 with an aggregate or effective total head sentence of 24 years and 6 months commencing 1 August 2006 and expiring 31 January 2031. 
     
      
    110 The earliest date upon which the offender will become eligible to be released on parole, accordingly, will be 31 July 2026. 
     
      
    111 I am conscious of the proportions of the non-parole periods to the total head sentences in respect of Counts 1 and 2 as well as the proportion of the total effective non-parole periods in respect of Counts 1, 2 and 3 to the total effective head sentences in respect of those three counts. In the present case, I consider that such relationship of non-parole periods to the balance of the term of the sentences to which I have referred is justified:- 
     
      
       
      (1) First, by the need for exemplary punishment. 
       
       
      (2) Secondly, by the absence of evidence demonstrating a need for longer parole periods in the interest of the offender’s rehabilitation.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    Introduction 
     
      
    1 This is a trial by judge alone following an election by the accused under s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 made on 6 May 2008. That election, endorsed with the consent of the Crown, was filed in this court on 7 May 2008.  
     
      
    2 The accused is charged with the murder of his son You Qi Foo (""the deceased"") who died on 31 August 2006. The deceased was born in January 2006 and was the second child of the accused and his wife Jui Ying Hoon. Their first son Dunyao was born in January 2003. 
     
      
    3 The accused was born in Singapore in 1973. He was married to Jui Ying Hoon in 2001. They came to Australia on a Permanent Residency Visa in May 2005. At the time of the events that give rise to the present charge, the accused was living with his wife and the deceased, together with his sister and her husband in a townhouse in Telopea, a suburb of Sydney. Their first son was temporarily living in Singapore with the accused's parents in anticipation of the birth of the deceased. 
     
      
    4 At about 11.30am on Tuesday 14 March 2006 the accused and his wife attended Dr Goh Chong Maw at the Meadowbank Medical Centre for the purpose of having the deceased vaccinated for tetanus, diphtheria, inactive poliomyelitis and hepatitis B as well as pneumococcal conjugate. He received two injections, one in each buttock. The deceased was apparently normal after the immunisation and Dr Maw detected no abnormality.  
     
      
    5 The deceased, who had also at all times before that been a normal healthy baby, would appear on one view to have had a mild reaction to the vaccine but in any event to have developed symptoms that made him irritable and increasingly sleepy although restless with a fever and he became uninterested in feeding. This continued for the next several days. On Sunday 19 March 2006 at approximately 3.00pm the accused and his wife took the deceased to their local general practitioner Dr Jeyaratnam at the Carlingford Medical Clinic for a consultation. The doctor advised them that the child was in a satisfactory condition but that if he deteriorated - in particular, if there was any lethargy, decrease in feeding, any further vomiting or bile stained vomitus - they should immediately take the child to Westmead Children's Hospital for treatment. Dr Jeyaratnam was of the opinion that on the day of the presentation the deceased was a reasonably healthy baby. 
     
      
    6 On the morning of Monday 20 March 2006 the condition of the deceased changed dramatically. It will be necessary to return to the circumstances in which this change occurred in more detail later in these reasons. Briefly, however, according to the accused, when he was carrying the deceased from the downstairs portion of the townhouse upstairs to hand him to his wife, the crying or breathing pattern of the deceased audibly changed and he appeared to go soft or limp in the arms of the accused. Rather than attempting to resuscitate the child, or call an ambulance to the premises, the accused and his wife drove immediately to the hospital where he was delivered into the care of the medical staff.  
     
      
    7 The deceased was presented to the Emergency Ward of Westmead Children's Hospital at approximately 9.00am on that day. His mother handed him to Sister Dollarhide at the triage desk. He was by then completely grey in colour, totally limp and was not breathing. It was later determined that the child had had a cardiac arrest. She hooked up the child to oxygen and commenced CPR. He was transferred to the ICU. It took approximately 45 minutes to revive the child. 
     
      
    8 The deceased was in due course found to have sustained injuries that included a right parietal skull fracture, subdural intracranial haemorrhages with subacute collection in the occipital region and posterior fossa, probably of a different age, suspected fractures of the seventh and eighth left ribs, the fourth and fifth right ribs, and a possible fracture of the left humerus. Subsequent examination of the deceased revealed bilateral intra-retinal haemorrhages and a shearing injury to sections of the brain consistent with, or suggestive of, a non-accidental injury such as violent shaking. The deceased was also found to have had early stage vitamin D deficiency with a mild elevation in parathyroid hormone and vitamin C deficiency with no evidence of scurvy. There was no evidence of osteopenia or osteogenesis imperfecta.  
     
      
    9 The deceased continued to be cared for at the hospital in a serious but stable condition for four months before being transferred to the Allawah Hospital at Bexley on 25 July 2006. He remained there until 31 August 2006 when he died from pneumonia secondary to injuries that he had suffered at some time prior to his presentation to Westmead Children's Hospital on 20 March 2006. 
     
      
    The facts 
     
      
    10 Prior to the death of the deceased, the accused gave two electronically recorded interviews to the police and cooperated as well in the making of an audio/video recording of a walk-through of the Telopea premises where he resided with his wife and the deceased. These all became evidence without objection in the proceedings. A third electronically recorded interview with the accused on 9 December 2006 following his arrest on that day was also tendered without objection. It produced no significant material beyond an exercise by the accused of his right to remain silent. 
     
      
    11 The accused did not give evidence. However, his detailed version of the circumstances and of the events that took place between the date of the deceased's immunisation and the presentation to the Emergency Department of the hospital is to be found in the ERISPs conducted on 24 March 2006 and 31 March 2006 and the electronic recording of the walk through of the premises on 19 April 2006. These matters are set out and discussed in more detail below.The first ERISP – 24 March 200612 In the first ERISP the accused said that, on the Tuesday prior to the deceased's admission to hospital, he had been immunised following which he had become quite unsettled with a fever. The accused said the deceased was not very stable and was refusing to eat. On the morning of Monday 20 March 2006 the accused woke up at about eight o'clock. The deceased was crying so he brought him downstairs to try to feed him there but he did not want to eat. The accused put the deceased on a bassinette that was located downstairs and went to the toilet. When he came back from the toilet he could hear the deceased crying louder and louder. The accused said that he then went and picked up the deceased ""very fast"" and tried to pacify him but he continued to cry. He then decided to take the deceased upstairs to pass him to his wife but before he could do so the child's body went soft. He said, ""It's like whole body is just, like, soft and without no, without any energy"". He then passed the baby to his wife, asked her to change, and they rushed him to hospital. 
     
      
    13 The accused said that on the Wednesday following the immunisation they had found that the deceased had ""a big fever"" and so they gave him Panadol. It would appear that he initially improved slightly but after that on Thursday the deceased did not want to sleep. The accused thought he might have had a fever. However, after Thursday he wanted to sleep more and more. The accused said that around Saturday or Sunday the deceased woke up every hour and cried constantly. On Saturday morning the accused went to a trade show but that afternoon the deceased was again not feeding well. He said, ""he just want to sleep"". The accused also said, ""then after sleeping for a while he want to wake up again and cry, cry, cry again. We try to feed him. He still did not want to feed"". 
     
      
    14 On Thursday 16 March 2006 the accused had noticed that the deceased had cracked lips. He noticed this after the deceased had had his face on the accused's shoulder. This was close to midnight and the accused said he was up at that time trying to pacify the deceased and feed him. The accused described how he held the deceased over his shoulder with one hand on his bottom and the other hand supporting his back. The accused noticed that the deceased was crying a lot more on Thursday and Friday and was not taking as much milk from a bottle as normal. 
     
      
    15 The deceased went to visit his uncle between approximately 8.30am and 1.00pm on Sunday. When he returned his wife told the accused that the deceased had vomited. This had a greenish appearance. The accused and his wife were so concerned that they made a call to the Westmead Hotline and described what they had seen. They were advised to take the deceased to a doctor. They took the deceased to Dr Jeyaratnam at about 3.00pm that day. (Dr Jeyaratnam gave evidence that the deceased appeared to her to be normal following the examination that she performed). The deceased would appear to have slept fitfully on that Sunday night waking hourly when he would be fed and comforted. This pattern continued throughout the night until the following morning. 
     
      
    16 The accused described on a number of occasions how he picked the deceased up ""very fast"" from the bassinette that morning. He placed his hands around the baby's chest under his arms and lifted him to a position on his shoulder without supporting his head. The accused said that he then rocked or jiggled or balanced the deceased as he walked around the room attempting once again to pacify him. The accused also described the change in the way that the deceased was crying at the point where his body went soft or limp. The accused said that when he tried to pass the deceased to his wife he said, ""I hear some, the, the crying is, like, a bit different, like, (DEMONSTRATES AUDIBLY), something like this. It's like, I don't know how to describe it but it's, like, not, not very good. Then the whole, then his whole body just become, like, soft"". The accused said that he wanted to pass the deceased to his wife because she could normally ""pacify him easier"".  
     
      
    17 The accused recalled that they arrived at the hospital sometime after 8.30am on Monday 20 March 2006. The accused was subsequently informed that the deceased had had a cardiac arrest. 
     
      
    18 Part of the electronically recorded interview with the accused on 24 March 2006 included the following questions and answers: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And has the hospital spoke [sic] to you about what injuries You Qi does have? 
         
        A. Yeah. It's mentioned that the, the bleeding and, like, the bleeding might be due to, like, shaking of the baby. So, that's the cause of it. So, I'm thinking that that may be caused by me because I'm bringing too fast and that's why I feel very guilty about. 
         
         
        Q. OK. You're saying that the hospital told you that the injuries may have been caused by the shaking of the baby and that you think that that may be when you moved him up? 
         
        A. (NO AUDIBLE REPLY) 
         
         
        Q Is there any other way that you could explain how the injuries occurred? 
         
        A. You mean -? 
         
         
        Q. Is there anything else you know about what has happened to You Qi that could explain his injuries? 
         
        A. No. Probably during the crying I did, like, smack on his buttock and say, hey naughty boy, why not eating, you hungry. 
         
         
        Q. OK. 
         
        A. Yeah."" 
        
       
      
    19 That sequence was followed shortly after by the following questions and answers:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. When you say you, you smacked him on the buttocks and the stomach . . . 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. . . . was that on the same day or a different day or something else? 
         
        A. Yeah, same day. 
         
         
        Q. And how did you smack him on the bottom and buttocks? 
         
        A. So . . . 
         
         
        Q. Sorry, the buttocks and stomach? 
         
        A. So, just smack this way, just hit the buttock and the stomach this way. 
         
         
        Q. O.K, and how hard did you hit him? 
         
        A. I, I don't know but I think should be OK, yeah, not too hard. 
         
         
        Q. Did you notice anything about You Qi after you hit him on the buttocks or stomach? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Did you notice any red marks after you hit him? 
         
        A. No, I didn't really look at it but I think it should be OK. 
         
         
          
         ***** 
         
         
        Q. Did the way that You Qi cry [sic] change after you smacked him on the buttocks and the stomach? 
         
        A. Yeah, a bit, like, like, probably he, he feel the pain. Yeah, because, like, I see (INAUDIBLE) cry a bit and then he settle down again. 
         
         
        Q. Yeah. 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. And, and so you think that he felt the pain because of his change of cry? 
         
        A. Yeah, but the cry is not, like, . . . (DEMONSTRATES AUDIBLY), that way, it's just, it's an increase of, of volume that way and he should be all right."" 
        
       
      
    20 The accused was asked to think very carefully about the time since the deceased was born. He was asked whether or not the deceased had had any other injuries before this. The accused said that the deceased had not had any injuries that had been noticed because he had been smiling and having fun like a normal baby. 
     
      
    21 The accused was asked, ""Have you shaken your baby?"" He replied, ""No. OK, I don't know how you consider shaking. It's like moving and all that"". The accused was then asked, ""Is what you done [sic] of that last week that you've told me about any different from how you've tried to pacify the child in times before that? Is it different or the same or something else?"" The accused asked, ""You mean the carrying method?"" The interviewer said, ""Yes"". The accused replied, ""Yeah, it's different"". 
     
      
    22 Then followed a sequence of questions and answers in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And so how has that been different in the last week? 
         
        A. Sometimes I used this, sometimes I used that but . . . only on Monday that I just pick up very fast that way and then try to pacify this way and just move . . . I guess the way that I move is probably heavier. I mean, rocking heavier, that's causing it. 
         
         
        Q. OK. When you say, rocking heavier, can you explain that more for me? 
         
        A. In this way I walk, I move up and down, this way. 
         
         
        Q. OK. 
         
        A. So . . . 
         
         
        Q. Shaking of a baby is usually, it can be in a lot of different ways but it's being held and being moved quite, how would you describe it? 
         
         
        CONSTABLE HUNTER 
         
         
        Q. Sharply . . . 
         
         
        SENIOR CONSTABLE NORTHEY 
         
         
        Q. Yeah . . . 
         
         
        CONSTABLE HUNTER 
         
         
        Q. . . like, very abrupt movement. 
         
         
        SENIOR CONSTABLE NORTHEY 
         
         
        Q. . . like a, like a, a, it could be, it can be caused by a lot of different ways. The injury could be that there, a sharp push on the ground or it can be continued shaking or it could be trauma or injury from hitting against something. Is there any of these things that have occurred during the time when you were trying to pacify You Qi? 
         
        A. No. I remember I sometimes just carry him this way, just play with him but not the, not the shaking."" 
        
       
      
    23 Slightly later during the same interview, but still referring to the way in which the accused said that he picked up the deceased from the bassinette on the Monday morning, the following series of questions and answers were recorded:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. When you picked him up that way, were you are angry? 
         
        A. (NO AUDIBLE REPLY) 
         
         
        Q. You'd been awake all night, you hadn't slept all night, every hour you were up, were you angry at your child? 
         
        A. Think of it right now, I think there's a bit of anger in there but also anxiousness in there because he's, like, not eating for a few days and say, hey, why are you not eating again and, I say, bringing up this way and just try to calm him down. 
         
         
        Q. That . . . 
         
        A. So, I think there is probably some anger in there. 
         
         
        Q. And you were obviously stressed? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. You're not working, you're, as, as much as possible and the child’s having problems, did you deliberately hurt your child? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Do you know of anyone else that deliberately hurt your child? 
         
        A. No. Everybody love him. I think that's might be the, might be me that is causing the, him to have this discomfort, injury. 
         
         
        Q. You've said that a couple of times. Why do you say that, what makes you say that? 
         
        A. Because I can only remember any situation that I causing that because, because [from my] remember last time I be waking him and hitting of stomach, I think should be all right for my feel and after that he slept normal, with sleeping the normal way so I think he's quite OK. It's only when the whole thing that I bring it up because . . . to have the, the stoppage, I don't know, at that time I don't know what is the stoppage of heart but of causing some, some sudden, different reaction, like the, the softening which I think that may be the, might cause, that causes him that thing to happen and when the doctor told me that there is some blood in the back and also the eye . . . the shaking so then I recall that, that day when I tried to bring up and move it this way, so and rocking, so it maybe might cause . . . anxious or [ could be] like you say, for the anger in there, that rocking too hard causes him to, to have this sort of, his heart collapse over there. 
         
         
        Q. OK 
         
        A. So, that's, that's why I feel that I'm, when the doctor said he’s feel that might be the cause, me that's inflicting the cause of, of having the baby have the sudden collapse. 
         
         
        Q. OK. When you picked You Qi up fast, did you, was there any, did you think, maybe that hurt the child, was there anything that went through your head then or . . . 
         
        A. No, no, I say, that, that time I say, you're crying again, what are you hungry for, you are still not eating? If [ few days] hungry, why you are not eating? You know, I keep, . . . in the night . . . you hungry, maybe your stomach is making noise, why are you not eating, why are you not eating, so when I come from the wee and he's, he's like, he's crying again, it's like quite, quite frustrated in a way, you know. 
         
         
        Q. Yes. 
         
        A. But I was so anxious the way I said, why you not eating? Then this becomes straight away, don't cry, don't cry, that way 
         
         
        Q. OK. 
         
        A. Now, want to just bring him up to my wife because my wife told me, my wife is, like, probably he can [feel is] with my wife is closer, normally my wife can pacify him. Just want to bring him up. It's only then I find that suddenly something is not right and he's just go limp and that's how the whole thing just occur in this."" 
        
       
      
    The second ERISP – 31 March 2006 
     
      
    24 The accused gave another description of what happened on the morning of Monday 20 March 2006. He described once again being upstairs and taking the deceased downstairs to try to pacify him and to give him a drink. However, the deceased did not want to drink and kept ""crying and crying"". The accused put the deceased temporarily on the bassinette and went to the toilet. When he returned the deceased was crying ""louder and louder"", and the accused became anxious. He said, ""I just pick up this way"", demonstrating what he did as he said this. The accused said that he tried to pacify the deceased but, in effect, he continued to cry. He said he decided to take the child upstairs to give to his wife saying, ""because my wife normally have a more soothing effect"". The accused then said the following:  
     
      
       
        
        ""A. OK. So when I go upstairs I was in the, in the room where I'm going to pass it to my wife. Pass the baby to my wife. What happened is that the, there's, the crying sound maybe becomes different, instead of crying become a, there's some difficulty in breathing that kind of noise. . . . Then what happened is that after he just become limp."" 
        
       
      
    25 The accused said that when he put the deceased on the bassinette he did so gently as normal. He was in the bathroom for less than two minutes. He described and demonstrated once again the way in which he picked the child up from the bassinette. He said, ""So I just like hold to his, below his arm . . . pick up fast this way"". The accused said that he did not really remember how the deceased reacted when he picked him up that way. He said, ""What I know is that I just, I just to pick him up, and just, Oh don't cry, don't cry, don’t cry and just . . ."". He said that he probably did not support the child's head when he picked him up.  
     
      
    26 The accused said that the manner in which he picked up the deceased on that morning was probably faster than the normal way that he would pick him up. He was asked whether at any stage he was feeling frustrated by the child not having stopped crying throughout the night. The accused replied, ""Probably but a bit of like more on the worrying side"". 
     
      
    27 The accused was informed that the deceased had a large subdural haemorrhage on his brain and that the doctors had indicated that it had been caused by a non-accidental injury. The accused was asked if he understood what that meant. He replied, ""Not accident, that means that, means done on purpose"". The accused was asked whether or not he knew how the deceased could have sustained such an injury. The accused said that he did not know. He also said that he did not know how it was possible to get such an injury. The accused was told that a shaking of the baby causes the injury. The accused said, in effect, that he did not think anything he had done was ""a shaking movement"". He had never seen his wife shake their son, and he had not seen anyone else do so either. 
     
      
    28 The accused was then informed that the deceased had a fracture to his skull. That part of the interview in which this information emerged is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Yeah we've been told that there's a, a fracture to his skull. 
         
        A. Huh? 
         
         
        Q. OK. So there's a fracture on his skull and doctors have informed us that that is from a, an impact or a trauma to his skull. Do you understand that? 
         
        A. How's that, happen? 
         
         
        Q. I don't know, I'm asking you. You know how it could have happened? 
         
        A. No, I, I, I don't know. 
         
         
        Q. OK. 
         
        A. So how, how, how can, it can't be? 
         
         
        Q. OK But doctors have told me, OK. That someone has had to have thrown him or dropped him or hit him on the head with something. Have you ever thrown You Qi? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Have you ever dropped You Qi? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Have you ever thrown anything at You Qi? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. OK. Has, have, has anyone done that to You Qi to your knowledge? 
         
        A. Not that I know of."" 
        
       
      
    29 The accused was then informed about a number of other injuries apparently sustained by the deceased. The accused said that he did not have any knowledge of how such injuries could have been caused. The accused was also asked whether or not he knew anything in relation to fractures to two of the deceased's ribs. He replied, ""Is it because the day I, I came too fast that . . . me? I'm not sure how, how it's been caused"". The accused said that he had never seen anyone else lose control whilst they were caring for the deceased. 
     
      
    30 The accused referred once again to the incident at the bassinette. He said, ""I am anxious that he's keep crying so I just picking up faster . . . I don't know why that day I just pick up this way. Probably it's, I am worried and anxious"". Then followed these questions and answers:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What makes you think that the way you picked You Qi up could have caused these injuries? 
         
        A. OK. Because he goes, I mean, . . . he, he go limp after I bring him up. So when we bring him to hospital, you see him like in critical condition and during that time I'm keep asking whether it’s myself that, that bring him up too fast that causes him to like suddenly like, like, happen and, and just like how I say like, go limp or, or, or become in a critical condition so I'm keep, that's why in the hospital I keep thinking whether I'm the one that bring him up this way and cause a sudden, sudden like . . . 
         
         
        Q. So do you think that the way you picked You Qi up may have caused these injuries? 
         
        A. I don't know whether the way that I pick him up causes the injury but I know I'm anxious that time and I want to try to calm him down and pacify him but because of all the series of things happen I . . . him up . . . and suddenly he just go limp so I thought I might be the person that caused because seeing him in, in the hospital that way with all the tubes and all that is very sad and I keep thinking whether is it me that causes him to be in that situation. 
         
         
        Q. Mmm. 
         
        A. So in actual fact for, until now I'm still feeling very guilty whether I'm the one or is it, the action that I, I bringing up that, that causes him to be that way. 
         
         
        Q. So once you picked him up fast? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. How did you then hold him? 
         
        A. I just put him over my shoulder. Like when I mentioned that I just walk around and just pat him. 
         
         
        Q. OK. 
         
        A. That way, so but this thing has been making me feel very guilty because I keep thinking whether is it me that, that causes him to, because he fall soft on me. So I don't know whether you had this . . . but."" 
        
       
      
    31 While he was at the hospital the accused had a conversation with Michelle Jubelin. Ms Jubelin gave evidence at the trial and this is referred to in more detail later. During the course of his second electronically recorded interview the accused was asked about whether or not he had had a conversation with her. The questions and answers relating to that topic are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. OK. Do you remember anything else about that conversation you had with Michelle? 
         
        A. Yeah. Because after talking about that because of that I, I thought I might be the person that, that is causing You Qi to be . . . then she mentioned going to be, thing, some, somewhat, some child protection unit and some police is, is coming in. 
         
         
        Q. Mmm Mmm. 
         
        A. So then I feel worse because what happen is that it means I will probably be charged because police coming and police going to arrest me or . . . 
         
         
        Q. Mmm Mmm. 
         
        A. . . . I don't know what the police could do to me so but that's why I'm feeling that time. And probably I'm going to be charged so what happened is that then I asked her, What is the consequences for, for, I say, If the police come and will I be charged or whatever? Because I love my family so I want to like prepare, let's say if I charged what will happen to my family, I just want to know and because what happen is, I just want to know what happened to me so that I can do some plans for my family. I don't want to leave them like dangling and in difficulty so that's why I, I remember did ask her something like that. 
         
         
        Q. Mmm Mmm. 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. What makes you think you'd be charged? 
         
        A. Like when I told you that time, that situation where the doctor tell me. 
         
         
        Q. Mmm Mmm. 
         
        A. OK. The baby is, is having that kind of injury and it's due to like, like what you mentioned the, the, the shaking of the baby. 
         
         
        Q. Mmm Mmm. 
         
        A. So the first thing I thought about, that I can think about is during the time . . . or not. 
         
         
        Q. Mmm Mmm. 
         
        A. So that might be shaking him. 
         
         
        Q. Mmm Mmm. 
         
        A. That . . . that's what I feel. So and that's why I might be the one that causes him to have that kind of, that, that he like . . . say, faint or, or in the kind of critical condition so I blame myself for that. 
         
         
        Q. Mmm Mmm. 
         
        A. So, and then Michelle told me that the police would come, that means it's probably, for the police to come and arrest me so that's, make me feel that way, that time."" 
        
       
      
    32 It was explained to the accused that the deceased had injuries that appeared to have been sustained at different times. He was asked how he felt about that. The accused gave the following answer: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Which means that probably one of the injury's not done by me. Why I say so because let's say one of, one of the date is caused by me in bringing him up, then they say old injury that means it's done some other time so I don't know whether it happens where he, he fall or whatever, I'm not sure, what might cause the, the injury at the other position. So but, if you say that's just one then I suspect it might be me during that time that, that carry him because we just . . . the time that I carry him very fast during that time. 
        
       
      
    33 The accused was later asked whether or not it was reasonable to believe that he could have caused the injuries sustained by the deceased. He gave the following answer: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. I'm not sure but, but only that time, I only feel that after picking up I causes him to go and to, to, to, to be at that critical condition so I keep blaming myself but I don't know whether this injury is due, is caused by my movement that way that causes him to be that way."" 
        
       
      
    34 The accused was asked whether or not he thought it was reasonable to hit an 11 week-old baby on the stomach or the bottom. He replied, ""Well I'm not doing a hard hit, if it's hard then it's not reasonable, OK"". The accused was also asked once again whether or not he thought he was the one who caused the injuries to the deceased. He replied, ""No"". He expanded upon that answer in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Because I love my baby, OK. So if that causes the baby to be that way so and if that happens I feel very, very guilty and that's why I, I say the things so because during that time emotionally I'm very sad. And I say the only way I can, my heart is so painful during that time because I thought I'm the one that causes the baby to be that way so if I would be punished because of that I will feel better because my heart is really painful during that time. 
         
         
        Because I keep thinking that I'm, I'm, I might be the one that's causing the baby to be that way after I carry him. So I can blame myself, I feel guilty, so when he told me that the police is here and what, I say, I'm just like, all right, you want to do whatever, do it to me."" 
        
       
      
    35 Finally, it was suggested to the accused that Michelle Jubelin had been told by the accused that, because he had caused the injury, he was concerned about whether or not he would have to pay hospital expenses related to his son's admission. The accused responded as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""A. So if let's say I'm charged or whatever, nobody's earning anything for my family so how are we going to pay the bill if that's going to happen 'cause I don't want to put my family in a financial difficulty during that time. 
         
         
        Yeah because I'm worry about what my wife, my kid in future will be like if I say I'm being, really being charged so what will happens [sic] to me so I want to know all this and just prepare."" 
        
       
      
    The walk through – 19 April 2006 
     
      
    36 The accused participated in an electronically recorded walk-through at the Telopea premises during the course of which he again demonstrated and described what happened on Monday 20 March 2006. The things said and done by the accused on that occasion were consistent with his descriptions and demonstrations of what occurred on that day given during his electronically recorded interviews. 
     
      
    Other evidence 
     
      
    Dr Jeyaratnam 
     
      
    37 The evidence of Dr Jeyaratnam was not the subject of controversy. Her clinical observations of the deceased on the afternoon of Sunday 19 March 2006 were that he was then a normal baby with symptoms that were not suggestive to her of any non-accidental injury. She was unable to exclude a surgical problem in the bowel, meaning something that could not be detected conclusively upon clinical examination. She gave advice that the parents should take the baby to emergency if there was any lethargy or decreased feeding or vomiting or bile stained vomitus. 
     
      
    38 She was cross-examined about her observations of the accused and his wife: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did both parents seem concerned about the baby's health and welfare? 
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Did either of them deal with you in a defensive way at all, or were they open to your treatment, examination and diagnosis? 
         
        A. They were open to my treatment and examination, yeah.""  
        
       
      
    Keng Boon Foo 
     
      
    39 The sister of the accused and her husband gave evidence in the Crown case by way of written statement about what occurred on and after 20 March 2006. These witnesses were not cross-examined on their statements as they were in Singapore and unavailable to give oral evidence at the trial. No application was made for their evidence to be given by audiovisual link. Mr Boulten SC on behalf of the accused conceded that the grounds for the tender of those statements had been made out but sought to reserve his position to the extent that some material in one of them appeared to be inconsistent with the version of events given by the accused. Mr Boulten sought to emphasise that the position that he adopted ought not to be construed as an acceptance by him of the allegedly inconsistent evidence as the preferred version of events that it described. The uncle of the accused gave evidence about events on Sunday 19 March 2006. Matthias Pfeiffer, the accused's employer also gave evidence concerning some aspects of the accused's employment and related issues. 
     
      
    40 The accused's sister Keng Boon Foo returned to Singapore recently. The Crown applied to rely upon a statement given by her on 14 April 2006. This was not opposed. At that time she was living with the accused and his wife and her husband at the Telopea premises as previously described. 
     
      
    41 Ms Foo said that at the end of January 2006 the accused and his wife took the deceased to Singapore to visit her parents. She and her husband Hartanto Hartanto were already there at that time having arrived a week earlier. She and her husband returned to Australia in early to mid February. The accused with his wife and the deceased followed a week or so later. 
     
      
    42 Ms Foo said that since the birth of the deceased she and her husband had never been left alone with him to baby sit. The accused and his wife had always been present. She played with the deceased in the presence of his parents. The parents were his main carers. 
     
      
    43 It was Ms Foo's opinion that her brother and sister-in-law were good parents. She described the deceased as very fussy. He had to be fed at a certain angle and in a certain way. He liked to be picked up and carried all the time. Her brother and sister-in-law were the only ones who fed him. She sometimes heard the deceased crying during the night but not very often. She said that she was a heavy sleeper. 
     
      
    44 Ms Foo was aware that the deceased had been taken to be immunised on 14 March 2006. She remembers that date, as she was unwell and stayed home from work. The deceased's parents left in the morning and returned sometime in the afternoon. When they arrived home, the deceased was irritable. By that she meant ""uncomfortable"". He cried and he would go to sleep and wake up and cry again. After his immunisation the deceased was more irritable than normal. She said he was ""different"". He would be alright for a while and happy to play and then he would start to cry. He became fussier with his feeds. 
     
      
    45 Ms Foo recalls that one morning she went downstairs and her sister-in-law was there already and she commented that the deceased had been awake all night. When she returned from work later that day she was told that the deceased had been asleep all day. On Sunday 19 March 2006 she went out and when she returned her brother and sister-in-law were not at home. They arrived late in the afternoon. They informed her that they had taken the deceased to a doctor in Carlingford. Ms Foo said that the deceased seemed to be alright. 
     
      
    46 She did not hear the deceased crying at all during the night of 19 March 2006. On the morning of 20 March 2006 she said she awoke at about 7.00am. She went to the bathroom, brushed her teeth, changed her clothes and left for work. That was her usual routine. She thought that she would have left the house between 7.30am and 7.45am. She and her husband left at the same time as he drove her to work. When they left she recalled that her brother and sister-in-law were not up. She assumed that they were still asleep as the door to their bedroom was closed and there was no noise coming from within. 
     
      
    47 Ms Foo received a telephone call from her husband at around 9.00am to inform her that the deceased was then being taken to hospital by his parents. She went to the Westmead Children's Hospital after work to visit him. She spoke to her brother and sister-in-law and they were what she described as both in shock and very sad about the deceased. She said that they were unsure what was wrong with him.  
     
      
    48 On the evening of 24 March 2006, Ms Foo went to the hospital to see the deceased. When she arrived she spoke to her sister-in-law who told her that her brother had been taken to Parramatta Police Station to be interviewed. She said, ""The doctors have said that You Qi has severe bleeding at the back of the head, behind the eyes and more on the left eye and it could cause permanent brain damage"". Ms Foo said, ""What [sic] the cause?"" Her sister-in-law replied, ""Due to shaking"". Ms Foo replied, ""How do you mean shake?"" The deceased's mother did not say anything. Ms Foo thought she was crying and so she did not ask her anything further. 
     
      
    49 Ms Foo said that prior to 20 March 2006 the deceased was a happy child. He would smile at her when she played with him and he would respond and always make sounds himself. She said that her brother and sister-in-law were very happily married. The accused is very mild and very softly spoken. She said, ""He wouldn't hurt anyone"". The accused and his wife shared in the care of the deceased. His mother would normally express her milk in the bedroom during the day and in the bathroom at night. The accused is a very good father who would help to look after the deceased. His parents would take turns in nursing him if he were upset. They were both very patient when they were attempting to pacify him when he was crying. She said that her brother and sister-in-law are both Buddhist and are very dedicated to their religion. 
     
      
    50 Finally, Ms Foo said that she had never seen her brother or sister-in-law shake the deceased. She had only seen them nursing him in their arms and rocking him gently. Moreover, she had only ever seen them pat him gently on his nappies. She had seen them pat him on his back when they were trying to burp him. 
     
      
    Hartanto Hartanto 
     
      
    51 Hartanto Hartanto is Ms Foo's husband. He also gave a statement dated 14 April 2006. He said that he was a self-employed photographer and worked from home. He confirmed that about two months before the deceased was born the accused took Dunyao back to Singapore so that his grandparents could look after him. The accused and his wife wanted to be able to devote all their time to the new baby when he was born. This would have been difficult with a three-year-old child around. 
     
      
    52 The accused was only away in Singapore for a couple of weeks and was home when the deceased was born. The accused and his wife were very happy. The deceased came home from hospital two or three days after he was born. The accused took a couple of weeks off work to help his wife with the new baby. He cooked and prepared things for his wife and generally looked after her so that she could look after the deceased. His wife was very weak after the birth and she stayed in bed most of the day for at least four or five days. 
     
      
    53 For the first month the deceased mostly slept and was very demanding. About a month after he was born his parents took him to Singapore for Chinese New Year. They were away in Singapore for about two to three weeks. When they returned only the deceased came with them. He said that they wanted to look for an apartment of their own because it was a bit crowded at the house in Telopea with everybody there. They wanted to find a place of their own before Dunyao came home. In general terms the deceased seemed to be a bit more demanding than his brother. He appeared to cry more often and seemed more particular about certain things. 
     
      
    54 Hartanto confirmed that about five days before the deceased was admitted to hospital he was immunised. Following that he was crying a lot more for about three days. He was not sleeping very well. Due to the nature of his work, Hartanto sometimes had to work through the night and his office was next to the bedroom where they slept. He could hear the deceased wake during the night and he could hear the deceased's parents wake up. Sometimes the deceased would settle down and go back to sleep for maybe three to four hours but at other times it was worse and he might only go back to sleep for an hour or so. 
     
      
    55 During this time the accused was not at work very much and was mostly at home. Both the accused and his wife were very tired due to lack of sleep. He told them that it was normal for babies to cry from time to time and that they just had to be patient. He said that there were about two days when the deceased was crying a lot and not sleeping very well and his parents took him to a doctor during the daytime. Later that day they were at home talking over dinner as a family and the accused and his wife told him that the doctor was not too worried about the deceased who was probably just unsettled by the immunisation. They were told to take him back to the doctor in a couple of days if he did not improve. 
     
      
    56 On the morning of Monday 20 March 2006 Hartanto got up and was moving around the house. At about 7.15am he turned on the computer in his office but did not hear any noise coming from the bedroom of the accused. At about 8.00am he drove his wife to work at West Ryde and stopped locally to have breakfast. He was there for about 15 to 20 minutes and then drove home. He arrived back at about 8.45am. 
     
      
    57 When he got home the accused was trying to feed a bottle to the deceased in the dining room. The deceased looked like he was refusing to feed. The accused was sitting in a chair with the deceased cradled in his arm. He was supporting the deceased's back with his arm and the deceased's head was resting on his upper arm and chest. The accused was in his sleeping clothes. He did not remember what the deceased was wearing but he was not wrapped up in a blanket. 
     
      
    58 The accused said to him, ""The baby is not feeding again"". He said, ""You better bring You Qi to the hospital"". The accused replied, ""OK"". Just about the same time that this was happening, the accused's wife came downstairs dressed in her pyjamas. She was washing up some bottles and things she used to express her milk. Both she and the accused were very worried and she was crying. From the accused's face he could tell that the accused was upset. In his estimation, both the accused and his wife were more upset than he had seen them in the past. This was particularly so in the last few minutes before they went to hospital that morning. 
     
      
    59 The accused passed the baby to his wife and went upstairs to pack some things. Hartanto stayed with the deceased's mother. The deceased was crying and his mother was unable to settle him. This was all happening in the space of a few minutes and Hartanto said that he was upset and worried about what was going on as well. The accused and his wife left the premises with the deceased destined for the hospital. A couple of hours later the accused rang him at home and told him that they would be at hospital for a few hours. He was not told anything of the deceased's condition. That night he went to the hospital with his wife and saw the deceased. It was at that time that he learnt that the deceased was very sick. 
     
      
    60 Hartanto was informed that the deceased was being treated for a range of problems, including having been shaken vigorously. He said that in his observations of how the accused and his wife had looked after the deceased, he had never seen them mistreat him in any way. Neither the accused nor his wife had said anything to him since the deceased went into hospital that suggested that they knew how he was injured. He said that he had no knowledge of his own about how the deceased had come to sustain his injuries. 
     
      
    Boong Chong Neo 
     
      
    61 The accused's uncle Boong Chong Neo gave evidence that the accused visited him on Sunday 19 March 2006 at his premises at Chester Hill. This was a regular occurrence. The accused arrived at about 9.00am and left at about 12.30 or 1.00pm. He came alone. The accused is his sister's son. She informed him on the afternoon of the following day that the deceased had been taken to hospital. 
     
      
    62 Although the accused would normally stay for lunch, on the Sunday in question he informed Mr Neo that the deceased was ill and that he had to leave early to take him to a doctor. Mr Neo spoke in praiseworthy terms about all aspects of the accused's character. He regarded him as honest, with no bad habits and said implicitly that he was a good father. 
     
      
    Matthias Pfeiffer 
     
      
    63 Matthias Pfeiffer was called in the Crown case. He worked with the accused in a computer consulting engineering company. They worked closely together. He said that the accused was trustworthy and never came into conflict with customers. Their work was very stressful and the accused was good at his job. The accused continues to be employed by this company. Mr Pfeiffer spends between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of his time at work with the accused. They travel interstate to the premises of clients. Mr Pfeiffer visited the accused at his home on a few occasions for a meal. He said, ""I have never seen Jeong Ming aggressive or lose his temper in professional life or social life"". He also said, ""Jeong Ming has my complete trust"". The accused had never confided in Mr Pfeiffer about any inappropriate handling by him of the deceased. Mr Pfeiffer said that he would be very surprised to learn that the accused might have done that. 
     
      
    Witnesses at the hospital 
     
      
    Allyson Jeans 
     
      
    64 Allyson Jeans was employed at the Westmead Children's Hospital in 2006. She provided a statement dated 30 May 2006 for use in this trial. 
     
      
    65 The deceased came under her care on Tuesday 21 March 2006, the second day of his admission to the hospital. She had a conversation with the accused at the hospital on Wednesday 22 March 2006. He was at the ICU with his wife and she sat next to him and asked what was wrong and whether he had any questions. Although she said that she did not remember his exact words, the accused asked her if he could have hurt the deceased or done ""this"" to him when he was crying. Whilst the accused was asking her these questions he was patting his shoulder as if he were holding the child. She said, ""This was to show me how he had patted You Qi"". This was demonstrated in court during her evidence in chief. The following questions and answers related to that demonstration: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Are you able to show his Honour, and stand up or however this is comfortable for you, to the best of your recollection what it was that Mr Foo did? What actions he actually did in relation to that point in your statement, paragraph 7?  
         
        A. He was sitting down next to the bedside and basically had his hands cupped and was just patting like this and was concerned that possibly why You Qi was so sick was because he was trying to console him prior to him getting ill.  
         
         
        Q. Just stop there. I'm seeking from you most of all a physical demonstration that his Honour can understand what it is that was shown. As I observed you, and I can't see all of you, you appeared with your right hand in front of you with your palm facing towards your chest with a palm at just below shoulder height and quite gently pat yourself on the chest? 
         
        A. As if he was consoling a baby, yep. As if he was consoling the baby.  
         
         
        Q. That was the action that was demonstrated to you at that time?  
         
        A. Correct.  
         
         
        Q. And is that the only action that you can recall him demonstrating to you before the conversation moved on to what the numbers on the monitor meant?  
         
        A. Correct."" 
        
       
      
    66 Ms Jeans said that she tried to console the accused ""and told him that you would have to shake a baby pretty hard to do damage to the baby's brain"". The accused then asked her about all the numbers on the monitor that displayed such things as respiratory rate, heart rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide measurement. To her observation, both the accused and his wife ""appeared visibly upset and not out of the norm from [her] experience in working in the PICU"". She said, ""they were equally distressed about You Qi's appearance"". 
     
      
    67 Later that afternoon Ms Jeans saw Michelle Jubelin in the ward at the PICU. She told her of the conversation that she had had with the accused. She said she did this, as she ""was concerned for his welfare"". She said ""both the parents pretty much sat next to the bedside for the duration of the two days of me looking after You Qi"". She described them as ""understandably upset"". 
     
      
    Michelle Jubelin 
     
      
    68 Michelle Jubelin gave a statement dated 28 March 2006. On 24 March 2006 she took part in a meeting with the accused and his wife and Dr Wilkins during which it was explained that the deceased had been found to have sustained subdural and retinal haemorrhages. She said that the deceased's mother appeared very composed and asked questions about his (then) long-term prognosis. The accused started to slump over and put his hand on his forehead. He appeared to be upset. 
     
      
    69 Miss Jubelin said that she later explained her role. When all the doctors had left the room she asked the accused and his wife, ""Were you surprised by what Dr Wilkins has just explained to you about You's injuries?"" She said that at this point the accused became quite teary and said, ""No. I picked You up from the bed and I didn't support his head and I patted him very hard"". As he did so the accused demonstrated picking up a baby, putting it over his shoulder and patting it with his hands. Ms Jubelin said that he placed his hands one under the other, just above chest height, with his arms out horizontal and parallel to one another and moved them back and forth at the same time. The accused said, ""I may have hit him too hard. The baby started to cry louder and when I went to give baby to [my wife] when we noticed the baby's breathing was funny"". 
     
      
    70 Ms Jubelin said that she did not ask any further questions about how it happened. She said that she went on to explain what he needed to do about liaising with CPU and DOCS. She said that the accused was visibly upset and said, ""I don't care what punishment I get, I deserve it"". There was then a short silence and the accused's wife said, ""Would you mind leaving us alone at this stage"". Ms Jubelin then left the room. 
     
      
    71 About ten minutes later she was walking past the interview room when the accused wife came out and asked if they could ask some questions. She went back into the room and sat down with them. She was asked what would now happen. Ms Jubelin explained that it was early days but that she would be making a report to DOCS and that someone would want to come and talk to them as well. The accused then said, ""Will I be arrested?"" She replied, ""I'm not sure at this stage what the process will be"". The accused asked, ""What is the worst scenario?"" She replied, ""If You died, you could be charged as a result"". The accused said, ""Because I caused injury, will I have to pay to the medical costs of You whilst he is in hospital?"" A few days later the accused's wife said to her, ""I don't understand, we are not a violent family"". 
     
      
    72 Ms Jubelin demonstrated in the witness box the movements shown to her by the accused that are described above. She gave the following evidence to explain what she saw: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Now you're doing that in a fairly gentle fashion?  
         
        A. Right.  
         
         
        Q. Is that what was done at the time?  
         
        A. The movements I was doing was pretty much what the father was doing.  
         
         
        Q. And the speed, you think you replicated the speed?  
         
        A. Pretty much so, yes.""  
        
       
      
    73 Ms Jubelin went on to give the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. The long and the short of it is: you accept that he demonstrated picking the child up without the head being supported, you can't remember how he did it; is that right?  
         
        A. That's correct.  
         
         
        Q. Your demonstration in court today about what he did when he had the baby up to his chest had, what the Crown Prosecutor described as, a fairly gentle approach; is that right?  
         
        A. Yes, it was his words, I guess, that went with the demonstration 
        
       
      
    74 Ms Jubelin was asked specifically about the issue of whether the deceased had been shaken. She gave the following evidence about that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Did you think that the accused was telling you that he shook the baby?  
         
        A. I formed the interpretation that the accused was telling me that he may have contributed to the medical information the doctor had just given him.  
         
         
        Q. That's clear enough from your statement, but focusing on the word ""shake or ""shook"". Did you interpret his information both visual and oral as conveyed to you as him shaking the baby?  
         
        A. By his movements and his verbal discussion with me I got the impression that this baby had been shaken in some way.  
         
         
        Q. Although neither anything he said or did really was what an ordinary person would describe as shaking, is it?  
         
        A. I guess when he was saying he was hitting the baby quite hard my interpretation was that that would cause the baby to shake because of the words that dad was using.""  
        
       
      
    75 A little later she gave this evidence about a note of her conversation that she recorded at the time: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You said in part that the accused explained that You was crying in his bed, he picked him up, placed him over his shoulder stating that he wasn't supporting his head and began to shake him while he was over his shoulder?  
         
        A. That's correct.  
         
         
        Q. He never used the word ""shake"", did he?  
         
        A. Not to my recollection today.  
         
         
        Q. It's not in your statement, is it?  
         
        A. No, it's not.  
         
         
        Q. And he didn't demonstrate a shake, did he?  
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    76 Ms Jubelin was re-examined on her use of the word ""shake"" in the following passages: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Nevertheless, when you completed the note that you completed in the hospital record you used the word ""shake""; is that correct?  
         
        A. I did.  
         
         
        Q. Can you read out the whole of the passage that you recorded concerning the use of the word ""shake""?  
         
        A. So you want me to read out the whole?  
         
         
        Q. Yes, please. 
         
        A. 'Meeting held with parents, Barry Wilkins and myself to discuss results of test. Barry explained that as a result of the retinal and subdural haemorrhage we need to refer to CPU and that a report to the Department of Community Services needs to be made. After the meeting with Barry I asked the parents if they were surprised by the findings. Dad became very teary and disclosed that he was not surprised. He then proceeded to say that on Monday, 20 March You Qi had been restless all night and both parents had minimal sleep. He explained that You was crying in his bed and he picked him up and placed him over his shoulder stating that he wasn't supporting his head  
        and begun to shake him while he was over his shoulder 
        . He then describes his crying getting louder and he then gave him to mum and they noticed that his breathing began to go funny. Have explained to dad that we will be referring to CPU and that a report to DOCS will be made. Contacted the DOCS helpline, reference number 1-7JMHPS, and have liaised with Mark Palmer from CPU who will be following up. Mark has also advised Lara Hodgen from JIRT will continue to follow up."" (Emphasis added)'."" 
        
       
      
    Suzanne Foley 
     
      
    77 Suzanne Foley was a social worker at the Westmead Children's Hospital in 2006. She was present with Dr Norrie when the accused gave the demonstration of how he picked up the deceased from the bassinette on Monday 20 March 2006, to which reference is made elsewhere in these reasons. Her description of what she observed is in accordance with all other versions of the same event. 
     
      
    The expert medical evidence 
     
      
    Dr Wong 
     
      
    78 A paediatric radiologist, Dr Wong, called in the Crown case, reported that chest x-rays of the deceased on 20 March 2006 demonstrated a healed fracture involving the fourth and fifth ribs on the right. These fractures would have occurred at least three weeks prior to the date of the x-ray as they had almost completely healed. Plain x-rays of the humeri and right tibia performed on 7 April 2006 demonstrated periosteal reaction along the shaft of the bones consistent with posttraumatic remodelling reaction. These injuries appear to have occurred a few days before 23 March 2006, but could have occurred up to seven days earlier. A CT head examination on 25 March 2006 demonstrated a non-displaced skull fracture of the parietal bone and bilateral haematomas, larger on the left side. There were also bilateral subdural haematomas in the posterior fossa also greater than two weeks of age. There was fresh blood at the interhemispheric fissure between the two cerebrums of less than ten days of age.  
     
      
    79 Dr Wong was of the opinion that the presence of new and old blood in the subdural space of the brain and the shearing injuries to the brain were most likely to have occurred with shaking of the deceased. The healed or healing rib fractures that he observed and evidence of acute bony injuries without fractures of the humeri and right tibia were most likely in his opinion related to compression of the chest wall during handling and rough handling of the limbs. This was all consistent with non-accidental injuries of the head and skeletal system that occurred on different occasions. 
     
      
    80 Dr Wong expanded upon his report in oral evidence. He spoke of the healing fractures of the fourth and fifth ribs on the right. He said that they had occurred at least three weeks prior to the first x-ray. He also said that there was no way of aging the separation of skull sutures in an 11-week-old infant. Accordingly, there was no way of knowing how long that condition (being the parietal fracture of the deceased's skull) had persisted. He said, ""the degree of separation of the skull sutures depend[ed] on the size of the expanding abnormality in the brain. It [did not] relate to how long the abnormality ha[d] been there"". 
     
      
    81 Dr Wong was asked questions about the degree of force that might be required to lead to a fracture of the humerus of a child of the age of the deceased. His evidence was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And what sort of force would you expect would create an artefact such as we've seen here?  
         
        A. Which?  
         
         
        Q. In relation to the healing on the humerus?  
         
        A. As far as I could tell there were no fractures. The abnormality was picked up on a bone scan and we do know that bone scans are more sensitive in picking up a mild degree of trauma or early fractures. So the fractures were not shown on plain x-rays, so I think the degree of force that was required to cause those changes on the left seven and eight ribs would be less than the force that is required to cause a fracture.  
         
         
        Q. And what sort of force would you expect would be necessary to create the seventh and eighth rib injury?  
         
        A. Again, it's a very difficult question to answer, but any form of squeezing or rough handling of the ribs would cause that degree of reaction. Again, less force is required as compared to a fracture.  
         
         
        Q. If we can just do it on a simple scale of ""mild, moderate and severe"", what would you attribute to this form of injury?  
         
        A. Moderate. "" 
         
         
          
         ***** 
         
         
         
        Q. Right, if we can go back to the left arm bone. On a mild, moderate and severe scale, what level of force would you expect had been necessary to create the injury that you saw to the long bone?  
         
        A. Again, moderate force.  
         
         
        Q. Moderate. And what type of force are we speaking of here for this injury?  
         
        A. Any form of rough handling would cause that degree of injury.  
         
         
        Q. And would that include holding the child by its arms?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And moving it unsupported?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Any other particular form of handing of the child likely to create such an injury?  
         
        A. Probably not. I think that's probably the most likely situation.""  
        
       
      
    82 He also said that a moderate degree of force would have been required to cause an injury apparently detected to the deceased's right tibia. He said:  
     
      
       
        
        "". . . the injury of the right tibia would be caused by a similar situation as what you described with the right humerus. It's basically holding onto the tibia or the leg or the lower leg, and maybe lifting the child without support and there may be a degree of twisting injury as well in that situation.""  
        
       
      
    83 Dr Wong agreed that the deceased's injuries to his tibia and his humerus could have been caused as many as 10 days prior to 23 March 2006. 
     
      
    84 The deceased was diagnosed as having sustained a shearing injury to the brain that caused loss of consciousness and cardiac arrest. Several medical specialists expressed the opinion that his death was as the result of that injury. Dr Wong shared that view. When asked to describe what such an injury involved, he gave the following explanation: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Can you describe to his Honour the nature of those injuries, please?  
         
        A. Okay. It was not just the corpus callosum, but also the deep white matter of the brain. The external capsules and the occipital lobes. These are just various parts of the brain, and the injuries are known as ""shearing injuries"", and what it is, is the effect from the acceleration and deceleration forces on the head. Basically the brain consists of grey matter and white matter. The grey matter is where the neurons or the brain cells are, and white matter is the nerve fibres. So there is a junction between the grey matter and the white matter in the brain, and it is this particular location that shearing injuries occur because there is a slight difference in density between white and grey matter, and when you have an acceleration and deceleration injury you get shearing forces at the border between grey and white matter.  
         
         
        Q. So there is in effect a separation of the matter; is that correct?  
         
        A. Not a true separation, but more of a shearing injury.  
         
         
        Q. It's the word shearing that I'm trying to get some satisfactory definition or understanding of, doctor. In relation to the two types of matter, the grey and the white, you told us they are slightly different densities?  
         
        A. That's right.  
         
         
        Q. What is it that actually happens when the shearing forces are applied?  
         
        A. When you have acceleration and deceleration forces what happens is, because of the difference in density of the two masses, you have a different amount of momentum going forwards, and when there is an abrupt deceleration you would have also a different amount of momentum between the two separate matters. And because of the difference in momentum there is, in actual fact, a difference in the forward and backward movements of both matters.""  
        
       
      
    85 He described what he considered to be the mechanism of the cause of these injuries: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Are you able to say from either the location of the injuries, or any other aspect of your observation of these shearing injuries, what the nature of any shearing force was that was applied?  
         
        A. The nature of the shearing force would be acceleration and deceleration, yes.""  
        
       
      
    86 Having regard to the description of what occurred that the accused had given, it was important to elicit medical opinion about the relationship, if any, between what the accused said he had done and the injuries sustained to the deceased's brain. Dr Wong gave his evidence on this aspect as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. If you pick up a child from a position where it is lying down on its back - in each case here, doctor, we are speaking of an 11 week old child - if you pick up such a child from the back quickly and raise it to the shoulder of an adult without support of the head, is such an action a sufficient level of force to create an injury such as you saw in this child?  
         
        A. If you were to lift a child, let's say from the ground at this age, and put it on to your shoulder without supporting the head, that degree of force would not be sufficient to cause shearing injuries.  
         
         
        Q. Because in part, that action doesn't have sufficient of an acceleration and deceleration pressure; does it?  
         
        A. That is correct.  
         
         
        Q. So that you can't contemplate any circumstance in which a child that's lying down on a surface with its back down, say approximately the height of this bar table here?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. To be lifted up, even fairly quickly, by an adult unsupported by the neck and taken up to the shoulder level of an adult is simply outside the range of possible sources of this injury?  
         
        A. That is correct.""  
        
       
      
    87 Finally Dr Wong gave an opinion about the age of the haematomas. He said that the subdural haematomas were greater than two weeks of age and that they ""may relate to one of the other two injuries [but that he could not] be more specific"". That evidence was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. I am not sure if I asked you this. It is not possible to age the brain injuries, is it?  
         
        A. The shearing injuries?  
         
         
        Q. Yes?  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. You've expressed a view that the various injuries seen to the head and the skeletal system occurred on different occasions. Are you able to say on how many occasions?  
         
        A. Oh, I would need to refer back to my report to try and answer that question because, first of all, the fractures of the right fourth and fifth ribs is at least three weeks prior to 20 March, so that is one incident.  
         
         
        The injury involving both humeri and the right tibia, we've estimated - or I've estimated to be at least three to four days prior to 23 March and that would be another incident. 
         
         
        And then the age of the fresh blood at the interhemispheric fissure is less than 10 days, so, again it's not very accurate in terms of ageing, not very specific anyway. So it may be partly related to one of the other two injuries or it may be a separate injury, I can't say. But, again, the subdural haematomas were greater than two weeks of age. Again, it may relate to one of the other two injuries, I can't be more specific.  
         
         
        Q. So the best that can be said is at least two?  
         
        A. True."" 
        
       
      
    Dr Rowe 
     
      
    88 An ophthalmologist, Dr Rowe, called in the Crown case, reported that the deceased suffered non-accidental injury causing retinal haemorrhages consistent with his having been shaken. He said that retinal haemorrhages are found in a small percentage of newborn infants although these disappear rapidly with very few exceptions. He was of the opinion that the deceased's eye findings were consistent with non-accidental injury, with the possibility that the injuries had occurred during CPR or persisted from birth or related to emetological bleeding disorders being remote. He also gave oral evidence in the proceedings that was consistent with his report. 
     
      
    89 Dr Rowe was cross-examined about whether or not he was able to estimate when the haemorrhaging that he observed and photographed might have occurred. He said that retinal haemorrhages like those shown would have occurred roughly within three weeks of the pictures being taken. He said that there was a slight variation in rates of resolution of haemorrhages, although typically superficial haemorrhaging, which was what was seen in pictures of the deceased's retinas, tended to resolve relatively quickly within three to four weeks of onset. The doctor said that, in his experience, what he observed was one of the more severe degrees of retinal haemorrhaging that he had examined. He agreed that if there were a clinically significant vitamin K deficiency then there would be an increased risk of bleeding generally. 
     
      
    90 Dr Rowe was asked about the degree of force required to produce retinal haemorrhages. He gave the following evidence on this topic: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So, too, there is significant debate about the degree of force required to exhibit retinal haemorrhages; is that right?  
         
        A. I think it is not understood how much force, or how little force is required to produce bleeding at the back of the eye in relation to shaking, non-accidental injury.  
         
         
        Q. So it is just not settled, as we speak here, start of the 21st century, just how much you need to do to hurt a baby like this? 
         
        A. No.""  
        
       
      
    Dr Munns 
     
      
    91 Dr Munns is a specialist in paediatric endocrinology. He prepared a report that was tendered in the Crown case. He also gave oral evidence at the trial. He expressed the opinion that the deceased's bone injuries were not explained by vitamin D deficiency or an underlying bone fragility disorder. Even though the deficiency was relatively severe, the effects of that deficiency on the child were mild. He was of the opinion that the deceased had a skull fracture but that the vitamin D deficiency was not leading to a bone defect. He ""could find no evidence to suggest that the bones were weaker so as to explain the skull fracture"". He said that that would be the same in relation to the fracture of the left arm and also in relation to the apparent or possible rib fractures. He agreed that the deceased also had a vitamin K deficiency but said, ""the role of vitamin K in bone strength is yet to be established"". 
     
      
    92 Dr Munns did not accept that there were alternative explanations for the cause of bony injuries sustained by the deceased such as the effects of immunisation or air travel to and from Singapore, being head-butted by his older brother or as a side effect of CPR when treated in the emergency department of the hospital immediately following his admission. 
     
      
    Dr Webster 
     
      
    93 A paediatric neurologist, Dr Webster, called in the Crown case, examined the deceased on 24 March 2006 in the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit of the Westmead Children's Hospital. He reported that on that occasion the deceased showed minimal response to stimuli, but had some spontaneous respiration with a full pulsatile fontanelle. He observed bilateral retinal haemorrhages. Neurological signs were very abnormal. An MRI from the preceding day showed evidence of diffuse damage to the white matter of the brain. The distribution of these images was considered to be atypical for changes that might be seen after a prolonged hypoxic event or cerebral infarction related to low blood pressure. There were chronic, as well as subacute, components noted in the subdural fluid collections shown on the MRI. It became clear to Dr Webster that the deceased had suffered a severe and irreversible neurological injury. He was of the opinion that the evidence was consistent with non-accidental traumatic head injury resulting in severe brain damage. 
     
      
    94 Dr Webster also gave oral evidence with respect to the assessment or estimation of the timing and aging of the brain injuries suffered by the deceased. With respect to the deceased's severe and irreversible neurological injury, he agreed that the timing of that injury was approximate to his sudden decline into unconsciousness and subsequent presentation to the hospital. He was asked whether or not he was able to put a time limit on that process. He said, ""No, I don't think I can accurately"". He went on to describe the process as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. I think the unconsciousness resulted from, perhaps not so much from the haemorrhage, but the damage to the brain underlying it. So I think the unconsciousness was a reflection of the brain damage. What I can't say is precisely at what time - the most the severe injury that caused that happened. In other words, whether there were preceding injuries, but it seemed like the most likely thing was that he had a significant injury within the period of time before him coming in, and there was some suggestion from the history provided from his parents that in the week preceding his admission he may have had something abnormal about his brain function, because he was described as being irritable and sleeping poorly."" 
        
       
      
    95 He agreed that prior to the injury that precipitated unconsciousness the deceased had sustained at least two subdural haemorrhages. He said that there was evidence, on the basis of subdural haemorrhages, that they were of different ages, suggesting that they did not occur at the same time. There was no history of a loss of consciousness associated with earlier injury. He agreed that if there had been a severe neurological injury occasioning a subdural haemorrhage, one would expect that the deceased would have shown a lack of consciousness, or at least some descent of neurological functioning. That would be expected to manifest itself as sleepiness, sometimes irritability and sometimes vomiting. The factor that determines what happens is the severity of the injury that causes it.  
     
      
    96 The following evidence was led from the doctor: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So that there is some indication of symptoms demonstrated by the baby, consistent with an earlier injury in the few days leading up to its presentation?  
         
        A. On the basis of history given to me, yes.  
         
         
        Q. This is culminated by the baby suddenly lapsing into unconsciousness on the morning of 20 March?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And that sudden decline into unconsciousness and very shortly afterwards being presented to the hospital in moribund condition is an indication of a significant neurological injury is it not?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And are you able to say whether that injury happened after the earlier presentation to the general practitioner?  
         
        A. I would think that is probable, but I don't think I can absolutely certain about that. I would expect that if this baby had suffered an injury as severe as that, that when the general practitioner saw him some abnormality would be identified."" 
        
       
      
    97 This evidence needs to be compared with some later evidence given by Dr Webster in cross-examination. That evidence appears at T 70-71 and is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. And as I understand something that you said in your evidence-in-chief, something could well have happened to the baby that caused a new injury that caused it to lapse into unconsciousness prior to his admission to hospital?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. But maybe not; maybe the last trauma could have been even before the baby went to see the doctor on the Sunday; is that right?  
         
        A. Yeah, and I think that's true.  
         
         
        Q. If the baby did have brain damage like was ultimately seen on MRI--  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. --and chronic subdural haemorrhages and retinal haemorrhages--  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. --already on the morning of 20 March, before the baby came into hospital--  
         
        A. So, that - okay, yes, yes.  
         
         
        Q. --which I think you'd accept to be the case; probably this baby already had?  
         
        A. Yes, yep.  
         
        Q. I will withdraw the question. Let's focus on 8am on 20 March.  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. An hour or so before the baby's admission--  
         
        A. Yep.  
         
         
        Q. --at a time shortly before the baby lapsed into unconsciousness?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. It could well be the case that that baby had quite a number of subdural haemorrhages already at that time?  
         
        A. Yeah, I think that's possible.  
         
         
        Q. Well, likely. I mean, some of these are chronic--  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. --subdural haemorrhages?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Could probably have been there more than two weeks, right?  
         
        A. Yeah, I mean, I think there is certainly a possibility that there were subdural haemorrhages at that time.  
         
         
        Q. And the brain injury--  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. --could well have been there even before the baby went to the doctor on the Sunday?  
         
        A. Yes, I think that's possible.  
         
         
        Q. If on that morning, the Monday morning, at about 8am, if the baby had been lifted quickly without its head being supported--  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. --that could have triggered a cascade of events to lead to rapid onset of unconsciousness, right?  
         
        A. Yes, so the point you're making is that if you already have an injured brain and then you have some minor trauma on top of things that that could then lead to a catastrophic deterioration?  
         
         
        Q. Yes?  
         
        A. Yes, I think that's possible.  
         
        Q. That's a reasonable possibility, is it not? It's not just speculative, given the evidence that you've seen in this case?  
         
        A. I think it is possible. I don't think I have seen that, but I think it is possible.""  
        
       
      
    98 He was also asked about vitamin deficiencies. He agreed that vitamin K deficiency does not predispose a baby to brain injury but if the baby's brain were injured then such a deficiency could lead to a greater than normal amount of bleeding. He thought it was ""highly unlikely"" in this case that all of the bone damage and haematomas seen in the deceased could have been sourced from vitamin deficiencies. 
     
      
    Professor Howman-Giles 
     
      
    99 Professor Robert Howman-Giles was called in the Crown case and gave evidence based upon his specialty as a physician in nuclear medicine. He expressed the opinion that the rib fractures found on the deceased would have occurred at the same time. He said that these types of fractures in a child are usually from non-accidental injury and that it is very rare for this type of fracture in this position to occur from any other cause. He said that he had never seen rib fractures of this sort ""other than from a non-accidental cause"". He agreed that such fractures ""could be occasioned by the child being struck abdominally by an adult hand in a fashion that lacked support for the rear"". He also said the ""right tibial abnormality was very abnormal on the bone scan"". Moreover, bone scanning of the skull in an infant such as the deceased was unsatisfactory because the skull was predominantly made up of cartilage so that fractures in the skull in a three-month-old child are usually very poorly reactive. Working backwards from the whole body scan performed on 31 March 2006, he could not be more precise than to say that the deceased's bony injuries had been occasioned within six to eight weeks, but more than 24 to 48 hours, of that date. In relation to the rib fractures he said, ""what appears to be a fracture on the x-ray and a fairly normal bone scan. . . would suggest that they are older fractures"". 
     
      
    100 The doctor's attention was also directed to the mechanism of picking up the deceased described by the accused. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. It would seem even picking the baby up really quickly from a bassinet with two hands would not cause rib fractures either?  
         
        A. No."" 
        
       
      
    Dr Norrie 
     
      
    101 Dr Norrie worked at the Child Protection Unit at the Westmead Children's Hospital. She provided a statement dated 1 July 2006 that was tendered in the Crown case. She is a forensic physician. Dr Norrie was present when the accused demonstrated how he had picked up the child very quickly on the morning of the child's admission to hospital. Her description of this demonstration was in general accordance with all other descriptions of it during the proceedings. She gave evidence that ""even though . . . the head wasn't supported, so it did have a chance to flick back and forward once, that wouldn't be enough to cause the injuries that [the deceased] had"". Nor could it in any way have accounted for the skull fracture. Dr Norrie gave her opinion of the type of activity that would be necessary to cause the type of head injuries sustained by the deceased: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Are you able to say what sort of activity would be sufficient to create the head injuries?  
         
        A. It's generally held that you need at least 30 seconds of - of to-and-fro movement of the head so--  
         
         
        Q. So that is an acceleration/deceleration injury?  
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. With the head free? 
         
        A. Where the head's free and the baby's chin will touch the chest often and then flick right back. So you need a lot of acceleration, deceleration and a lot of rotation of the actual brain inside the skull.  
         
         
        Q. So if we can just understand that, the head is physically going backwards and forwards towards the chest and then towards the back and at the same time there is a rotational movement induced in the brain?  
         
        A. Yes.""  
        
       
      
    102 The Crown quite properly elicited from Dr Norrie that there were no signs of otherwise commonly occurring shaken baby psychosocial factors in the deceased's household such as drug or alcohol abuse, mental illness or history of domestic violence. 
     
      
    103 Dr Norrie said that the major injury to the deceased was within minutes to an hour of development of symptoms rather than days. In this respect she said that she was referring to the final internal head injury or bleed. That was the injury that caused the deceased to go into a cardiac arrest. She said that in a small infant of this sort there is likely to be a quite limited time span between the infliction of injury and the unconsciousness. It will ultimately depend upon the severity of the injury but if the injury is ultimately going to result in the heart and the breathing stopping, then usually the development of symptoms is quite quick. She agreed with the proposition that this was a severe case where the unconsciousness was almost immediately consequential upon the infliction of the injury. 
     
      
    104 Dr Norrie's report included what is accepted to have been an erroneous reference to something she was told by Ms Jubelin. The following question and answer would appear sufficiently to dispose of that issue: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. In expressing the opinions that you have both here and within your statement, Dr Norrie, is anything that you have said affected by whether or not Michelle Jubelin was correct in saying to you that the father had said, ""No, I shook the baby""?  
         
        A. No, my opinion's really based on the medical findings.  
        
       
      
    105 Dr Norrie accepted the accuracy of the expert radiological opinions expressed by Dr Wong concerning the age of the deceased's rib fractures. She agreed that it was clear that before 8.00am on 20 March 2006 the deceased had already received a number of distinct injuries and that it was impossible to date the skull fracture. She agreed that it was not possible to be any more precise about the age of the fractured skull than that it was two or three weeks old by the time the deceased came to hospital. She also agreed that the deceased had subdural haemorrhages that were at least two to three weeks old at that time. It was her opinion that these haematomas were caused by shaking. She also agreed that the injury, which led to cardiac and respiratory arrest, and which must have occurred within minutes to an hour of that injury, could not be related specifically to the subdural haemorrhages. 
     
      
    106 Dr Norrie also dealt with the relationship between the infliction of an injury causing brain damage and the appearance of signs or symptoms that may result. The following questions and answers should be noted: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So there could well be instances where a baby has been dealt with roughly, and I use that in a non-clinical term and without any real precision, leading to the development of subdural haemorrhages, and also leading to some damage to the brain, that does not ultimately lead to cardiac arrest or respiratory failure within an hour?  
         
        A. That's correct. That's correct.  
         
         
        Q. If a baby did have some brain damage, but not sufficient to lead to collapse within an hour, you would nevertheless expect to see some sign of decreased brain functioning, would you not?  
         
        A. You - yes. You would expect to see some signs of irritability, and perhaps they would go off their feed and perhaps they would start to vomit.  
         
         
        Q. And lethargy?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And increased sleeping, right?  
         
        A. Yes, and you might see, if they were at the early childhood centre, you might actually be able to demonstrate slightly increased head circumference."" 
        
       
      
    107 Dr Norrie was also cross-examined on the question of whether or not the deceased may have sustained an injury that did not lead immediately to respiratory failure, loss of consciousness or cardiac arrest but which may in some way have been lying dormant and which may have produced or facilitated such a result in the presence of later trauma. The following passage from her evidence identifies this line: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Now we know, don't we, that at about 1 o'clock, on Sunday 19 March the baby was taken to the doctor by both parents?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And a history was given at that time of irritability, increased crying, vomiting and longer sleeping?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. All consistent with reduction, or a drop in brain functioning; right?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Given the fact that the baby at that time almost certainly had injuries consistent with rough handling?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. It's on the cards, I would suggest, that at 1 o'clock on that afternoon, the baby already had some brain injury. What do you say about that?  
         
        A. I think that's probable.  
         
         
        Q. And brain injury that would have led to a continued path of restricted functioning of the respiratory and cardiac systems?  
         
        A. No, not necessarily.  
         
         
        Q. No, not necessarily, but you can't rule that out as being a reasonable hypothesis, can you?  
         
        A. Yes, because it's where the damage occurs, and it would have had to be another incident of trauma to the child to have then caused the respiratory and cardiac. Now, it may well have not been as severe as if you took a baby that was perfectly healthy, you might not have to use as much force, but that final insult had to have happened as a separate insult. 
         
         
        Q. The father has given you a history of an incident that was quite approximate to the baby's collapse, hasn't he?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. You're saying, now are you, correct me if I am wrong, that this baby probably did have, at 8 am, before the father dealt with at all, some brain damage. Do you agree with that?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And in those circumstances where the baby already had brain damage at 8 am, the degree of force that could cause a cascade of damage leading to collapse of the respiratory system and cardiac arrest would necessarily be less severe than what would normally be required to cause cardiac arrest through this sort of brain shear injury, right?  
         
        A. In these circumstances it may have been less severe, but it would still be of significance.  
         
         
        Q. Not doubt, it has to be significant, otherwise the baby wouldn't collapse?  
         
        A. It wouldn't be just simply picking the baby up with an unsupported head, or something that was completely passive and non-violent in nature.""  
        
       
      
    108 The reference to the parents having taken the deceased to the doctor at 1.00pm on Sunday afternoon is an error as the correct time was about 3.00pm. It has not been suggested, whatever may be the ultimate significance of this evidence, that the error is important in any way. 
     
      
    109 A later series of questions and answers on this topic included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So that the baby could, at 1 o'clock or 3 o'clock on the Sunday, have been in a state of incipient cardiopulmonary arrest because of a shearing injury which had remained either asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic between then and the following morning; isn't that possible?  
         
        A. Well, I don't think that the baby was even near cardiopulmonary arrest at that stage, but it was sick at that stage.  
         
         
        Q. Well, I've described it as ""incipient""?  
         
        A. Incipient, yes, yeah.  
         
         
        Q. Is that possible--  
         
        A. By ""incipient"" I'm sort of imagining it's just on the verge of it. I'm not even thinking it's on the verge of it. I'm thinking you need another trauma to actually cause it.""  
        
       
      
    110 In this same context, Dr Norrie was referred to some of the evidence, reproduced above, given by Dr Webster at T 70-71. She was asked whether or not she agreed with Dr Webster's opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Do you agree with that evidence?  
         
        A. Well, in view of what I've said, no, I don't. I think that it is speculative. Certainly the progression to a catastrophic event is usually fairly rapid and that all the data that we've collected on that sort of event happening is - is - you need something to precipitate the catastrophic event.  
         
         
        Q. Do you agree with his evidence--  
         
        A. Of minor trauma being enough.  
         
         
        Q. --that there could have been? Do you agree that the baby could well have had a brain injury or the brain injury when he went to the doctor on Sunday?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. Do you agree that some minor trauma could have led to the catastrophic deterioration in cardiorespiratory functioning?  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. Why not?  
         
        A. Well, again, it's very difficult to prove, but the majority of people who have confessed to shaking a baby have said that the progression to the catastrophic event - and, admittedly, I will agree that nobody has known whether the baby already had prior injury - has been quick. It's not - and that this - what you're describing as a slow decline into something that - which minor trauma will then precipitate, I don't think is terribly well written about and I'm not sure that anyone can say that minor trauma would do that.  
         
         
        Q. More to the point, can it be ruled out?  
         
        A. Well, I think it needs more than minor trauma.  
         
         
        Q. Although your colleague doesn't agree with it?  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. Is this a subject about which professionals in good standing might have an argument about?  
         
        A. I think so.""  
        
       
      
    111 Dr Norrie suggested that there must have been a traumatic incident either immediately before the deceased's collapse on the Monday morning or within an hour or so of it. She did not agree that the outer limit of the time between the incident causing collapse and the fact of collapse could have been longer than an hour, perhaps several hours. However, she did agree that this was an area where people with her qualifications and experience ""would disagree on occasion"". 
     
      
    112 Dr Norrie gave evidence that the infliction of a shearing brain injury through shaking would require as many as six to ten backwards and forwards acceleration and deceleration motions to result in the shearing injuries that she understood were caused in such a fashion. This then led to the following questions: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Is it possible to state with such emphasis as you are in the context of a murder trial where so much hangs on what you say that you would need to shake more than a few times, if the baby already had some sort of brain injury before?  
         
        A. I think--  
         
         
        Q. At 8:00 am?  
         
        A. I think it's impossible for me to answer that question."" 
        
       
      
    113 Dr Wong's evidence had been that it would require ""multiple shakes"". Dr Norrie agreed that this was an area where there was still ""quite some debate amongst doctors with [her] qualifications"" about ""how much force really is required to cause these shearing injuries"". She also emphasised that ""the debate extends from whether you just shake, or whether you had have to have a shake with an impact"".  
     
      
    114 Dr Norrie also agreed that her opinion that the major injury to the deceased was within minutes to an hour of the development of symptoms leading to cardiac arrest, or respiratory failure, was based on an assumption that the baby had no shearing injury to the brain at the time of the last incident that did cause such brain damage. However, she agreed that the rib fractures could have been caused during the incident that caused the (subdural) haematomas. By reason of her other evidence about these fractures, that must have been at an earlier time. 
     
      
    115 Dr Norrie did not consider that the way that the accused described and demonstrated to her having picked up the deceased from the bassinette could have caused a shearing injury to his brain. She was asked further questions about this mechanism in the context of some pre-existing injury: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. What if the baby already had brain damage, could that exacerbate the brain damage?  
         
        A. Oh, I find that really difficult to answer, but based on - I find that - well, yes, I think that's a very difficult question to answer, but probably not. One quick motion up to the shoulder, probably not.  
         
         
        Q. It sounds like you have difficulty excluding it completely as a possibility, reasonable possibility; is that right?  
         
        A. Yes, I couldn't say definitely not.  
         
         
        Q. What about if the baby was picked up really quickly like the way that you've just demonstrated the way that the accused demonstrated to you and then moved it backward and forwards straightaway after that quick pick-up movement?  
         
        A. With the head still unsupported?  
         
         
        Q. With the head still unsupported?  
         
        A. That's usually not - I mean, the babies don't like it because they cry a lot, but usually it doesn't - it wouldn't result in injury in a normal child.  
         
         
        Q. No, but what about an injured child? This baby was already injured at that time with something?  
         
        A. Yes. I'd still say probably not.  
         
         
        Q. But, again, given that you could not reasonably exclude the possibility of injury from the pick-up, the fact that there was more movement immediately after cannot also be excluded as reasonably possibly exacerbating existing injuries?  
         
        A. No, they do have some control, head control, at 11 weeks though, so his head wouldn't be flopping to-and-fro in the way that it does if he's shaken. So they're - you know, the head control's reasonable, so I'd have to err on the side of 95% wouldn't.  
         
         
        Q. 95%?  
         
        A. Well, yes, I guess.  
         
         
        Q. It depends how injured the child already was, surely?  
         
        A. Yes, but I still think that there isn't enough force in that to injure - to injure the deep tissues of the brain.""  
        
       
      
    116 Finally, Dr Norrie was asked to comment upon the significance of the events described by the accused taken, in effect, at face value. She gave this evidence about that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Certainly going through the history given about the smacking, the blaming of the child for not feeding properly, and the demonstration that he has given to me of the shaking and the lifting on to the shoulder and the jiggling around, none of those per se would have caused the symptoms or signs that You Qi presented with.  
         
         
        Q. Either individually, or collectively?  
         
        A. That's right."" 
        
       
      
    Dr Wilkins 
     
      
    117 Dr Wilkins is a senior staff specialist in paediatric intensive care at the Royal Alexandria Hospital for Children. He prepared a statement dated 29 May 2007 that was tendered in the Crown case. He was of the opinion that the deceased suffered a cardiac arrest on the day of his admission, which occurred at the time of, or shortly after (""i.e. minutes rather than hours""), a shaking injury inflicted by an adult who had picked up the deceased by grasping around the upper arms and chest and shaking him backwards and forwards several times. He was of the opinion that there was insufficient evidence of what he called ""shaken-impact syndrome"", where the baby is not only shaken but also thrown or banged against a firm object. For example, he said that he was ""unconvinced"" that the deceased had suffered a short linear fracture of the right parietal bone described by others as seen on the bone scan. He said that a cardiac arrest and consequent lack of oxygen made a major contribution to the deceased's brain injury. He concluded, ""no medical or environmental or other cause other than shaking has been identified as contributing to the [deceased's] injury"". 
     
      
    118 He first saw the deceased on 24 March 2006. He gave this evidence about his views at that time: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. . . .In this case, the baby had already been in hospital for four days, no cause had been found as to why this baby had his cardiac arrest and, on top of that, the previous afternoon, a scan had been done of the child's brain showing a subdural haemorrhage and those two pieces of information led me to suspect that the child had suffered a traumatic injury to the brain, probably by shaking, because that is a known cause of cardiac arrest and subdural haemorrhage."" 
        
       
      
    119 Dr Wilkins said that some time in the hour before the deceased presented to the emergency department, something catastrophic happened. He said that if it were more than an hour, the child would have been dead when he arrived at hospital. The injuries would have required there to have been more than ""a small jiggling"", a reference to one of the terms used to describe the actions of the accused. He was asked, therefore, to explain how much force would have been necessary: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Can you describe for the court the sort of level of shaking that you understand is necessary to create this form of shearing injury within the brain?  
         
        A. No I can't, because it is a controversial area, and there are some who say it has to be extremely violent, and there are some who think it does not have to be very violent. But the point is that babies of this age are small, they have limited ability to protect themselves because their muscles are weak, and furthermore the act of shaking is not the same as say a single whiplash injury that you might experience in a car crash. Because the shaking is repetitive, this adds to the amount of injury that can happen to the brain. Furthermore, because the bobbing backwards and forwards of the head, together with some rotation of the head on the neck, this can cause injury, both in the brain itself and in the spinal cord, which has been demonstrated in some cases in forensic pathology examination. The point is that there is shaking, and it's repetitive, but I can't tell you a degree of force, or a duration of the shaking. I do not have the expertise to answer that question.  
         
         
        Q. But it's your view that the shaking must be, at the very least, repetitive?  
         
        A. Yes, but I cannot tell you how many times.""  
        
       
      
    120 Dr Wilkins agreed that there was a definite controversy concerning the force and duration required to cause brain injury in a shaken baby. He did not believe that there was any controversy over whether shaking per se could do so. He said that there was other controversy concerning whether there were other underlying (unknown) diseases which could lead to the constellation of injuries associated with the syndrome. However, when there is demonstrated injury to bone, that would decrease the extent of controversy in his opinion. This was such a case.121 Dr Wilkins expanded upon his opinions during cross-examination in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Correct me if I am wrong, it does seem, though, that your report and the opinion that you express in it, and indeed the opinion you expressed in the witness box just now, about the fact that the injuries or the cardiac arrest were caused by the shaking that you have described, was on basis that the constellation of injuries co-existed in time. Is that right or wrong?  
         
        A. I stand by what I have said in my report, which is that something happened that morning, irrespective of whether there were any previous injuries. It makes no difference to my understanding whether or not the subdural haemorrhages were old, or whether that occurred that morning, and it makes no difference to my opinion whether there were old rib fractures. Because having old rib fractures does not cause a cardiac arrest, having an old subdural haemorrhage does not cause a cardiac arrest. Even if you had a secondary haemorrhage, bleeding that is, into an old subdural haemorrhage, I think that would not cause a cardiac arrest if it hasn't caused massive swelling of the brain, or pressure on the brain and that was not demonstrated, and that would be supported by the neurosurgeons who did not want to operate that day, or the next day, because they did not see any evidence of swelling on the brain, or any need to evacuate the subdural haemorrhage. So although I did not have at the time evidence that the subdural haemorrhage was old, there was some controversy in the reports of the MRI scan and the CT scan about how old it was, that did not make any difference because the child had presented in cardiac arrest 4 days earlier.""  
        
       
      
    122 The topic of the timing of the deceased injuries arose in the course of Dr Wilkins' evidence as well. He was asked a series of questions about this as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Well, what I am suggesting to you is that there is controversy also amongst colleagues of yours about whether the cardiac arrest follows within minutes or whether it's within possibly hours of the shaking, isn't there?  
         
        A. I'd accept what you say.  
         
         
        Q. You accept that there is controversy, do you?  
         
        A. Well, are you - I don't know whether you're referring to evidence given to this court or evidence in the medical literature.  
         
         
        Q. Well, to start with, Dr Norrie gave evidence here yesterday and in her report that it could have been minutes or it could have been up to an hour, although she said that she couldn't be definite about an hour; it might be a bit more, but probably not much more than an hour?  
         
        A. Mmm-hmm.  
         
         
        Q. That's one contrary piece of evidence?  
         
        A. Well, hardly.  
         
         
        Q. Hardly?  
         
        A. I said ""minutes rather than hours"". By ""minutes"" I didn't mean necessarily one or two or three minutes. I mean less than an hour.  
         
         
        Q. Less than an hour. I'd suggest to you it could have been up to two hours. What do you say about that?  
         
        A. I can't exclude that.""  
        
       
      
    Dr Moran 
     
      
    123 Dr Moran is a consultant paediatrician working from the Royal Children's Hospital at Randwick. He provided an opinion by letter dated 20 April 2007, which was tendered in the Crown case. He expressed the view that the shearing injury to the deceased's brain would have resulted in simultaneous and instantaneous loss of consciousness. He said, ""the accepted wisdom is, if you have injury to the deep part [sic] matter of the brain, you have what's known as a diffuse axonal injury, and you become instantly unconscious and you will not recover from that injury"". 
     
      
    124 Dr Moran gave evidence about the physical mechanisms that have been postulated as the causes of such injuries to infants, in circumstances where eyewitnesses are unavailable or non-existent, and where obviously no studies have been possible. Two circumstances present themselves. These are either a severe blow to the head against a hard object where the infant's brain suddenly stops and/or a severe rotational acceleration of the brain where an impact to the brain is unnecessary. Shaking is ""the postulated mechanism"" in the latter case. 
     
      
    125 Dr Moran agreed that the sort of injury that he observed in the deceased would be more readily created by an impact than simply by shaking. His attention was drawn to the question of whether or not it could have occurred in this case without an impact, as the following questions and answers reveal: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. But in your view the injury to the central brain could equally have been caused simply by shaking mechanisms?  
         
        A. I wouldn't say ""equally"", not at all equally. I think the chances of it happening by shaking alone in fact are remote because it - one rarely finds injuries such as these in babies in whom the history has been that the child was shaken. Now there's absolutely no evidence of impact. I think it would be rare to find such a degree of injury in those babies.  
         
         
        Q. Given that we've got a whole constellation of injuries here, what injuries that are present in this child would you exclude if there wasn't an impact in addition to shaking?  
         
        A. I wouldn't exclude any of them, apart from the skull fracture of course, but supposing there was no evidence of impact here, what I would say to that is it would be rare to get such a degree of injury in shaking alone, but because one can't rely on the history in terms of making a diagnosis of shaking, I would have thought there was a good chance that there was an impact against an object that left no external evidence of injury. So, for instance, a - the soft arm of a sofa, something like that, that leaves no external evidence of impact. It may, on retraction of the scalp at post-mortem, you may see evidence of impact, but--  
         
        Q. But not in a case like this where the baby didn't die for months?  
         
        A. Yes, exactly. So in a case like this where you have much more severe deep injury as a primary injury to the brain, the likelihood is that an impact has taken place."" 
        
       
      
    126 It seems apparent that Dr Moran's opinion that ""there's absolutely no evidence of impact"" is not an agreement with Dr Wilkins' view that the suspected parietal fracture could not be confirmed, but rather a comment upon the quality and character of the evidence about what occurred in fact. He remained of the view that an impact had been involved having regard to the extent of the brain injury sustained by the deceased. However, he was adamant that nothing demonstrated by the accused in the course of his ERISP could have been responsible. He said, ""No, even if it were somewhat robust handling it wouldn't cause anything like this. I mean, otherwise our hospital wards would be full of babies with severe brain injury"". He excluded any action demonstrated by the accused as being a cause of the deceased's injuries. He also believed that appropriate investigations had been made to exclude all other causes of death other than the brain injury that he described. 
     
      
    127 Dr Moran agreed during cross-examination that it was clear that there had been at least one incident involving force to the deceased's head well before he presented to Westmead Children's Hospital on 20 March 2006. This was apparent from the subdural haemorrhages and the healing rib fractures. 
     
      
    128 The significance of the precise nature of the deceased's brain injury was explored in some detail with Dr Moran. (It also became apparent that Dr Donald, who was subsequently called in the defence case, placed particular emphasis on this issue in forming his own views about the timing of the injuries sustained by the deceased. This is considered below). Dr Moran gave an explanation of the relationship between the extent of injury and the degree of force that might have been involved: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So presumably on a scale there must be less severe examples?  
         
        A. Yes. If I could explain, on the what is known as the centripetal theory of head injury, the greatest degree of shearing occurs at the outside of the brain (indicated) for a particular force and that sort of shearing causes shearing of the bridging veins to give you a subdural haemorrhage. You can also get shearing at various levels within the brain substance. I'm not sure if this is what you're talking about, but you can get shearing between the grey and white matter, so as you get increased force you may get shearing between the grey and white matter. And the greatest degree of force or at least the force that's going to cause the greatest degree of damage to your brain, would be within the deep white matter. So, yes, there are gradations of shearing depending upon the force applied to the brain."" 
        
       
      
    129 He explained that ""shearing injury"" and ""diffuse axonal injury"" were interchangeable terms. Dr Moran agreed that even though it may be accepted that there was a primary shearing injury to the deceased's brain, the extent of the injury was exacerbated because of the secondary effects of lack of oxygen or hypoxia. He said, ""What I think the situation was that you're saying that hypoxia, which I think is reasonable to assume in this baby, would cause further brain swelling and, as a result of that, that there would be brain - further brain damage and I agree with that . . . But hypoxia, yes, would cause further damage and lead to further swelling"".  
     
      
    130 Dr Moran said that the retinal haemorrhages that were present were not the most severe type of retinal haemorrhages and that they were confined to a small area. He appeared to agree with the proposition that the extent of retinal haemorrhage distribution was related directly to the degree of force that had been occasioned. He said, ""depending upon the degree of force, I think the haemorrhage can be more extensive"". 
     
      
    131 Dr Moran agreed that it was not known whether the parietal skull fracture occurred at the same time as the shearing injury. This is because it was not possible to date the skull fracture. Specifically, he agreed that it was not possible to say, ""with the sort of certainty required in these forensic circumstances"" that the deceased's skull was fractured on the morning of 20 March 2006. Likewise with the rib fractures. They were weeks old, so that they were clearly not associated with whatever it was that caused the deceased to have a cardiac arrest. He also agreed that the retinal haemorrhages might be attributable to earlier incidents. He said, ""I think it's reasonable to say that you can't date retinal haemorrhages"". 
     
      
    132 Dr Moran did not agree that it was impossible to date the shearing injuries. He did not agree with Dr Webster's opinion appearing in the evidence at T 70-71. His view was that ""the shearing injury had to be almost instantaneously before lapsing into unconsciousness"". In this context, Dr Moran was asked, and answered, the following question: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Well, what I want to suggest to you is that a shearing injury of the type seen ultimately on MRI in this baby might not cause a permanent lapse into unconsciousness, but could well lead to a concussion where there is in and out, as it were, of consciousness and then a descent into unconsciousness and then ultimately, through a cascading of events, a shutdown in the respiratory system and cardiac arrest. What do you say about that proposition?  
         
        A. I think that's a perfectly reasonable proposition in terms of an injury occurring and it may cause an - an injury may cause that if it's not so severe. However, the problem with applying that proposition to this baby is that we know that there was severe damage to the white matter, so what we're talking about is not concussion; we're talking about the things above concussion. So, in other words, a greater force has been applied. We have subdural haemorrhage in this baby and we have injury, demonstrable injury, to the deep white matter, which means that we've gone past concussion, we've gone up to the level of subdural haemorrhage and we've gone up to the higher level of energy input causing damage to the deep white matter.""  
        
       
      
    133 Dr Moran said that it was generally accepted that if you have injury of this degree that you have instant unconsciousness. He described it as ""a generally accepted clinical fact"". He did not agree with Dr Norrie's opinion that ""the major injury was within minutes to an hour of development of symptoms rather than days"". Dr Moran said, ""I'm not prepared to change my opinion just because [of what] another doctor has said"". However, he did agree that a ""cardiac arrest that's due to hypoxia most likely in a baby like this could occur at any time after an injury"". Dr Moran did not agree with the conclusion of Dr Donald that was put to him as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Based on the information available, both from You Qi's parents, the clinical reports and investigations, it is not reasonable to conclude that an episode of head injury must have occurred immediately prior to You Qi's collapse at home. The time when it might have occurred is not clear either.""  
        
       
      
    He did agree however, that that seemed ""quite consistent with Dr Norrie's opinion"". He emphasised his view that ""a shearing injury in the brain means that you have a primary injury to the brain as a direct result of the force applied to the brain"" and that this leads to immediate unconsciousness. 
     
      
    134 However, a little later in his cross-examination, Dr Moran gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Is there a scale of seriousness of axonal injuries where there might be some damage which immediately causes unconsciousness, but other lesser forms of injury which, although impacting on the baby's functioning, does not lead immediately to unconsciousness?  
         
        A. Obviously only certain degrees of force will lead to unconsciousness. The severity point is that with varying degrees of force, as you reach a threshold, you may become unconscious, yet recover, which is known as concussion, by which I mean you were unconscious, from which you did not recover, which occurs with diffuse axonal injury.  
        I think the important point for us is that is possible to have diffuse axonal injury, become unconscious and subsequently recover some form of consciousness and then, once again, lapse into unconsciousness. 
        "" 
          
        (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    135 Later still Dr Moran was taken back to this topic as the following evidence reveals: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So, accepting that the facts that you say a [sic] definitely facts, are indeed facts, you leave open room for reasonable professionals to differ about whether a baby can move from unconsciousness into a form of abnormal consciousness?  
         
        A. Yes, I think having discussed it with the paediatric neurologist, I would say; yes, of course, there is a matter of opinion as to what level there is; that he was of the opinion that you could possibly not be completely unconscious but have a significant degree of auto-consciousness, so much so that any reasonable observer would know that there was something seriously wrong with the baby. I see no reason why I should disagree with that, yes."" 
        
       
      
    136 Dr Moran agreed that there was ""hot debate"" about whether shaking alone can cause the sort of shearing injury sustained by the deceased. The burden of his opinion was that it is unlikely that shaking alone causes diffuse axonal injury. He explained his view in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[I]t would be very rare, in my view, and from reading the literature and, in fact, in my experience, that a child would have this degree of injury from shaking alone. I would have thought that it was much more likely that an impact would have to occur for this degree of injury to be present"".  
        
       
      
    137 In this respect Dr Moran said that ""whatever caused this injury, the shearing injury was a very significant force"". His cross-examination concluded on this topic as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. About which there is controversy concerning exactly how much force is required to cause this type of diffuse axonal injury? A. I think you are asking me the question; do I know the minimum force to produce that. I don't."" 
        
       
      
    Dr Curtin 
     
      
    138 Dr Curtin is a haematologist who is employed by the Royal Alexandria Hospital for Children at Westmead. She was there in 2006. She prepared a report for these proceedings dated 28 May 2007 that was tendered in the Crown case. She gave evidence with respect to the existence and significance of vitamin deficiencies detected in the deceased. She said that the deceased did have a vitamin C deficiency, but not such as to cause the subdural haemorrhages that were evident. However she said that they certainly might have exacerbated any bleeding from other causes. Specifically Dr Curtin said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. I don't though that I'm qualified to be able to say that, but certainly children with bleeding problems, if they have a trauma or whatever will have more bleeding than children who don't have a bleeding problem. Vitamin C deficiency is a cause of bleeding problems. So if the baby was deficient at presentation then you would propose that may have led to a bigger bleed in the brain than what otherwise occurred. I can't quantify that.""  
        
       
      
    139 The deceased also had a vitamin D deficiency. Dr Curtin did not agree with Dr Munns' view that the deceased also had a vitamin K deficiency. She explained why she held that view: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. Well, I think the result, the vitamin K tests, when the baby presented in the cardiac arrest that were done shortly after that were minimally abnormal. If the baby had such vitamin K deficiency at that time those coagulation tests would have been more dramatically abnormal. The coagulation tests remained abnormal after the baby had a dose of vitamin K, and they reflect a sick baby, they are not to a level that I would say contributes to bleeding, so that's a mild result. We do operations and surgery on children with those sorts of testings and they don't contribute to bleeding. So I don't think there is evidence that the baby was vitamin K deficient."" 
        
       
      
    Dr Donald 
     
      
    140 The accused called Dr Donald, a paediatric forensic physician and a senior consultant and head of Child Protection Services at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Adelaide. He prepared a report dated 16 March 2008 that was tendered in the defence case. He gave evidence by audiovisual link from Adelaide.  
     
      
    141 Consistently with other medical experts, Dr Donald formed the view that the deceased sustained various injuries that were apparently inflicted at different times. His significant opinion in the context of the proceedings was that it was not reasonable to conclude that an episode of head injury must have occurred immediately prior to the deceased's collapse at home.  
     
      
    142 He was directed to the issue of the possible mechanism that caused the shearing injury in question: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. . . . Are you able to explain in more detail what type of mechanism might have caused the shearing injury, or shearing damage, that you saw reported on the MRI?  
         
        A. Yes. I should explain what I saw before I talk about what caused it. There was evidence of shearing injury most obvious at the junction between the white and the grey matter in the cerebral hemispheres. There was evidence of shearing injury in the band of neuronal tissue that connects the left and the right haemorrhage, the corpus callosum, and there was some evidence of injury within the occipital lobe and I can't recall which side now. All of these injuries were in the cerebral part of the brain, as opposed to the mid part of the brain, or the lowest part of the brain. So they were all lesions that were in the more superficial parts. Even though the corpus callosum is a deeper structure, it is still considered to be part of the cerebral hemisphere which it connects together, and these areas of tissue damage would occur through high angular acceleration forces, either or not accentuated by an episode of impact to the head.  
         
         
        Q. What is the significance of these injuries being seen in the cerebral regions of the brain?  
         
        A. It means that the part of the brain that controls the function such as breathing and heart beat and so on was not obviously injured by the primary event. In other words, the incident of angular acceleration and or impact to the higher centres, rather than the deep mid brain centres, and the deeper mid brain centres are the centres that, if they are injured, cause significant disturbance in vital functions like breathing and heart rate. So when breathing and heart rate are significantly affected, in a child who has suffered a head injury, they are so affected because of secondary effects, not primary effects, and secondary effects take time to develop after the primary injury has occurred.  
         
         
        So basically what it means is that the primary injury would have led to significant swelling of the nerve cells, which would then cause significant problems with most parts of the brain, including the mid brain, and that would then affect the child's capacity to breath and may have affected the child's heart beat, and then that would become more of an issue, because breathing is necessary to supply oxygen to the brain. If the oxygen is not supplied, then the brain effectively becomes further insulted, further hypoxic, and that then leads to more difficulties with breathing. So you end up in a vicious circle, and presumably at some point in that process your heart will become affected as well, and I believe that's the sequence of events that led to this little boy's collapse on that morning.""  
        
       
      
    143 He continued with the following answers on this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. You're aware that there has already been evidence presented that suggests that the injury, in particular to the corpus callosum and to the other locations in the brain that were damaged, was deep damage that would have caused instantaneous loss of consciousness and, at least in accordance with Dr Moran's evidence-in-chief, permanent loss of consciousness. What do you say about that evidence already given in this trial?  
         
        A. I don't have any doubt that the initial assault would have concussed the baby. When I use the term ""concussion"", I mean a temporary loss of consciousness due to head injury. Now when I say ""temporary"" I don't mean that once the concussion has passed the child returns to a normal state of consciousness. What I mean is that the unconsciousness then lifts somewhat and, depending on what the next sequence of events is, the child will remain in a less than conscious state and then if the secondary effects begin, which I think they did in this case, the child's consciousness, once again, will become more seriously impaired as that hypoxic episode comes into play. 
         
         
        Now, I believe the mistake in what Dr Moran said was he was equating injury to the corpus callosum which, as I said, is a deeper structure that is still part of the cerebrum. He was saying that that, of itself, would cause unconsciousness leading to death.  
        My view is that in a situation like this, because there is no evidence of any primary injury to the midbrain or brainstem, that the effects must have been secondary in this little boy. Therefore, there would have been a significant lapse of time between the primary injury and his collapse due to a combination of hypoxia and ischemia,  
        ischemia being lack of blood supply due to the brain swelling which produced the hypoxic change."" (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    144 This evidence was then augmented by the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Are you able to quantify in any way what you would regard as a significant lapse of time between the primary incident causing the damage to, say, the corpus callosum on the one hand, and the collapse caused by the effect of cascading secondary effects?  
         
        A. No. It's fairly unpredictable. In some babies it happens quite quickly, but the average time frame that you are looking at is somewhere in the vicinity of a couple to several hours. I mean, this situation - and I think it's important for me to agree with others who have said that there was extensive injury to the brain in the cerebrum and, of course, the more extensive the injury the more quickly the effects of that will be apparent in relation to the appearance of the secondary injury.  
         
         
        So, if I had to say, well, would this be something that happened more slowly or more quickly, I would say more quickly, but I still wouldn't want to suggest that this would occur so quickly as to be indistinguishable from the primary event. I think there is a clear period of time that it could occur before this collapse occurred. Like, for instance, if I go back to the time frame, if we take at face value the time 8 o'clock, which is when things, I think, started to go wrong, then I would not expect the primary injury to have occurred the previous day, but I would accept that the primary injury could have occurred some time within the previous several hours of this. But if it was established that it happened at 4 or 5 o'clock in the morning, I wouldn't discount that."" 
        
       
      
    145 He said that Dr Norrie suggested that the evident collapse resulted from the primary injury. He said that if she believed that the primary injury was what caused the collapse, then there is no reason to put any time frame around that because unconsciousness would have occurred simultaneously. He said however, ""if you're speculating or you're talking about a secondary effect, then you've got a time gap. There is no scope for time gaps in children who have primary injury within the midbrain or brainstem. It should happen immediately"". He explained his difference of opinion with Dr Norrie in more detail as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The first presentation in children who suffer angular acceleration is those children who do get injury to the brainstem, midbrain or the junction between the skull and the top of the spine and those children, as a result of the primary injury, have nerve damage which interferes with their breathing; those children collapse and die. They are sometimes resuscitated, but invariably they succumb quite quickly. They make up a small but significant percentage of children who suffer angular acceleration forces. That's type 1. 
         
         
        Now, to me, the patient in what Dr Norrie says is that's what she was dealing with, but in her report she actually says that she is referring to type 2. Now type 2 is when you have a range of abnormalities, like you have a subdural haematoma. You'll probably have evidence of shearing injury, but you present in an encephalopathic state, in other words, you present with altered consciousness and then, as the secondary effects become apparent, you become more affected and if you're not able to be adequately looked after medically you would deteriorate and ultimately die or, alternatively, as happened in this little boy's case, he survived but with severe damage. 
         
         
        Now, in other words, there's a contradiction, I think, in what she's written in her report. The contradiction is that she's claiming type 2, but really describing a situation that more readily fits with type 1."" 
        
       
      
    146 Dr Donald was asked about his opinion relating to the mechanism that caused the deceased's brain injury. He told the court that it could have been blunt trauma or it could have been a form of shaking. He was asked to express a view about which is more likely. He gave this answer: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. The angular acceleration forces were clearly present. It depends somewhat on whether - I actually think that that - there's some contentiousness about the presence or absence of a skull fracture. I think, given that the CT scan was done five days after the child was admitted, I think it's more likely to be a skull fracture than not. The reason I say that is it looks like a skull fracture. We don't have the advantage of it being done recently or close to the time the child presented where, if we had, it might have shown local swelling and so on, which would have supported it further. So my view is that this child did suffer head impact and as a result of that would have definitely experienced significant angular acceleration forces. 
         
         
        It's not, in my experience, usual for impact-derived angular acceleration forces to be sufficient to cause shearing injury of the kind that the baby had. So I think there was, in addition to the impact significant flexion, extension of the head which would be adequately explained by shaking, so I think it's a combination of shaking and head impact that's caused these injuries for the reasons I've just outlined."" 
        
       
      
    147 As with all other expert medical witnesses whose views on the issue were sought, Dr Donald was not able to say how much shaking was required. He agreed with Dr Moran that the retinal haemorrhages were not as extensive in the deceased as was commonly seen in babies who have received what seem to be corresponding shearing injuries. He said that raised intracranial pressure at the time of admission indicated the well-established secondary effects and/or the effects of the deceased's apparent cardiac arrest. Dr Donald expressed the opinion that that was more likely to have ""reflect[ed] the secondary effects of the shearing injury that the baby suffered"". He explained that he meant by that ""the hypoxic ischaemic problems caused as a result of the shearing injury"". 
     
      
    148 The doctor re-affirmed in cross-examination that he postulated or assumed a concussive episode which he described as ""the actual incident of head injury, the angular acceleration forces, plus or minus the impact"". He said that it was his view that such an episode ""occurred some time prior to this baby's unconsciousness, floppiness and so on"". He then answered the following question: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Is there anything about what's known in the immediate history of this child that separates out that possibility from the possibility of instantaneous unconsciousness consequent upon assault?  
         
        A. So can I ask you if what you're asking is that there is no possibility that the child had the injury before the episode of collapse? Is that what you're asking me? Because if that's the case I'd say I can't exclude that. I mean, it is possible that the child had no injury before the episode of unconsciousness and floppiness, but it kind of doesn't make a lot of sense because that's - because we know there was a significant injury there and that clinical description, it worked well, in my view, with the development of secondary effects.""  
        
       
      
    149 The doctor confirmed that the ""significant injury"" to which he referred in that last answer was intended to be a reference to the shearing injury sustained by the deceased. 
     
      
    150 The Crown asked Dr Donald, in effect, to assume the history or version of events of the morning of 20 March 2006 at the Telopea premises given on several occasions by the accused, to the point where the accused described the deceased as becoming floppy in his arms and the child was presented to the hospital thereafter when undoubtedly moribund. It was put to the doctor that there was ""simply no room in that history for a concussive event"". The doctor gave the following answers: 
     
      
       
        
        ""A. That's presuming that it's all true. I mean, if it's all true, none of it makes sense.  
         
         
        Q. Well, it would make sense if there was a shearing injury inflicted at the point shortly after or at about the time the child was picked up out of the bassinet, wouldn't it?  
         
        A. It would also make sense if that happened some time previously and the child's condition, as I've mentioned before, slowly deteriorated over that time because you would still, in that situation, see periods where the child may have been less than normally conscious, but also at some point more unconscious and, as I said, I think that's a very difficult assessment for any parent to make, particularly in a baby of 11 weeks. So I think that's - that's my concern, that we're relying very much on a very - fairly inadequate history, which is not a reflection of anything other than the fact that that's normally what happens when parents try and report these things to you.  
         
         
        Q. So that you'd agree that the history, as I have just put it to you, doesn't allow for a concussive event; is that correct?  
         
        A. Doesn't allow.  
         
         
        Q. I said it doesn't allow for it.  
         
        A. It doesn't allow me to understand anything."" 
        
       
      
    151 Dr Donald agreed that the combination of forces that he accepted had been inflicted upon the deceased in whatever way it occurred was clearly dangerous to the child. He said that he thought, ""that would be an observation that most people would make if they saw something like this happen"". It would be something that would have caused an objective bystander to have great fear or concern for the well being of the child. He agreed with every other medical expert who expressed an opinion on it that the deceased's injuries were not explained by anything that the accused described when he said he picked up the deceased quickly from the bassinette. He agreed with the proposition that ""one would clearly have to look outside the incident as related by the father and demonstrated by him to account for the injuries that ultimately caused this child's presentation to the Westmead Children's Hospital"". 
     
      
    152 Dr Donald was also asked to express his opinion concerning the degree of seriousness of the injuries sustained by the deceased: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. On a scale of mild, moderate and serious, how would you describe the shearing injuries to this baby's brain?  
         
        A. They're about as serious as you can get when the mid brain and lower part of the brain are not affected. Now, with the corpus callosum being included, that makes the shearing injury more severe than if only the upper part of cerebral hemispheres were involved.""  
        
       
      
    153 Finally, Dr Donald clarified his view about some issues that had reoccurred regularly throughout the evidence of others: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Just so it's clear to me, can you tell us your opinion, if you have one, about the relative age or timing of the angular acceleration forces that caused the shearing injury on the one hand and the event that led to that skull fracture on the other hand?  
         
        A. No I can't relate it to you, your Honour. All I can say is that if there was a skull fracture there is nothing to indicate that it occurred at a different time, any more than there is to indicate that it occurred at the same time. It might have been possible to be more clear about that if the initial imaging was done immediately after the arrival of the child, because a significant number of children who have impact injuries have superficial injury to the brain under the fracture site. Now, it's quite possible that by the time the CT scan was done that if there had been minor injury, it would have vanished, so I can't relate the two.  
         
         
        Q. Is it your view that, or is it not, please tell us, that the angular acceleration forces that caused the shearing injury to this child could have occurred in the absence of a blunt trauma?  
         
        A. I tend to - I tend to believe that the most serious injury, which this has to be considered to be an example of, is unlikely - well, ""unlikely"", that doesn't help much. I really, I think, subscribe to the impact angular acceleration school, rather than the pure angular acceleration school. So looking at a situation like this, I would be hunting for signs of impact because of the severity of the shearing impact forces inside this little boy's brain.""  
        
       
      
    Discussion 
     
      
    154 It is convenient to dispose of a series of matters that originally appeared likely to be significant in the proceedings but which became uncontroversial for one reason or another as the trial progressed. 
     
      
    155 First, although much evidence was directed to the potential importance of whether or not the deceased had suffered from a series of vitamin deficiencies, and to the question of the extent to which, if at all, these deficiencies had, or may have had, an impact upon the medical condition that caused his death, the issue ultimately became insignificant. It was conceded by the accused that the injuries causing death were of their nature so severe that the interplay between those injuries and the secondary effects flowing from minor vitamin deficiencies could be disregarded. The evidence of Dr Curtin in particular made such a concession, or a finding to that effect in the absence of such a concession, inevitable. 
     
      
    156 Secondly, evidence suggesting that the deceased may have suffered from a fractured tibia was inadequate to support such a finding. It was conceded by the Crown during final submissions that references to the existence or suspicion of some tibial pathology should be wholly disregarded. 
     
      
    157 Thirdly, the series of injuries that the deceased had suffered at times clearly removed from the insults that ultimately led to his death had no causal connection with his death. These injuries were specifically the fractures to his ribs, the suspected fracture to his humerus, and the subdural haematomas. The fracture to his parietal skull and the retinal haemorrhages could not be excluded as having occurred at the time of the events that caused the shearing injury to his brain but they could not equally be dated in a way that conclusively or persuasively aligned them with that event. However, the skull fracture and the retinal haemorrhages were not themselves life threatening even if they were capable of providing support to arguments suggesting the mechanism by which the fatal injuries were inflicted. 
     
      
    158 Fourthly, the version of what occurred on the morning of 20 March 2006, given by the accused, could not have resulted in the infliction of injuries to the deceased from which he died. This was the unanimous view of the medical specialists. The degree of force required to produce the shearing injury to the deceased's brain was such that not even the degree of rough or inappropriate handling to which the accused admitted, and which he demonstrated, could be implicated in the cause of any injury associated with the cause of death. 
     
      
    159 Fifthly, although less significantly, the fact that the deceased had been immunised on the Tuesday preceding his admission to hospital on the following Monday became wholly irrelevant to the assessment of his condition when admitted to hospital. In the events that occurred, this issue was not the subject of medical evidence and the only relevance that it achieved was as a possible explanation for the fitful sleeping patterns and indifferent feeding that was characteristic of the deceased's presentation for the period following the immunisation and up to and including the morning of 20 March 2006. 
     
      
    Critical issues 
     
      
    160 The crime of murder will have been committed by the accused if the Crown establishes beyond reasonable doubt each of the following: 
     
      
      (i) that it was the deliberate act of the accused that caused the death of the deceased;  
       
       
      (ii) that the act of causing death was done with an intention to kill the deceased or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him or with reckless indifference to human life; and  
       
       
      (iii) that the act causing the death of the deceased was not carried out in self-defence. 
      
    161 The issues that emerged as critical to the determination of the present case include the following: 
     
      
      1. The nature and extent of the physical forces that led to the injuries to the deceased that caused his death. 
       
       
      2. The precise nature and extent of the injuries sustained by the deceased that caused his death. 
       
       
      3. The time when, or the time frame within which, the deceased sustained the injuries that caused his death. 
       
      
    162 The physical forces that caused the death of the deceased were universally described by the medical experts who gave evidence about the issue as high angular acceleration forces, probably, but not certainly or even necessarily, accentuated by an episode of impact to the head. Dr Norrie referred to an acceleration/deceleration force with rotation of the brain inside the skull. Dr Webster described the event as being consistent with a non-accidental traumatic head injury causing severe brain damage. Dr Wilkins favoured shaking alone as the probable cause as no medical or environmental or other cause apart from shaking had been identified as contributing to the injury. Dr Wilkins was not convinced that the deceased had in fact sustained a parietal fracture. Dr Moran identified two circumstances as presenting themselves being a severe blow to the head against a hard object and/or a severe rotational acceleration of the brain where an impact to the brain is unnecessary. Shaking is the postulated mechanism in the latter case. 
     
      
    163 No evidence was tendered, and no submissions were made, in support of the proposition that the injuries were occasioned in other than a non-accidental manner. Having regard to the opinions expressed about the mechanism of the infliction of the injuries, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they were inflicted when the deceased was either shaken and/or struck by or against some firm object such as a wall. No opinion supported even the possibility that the deceased could have fallen accidentally from a bed or a change table or otherwise sustained the injuries that were inflicted without some form of active human intervention. 
     
      
    164 The precise nature and extent of the injuries was ultimately not the subject of any relevant controversy. The grey and white matter of the deceased's brain suffered a shearing or tearing at the junction of their respective surfaces as the result of their dissimilar capacities to withstand the exertion of accelerating and decelerating velocities. A differential between the densities of the grey and white matters of the brain meant that they separated along the junction or border of their surfaces in response to the application of forces with which each type of brain matter coped differently. Although the damage was minor in physical terms its consequences were catastrophic in functional terms. Dr Donald described the damage as about the most serious damage that might be expected of its kind. Whatever may be the timing of the onset of unconsciousness, which is the inevitable and ultimate result of the infliction of an injury of this kind (which is discussed in detail below), the victim never recovers. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died as the result of diffuse axonal injury to his brain. 
     
      
    165 The third issue is more troublesome. The significance of the answer will be apparent, but the context in which the issue arises is an important aid to an understanding of it. 
     
      
    166 There is no doubt that the deceased had lost consciousness, had stopped breathing and had suffered a cardiac arrest by the time he was presented to Sister Dollarhide at the hospital at about 9.00am on 20 March 2006. The evidence does not reveal the precise time or times when those three things occurred. The only description of what occurred is that given by the accused in his ERISPs on 24 March and 31 March 2006. The accused said that the breathing pattern of the deceased altered and he went soft. That could be a description of one or some combination of all of those factors. The timing of that event on the accused's account places it at somewhere around 8.00am. 
     
      
    167 Dr Moran favoured the view that the infliction of the known injuries to the deceased's brain would have resulted in a simultaneous and instantaneous loss of consciousness. That opinion would lead, upon the accused's version, to the conclusion that the accused must have been at least in the presence of the deceased when the injuries causing brain damage were inflicted. However, no version given by the accused speaks of the infliction by anyone of force necessary to cause the injuries. The version given by the accused is therefore wrong or incomplete if the deceased lost consciousness in his arms and Dr Moran's view is correct. 
     
      
    168 The accused did not give evidence. No inference unfavourable to the accused can arise in those circumstances and I have notionally directed myself that it is a matter that should have no influence upon my deliberations. Moreover, it has not had any influence upon my decision. 
     
      
    169 The only other potential witnesses to any events in the Telopea premises on the morning of 20 March 2006 are the accused's wife, his sister and his brother-in-law. The accused's wife was not called as a witness in the Crown case. The accused expressly disavowed the availability of any adverse inference that might have been suggested by a failure of the Crown to call, or to attempt to call, her in its case. No evidence was led that directly or indirectly assisted or permitted me to characterise the absence from the witness box of the accused's wife in any way favourably or unfavourably to either the Crown or the accused. I have proceeded therefore to treat that absence as a wholly neutral circumstance. Such an approach would appear to conform to the following submission made on behalf of the accused by his counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        ""This is not a case, I hasten to add, where I submit that you can conclude that there is some  
        Jones v Dunkel 
         damage to the prosecution case. We just don't know exactly why she wasn't called, and I do not make the submission that there is no good reason why she was not called. She is, after all, his wife. However, this is a case where she hasn't been called, and in those circumstances that does provide you with a forensic disadvantage"".  
        
       
      
    170 I have in any event also proceeded to direct myself, in respect of the election both by the Crown and by the accused not to call the accused's wife, in accordance with the statements of principle to be found in the joint judgment of Gaudron and Hayne JJ in Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; (2002) 210 CLR 285 at [5] - [6] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[5] As a general rule a trial judge should not direct the jury in a criminal trial that the accused would be expected to give evidence personally or call others to give evidence. Exceptions to that general rule will be rare. They are referred to in  
        Azzopardi 
         . . . As a general rule, then, a trial judge should not direct the jury that they are entitled to infer that evidence which the accused could have given, or which others, called by the accused, could have given, would not assist the accused. If it is possible that the jury might think that evidence could have been, but was not, given or called by the accused, they should be instructed not to speculate about what might have been said in that evidence.  
         
         
        [6] Further, as a general rule, a trial judge should not direct the jury in a criminal trial that the prosecution would be expected to have called persons to give evidence other than those it did call as witnesses. It follows that, as a general rule, the judge should not direct the jury that they are entitled to infer that the evidence of those who were not called would not have assisted the prosecution. A direction not to speculate about what the person might have said should be given. Again, exceptions to these general rules will be rare and will arise only in cases where it is shown that the prosecution's failure to call the person in question was in breach of the prosecution's duty to call all material witnesses"".  
        
       
      
    171 The only material that touches upon the involvement of the accused's wife in the events at the Telopea premises at any relevant time, and which can be attributed in some way to her, is to be found in the statement of Dr Norrie. She said that the deceased's mother denied the possibility of inflicted head injury. That cryptic reference did not adequately address the question of whether or not it was a statement about her own involvement or a more general denial of the infliction of injury by anyone at all. It is not a piece of evidence that is particularly helpful or instructive in any event. 
     
      
    172 The statement of the accused's sister does not cast any light on the events of the morning of 20 March 2006. She was only able to say that when she left for work the bedroom door where the accused and his family slept was closed. She neither saw nor heard anything. 
     
      
    173 The accused's brother-in-law gave a version of the events of that morning that arguably does not fit with the version given by the accused. The burden of his evidence is that when he returned at about 8.45am from taking his wife to work, the accused was trying to feed the deceased in the dining room as he sat in a chair with the deceased in his arms. The deceased looked like he was refusing to feed. On his version, he told the accused that he should take the child to hospital, but only apparently in response to having been informed by the accused that the deceased was not feeding again. The accused's wife then came downstairs. He said that they were both very worried and she was crying. The accused was upset. The accused and his wife were more upset than he had seen them in the past and particularly so in the last few minutes before they left for hospital. The accused is said to have passed the deceased to his wife and gone upstairs. This is all said to have happened in the space of a few minutes. 
     
      
    174 This version is inconsistent with the version given by the accused, to the extent at least that the accused makes no mention of these events. It is not inconsistent to the extent that what Hartanto said occurred could have happened after the events described by the accused. The statement is unsatisfactory to the extent that it lacks detail about the condition of the deceased. It is inconsistent with the assumption that the description of the deceased having gone soft corresponded to some condition amounting to unconsciousness or cardiac arrest; the descriptions of attempts to feed the deceased do not sit comfortably with the notion of a child in either a state of unconsciousness or cardiac arrest. An assessment of the accuracy or otherwise of Hartanto's recollections was not assisted by an opportunity to observe him as a witness in the courtroom. 
     
      
    175 An acceptance of Dr Moran's primary view about the timing of the critical insult to the deceased and the onset of unconsciousness, and the rejection of the accused's version that must accompany it, does not lead automatically or even persuasively to a conclusion that is necessarily unfavourable to the accused. As a matter of logically available inference, rejection of the accused's version is entirely consistent with the acceptance of Dr Moran's view if the accused's version is replaced with another explanation involving trauma and coincidental unconsciousness. The involvement of the accused in such a version is not a given. The existence of such an explanation in the circumstances of this case is a reasonably available hypothetical alternative. 
     
      
    176 The description given by Hartanto that the accused and his wife were upset and perhaps more upset than he had seen them in the past is presumably accurate. His statement, however, does not assist in isolating or identifying the time or the event that triggered their reaction. The accused's wife, on this version, would appear to have been already upset before she came downstairs to the dining room and the scene described by Hartanto. He did not describe a scene as she arrived that only suggested shock or alarm at what she then saw. So much leaves open the possibility that whatever event had caused the parents to be so upset had already occurred, but no insight is provided into where or when it may have occurred. Somewhat curiously, the accused is said to have passed the deceased to his wife and gone upstairs but Hartanto gives no clue to the condition of the deceased at that time. 
     
      
    177 The issue becomes even less clear when one considers the alternative medical opinion about the temporal relationship between a shearing injury to the brain and the onset of unconsciousness. The outer limit of this opinion is that expressed by Dr Donald who suggested that the shearing injury could have preceded the deceased lapsing into unconsciousness by as much as four hours. He also described the period as ""somewhere in the vicinity of a couple to several hours"". This was based upon his opinion that the loss of consciousness was the result of secondary effects such as hypoxia and ischaemia, which would have followed from the injury, rather than from an immediate shutdown coinciding with the infliction of that injury. He placed emphasis upon the fact that the deceased suffered no injury to the midbrain or brainstem, which would have been more likely to lead to immediate unconsciousness if it had occurred. His view was that it was therefore unreasonable to conclude that an episode of head injury must have occurred immediately prior to the deceased's collapse at home. 
     
      
    178 The significant concession made by Dr Moran is critical in this context. He accepted – indeed, he described it as the ""important point"" – that it was possible to have diffuse axonal injury causing unconsciousness but from which the victim could recover ""some form of consciousness"" before once again lapsing into unconsciousness. This description appears comfortably to fit with the observations of Hartanto who observed no violent event but observed the deceased and his wife to be significantly upset with a child who was arguably in some form of consciousness, even if not complete. The event that caused this to occur could quite easily have occurred in the period of Hartanto's absence when only the accused and his wife were present in the house. This is well within both the time period promoted by Dr Donald and the analysis conceded by Dr Moran. 
     
      
    179 Other medical specialists also gave opinions that would accommodate this hypothesis. Dr Norrie spoke of minutes or up to an hour. Dr Wilkins said ""minutes rather than hours"" and agreed that he could not exclude a period of up to two hours. During any such period the deceased was in the Telopea premises with both the accused and the deceased’s mother. 
     
      
    180 It is of course necessary to look at all of the circumstances in a case such as the present where no single piece of evidence of itself inculpates the accused. I have had regard to the passage in Martin v Osborne [1936] HCA 23; (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375 where Dixon J said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation. This means that, according to the common course of human affairs, the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed"". 
        
       
      
    181 To the extent, therefore, that the Crown relies upon circumstantial evidence, guilt should not only be a rational inference but should be the only rational inference that can be drawn from the circumstances. It is therefore important to outline the circumstances relied upon by the Crown to infer the guilt of the accused because not only must these circumstances be capable of giving rise to the inference of guilt but must be the only inference available to be drawn. It is trite to observe that the Crown must establish the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and such a doubt will remain if any other inference is reasonably open on the evidence: Shepherd v The Queen [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573 at 579. I take into account that intermediate facts, if any, that constitute links in the chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt must also be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn. Moreover, in the case of evidence that in effect consists of strands in a cable from which guilt is sought to be inferred, as opposed to links in a chain, no fact or facts being by itself or themselves necessary to the ultimate inference or conclusion, I should not look at the evidence as to each fact or circumstance separately, but I should consider the accumulation of the evidence. I may in such a case draw an inference of guilt from a combination of facts, none of which alone may be capable of supporting that inference: Shepherd v The Queen (supra) at 580. The ultimate inference of guilt, however, must exclude any other reasonable explanation or explanations than that of guilt. 
     
      
    182 As the Crown quite properly emphasised, this is a circumstantial case and it is necessary to look at all of the circumstances. First, the accused was a relatively inexperienced father living in cramped and difficult circumstances, occupying a bedroom with his wife and the deceased who slept on a mattress on the floor of their room. The house they occupied was that of their in-laws and presumably that fact added to the pressures upon the accused and his wife. The deceased was a fussy child from birth and probably suffered additionally from a mild reaction to his recent vaccination that left him feeding indifferently and sleeping fitfully. The night before his admission to hospital, the deceased was awake on an hourly basis and the accused would in those circumstances have been tired and harried. 
     
      
    183 The accused was also under pressure to support the family. Chinese custom was said to impose a particularly onerous obligation upon young fathers for the care and support of wives and newborn babies. Documentation supporting a claim for work done for his employer in the time around the date of the deceased's admission to hospital showed that the accused had worked full days with little time for rest. His work imposed high pressures and stresses upon the accused and these were not relieved at the time leading up to the collapse of his child. There was no relevant family support for the accused and his wife in Australia and the fact that Dunyao had been sent to Singapore was said to be a recognition of the stresses that accompanied the early weeks following the birth of a new child rather than something that would have led to a significant relief of pressure upon the accused and his wife in the circumstances. The parents had, in effect, been left alone to focus on the care of the deceased themselves. 
     
      
    184 Secondly, the accused made statements to workers at the hospital that amounted to what the Crown described as ""admissions"". The Crown described these as ""crucial admissions"" that were made at the hospital at the time when the deceased was still being intensively cared for and when his medical condition and outcome were still unknown or doubtful. These statements included the statements to Ms Jubelin that he ""may have hit him too hard"" and ""I don't care what punishment I get, I deserve it"", and questions about responsibilities for medical costs for injuries that he may have caused. The accused also asked Ms Jubelin about whether or not he would be charged. The Crown's submission was that ""we have now moved on to a situation where one of those people [i.e. the accused and his wife] is openly acknowledging mistreating the child and speaking about [his] sense of guilt in relation to the child and speaking at that point in time while the child is still critically ill in hospital and subject to intensive medical treatment that he doesn't care what punishment he gets, that he deserves it"". 
     
      
    185 In his records of interview the accused admitted to hitting the deceased on the stomach and the buttocks and the suspected, but not proven, presence of blood in the child's stools was emphasised as an indicator of the degree of force applied. The accused agreed that such force would be unreasonable in some circumstances but insisted that what he did in fact was acceptable. The accused agreed that he had been awake all night and agreed that he could have been angry (""there’s a bit of anger in there"") but said that he was also anxious. He agreed that he was obviously stressed. He denied deliberately hurting the deceased. He agreed that he had become quite frustrated. It was submitted that the reference by the accused to the deceased as ""a naughty boy"" at the time he struck his stomach was ""a very important piece of evidence about the state of this accused's mind and the stresses and pressures that he [was] under"". The Crown submitted that any suggestion that the accused's statements were some form of ""wondering aloud or querying"" or ""matters of that sort"" were ""a nonsense"". The accused was said to be a sophisticated man whose statements should not be merely discounted as ""some sort of musing"". 
     
      
    186 Thirdly, the Crown points to the fractured skull and the prospect that the likelihood is that the fracture was occasioned at the same time as the shearing injury. Dr Moran's assessment of fifty times the amount of force flowing from an impact injury, as opposed to any other form of injury such as shaking alone, tended strongly to support a temporal connection between the two injuries. It was submitted by the Crown that the overwhelming preponderance of evidence linked the two. In this respect it should however be observed that the deceased's prior injuries, including old fractures and subdural haematomas, were not relied upon as being in any way related to the cause of death and were not suggested to be circumstantially related to any set of circumstances inculpating the accused. They were undoubtedly evidence of physical injury, probably if not certainly non-accidental, but connecting them in any way to the accused was not attempted and certainly not established. 
     
      
    187 Referring to these and other similar circumstances, the Crown submitted that what emerged was a clear admission from the accused to the infliction of an amount of force, that did not lead to death, which amounted to a form of behaviour by a person acting out of frustration inflicted upon a child in an extraordinarily inappropriate way. The Crown submitted that what emerged was an ""extraordinarily strong circumstance pointing towards the perpetrator of the greater injuries, even if they are unadmitted"". In other words, to the extent that the accused admitted to the commission of the type of acts and the degrees of force that he in fact agreed to, there was an inference in the circumstances that pointed to him as the perpetrator of the greater physical injuries that caused the death of the deceased. That was described as ""the fulcrum point in the Crown case"". The Crown submitted ""that at all points in time it is the accused who has acknowledged his care of the child and his mistreatment of the child. . . even if not to a level that would account for the injuries"" that ultimately led to his death. 
     
      
    188 The Crown conceded that in assessing the evidence upon which it relied that it was ""quite plain"" that one could ""take out of the picture everybody except the mother and the father"". 
     
      
    189 The accused's response to these matters was simple. This was said to be a case where there are considerable uncertainties about all of the necessary proofs that are required to convict the accused of either murder or manslaughter. There are uncertainties about what was the exact act that caused the injuries that led to the death of the deceased. There are uncertainties about what injuries were contemporaneous with the injuries that caused the death of the deceased. There are uncertainties about when the acts were occasioned that caused the death of the deceased and there is uncertainty about whose acts caused the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    190 There is little doubt that there are uncertainties about what was the exact act that caused the injuries that led to the death of the deceased. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died of a shearing injury to his brain, caused by what all medical experts who expressed an opinion upon it described as an acceleration/deceleration injury, at the site of the junction between the grey and white matter of the brain. I am also satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the act that caused those injuries was non-accidental in the sense that it did not occur without human intervention. The deceased was too young and inactive to have caused the injury himself. Dr Donald, who was called in the case for the accused, described the ""impact-derived acceleration forces"" and ""significant flexion [and] extension of the head"" in addition to the impact that ""would be adequately explained by shaking"". There is in my view no scope for a reasonable doubt that the deceased's injuries were inflicted by the employment of a physical mechanism falling within such descriptions. Whilst the exact act may not be discoverable, there is to my mind no scope for a reasonable doubt about the type of act concerned. 
     
      
    191 There is also little doubt that there are uncertainties about what injuries were contemporaneous with the injuries that caused the death of the deceased. These uncertainties, however, are irrelevant. The Crown case is effectively limited to reliance upon the infliction of a brain shearing injury as sufficient to cause death. I have found that such an injury did cause death. The presence or absence or contemporaneity or otherwise of one or some other injury is of no consequence in circumstances where the brain injury alone was a sufficient cause. The fractured bones and subdural haematomas occurred at other times. The fact that they bespeak other violent acts or abusive treatment is undoubtedly troublesome, but does not diminish the causal potency or significance of the ultimately fatal insult. The retinal haemorrhages may have occurred as the result of the infliction of a severe rotational force or they may not. They may have occurred at the time of the infliction of the injury causing death or they may not. Once it is accepted, as I have accepted, that the act that caused the relevant fatal injury was as I have indicated, the significance of the retinal haemorrhages as evidence tending to support a particular occurrence in preference to another subsides.  
     
      
    192 There are uncertainties about when the acts that caused the death of the deceased were occasioned. These uncertainties flow from a combination of two competing factors. First, the medical controversy about whether or not the deceased would have or must have become instantly unconscious at the moment that he sustained the shearing injury to his brain or whether or not it would have been possible that unconsciousness may have been delayed for some period of minutes or hours following that event. Secondly, the evidentiary controversy between what the accused said he was doing when the deceased is said to have gone ""soft"" (presumably unconscious) in his arms and the uncontradicted medical view that nothing that the accused described doing to the deceased in the moments before that happened could have led to the shearing injury to the deceased's brain that caused him to lose consciousness. The reliability of the version given by the accused is very largely if not entirely dependent upon acceptance of the medical opinion that allows for the lapse into unconsciousness following a brain shearing injury to occur other than instantaneously or simultaneously. Nothing said by the accused or by his brother-in-law about the events leading to the deceased becoming soft involves any act by the accused that was sufficiently violent to cause the relevant injury. 
     
      
    193 Neither the accused's version nor Hartanto's version explains the circumstance that caused the injury. If the accused and Hartanto are accepted then the injury must have occurred earlier. Neither version describes any sufficient level of force. Earlier infliction of the injury would only have been possible if the injury and the unconsciousness that the accused appeared to describe occurred at different times. If this were not medically possible, then the accused's version would have to be rejected. However, rejection of the accused’s version for this or any other reason is not necessarily inconsistent with innocence. The infliction of the relevant brain injury at an earlier time does not in those circumstances point only in the direction of the accused. 
     
      
    194 In the final analysis the medical controversy turned out to be less controversial than would appear to have been anticipated. Dr Donald was of the view that at least two hours could have separated the infliction of the shearing injury and a state of unconsciousness from which the deceased did not recover. Dr Moran ultimately agreed with that proposition. Dr Wilkins was unable to exclude two hours. Dr Norrie would appear to have accepted as much as one hour as possible. Any of these periods was long enough to account for Hartanto's absence from the house with his wife when only the accused and his wife were present with the deceased. The deceased could well have sustained the relevant injury at any time during the two-hour period before the accused and his wife decided to take the child to hospital. There is in my opinion no medical controversy that adversely affects this analysis.  
     
      
    195 It was finally submitted on behalf of the accused that uncertainty remains about whose act or acts caused the injury that led to the death of the deceased. Howsoever one views the circumstantial material that can be factored into this inquiry, there is no one circumstance or combination of circumstances that points only in the direction of the accused. There are only two possible sources of the injury to the deceased. There is no evidence that points persuasively at the accused as opposed to the accused's wife. For example, the existence of evidence that the injuries to the deceased were of a type, or had been delivered with such force, that could only have been caused by a male, would suggest, according to the common course of human affairs, that the occurrence of such a proved fact would be so highly likely to be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved, that anything other than the guilt of the accused could not reasonably be supposed. No evidence of this type exists. 
     
      
    196 Nor are the factors upon which the Crown relies of this type. The accused's wife was under the same physical and emotional pressures as the accused. She was also presumably without sleep as the result of the deceased himself not sleeping through the night and feeding irregularly. She was subject to the same poverty of family support as the accused. She was also caring for the deceased and had access to him in much the same way as the accused. No evidence of anything attributed to her amounts to an unambiguous denial of involvement in the cause of the deceased's injuries. No so-called admission by the accused of rough handling of the deceased is capable of explaining the cause of the injuries or of proving who did cause them. Prior injuries to the accused are in the same category. No aggregation of proved circumstances, considered in sequence or in combination, is capable of excluding at least one other equally available alternative hypothesis. The precise submission made on behalf of the accused in this respect was that as ""there [were] at least two possible suspects for the perpetrator of the act or acts which caused death, the accused and his wife, [I] could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused"". 
     
      
    197 This includes the so-called admissions made by the accused at the hospital. The accused admitted to certain behaviour that he would not usually have engaged in, including picking the deceased up very quickly from his bassinette without supporting his head. He also spoke of hitting the child on his stomach and buttocks. At the point where the accused was revealing these things and referring to his arrest and punishment, the deceased was in a grave medical condition and his prognosis was either uncertain or very poor. No information permitting the accused or his wife accurately to comprehend the extent of the child’s injuries and prognosis had been provided. Indeed, some insight into this is available from that part of the accused's ERISP on 24 March 2006 when it is revealed to the accused for the first time that the deceased had a fractured skull. The transcript of that event is reproduced above at par [28]. It shows in my opinion a genuine surprise and alarm on the part of the accused. 
     
      
    198 In this context I consider that the circumstantial force of the so-called admissions is small. The reactions of the accused and his statements of what could be characterised as some form of remorse are explicable by alternative hypotheses entirely consistent with innocence. It is not difficult to imagine that there may have been another reason, or other reasons, why the accused would make statements appearing to draw attention to himself that were not in fact statements amounting to an admission of guilt. I agree with the Crown submission that the circumstances reveal a ""clear indication of a form of behaviour which is acting out of frustration on a child in an extraordinarily inappropriate way"", but precisely whose behaviour is by no means sufficiently revealed.  
     
      
    199 It follows that I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is the person who inflicted the injuries to the deceased that ultimately led to his death. 
     
      
    200 Counsel for each of the parties made submissions with respect to the mental element of the offence of murder and the alternative verdict of manslaughter. The Crown's submission included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The accused stands charged of murder. I cannot take your Honour to any intent to murder demonstrated, other than by the scale of the actual injury itself. There are no admissions of intent that I have been able to find in the material placed before your Honour, although there are admissions, as previously discussed, of anger. So in relation to the combination of admissions of anger and the inherent intended consequence of the mistreatment of this child, it seems to me that that perhaps remains open for consideration on the head of recklessness in relation to indifference to human life, but there is a clear and strong case on manslaughter.""  
        
       
      
    However, by reason of the conclusion that I have reached with respect to the infliction of the injuries that caused the death of the deceased, it is unnecessary to consider these matters.

    JUDGMENT 1. Men and women engage in sexual activities for a variety of reasons and to satisfy a variety of motives. Lovers and romantics see sexual intercourse as an occasion of giving and receiving from their partner love, bonding and pleasure in a warm sexual intimacy. There are other who are simply participating in sexual activity for their own self centred sexual arousal and satisfaction. The criminal law makes no judgment about such people provided the sexual partner consents. Where, however, there is an absence of consent the criminal law recognises such conduct as violent, antisocial behaviour. Where the intercourse is with a dead or an unconscious body the criminal law recognises such conduct not only as violent, antisocial behaviour but also behaviour touched with alarming depravity as well because the violation of the victim moves beyond the violence of power over a struggling, weaker person to become the violence against an unresisting, inert body. 2. Neil William Mintern on 26 June 2005 at Bourke had sexual intercourse with Margaret Joan Dickson in circumstances where she was unconscious, without her consent, knowing she was not consenting, in circumstances where he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm upon her that, among other things, contributed to her unconsciousness. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct in penetrating the unconscious body of Margaret Dickson. 3. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for these offences before this court, committed by this offender, harming the particular victim, he did in her community. See Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80].4. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires the sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and the to offender. My fact-finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. A tender of agreed set of facts does not relieve the judge from his/her fact-finding responsibility, it simply limits the material from which those facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts do not reflect the actual events that occurred it must be remembered the Court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it. In this case I have real concerns as to whether the facts, as agreed, accurately reflect the actual events. 5. An unusual feature of this case is the delay between the offending and the offender’s arrest and the subsequent sentencing disposition. That delay, which causes an impact, will need assessing. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. 6. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, whether this offence attracts a standard non-parole period and, if so, indeed, the length of the parole period and, finally of course, the ultimate length of the term of overall imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Facts7. The agreed facts are in these terms: “The victim Margaret Dickson (twenty­one years old) arrived in Bourke on 15 June 2005 to visit her sister who was having her eighteenth birthday. Whilst at Bourke the victim stayed at a number of friends’ and relatives’ houses. On Friday 24 June the victim saw Neil Mintern (the accused) in the main street. She had known him for nine to ten years and he had gone out with her sister. At this stage they did not talk. Later that night whilst at the Oxley Club with family and friends the accused and the victim were seen to be talking and being friendly. Both were well intoxicated. The accused and the victim left the Oxley Club at about midnight. The accused and the victim were observed by police at about 12.15am on the footpath outside Hawkins Tyres. They appeared well acquainted and in close proximity and actively touching each other. The victim was going to take the accused to see her sister. They made a short stop at Jim Knight’s (a friend) house to see if her sister was there. They were told she was at her auntie’s house. Both proceeded to walk to the auntie’s house. 8. Whilst walking they passed the Girl Guides Hall on Hope Street when the accused put his arms around her shoulder, covered her mouth and proceeded to carry her to the hall. The accused attempted to pull her pants down. The victim told him to stop or she would scream. The accused said “don’t be silly girl” and punched her in the face. The victim then fell back against the wall. The accused proceeded to sit on the stomach area of the victim. She tried to escape the accused. The accused bit her bottom lip and her breasts. The victim forced her fingers into the accused’s face. The accused and victim continued to struggle for a short period of time when the accused hit the victim to the left side of her head. The combination of the alcohol and the hit caused the victim to pass out. After coming to, the victim noticed that she had no trousers or underpants on. She found her trousers and put them on and went back to Jim Knight where she made a complaint that she had been sexually assaulted. Subsequent analysis found the accused’s DNA in the high vaginal area of the victim. The accused was arrested in Orange two and a bit years later on 5 October 2007 and has been bail refused since that date.” 9. The agreed facts postulate that it was a combination of alcohol and the hit that caused the victim to pass out. There is a responsibility on counsel, particularly the Crown, to agree to facts that reflect a true rather than an artificial situation. Immediately before the blow was struck that is associated with the unconsciousness the accused was sitting on the victim’s stomach. No doubt that had some impact on her capacity to breathe. Even so she was trying to escape, she was struggling. She was forcing her fingers into the accused’s face. There is no suggestion in that passage of the agreed facts that the effects of alcohol are of such a high level that she is in a state of near collapse and about to pass out. The plea though has been entered and accepted upon the basis that the accused’s blow to the left hand side of the complainant’s face alone did not render the complainant unconscious, that alcohol also played some part or a part in rendering her unconscious. However, I will not accept that her consumption of alcohol played an equal part or the greater part in rendering her suddenly unconscious. 10. At the time of his offending Mintern was aged nineteen. He had started drinking early on that day and had been drinking the previous night. It would seem that he had been consuming liquor, including spirits, through the day up to the time of his offending. Objection Criminality11. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offence with criminality of an offence of a similar kind or of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality can be evaluated. The objective criminality obviously would have a very important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 12. The useful starting point in the assessment of objective criminality in sexual assault cases is to remind the court of part of a judgment of Mahoney JA, a judge of appeal, in R v Gebrail unreported NSWCCA 18/Nov (1994).  
     
      
      As I have indicated every offence of this kind is a serious offence. But to those whose duty it is to deal with crimes of this kind and to sentence those who commit them know that though each case is inherently serious some are more serious than others. In some cases the degree of violence, physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation and otherwise are much greater than are involved [in other cases]. It is to be understood that in sentencing it is appropriate, indeed in most cases it is necessary, that the sentencing judge form and record his assessment of where on the relevant scale of seriousness this particular offence lies.  
      
    14. In 1993 the then Chief Justice, Gleeson CJ, made the point that non-consensual intercourse is an extreme form of violence and one which the community expects the courts to take very seriously ( R v Hartikainen unreported NSWCCA 8 June 1993). Even if no additional violence is administered other than the intercourse (see R v Pay (1999) NSWCCA 40 [7]) unwanted forced intrusion into the privacy, indeed the intimacy, of a complainant’s body and psyche against her will or without her consent by the use of physical power and callous disregard of her wishes or feelings marks the essence of the criminality of these offences.” 15. At the time the offending conduct began, both offender and complainant were walking to an auntie’s house. Earlier there had been some level of intimacy as they were seen in close proximity and actively touching each other. The facts though do not account for the offender’s sudden change in attitude. Was this simply gratuitous and spontaneous administration of violence to a lady who thus far had been content to interact in an intimate way with him? Was he impatient wanting intercourse without pursuing social routines, such as visiting aunties? Or has the complainant made her position plain that she would not be having sex with him? I am unable to speculate. The facts simply disclose a sudden and violent change in attitude without any provocation by the complainant. 16. The violence administered to the complainant was sufficient to render her, together with the alcohol, unconscious. Unconsciousness is usually regarded as grievous bodily harm. I do not aggravate his criminality on account of his contribution to her unconsciousness ( De Simone v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383) but I do regard his penetration of her whilst she was unconscious as part of his criminality. When a woman is unconscious she is unable to respond with movement to the intrusion of the penetrating penis even in circumstances where she does not want the penis inside her. There is therefore a greater chance of injury in circumstances where there is penetration in this way. In this case there is no evidence of vaginal injury. The agreed facts are silent upon the precise injuries amounting actual bodily harm. She received two punches to her face, I have inferred bruising and swelling at the impact sites. She was lying on the ground when sexually assaulted and while I have inferred abrasions and bruising resulting from the contact with the ground and the accused’s sexual assault upon her I have not taken these into account as they occurred within the sexual intercourse and do not constitute a form of aggravation under s 61J(2)(a). The level of violence administered by the accused is certainly significant, however there are instances of s 61J(1)offences where the violence administered is both more intense and more prolonged. 17. This is an offence for which there is a standard non-parole period applicable for an offence falling in the mid range of seriousness. The case law establishes that the standard non­parole period applies after trial, all other things being equal (see R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168). The standard non-parole period is ten years. The standard non-parole period would apply to all offences created by s 61J of the Crimes Act. On my reading of the section there are more than a dozen circumstances of aggravation, some more serious than others, created by the section. The circumstances of aggravation relied upon here is the infliction of actual bodily harm before the intercourse, namely the two blows. Thus the actual bodily harm inflicted constituting the circumstance of aggravation is confined to the injuries occasioned in the course of rendering the complainant unconscious. I have indicated I regard her unconsciousness as amounting to grievous bodily harm and have not taken it into account as a circumstance of aggravation. That leaves the swelling and bruises occasioned by the blows. There is no evidence of any bite marks although there was evidence of biting of the lip and breasts. 18. In determining whether the offence I am dealing with constitutes an offence falling in the mid range of seriousness of s 61J offence I must compare it to other offences created by s 61J that would have criminality constituting a mid range of seriousness. In this case the violence, including sexual violence, was administered to only one victim. The humiliation arising from the intercourse was not compounded by others of the accused’s associates present demeaning the complainant nor was she one of those particularly vulnerable persons under sixteen or with serious physical or intellectual disabilities. 19. There are a number of matters that really mitigate this offence. It was not planned, indeed it appears to be a spur of the moment decision. This accused was aged nineteen at the time of offending. He had consumed alcohol for most of that day. It was not taken to give him Dutch courage but simply consumed. I do therefore take into account that it must have impacted upon his executive brain functions including particularly judgment and his capacity to restrain his inhibitions. 20. This offence falls below the mid range of seriousness. Necessarily any offence falling within s 61J must be a serious offence and this offence is no exception. Both parties have argued that a starting figure of eight years is appropriate. My own view is that while that figure is toward the lower end of the range it is one within the range. Subjective Matters 21. I am now required to turn to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. 22. Neil Mintern is a twenty­three year old Aboriginal man living in a de facto relationship with Ms Lucas. He is the father of her three children, the youngest about two weeks old and the oldest as I understand it under three. He came from a family of six. His is a complex family structure. There is an older sister and an older half brother. There are three or four other siblings who have different mothers. This offender was raised predominantly by his mother after his parents had separated when he was aged but one year old. He was exposed to serious dysfunctional upbringing including drugs and alcohol abuse in the home. He told Dr Allnut, retained by the defence, “I grew up around a lot of people [having] sex with kids”. The offender himself was abused when aged six by a so called “family friend”. Education Skills and Employment23. This offender achieved Year 10 at the age of fifteen. He has learning problems in that he was unable to concentrate and was hyperactive. He has difficulties reading and writing although he says he is able to do both to a level where he can at least function. He had no difficulty making friends or maintaining friends at school. He got on adequately with his teachers. His education and employment history appear to have been hampered by his family’s itinerant lifestyle and his illicit substance and alcohol abuse. His father, as I say, believes he is functionally illiterate but the offender says that he can read and write at survival level.  General Health24. He is aged now twenty­three and presents as generally being in good health although Dr Allnut notes that the offender has lost about thirty kilograms since he has been in gaol, ten of them in the last couple of months. It may be that that loss of weight is due to stress to which I will come later. Mental Health 25. The offender has a number of significant stressors including his concern about the outcome of his court proceedings and more particularly the whereabouts and safety of his mother. She has now been lost for some three months. Police are sufficiently concerned to have commenced an investigation including a forensic investigation of her home but as matters presently stand she has not been accounted for. Dr Allnut comes to a view that the offender demonstrated mild symptoms of a depressive disorder characterised by a depressed mood, reduced appetite, energy, concentration and motivation with some social withdrawal. He complained of some anxiety but not to the extent that Dr Allnut would have diagnosed an anxiety disorder. Psychosexual History26. I turn now to the psychosexual history of the offender. The offender told Dr Allnut that he learnt about sex from “other lads”, that his first sexual experience was at the age of six when he was molested. That sexual interference was not one isolated incident but apparently continued for some time. It involved oral sex and it occurred on four occasions. He was again sexually abused at the age of thirteen or fourteen when he was seduced by a girl aged then in her twenties. He claims not to have prior experiences of sexual fantasies, urges or behaviours involving sexual activity with children under the age of thirteen. He claims that he does not fantasise in respect of rape or sex with violence , sadism, sadomasochism, bondage or other fantasies of that kind. He conceded that his past history exposed difficulty with sexual regulation and he accepted that he had a sexual regulation difficulty. When asked why that might be so he said he was unsure but offered this explanation. “It’s what I grew up around, a lot of people had sex with kids.” But he was unsure of the reason. 27. He has in his childhood been exposed to domestic violence, physical abuse and sexual abuse. The sexual abuse in the opinion of Dr Allnut seems to have occurred over a significant period of time and in a number of circumstances, initially by an older male and then by virtue of the twenty something year old girl. His first probable consensual sexual relationship occurred when he was fifteen. Dr Allnut describes him as having been brought up in an environment where sexual boundaries were frequently blurred. 28. The Probation and Parole Service assessed Mr Mintern as in the high risk of re­offending in a sexual matter based on the Static-99. They say that the score is based upon his history of sexual offending, a previous victim being an unrelated stranger, his de-facto relationship not having endured an unbroken two year period and the offender being under twenty­five years of age. That assessment was made on 15 May this year by a departmental senior psychologist. Dr Allnut’s opinion was that given he had two previous convictions for indecent assault and is now charged with a sexual offence concern should be raised about an underlying sexual deviance. 29. Another factor in assessing the psychosexual history is the fact that this offender has a history of substance abuse problems particularly with alcohol. Dr Allnut comes to a view that the offender falls at least into a moderate risk group by which it seems to me he is saying that that is a view most favourable to the offender. The Probation and Parole Service recommended that if the offender is given a custodial sentence that he participate in custody based intensive treatment. That is the Cubit Program. The Cubit Program is based upon cognitive therapy and is targeted at high risk, incarcerated male offenders who offend against both adults and children. The program targets offending behaviour with empathy, victim awareness, impulse control and social competence. The duration of the program is ten months. The hierarchy of interventions within the department requires offenders with sexual violence convictions to engage in Cubit Program in the first instance, then addressed any other criminogenic needs at the completion of that program. Alcohol and Other Drug Issues30. The offender at the time of his arrest had not been abusing any substances and had drunk alcohol two days before his arrest, the significance of that being he was not drinking daily. The offender told the Probation and Parole Service that his alcohol and cannabis abuse had been ongoing factors in his offending behaviour. He accepts that he regularly engaged in binge drinking and cannabis consumption to the level of intoxication affecting his memory. He has not sought assistance in those matters. It must be noted of course that on the day of this offending he was drunk and had been drinking I think since the previous day. 31. The offender’s attitude to the offence is basically this. He claims very little memory of it. He says he remembers flashes of events on the evening on which he sexually assaulted his victim. He says that he had forgotten the event until he was made aware that a warrant had been issued for him. He, having been confronted with the event, expressed that he recognised his behaviour was unacceptable and claimed sorrow for his actions. He did not elaborate any further. He did not seek to minimise the impact this offence could have had upon his victim but did claim a diminution of his responsibility as a consequence of his level intoxication. In fairness to him that would appear to be a proposition with which I have agreed because I have counted it as one of the mitigating factors. 32. I regard his plea of guilty on presentation of the indictment as a plea in which he was indicating a preparedness to accept responsibility for his criminal activity. The plea was not of course entered at the Local Court but it does have an important value. The complainant does not have to give evidence and the Crown case would, in my view, have had some difficulties given the earlier situation and the complainant’s absence of memory because she was unconscious. 33. The offender does have a criminal history. His first offending was done in February of 2000. It was an indecent act with a child under sixteen. He was dealt with without conviction and released on a youth supervision order for a period of twelve months. It was dealt with in the Benalla Children’s Court. A year and a half later in July of 2001 he was dealt with for an indecent assault and was released. There was no conviction recorded there because he was also being dealt in the Children’s Court. Nothing then appears to occur until March of 2005 when there is a further indecent assault and he was convicted and a community based order for two years was made for him to perform a hundred hours of community service. A psychological assessment and treatment were ordered. My understanding is that that part of the order was not complied with. In 2007 there is an assault occasioning actual bodily harm dealt with in the Orange Local Court and that is an offence of course that occurs after the offence that I am dealing with and would only go to his rehabilitation prospects. In respect of that offence he was imprisoned for twelve months, it was suspended. There is no breach of any bond in respect of this offence, as I say the offence that I am dealing with occurred two years earlier than that. 34. Clearly this is an offence calling for recognition of the need for general deterrence and, in this case because of the prior sexual matters appearing on the record, for personal deterrence. The maximum penalty for this offence is one carrying twenty years imprisonment. I mentioned at the outset that there appears to me to be some delay in finalising this matter. The offender has a right to silence and is not thereby required to report any unlawful conduct by him to the police. Given that it is a right it seems to me that it cannot be said that this delay of two years prior to his arrest can be laid at his feet. There was material, which identified him fairly early in piece as the offender. The offence is now three years old and in that sense is somewhat stale. He was living in the community for a period of two years prior to this offence before being arrested. Whilst there is another offence of assault, that is of violence, there is no other apparent sexual offending. While the delay in finalising this matter is not great I have given some very modest allowance particularly in respect of setting the minimum term. 35. I come back then to the question of the standard non-parole period only to remark that there is nothing in the subjective features that would cause me to review my initial decision that a standard non-parole period did not apply. Setting the Sentence and Applying the Discount36. But for the plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of eight years. Applying the twenty percent discount that would bring the overall sentence to one of six years and eight months. 37. I find special circumstances. The reason motivating me to find special circumstances is the offender’s willingness to undertake the Cubit Program, his youth at the time of the commission of this offence, the presence of young children at home making his incarceration more arduous for him and that it is my view his rehabilitation would be better achieved in the community. He was arrested on 5 October and has been in custody since that time. 38. Would you stand up please now. Neil William Mintern you are convicted of the offence that you on or about 25 June 2005 at Bourke had sexual intercourse with Margaret Joan Dickson without her consent, knowing she was not consenting and in circumstances of aggravation, namely that immediately before the commission of that offence you inflicted actual bodily harm upon her. For that offence I sentence you to a minimum term of three years and six months to commence from 5 October 2007 and to expire on 4 April 2011. I set a balance of term of three years and two months to expire on 4 June 2014. 39. I should note that in setting that sentence I have had regard to the JIRS statistics provided to me and that that puts him in a position where forty­two or forty­three percent of the offenders received either the sentence he received or a lesser sentence than he received. Officer this offender has a baby and it’s just been born two weeks ago. He’s not seen the baby but once in court, do you mind if I allow his partner to come forward and show him the baby again? Yes you may come forward Ms Lucas.  WILLIAMS: Your Honour could I just raise one very minor factual matter? Your Honour said in terms of his drinking on the day of the offence and previous to that that your Honour thought - I think the words you used your Honour was, I think he’d been drinking since the previous day.  HIS HONOUR: Nine o’clock the previous morning is in the back of my mind.  WILLIAMS: I think your Honour’s referring to the history set out on page 4 of Dr Allnut’s report in relation to--  HIS HONOUR: Yes it comes from Dr Allnut I can remember that. WILLIAMS: On page 4 under the heading, “your client’s account of the alleged offence. The history is this. He started drinking early that day, I think that refers to the day of the offence, he had been drinking the night before and had got up and they had kept going, estimated here it started at 9am.” As I said it’s a very minor matter but insofar as the remarks may have suggested it was--  HIS HONOUR: Well the point that I was seeking to make was that there was alcohol in his blood no doubt when he started drinking.  WILLIAMS: Absolutely, yes your Honour. I once again thank your Honour for this opportunity for my client.  HIS HONOUR: There was one other factor that I meant to mention and I didn’t, under Mental Health which I might just put as an addendum. It was that there is a positive family history of mental illness, with the mother having schizophrenia.  WILLIAMS: Yes. HIS HONOUR: Which would be a factor both in terms of his upbringing and his immediate concern for her now.  WILLIAMS: Yes your Honour.  HIS HONOUR: Thank you Ms Long, thank you officer I’m very appreciative of that. Right Mr Mintern you may be returned to custody.

     PROTHONOTARY OF THE SUPREME COURT OF NSW v JOHN COLIN HOLT 
     
     
      
       
       Judgment 
       
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Gzell J. 
     
      
    2 McCOLL JA: I agree with Gzell J. 
     
      
    3 GZELL J: The claimant is the Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. She seeks declarations that the opponent, John Colin Holt, is guilty of professional misconduct, is not a person of good fame and character and is not a fit and proper person to remain on the local roll of lawyers of this Court. The claimant seeks an order that the name of the opponent be removed from that roll. 
     
      
    4 The opponent does not contest the proceedings. He consents to the declarations and order and consents to and agrees with an agreed statement of facts. The claimant no longer presses an order that the opponent pay her costs. 
     
      
    5 Despite the opponent's attitude to the proceedings it is not appropriate, however, that the declarations and order sought be made unless the Court is itself satisfied that they should be made and records the findings upon which they are made (Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v McCaffery [2004] NSWCA 470 especially at [12]). 
     
      
    6 The agreed statement of facts is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On 25 November 1966 the Opponent was admitted as a Solicitor of the Supreme Court of New South Wales. His name remains on the Local Roll of Lawyers.

        3. On 30 June 2006 before Hock J in the District Court at Sydney the Opponent, having pleaded guilty, was convicted of, and sentenced in relation to, four criminal offences as follows:

          Crimes Act 1900 
           (NSW). (“King Count 1”) 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) Between 5 August 1993 and 21 February 1993 ( 
          sic 
          ) being the trustee of property wholly for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the Estate of the late James McEwan King, appropriating that property (money in the sum of $29,310.00) for his own use in violation of good faith and with intent to defraud, contrary to s172 of the  
          Crimes Act 1900  
          (NSW). (“King Count 2”) 
          
         
         
          
          (iii) On 21 August 1997 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales obtaining property (money in the sum of $1000.00) by a false pretence (to Margaret Fisher that he held a current Practising Certificate authorising him to practise as a solicitor in the State of New South Wales) with intent to defraud, contrary to s179 of the  
          Crimes Act 1900  
          (NSW). (“Fisher Count 1”). 
          
         
         
          
          (iv) On 16 July 1998 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales obtaining property (money in the sum of $1000.00) by a false pretence (to Margaret Fisher that he held a current Practising Certificate authorising him to practise as a solicitor in the State of New South Wales) with intent to defraud, contrary to s179 of the  
          Crimes Act 1900  
          (NSW). (“Fisher Count 2”)

        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  
        (NSW) the opponent by way of a “Form 1” admitted to having committed, and the judge took into account, ten further offences of obtaining property (money in various amounts) by a false pretence (in each case to Margaret Fisher that he held a Practising Certificate authorising him to practise as a solicitor in the State of New South Wales) with intent to defraud, contrary to s179 of the  
        Crimes Act 1900  
        (NSW) on the following dates involving the following sums:

          (ii) On 3 October 1997, $1000.00; (“Fisher Form 1 Offence 2”)

            King Count 2 – a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 30 June 2006 and expiring on 29 December 2006 
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            Fisher Count 1 – (taking into account Fisher Form 1 Offences 1-10) – a sentence of imprisonment of 1 year and 9 months consisting of a non parole period of 8 months commencing on 28 February 2007 and expiring on 27 October 2007 and a balance of term of 1 year and one month commencing on 28 October 2007 and expiring on 27 November 2008.  
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            Fisher Count 2 – a fixed term of 6 months commencing 28 February 2007 and expiring 27 August 2007.  
            
           
          
         
         
        6. The facts of the Opponent’s conduct in relation to King Counts 1 and 2, and the progress of those charges through the criminal justice system, are accurately set out in the Statement of Facts tendered by the Crown in the sentencing proceedings, a copy of which is annexed and marked  
        “A” 
        .  
         
         
        7. Further to those facts, in the course of the police investigation into the matters the subject of King Counts 1 and 2, on 9 April 2001 and 29 May 2001 the Opponent was interviewed by police. During each of those interviews he falsely asserted on a number of occasions that the advancement to him (and companies associated with him) of monies as a result of the mortgaging of a unit he held in trust for the beneficiaries of the Estate of the late James McEwan King was the result of an error on the part of himself and the Advance Bank. 
         
         
        8. The facts of the Opponent’s conduct in relation to Fisher Counts 1 and 2 and Fisher Form 1 Offences 1-10, and their progress through the criminal justice system, were as follows. 
         
         
        9. On 20 December 1996 Mrs Margaret Fisher, then aged in her mid-sixties, engaged the Opponent as her solicitor in litigation involving a dispute about the maintenance of a home unit which she owned and in which she lived. The Opponent was, at that time, a solicitor with a current practising certificate. 
         
         
        10. From that time until 16 July 1998 the Opponent and Mrs Fisher had regular meetings, telephone conversations and correspondence in relation to her litigation. All but one of the letters sent by the Opponent to Mrs Fisher during that period was on letterhead bearing the title “John C. Holt Solicitor”. 
         
         
        11. On 8 July 1997 the Opponent’s practising certificate was suspended as a result of the allegations the subject of King Counts 1 and 2. He did not inform Mrs Fisher of that event but, until 16 July 1998, continued to hold himself out to her as a solicitor. 
         
         
        12. On twelve occasions between August 1997 and July 1998, after his practising certificate had been suspended, the Opponent requested from Mrs Fisher, and received, payments of money on account of legal fees and disbursements. Mrs Fisher lived close to the Opponent’s office and in each case made payment on the day it was requested. The dates and amounts are set out in paragraphs 3 (iii) – (iv) and 4 (i) – (x) above. 
         
         
        13. On 10 August 1998 Mrs Fisher, having been unable to contact the Opponent, made enquiries with the Law Society of New South Wales and discovered that his practising certificate had been suspended. On or about the next day, Mrs Fisher and the Opponent had a telephone conversation during which there was an exchange to the following effect: 
         
         
          
          […] 
           
            
            Opponent: “Oh, by the way, you can still get me on this number.” 
             
            Fisher: “Why would I. You are not a practising solicitor.” 
            
           
          Opponent: “Who told you that?” 
           
            
            Fisher: “I telephoned the Law Society the day before and they told me you are not listed to practise. […] You were not in a position to take my case to court.” 
             
            Opponent: “Oh, that does not matter, because the barrister presents the case.” 
            
           
          […] 
          
         
         
        14. In April 2003, after unexpected delay on the part of the prosecuting authorities, the Opponent was charged with the offences. While he ultimately admitted his guilt, in the course of his defence, Mrs Fisher (who was then in her seventies) was required to give evidence at a committal hearing and was subjected to cross examination.  
         
         
        15. The Opponent was committed for trial in October 2004 and maintained his pleas of not guilty up until 10 April 2006, the day the matters were listed for trial. On 29 June 2006, the day before he was sentenced, the Opponent repaid the $10,500.00 which he had fraudulently obtained from Mrs Fisher.” 
        
       
      
    7 There is an error in paragraph 3(ii) of the above statement of facts. The second date should be 21 February 1997. 
     
      
    8 The Crimes Act 1900, s 172 provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever, being a trustee of property for the use or benefit, wholly or partially, of some other person or for any public or charitable purpose, converts, or appropriates, the same, or any part thereof, for the use or benefit of himself or herself, or some other person, or for any other than such public or charitable purpose, or, otherwise disposes of, or destroys such property, or any part thereof, in violation in any such case of good faith, and with intent to defraud, shall be liable to imprisonment for ten years. Provided that no prosecution shall be instituted under this section without the leave of the Supreme Court, or of the Attorney-General.” 
        
       
      
    9 Section 179 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever, by any false pretence or by any wilfully false promise, or partly by a false pretence and partly by a wilfully false promise, obtains from any person any property, with intent to defraud, shall be liable to imprisonment for five years.”  
        
       
      
    10 The additional statement of facts to which reference is made in paragraph 6 of the above statement of facts is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The accused was the solicitor for James McEwan King and was appointed sole Executor under Mr King’s will. The will provided that Mr King’s Estate was to be held by the accused under trust. The major portion of the Estate, referred to as the “residuary Estate”, was to be held upon trust as to the net income therefrom for Mr King’s son, Bruce McEwan King, during his life and then after his death as to the income therefrom for his wife, Jean King, during her life or until her remarriage, and upon either of those events for the children of Bruce McEwan King and Jean King. Bruce McEwan King did not survive his father. The residuary Estate was held on trust for Jean King and her three children.  
         
         
        2. The accused applied for probate of the will. That was granted and the assets of the Estate were converted to cash totalling approximately $275,000, of which the residuary Estate amounted to approximately $269,251. 
         
         
        3. In December 1987, the Estate purchased a home unit in Sussex Street, Sydney (“the Vintage”) for approximately $225,000. The Certificate of Title showed that the registered proprietor as “John Colin Holt”. The fact that he was the Trustee was not disclosed, but that was the usual practice. Following the purchase, the property was unencumbered. 
         
         
        4. In 1989, the accused recommended to the beneficiaries that the Estate make a further investment in property. In particular, he recommended that they purchase four parcels of land on Magnetic Island, Queensland. The accused disclosed the fact that he was a director and shareholder of the company which owned the land. The beneficiaries took independent legal advice following which they agreed to purchase the four parcels of land.  
         
         
        5. That purchase took place in August 1989. Each parcel of land was purchased for $39,350. The purchase was financed from Estate funds and a loan of $100,000 secured by a mortgage over “the Vintage”. The mortgagee was also a client of the accused. 
         
         
        6. In late 1992, that mortgage was increased to $120,000, the additional money being required to pay the special levy (approximately $13,000) imposed by the Body Corporate for essential structural repairs to “the Vintage”, as well as other monies said to have been spent in relation to the property. 
         
         
        7. By letter dated 2 February 1993, Mrs King wrote to the accused seeking details of the present “state of affairs” of the Estate. On 16 February 1993, the accused replied to that letter. The accused reiterated the position so far as the purchase of the various properties was concerned. The accused stated that the Estate had not received any income of any consequence during the period of his trusteeship and that it was unlikely that this position would change for some time. He recommended that they should retain their interest in the property purchased by the trust.  
         
         
        8. On 15 March 1993, the solicitor for the beneficiaries wrote to the accused informing him that they were considering winding up the Estate and sought from him a statement about the affairs of the Estate. 
         
         
        9. During the period covered by this correspondence, the accused had been in negotiations with staff of the Advance Bank in relation to overdrawn accounts that he had with that bank. The three accounts were in arrears to the order of $120,000. Those loans were unsecured. During the course of those negotiations, the accused offered “the Vintage” as security for a loan from the Advance Bank to the accused. At no time prior to the commencement of the loan did the accused inform the Bank that he held the Vintage on trust for the beneficiaries of the Estate. The beneficiaries did not give the accused permission to use the property in that way. 
         
         
        10. On 3 July 1993, the mortgage of the property by the accused to the Advance Bank was registered. The mortgage was in the sum of $250,000. In excess of $120,000 was used to repay the debts of the accused referred to above. Approximately $8,000 went into an account operated by the accused. The balance was used to pay out the existing mortgage. From that time on, rent received from the tenants of the Vintage was paid into the loan account associated with the mortgage.  
         
         
        11. In November 1993, the accused wrote to the solicitors for the beneficiaries. In providing a breakdown of the assets and liabilities of the Estate, the accused did not mention the mortgage to the Advance Bank. The accused recommended as “trustee” “that the unit should be retained at all cost”. 
         
         
        12. Count 2 in the Indictment is a rolled-up charge relating to monies paid into the mortgage account. The monies were misappropriated over a period commencing in July 1993 and ending in February 1997. The $29,310 is the value of the loss to the Estate from the time that the mortgage commenced.  
         
         
        13. In about November 1996, the solicitor for the beneficiaries received instructions to seek the winding up of the Estate. At about this time, the accused attempted to obtain a release of “the Vintage” from the mortgage to the Advance Bank. That request was denied. On 18 November 1996, the accused was requested by the solicitor for the beneficiaries to provide all relevant documents for the finalisation of the Estate. The accused stated that he would attend to settlement by the end of December 1996. At this time, the accused was in arrears in relation to his obligations to the Advance Bank pursuant to the mortgage. Proceedings were commenced for the sale of “the Vintage” by the Advance Bank, as mortgagee in possession. On 24 April 1997, the Advance Bank sold the property for $275,000 – all proceeds of the sale went to satisfy the monies owed to the Advance Bank.  
         
         
        14. The matter was referred to the Police. A statement was taken from Mrs King in March 1998. A follow-up statement was taken in February 2000. The accused was interviewed on 29 May 2001 and again on 9 April 2002. During the first interview, the accused admitted that the loss to the Estate was as a result of an “error” that he had made. He admitted that he should have outlined the fact of the trust and that he had put forward the property as his own (Q120-1). He also admitted to paying cheques from the Estate’s account to the Advance Bank loan account (Q138). 
         
         
        15. On 11 October 2004, the accused was committed for trial. The accused was initially arraigned upon an indictment containing 47 counts. On 2 May 2005, a new indictment was prepared containing 35 counts, but adding an additional count under s178BA. That count related to obtaining a benefit from the Advance Bank by deceiving them as to the ownership of “the Vintage”. 
         
         
        16. The matter was listed for a three-week trial commencing on 29 August 2005. On that day, the accused offered to plead guilty to the present indictment. Those please were accepted in full satisfaction of the matters relating to the Estate.  
         
         
        17. As a result of the offences committed by the accused, the Estate sought compensation from the Law Society of NSW. The Estate received $157,097 from the Law Society.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    11 There is an error in paragraph 14 of the above statement. The first interview was on 9 April 2001. The second was on 29 May 2001. 
     
      
    12 Professional misconduct of a solicitor at common law has come to be regarded as conduct that would reasonably be regarded as disgraceful or dishonourable by solicitors of good repute and competency (Myers v Elman [1940] AC 282 at 288-289, New South Wales Bar Association v Cummins [2001] NSWCA 284, (2001) 52 NSWLR 279 at [36]-[41]). 
     
      
    13 There is a controversy as to whether professional misconduct is limited to misconduct in the course of professional work or extends to conduct sufficiently closely connected to actual practice or to conduct outside the course of practice manifesting the presence or absence of qualities incompatible with, or essential for, the conduct of practice (Cummins at [49]-[56]). 
     
      
    14 The controversy does not arise in this case because the opponent’s conduct with respect to Mrs Fisher arose in the course of his purported practice as a solicitor and his trusteeship arose from his conduct of his practice as the solicitor for the late Mr King.  
     
      
    15 But in my view, not only would a competent solicitor regard the opponent’s conduct in breach of trust as disgraceful and dishonourable, it also demonstrated a lack of the qualities of honesty and integrity essential to the conduct of professional practice.  
     
      
    16 As Spigelman CJ said in Cummins: 
     
      
       
        
        “19 Honesty and integrity are important in many spheres of conduct. However, in some spheres significant public interests are involved in the conduct of particular persons and the state regulates and restricts those who are entitled to engage in those activities and acquire the privileges associated with a particular status. The legal profession has long required the highest standards of integrity.  
        
       
       
        
        20 There are four interrelated interests involved. Clients must feel secure in confiding their secrets and entrusting their most personal affairs to lawyers. Fellow practitioners must be able to depend implicitly on the word and the behaviour of their colleagues. The judiciary must have confidence in those who appear before the courts. The public must have confidence in the legal profession by reason of the central role the profession plays in the administration of justice. Many aspects of the administration of justice depend on the trust by the judiciary and/or the public in the performance of professional obligations by professional people.” 
        
       
      
    17 In my view, the claimant is entitled to a declaration that the opponent is guilty of professional misconduct and a declaration that he is not a person of good fame and character. 
     
      
    18 But that does not mean that in the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction the court should automatically strike the opponent’s name from the local roll of lawyers or declare that the opponent is not a fit and proper person to remain on the roll. 
     
      
    19 In Prothonotary of the Supreme Court of New South Wales v P [2003] NSWCA 320 at [17], Young CJ in Eq with whom the other members of the Court agreed summarised a series of propositions drawn from the authorities as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “A series of propositions as to the law clearly have appeared from the cases and I will briefly summarise them.  
         
         
          
          (1) The onus is on the claimant to show that the opponent is not a fit and proper person. It is a civil onus:  
          Re Evatt; Ex parte NSW Bar Association 
           (1967) 67 SR (NSW) 236. However  
          Briginshaw v Briginshaw  
          (1938) 60 CLR 336, 362 shows the particular standard that must be applied when working out the civil onus of proof. 
           
           
          (2) An order striking off the Roll should only be made when the probability is that the solicitor is permanently unfit to practice:  
          Prothonotary v Richard  
          (NSWCA 31.7.1987 per McHugh JA) and see  
          NSW Bar Association v Maddocks  
          (NSWCA 23.8.1988). 
           
           
          (3) The fact that the opponent has a conviction for a serious offence is not necessarily sufficient reason for an order striking that person off the Roll; see  
          Ziems v Prothonotary 
           (1957) 97 CLR 279, 283. 
           
           
          (4) The fact of conviction and imprisonment is, however, far from irrelevant and may be regarded as carrying a degree of disgrace itself. See  
          Ziems 
           case at 288. 
           
           
          (5) The Court needs to consider the conduct involved in the conviction and see whether it is of such personally disgraceful character that the opponent should not remain a member of an honourable profession:  
          Re Weare 
           [1893] 2 QB 439, 446;  
          Barristers’ Board v Darveniza 
           (2000) 112 A Crim R 438 (QCA). 
           
           
          (6) The fact that the opponent pleaded guilty to the charge will usually be counted in her favour:  
          NSW Bar Association v Maddocks.  
          Though we do not assume that all pleas of guilty necessarily show remorse, it is significant that in the instant case Keleman DCJ said that it did. 
           
           
          (7) Conduct not occurring in the course of professional practice may demonstrate unfitness if it amounts to incompatibility with the personal qualities essential for the conduct of practice. There may not even have been any criminal conviction with respect to that conduct. This is particularly so where the conduct over a long period shows systematic non-compliance with legal and civic obligations:  
          NSW Bar Association v Cummins 
           (2001) 52 NSWLR 279, 289;  
          NSW Bar Association v Somosi 
           (2001) 48 ATR 562. 
           
           
          (8) The concept of good fame and character has a twofold aspect. Fame refers to a person’s reputation in the relevant community, character refers to the person’s actual nature:  
          McBride v Walton 
           (NSWCA 15.7.1994 per Kirby P);  
          Clearihan v Registrar of Motor Vehicle Dealers 
           (1994) 117 FLR 455, 459. 
           
           
          (9) The attitude of the professional association is that the application is of considerable significance. 
          
         
         
          
          (10) The question is present fitness, not fitness as at the time of the crime:  
          Prothonotary v Del Castillo 
           [2001] NSWCA 75 at para 71.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    20 In the instant circumstances the opponent has been convicted of serious offences arising from the conduct of a solicitor’s practice. He falsely held himself out as qualified to practise as a solicitor. He purloined property held by him as trustee. That conduct makes him presently and permanently unfit to practise as a solicitor. He is not fit to remain a member of an honourable profession. While the opponent did plead guilty, he did so at a late stage. It cannot be assumed that his plea connotes remorse. Both his dealing with the trust property and his continuing to act for Mrs Fisher demonstrated a systematic flaunting of his duties over an extended period of time.  
     
      
    21 In my view the opponent is not a fit and proper person to remain on the Local Roll of lawyers and his name should be removed from it. 
     
      
    22 In terms of the claimant’s amended summons I suggest that the following declarations and order be made: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Declare that the opponent is guilty of professional misconduct in that:  
         
        
       
      
    (i) on 2 July 1993 the opponent engaged in conduct of a dishonest nature for which, on 30 June 2006 at the Sydney District Court, he was convicted of the offence of: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              being the trustee of property wholly for the benefit of the beneficiaries of the Estate of the late James McEwan King, appropriating that property (a unit at 13/281 Sussex St Sydney) for his own use in violation of good faith and with intent to defraud, contrary to s 172 of the

    3 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Daniel Luke English, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical harm, an offence under s562AB of the Crimes Act which carried a maximum sentence of imprisonment for 5 years. (The section has since been repealed and replaced by s13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007.) He was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 8 months, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and a balance of term of 8 months, commencing on 30 October 2006, the date of the offence and of his arrest. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 In the early afternoon of the day in question, the applicant boarded a city bound train at Liverpool. The victim, a university student from South Africa, boarded the train at Warwick Farm. The applicant entered the carriage in which the victim was travelling, sat next to him, began to read a newspaper and engaged him in conversation. He introduced himself and there was conversation about the victim’s studies. In the course of the conversation, the applicant told the victim that he had just got out of prison that day. 
     
      
    5 The conversation continued until the applicant said, “Can you help me out with some money?” The victim said that he could not. The applicant said, “Listen, I’ve just come out of prison, I can hurt you, it doesn’t mean anything to me.” As he said this, he seized the front part of his own jumper. The victim thought that he might be concealing a weapon of some kind and feared that he would be harmed.  
     
      
    6 The applicant moved closer to the victim, and again asked him to help him out. He continued to hold his jumper in the same fashion. The victim said that he could not help him. The applicant then apologised to him, saying, “I thought you were messing around with me, you’ve got to see where I’m coming from, I’ve just come out. Sorry, OK.” He extended his hand to the victim and they shook hands. The applicant then left the carriage.  
     
      
    7 At about this time the train arrived at Fairfield railway station. The victim went to the guard’s compartment and told the guard what had happened. The guard notified police by phone, and the victim remained in the guard’s compartment because he still feared the applicant. At Granville railway station police entered the train and arrested the applicant. He took part in a recorded interview, in which he denied intimidating the victim. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    8 The applicant was twenty-five years old at the time of the offence, and is now twenty-six. There was a body of subjective material before the sentencing judge, which it is not necessary to recount. It is sufficient to say that he appears to have had a disturbed upbringing, he suffers from several medical conditions, and has a history of addiction to alcohol and illicit drugs.  
     
      
    9 His criminal record is significant. In 1999 he was dealt with in a Children’s Court for stealing. In the following year he was placed on a control order for robbery in company, and later in that year he was sentenced in the District Court to a term of imprisonment for a similar offence. In 2003 he was again before the District Court, when he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for robbery, and in 2004 he was sentenced to further terms of imprisonment for robbery and armed robbery. He was on parole in respect of those last two offences at the time he committed the subject offence.  
     
      
    10 There was some similarity between the present offence and the modus operandi of the three offences for which he was sentenced in 2003 and 2004. Statements of the facts of those offences were before his Honour. In each case the offence was committed on a train. The armed robbery involved the use of a knife, and was committed after the applicant had sat next to the victim and engaged him in apparently innocent conversation. One of the robberies also began with the applicant conversing with the victim, and was perpetrated by his putting the victim in fear by saying that he had been in gaol for eight years for stabbing someone. In the other robbery the applicant sat next to the victim, moved his hand under his shirt and moved towards the victim, so that the victim felt a sharp object pressed against him. He threatened to stab the victim, who believed that he had a knife. All three victims were made to hand over their money and their mobile phones.  
     
      
    11 His Honour appears to have had regard to the facts of those offences only in so far as they tended to call into question the applicant’s account of the present offence to a psychologist, whose report formed part of the subjective material. He told the psychologist that he thought that the victim was “looking down on him” and had reacted to him in a “rude” way, and that he was “overly sensitive” to any suggestion that people might think ill of him. Having made that observation about the evidence, his Honour said that he was “more than aware” that those robbery offences were of a different nature from the offence for which the applicant stood for sentence.  
     
      
    12 His Honour did not consider that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation, and did not find special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between sentence and non-parole period. However, his Honour was satisfied that he was genuinely remorseful. He considered that the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty merited a discount of sentence “in the order of twenty-five per cent”.  
     
      
    13 His Honour saw personal deterrence as an important factor in sentencing the applicant, given his criminal history. At the time of sentence the applicant’s parole had been revoked because of the present offence, and he was serving a balance of term to expire on 31 December 2007. His Honour recognised the fact that the present offence had been committed while on parole as an aggravating factor. Nevertheless, he backdated the sentence to the date of the applicant’s arrest, 30 October 2006. In the result, only ten months of the period he would have to serve before being eligible for parole is exclusively referable to this offence. 
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    14 The only ground of the application is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. For the reasons submitted by Ms Rigg, who appeared for the application, I am satisfied that this ground is made out. The sentence of 2 years and 8 months is a little over half the maximum sentence for the offence. Moreover, it was arrived at after a discount of about twenty-five per cent for the applicant’s plea of guilty, so that his Honour’s notional starting point must have been of the order of 3½ years. Such a sentence is more than could be justified by the objective gravity of the offence which, given the facts as outlined, must be regarded as relatively low. 
     
      
    15 Ms Rigg supplied us with Judicial Commission statistics of sentence for this offence. It can be dealt with summarily, and the figures show that the great majority of cases were. (That is not to suggest that the present offence should have been, given the applicant’s criminal record and the fact that his offence was committed whilst on parole.) The figures go on to show that forty-one of the recorded cases were dealt with in the District Court, of which eleven resulted in full time custodial sentences. They ranged from 6 months to 2½ years, so that the present sentence is higher than any of them. Those statistics lend some support to Ms Rigg’s argument, although they must be approached with the caution which this Court has urged more than once, particularly as the sample of District Court cases is rather small.  
     
      
    16 Ms Rigg suggested that his Honour may have fallen into error by giving undue weight to the applicant’s criminal history, although she acknowledged that no such error is conveyed by his express reasons. She referred to the well known passage from the joint judgment in Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477-8, in which their Honours explained the relevance of an offender’s criminal history and emphasised that it must not be given “such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence”. Their Honours went on to observe that, consistently with that basal principle, an unfavourable criminal record may mean that greater weight has to be given to retribution, deterrence or the protection of society. Those principles were revisited, in the context of s21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, by a five judge bench of this Court in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242, (2006) 66 NSWLR 566. 
     
      
    17 I would not readily find that a judge as experienced as the present sentencing judge had fallen into such an error but, in any event, that finding is not necessary for the applicant to succeed. There is no doubt that considerations arising from his criminal history, particularly personal deterrence, justified a sentence more severe than otherwise would have been warranted. However, I am persuaded that the sentence which his Honour passed exceeds “the outer boundary of a proportionate sentence…set by the objective circumstances of the offence”: McNaughton, per Spigelman CJ at [24]. 
     
      
    18 What, then, of the fact that much of the sentence was concurrent with the balance of term the applicant had to serve following the revocation of his parole? The Crown prosecutor in the District Court submitted that it was appropriate for his Honour to backdate the sentence as he did. Nevertheless, a different Crown prosecutor in this Court argued, quite properly, that that is a matter which we should take into account in determining whether to intervene. His Honour sentenced the applicant on 17 August 2007. As is clear from Callaghan v R [2006] NSWCCA 58, (2006) 160 A Crim R 145, the determination of the commencement date was discretionary, although the effect of s47 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act is that it could not have been later than the date on which sentence was passed. 
     
      
    19 However, Ms Rigg identified several reasons why the backdating of the sentence was appropriate, and I do not consider that the undoubted benefit which the applicant gained from it should stay this Court’s hand. His parole was revoked only because of the present offence. He had been on parole for a significant period of time before re-offending, having been released on 31 December 2005 and having committed this offence at the end of October in the following year. The balance of term to be served, following the revocation of his parole, was a substantial period. Moreover, whereas prisoners whose parole is revoked may seek re-parole, the present sentence meant that he could not do so: cf Callaghan, per Simpson J at [23].  
     
      
    20 The extent to which this Court can intervene is constrained by the fact that the applicant is now due for parole on 29 October 2008, a little over four months hence. Were it not for that fact, a lesser sentence than that which I propose might well have been warranted. In my view, the applicant should be released by the end of this month but it would be in the community’s interest that he be subject to the sanction of parole, even though for a short period only. I would achieve this by reducing the sentence by 6 months and the non-parole period by 4 months, while preserving his Honour’s commencement date. The result would be a sentence of 2 years and 2 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months, dating from 30 October 2006. 
     
      
    21 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence passed in the District Court and, in lieu, I would sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 1 year and 8 months, commencing on 30 October 2006 and expiring on 29 June 2008, and a balance of term of 6 months, commencing on 30 June 2008 and expiring on 29 December 2008. I would direct his release on parole on 29 June 2008.

    The respondent was charged on indictment with larceny as a clerk and destruction of paper with the intent to defraud under ss 156 and 158 respectively of the Crimes Act 1900, in relation to the theft of $80,000 the property of her employer, Brinks Australia. The respondent pleaded not guilty to both charges. Before the commencement of the Crown case, the respondent made a successful application to the trial judge, Hughes DCJ, under s137 of the Evidence Act 1995 for the exclusion of an edited CCTV surveillance video of the despatch area of Brinks Australia from which the monies were taken and the evidence of a Mr Rorke, who had compiled the edited version of the videotapes. Mr Rorke gave evidence that in editing the CCTV footage, he had focussed on the movements of the respondent, acting on the assumption that she was the primary suspect.Hughes DCJ found that a jury, on viewing the edited disk, would be likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserved, or the jury would be diverted from its task. His Honour therefore determined that the prejudice of the tape outweighed any probative value, which could not be cured by giving appropriate directions.The Crown appealed pursuant to s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, submitting that his Honour erred in refusing to admit the evidence and that without the edited video surveillance the Crown’s case was eliminated or substantially weakened. The Respondent raised an additional jurisdictional issue, having regard to the provisions of s 5F(3A).Held per Beazley JA (Johnson and McCallum JJ agreeing ):On the issue of the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal under s5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 19121. The question whether excluded evidence substantially weakens the prosecution case raises a jurisdictional issue: [24]. 
     
      
       
        
        R v Shamouil 
         [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 (referred to) 
        
       
      
    2. It is for Court to assess the Crown’s case to determine whether or not the excluded evidence does substantially weaken that case, a matter upon which the Crown bears the onus: [24].

    3. The jurisdictional question is to be determined on the whole of the material in the Crown case. The jurisdictional challenge arose because the trial judge proceeded to determine the application under s 137 on a summary of the Crown case: [23]-[25].4. There was no objection to the whole of the Crown case being placed before this Court. On the whole of the material in the Crown case, the respondent conceded that the exclusion of the evidence would weaken the Crown case: [26]. 5. Discussion as to how to proceed with the s 5F(3A) appeal in circumstances where there was material before the Court additional to the material before the trial judge: [27]-[31].  
     
      
    On the question of whether the evidence should be excluded under s137 of the Evidence Act 1995 
     
      
    6. For an appeal to succeed under s 5F(3A), the Crown must establish error of the type identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 505: [27], [41].

    7. The question to be asked is whether the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value of the evidence, that is, would the jury give the evidence more weight than it deserves, or would the evidence divert the jurors from their task. This question involves an evaluative exercise, in respect of which judicial minds may differ: [27], [34], [45]. 
     
      
      Festa v R 
       [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 (applied) 
      
    8. The video evidence formed only part of the Crown case. On the whole of the evidence in the Crown case, a jury would not be diverted from its task or place more weight on the video evidence than it deserved. A jury would understand it to be part of a circumstantial case advanced by the Crown. The trial judge’s determination to exclude the evidence was therefore unreasonable: [50], [57].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The respondent has been charged on indictment with two charges as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. On 4 August 2005 at Seven Hills in the State of New South Wales, [the respondent] being then a clerk of Brinks Australia did steal certain property, namely $80,000 the property of Brinks Australia her employer: s 156,  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. 
       
       
      2. On 4 August 2005 at Seven Hills in the State of New South Wales [the respondent] being a clerk to Brinks Australia, with intent to defraud, did destroy a paper belonging to Brinks Australia, her employer: s 158,  
      Crimes Act 
       1900. 
       
      
    2 The respondent has pleaded not guilty to both charges. 
     
      
    3 The respondent's trial came on for hearing before his Honour Hughes DCJ on 29 April 2008 and a jury was empanelled. Before the commencement of the Crown case, the respondent made an application under the provisions of s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 for the exclusion of certain evidence, namely, an edited CCTV surveillance video and the evidence of a Mr Rorke, who compiled the edited versions of the videotapes. That application was successful and the trial judge refused to permit into evidence the edited videotapes and Mr Rorke’s evidence.  
     
      
    4 The Crown appeals to this Court from his Honour’s ruling pursuant to the provisions of s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    5 Following the lodgement of the appeal, the jury was discharged by his Honour. A new trial date has not yet been set. 
     
      
    6 The Crown case is that on 4 August 2005, the respondent removed two E-cash satchels from a security trolley No 730, which was located in the despatch room in the premises of her employer, Brinks Australia (Brinks). The E-cash satchels had been placed in the trolley at about 11 pm the evening before, that is, 3 August 2005. It is the Crown case that, in accordance with Brinks’ usual procedures, trolley No 730 was secured by the employees who placed the E-cash satchels in the trolley. The Crown alleges that the respondent removed the satchels, placed them into a cardboard box and took the cardboard box to an office she shared with another employee, Chris Agius. Mr Agius was not then on duty. The Crown contends that later, in the morning, the respondent took the E-cash satchels out of the building, either in the cardboard box, or in another bag. The satchels contained approximately $80,000. The moneys have not been recovered.  
     
      
    7 The respondent’s normal duties that day involved her having access to trolley No 730. She accessed the trolley between 4.50 am and 5.07 am on 4 August 2005, for the purposes of removing a number of ATM bags from it. It is alleged that in the course of doing this, the respondent unlawfully removed the E-cash satchels. The manifest (known within Brinks as the ‘re-schedule document’) that recorded the contents of the trolley (including the individual seal numbers of each package and the movement of the contents into and out of the trolley) was shredded by the respondent sometime later in the morning. The respondent admitted shredding the re-schedule document. The shredded document was subsequently located and pieced back together.  
     
      
    8 The despatch room where trolley No 730 was located was subject to CCTV surveillance. The cameras recorded to a number of digital and analogue recorders located in the manager’s office. The digital recorders recorded onto a hard drive. The analogue recorders recorded onto VHS tapes that were changed daily. At about 11.08 am on 4 August 2005, the respondent entered the manager’s office and removed the tapes from the machine. The tapes have not been seen since and it is the Crown case that the respondent is responsible for those tapes having gone missing. It was within the normal duties of a member of staff such as the respondent to change over the VHS tapes, but not to remove them from the manager’s office. The respondent explained to the police in her record of interview that she removed the tapes from the VHS recorder some time after the alarm had been raised that the E-cash satchels were missing, so that she and other staff could view the tapes. She said she left the tapes in Mr Agius’ office. That office was not covered by Brinks’ CCTV surveillance system. As a result of the VHS tapes having gone missing, the only CCTV surveillance footage that was available for viewing during the course of the investigation of the theft was the digital recording.  
     
      
    9 The digital recording showed the respondent entering the despatch room with another employee at about 4.49 am. The recording shows the respondent carrying a cardboard box, apparently containing some uniforms. She is seen placing the cardboard box onto the ground outside an office that is adjacent to the despatch room (and which has large glass windows) and then moving a number of trolleys, including trolley No 730 from which the E-cash satchels were taken. The respondent is seen removing the seal from trolley No 730 and unpacking its contents. Approximately half-way through this process, she is seen picking up the cardboard box and carrying it into Mr Agius’ office. She is then seen re-entering the despatch area carrying the box, which she again places outside the office where she had placed it when she first entered the despatch area. Another employee is seen picking up the box and carrying it out into another area, known as the “wicket” area. The respondent and that employee are then observed going to the loading bay.  
     
      
    10 About two hours later, the respondent and a different employee are shown on the digital recording leaving the building and entering the turret area leading to the outside car park. That employee is seen carrying a cardboard box and the respondent is seen carrying a plastic bag. They are also recorded returning to the building not carrying anything. Approximately an hour later, a person, who may be the respondent, is observed going to the car park and returning to the building with something in her hands. At about 11.08 am, the respondent is seen entering the manager’s office. At about 1.15 pm, the respondent is seen walking down the corridor with a folder under her arm and into the carpark area.  
     
      
    11 Notwithstanding the extensive CCTV surveillance, the digital coverage of the despatch room was not complete and the cardboard box that the respondent had been carrying when she first entered the room, was out of the line of the video surveillance when placed on the ground. The respondent is recorded on the CCTV footage as moving away from the trolley. The Crown contends that the cardboard box was in the area towards which the respondent is seen moving after she had accessed the trolley. The inference for which the Crown will contend at trial is that the respondent had taken the E-cash satchels from the trolley at this time and placed them into the cardboard box.  
     
      
    12 The original complete digital recording was made available to Mr Rorke, Brinks’ National Security Manager. There was about 74 hours of footage in all. Mr Rorke viewed most of that footage and prepared an edited version of it on two discs, comprising a compilation of about one hour. The original digital recording was subsequently lost when Brinks moved premises and has not been found. Accordingly, the only CCTV surveillance material is that contained in the edited videos. 
     
      
    13 Mr Rorke gave evidence that in editing the CCTV footage, he had focussed on the movements of the respondent, acting on the assumption that Brinks believed she had removed the E-cash satchels without authority. 
     
      
       
      Respondent’s submissions to trial judge 
       
      
    14 Counsel for the respondent conceded before the trial judge that the one hour edited video has probative value. However, it was submitted that most of what was contained on the edited discs was also the subject of evidence given by other witnesses, so that the probative value of the surveillance material in the edited discs had to be assessed with that in mind. When regard was had to that material, it was apparent that the evidence was not essential to the Crown case and whilst of probative value, that probative value was low. 
     
      
    15 The respondent then submitted that it would be prejudicial to the respondent to admit the evidence, because the edited discs provided an incomplete picture of the events of the day and had been edited in such a way that the focus was on the respondent’s activities only. 
     
      
    16 It was submitted that the jury was likely, therefore, to speculate as to what was on the footage that was lost and, in particular, was likely to speculate that the lost material contained damaging footage of the respondent’s movements. This submission, as I understand it, was a particular of the more general submission that the jury was likely to overvalue the probative weight of the footage contained on the edited discs.  
     
      
    17 The trial judge referred to Festa v R [2001] HCA 72; 208 CLR 593 as the proper test to apply in determining whether to exclude evidence and noted: 
     
      
       
      1. That the respondent was the main focus on the edited discs; 
       
       
      2. The footage was edited in circumstances where the respondent’s guilt had been assumed. His Honour later modified this to an assumption of the possible guilt of the respondent; 
       
       
      3. The respondent had not had an opportunity to ascertain if the compilation was fair, it being accepted the original video tapes have been lost; and 
       
       
      4. A jury, on viewing the edited disc, would be likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserved, or the jury may be diverted from its task. 
       
      
    18 His Honour thus found that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… this is a clear case where the prejudice, that is to say, the compilation by an outside person of a person he suspects of committing the offence a person acting as, if I might say so, as a judge and jury as to the guilt or innocence of the accused in my opinion that prejudice is so strong that it outweighs any probative value that is gained by the Crown.” 
        
       
      
    19 His Honour accepted that the edited disc was strong evidence in the Crown case. However, because it focussed on the activities of the respondent, the evidence was distorted. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “They are in fact an electronic eye witness of the events. If in some way or another the electronic eye witness is distorted to an extent that only gives an account of the accused’s behaviour or one person’s behaviour, then it would be like calling a prejudiced eye witness to give an account of evidence.”  
        
       
      
    20 His Honour found that distortion could not be cured by giving appropriate directions and, therefore, excluded both the edited disc and the evidence of Mr Rorke. 
     
      
       
      Issues on the appeal 
       
      
    21 Two issues arose on the appeal. The first issue is the issue raised by the Crown on the appeal itself, namely, whether his Honour erred in refusing to admit the evidence. It was argued that without the evidence of the surveillance as contained on the two edited discs, the Crown’s case was ‘eliminated’ or at least ‘substantially weakened’.  
     
      
    22 The second issue is a jurisdictional issue raised by the respondent, namely, that having regard to the provisions of s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, this Court has no jurisdiction to deal with the appeal. It is convenient to deal with the jurisdictional issue first. 
     
      
       
      Jurisdictional issue 
       
      
    23 The Crown has appealed against a ruling on evidence pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case.” 
        
       
      
    24 In R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112; (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 Spigelman CJ stated, at [27], that a contention that the excluded evidence did not substantially weaken the prosecution’s case constituted a challenge to the jurisdiction of the Court. Spigelman CJ held that it is for the Court to assess the Crown’s case to determine whether or not the excluded evidence does substantially weaken that case, a matter upon which the Crown bears the onus: Shamouil per Spigelman CJ at [28]-[30].  
     
      
    25 The respondent’s point on this matter may be stated simply. She contends that in order for the Court to determine whether the excluded evidence substantially weakens the prosecution’s case, the Court must examine the evidence upon which the prosecution intends to base its case. However, in this case, the determination of the trial judge had been made on a limited selection of material that comprised: a three page summary of the Crown allegations; a summary of the CCTV footage; two compact discs, being the edited footage prepared by Mr Rorke; and a document entitled “Re-scheduled and scheduled items”. In addition, Mr Rorke gave oral evidence before the trial judge. As this was the only material before this Court, the Court could not undertake an assessment of the evidence in the Crown case in order to determine the jurisdictional question.  
     
      
    26 The respondent accepted, however, that if the Crown brief was tendered to this Court, a course which she did not oppose, the jurisdictional question would be overcome, as she accepted that the exclusion of the edited tapes and the evidence of Mr Rorke did substantially weaken the prosecution case. Subsequently, pursuant to a direction by this Court, the prosecution brief was placed before this Court. For that reason, the jurisdictional issue should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      How should this Court proceed? 
       
      
    27 The dismissal of the jurisdictional issue raises another matter for consideration, namely, how this Court should approach the appeal. Although a determination under s 137 does not involve the exercise of a discretion strictly so-called, it requires an evaluation of evidence that calls into play similar juridical processes. Accordingly, for an appeal to succeed under s 5F(3A), the Crown needs to establish error of the type identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505: see R v Blick [2000] NSWCCA 61; (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at [19]; Vickers v R [2006] NSWCCA 60; (2006) 160 A Crim R 195 at 210. An appeal of that nature is determined on the basis of the material before the trial judge. The difficulty in this case is that this Court now has before it material that was not before Hughes DCJ.  
     
      
    28 The respondent submitted that in the circumstances it would be necessary for this Court to determine the matter afresh, presumably without reference to the trial judge’s determination, having regard to the whole of the material available to the Court. There is a difficulty with this submission. In the first place, for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must establish error by the trial judge. Further, this Court is a court of appeal, not a court of first instance, which is the role now urged upon it by the respondent. That requires a consideration of his Honour’s reasons, which were based on the material before him.  
     
      
    29 The resolution of this conundrum is, in my opinion, to be found in its origin. The respondent was the applicant before the trial judge. Her legal representatives agreed to the material to be placed before the trial judge for the purpose of her application. They must have been satisfied that that material was adequate for the purposes of the application she was making and that it fairly represented the material contained in the Crown case.  
     
      
    30 The only omission that seemed to have any real significance in the way the respondent put the matter to this Court was by the Electronic Recording of Interview with the Suspect, dated 30 August 2005 (the ERISP). Although there is no explanation as to why the ERISP was not placed before the trial judge, there is reference, in the ‘Summary of Crown Allegations’ to some of the explanations she gave of her activities during her shift on 4 August 2005, upon which the Crown places particular reliance, including her admission that she shredded the re-schedule document, although it does not include her explanation as to why she did so. There is also reference in the ‘Summary of Crown Allegations’ of the explanation the respondent gave in the ERISP as to why she took the VHS tapes from the office. 
     
      
    31 However, whatever the respondent’s reasons for not placing the ERISP before the trial judge, it was her application and it was her responsibility to adduce material so as to provide a proper basis for the determination of the application. As I have said, she must have been satisfied that the synopsis of the Crown case as contained in the ‘Summary of Crown Allegations’ was a fair representation of the Crown case and I consider that this Court should infer that to be the case. As a first stage in the determination of the appeal, therefore, I am of the opinion that the Court should consider whether the Crown has established, on the material before the trial judge, that his Honour erred in his determination of the application. 
     
      
       
      Should the evidence have been excluded? 
       
      
    32 Section 137 of the Evidence Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 
         
         
        In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    33 The ‘House v The King error’ relied upon by the Crown was that his Honour confused the question of admissibility with the question of the strength or otherwise of the evidence to be put before the jury. The Crown submitted that the matters raised by the respondent in her submissions to the trial judge were essentially jury points. It was submitted that the ruling had to be viewed against the role of the Crown at the trial, namely, that it was for the Crown to adduce evidence that established beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent was guilty of the offences with which she was charged. 
     
      
    34 As indicated, the trial judge referred to Festa. In that case, McHugh J commented upon the circumstances in which evidence could be excluded under s 137. The appellant in Festa had contended that the trial judge erred in not excluding identification evidence, which she claimed was of low probative value, but which was of a highly prejudicial character. McHugh J observed, at [51], that the weakness of relevant evidence was not a ground for exclusion. McHugh J then commented upon the balance of probative value as compared to the prejudicial effect of the material. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is only when the probative value of evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect that the Crown can be deprived of the use of relevant but weak evidence. And evidence is not prejudicial merely because it strengthens the prosecution case. It is prejudicial only when the jury are likely to give the evidence more weight than it deserves or when the nature or content of the evidence may inflame the jury or divert the jurors from their task.” 
        
       
      
    35 Having appropriately referred to this test, Hughes DCJ described the CCTV surveillance footage as “an electronic eye witness of the events” and said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “If in some way or another the electronic eye witness is distorted to an extent that only gives an account of the accused’s behaviour or one person’s behaviour, then it would be like calling a prejudiced eye witness to give an account of evidence.”  
        
       
       
      His Honour considered, therefore, that:  
       
       
        
        “… this is a clear case where the prejudice, that is to say, the compilation by an outside person of a person he suspects of committing the offence a person acting as, if I might say so, as a judge and jury as to the guilt or innocence of the accused in my opinion that prejudice is so strong that it outweighs any probative value that is gained by the Crown.”  
        
       
      
    36 In reaching this conclusion, Hughes DCJ accepted that the tapes were “strong evidence” in the Crown case, by which I assume his Honour meant, were of high probative value. 
     
      
    37 The Crown contends that his Honour’s conclusion that the jury would give more weight to the edited video evidence than it deserved because it focussed upon the activities of the accused, so that its effect was distorted, was erroneous. The Crown submits that the criticism by his Honour that the editing of the tapes was done in such a way as to only focus on the respondent, was not a cogent one. The prosecution of the respondent was based on a strong circumstantial case against her, including that the footage recorded her opening the sealed trolley, retrieving a document from it, reading the contents of the document which, it was known, included reference to the E-cash satchels; having a cardboard box in the near vicinity but out of CCTV surveillance; of moving things away from the trolley; and of asking another employee to take the carton to a room in which there was no surveillance.  
     
      
    38 The Crown submits that this was enough to direct suspicion towards the respondent as being the person responsible for, or involved in, the theft. The Crown also pointed out that there were other factors that directed suspicion towards the respondent, including the fact that she had removed the VHS tapes, which are now missing, into Mr Agius’ office, which she shared. It was submitted that, in the circumstances, it was reasonable for the tapes to be edited, so as to focus upon the activities of the respondent. The Crown also indicated that a jury would not be asked to watch some 74 hours of video material, much of which contained no activity around or near trolley No 730. 
     
      
    39 The Crown also relies upon Mr Rorke’s evidence (which was also excluded by the trial judge) that he had edited the tapes so as to compile footage of the frames he considered to be relevant, although he readily acknowledged that he was working on the theory that the E-cash satchels had been taken out of the despatch room at about 5.08 am and that he also understood that the respondent was the prime suspect. He said, however, that he tried to look at events surrounding the times that had been indicated to him as being relevant.  
     
      
    40 The essential prejudice upon which the respondent relied at trial and which she reiterated on appeal, is, as his Honour found, that the tapes were edited upon the premise that she had stolen the two E-cash satchels. She submitted that the effect of this selective editing meant that the jury would be deprived of the opportunity of making a proper assessment of whether any other employee had the opportunity of stealing the E-cash satchels, either before the respondent arrived for work, or after she left the despatch room at 5.07 am. The respondent also submitted that she can never investigate what happened in the despatch room between about 11.40 pm, when the E-cash satchels were placed in trolley No 730 and 0.39 am, when the trolley was again opened, and then between 0.39 am and when she arrived at about 4.49 am. In particular, without being able to view the entirety of the video footage, she cannot determine whether somebody else accessed the trolley during either of these two periods.  
     
      
    41 The respondent further submitted that there was no error in his Honour’s determination to exclude the evidence. His Honour had acted upon correct principle; had taken into account all relevant considerations and had not taken into account irrelevant considerations. Accordingly, it was submitted, no basis had been established for appellate intervention. Although this submission correctly states the principle in House v The King, it does not cover its full application. In House v The King, having identified the matters that constitute error, Dixon, Evatt and McTiernan JJ stated, at 505: 
     
      
       
        
        “It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is  
        unreasonable 
         or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    42 It will be recalled that the ‘House v The King error’ upon which the Crown relied is that his Honour confused the question of admissibility with the question of the strength or otherwise of the evidence which was to be put before the jury. As I understand that submission, it is properly best expressed as stating that his Honour asked himself the wrong question, or alternatively, in approaching his determination of the question under s 137, he applied a wrong test, notwithstanding that he had identified the correct principle to apply.  
     
      
    43 Having viewed the video and considered the other material that was placed before his Honour for the purposes of the application on s 137, and having read his Honour’s reasons, I am not satisfied that he made an error of the type identified by the Crown. As the respondent submitted, his Honour correctly stated the test that he was required to apply in determining whether to exclude the evidence and considered all the material facts that were before him. He took into account the matters that were relevant and did not take into account any extraneous factors. In those circumstances, the Crown will only be able to succeed on the appeal if his Honour’s determination was unreasonable in the House v The King sense. In order to determine to whether his Honour’s determination was unreasonable, it is necessary to refer again to the material before his Honour and the manner in which he dealt with that material.  
     
      
    44 The trial judge stated that the video only gave an account of “the [respondent’s] behaviour or one person’s behaviour”. That is not an accurate description of the edited videos themselves. The focus in each section of footage is not on the respondent as such. The focus is first upon the loading of trolley No 730 in the despatch room and it being accessed again at 0.39 am. The focus is thereafter on the despatch room, the corridors and loading bay between 4.49 am and 5.07 am and, later, the Manager’s office, other areas leading out to the car park and the car park itself. In this part of the evidence, the respondent is seen in each of the video clips, as are others within the areas subject to video surveillance. Indeed, in the critical time upon which the Crown relies, namely 4.49 am-5.07 am, the video footage shows a deal of activity by a number of people in and near the despatch room. 
     
      
    45 The prejudice, and the problem that his Honour identified, was that there is no video material between 11.10 pm, when the E-cash satchels were put in the trolley, and 0.39 am, when the trolley was again accessed, and then between 0.39 am and 4.49 am, when the respondent entered the despatch room and from 5.07 am, when the respondent left the despatch room, and 6.55 am, when the respondent reported the E-cash satchels as missing. To that extent, the available video material focuses first on the E-cash satchels being placed in the trolleys, and then on the footage that records the respondent’s activities, including the time and manner in which she accessed the trolley.  
     
      
    46 The question to be asked, therefore, is whether his Honour erred in finding that the prejudicial effect of the videos outweighed the probative value. Would, as the trial judge asked himself, “the jury [be] likely [to] give [the edited video] more weight than it deserves”, or would the edited video “divert the jurors from their task”?: see Festa at [51] per McHugh J. That question involves an evaluative exercise, in respect of which judicial minds may differ. In this case, it is only if the question does not reasonably permit an affirmative answer that this Court can interfere: House v The King at 505.  
     
      
    47 In this case, although Mr Rorke edited the videos on the basis that the respondent had taken the E-cash satchels, the matter could not be placed before the jury in that manner. Rather, the videos would have to be placed before the jury on the basis that the respondent was the prime suspect, having regard to the other evidence that pointed in that direction. The jury would have to be told, as would be apparent anyway, that the video evidence was not a complete record. They would also have to be told of the need to be satisfied, on the whole of the evidence, both that the satchels containing the moneys had been placed in the trolley and that no person other than the respondent had the opportunity of accessing the trolley, in order to be satisfied of her guilt.  
     
      
    48 The edited videos provide evidence that the respondent accessed a trolley in the despatch room, as well as providing evidence as to her carrying a cardboard box and entering the manager’s office, as has been more fully explained above. The videos also show other people in the despatch room at the same time.  
     
      
    49 However, that is only part of the evidence in respect of the Crown case and, in particular, is only part of the evidence relied upon to prove that the respondent stole the E-cash satchels from the second compartment of trolley No 730. The video evidence does not, for example, provide evidence that the missing E-cash satchels were placed in the second compartment, although it does provide evidence that packets were placed in the second compartment. The Crown will need to establish that E-cash satchels with particular serial numbers were placed in the second compartment of trolley No 730 and that E-cash satchels with those same serial numbers went missing. In addition, the necessity to edit such evidence existed whether or not the unedited videos went missing.  
     
      
    50 To the extent that evidence has been truly lost, it is the lack of video evidence between the time trolley No 730 was loaded at 11.10 pm and then accessed at 0.39 am, and then between 0.39 am and 4.50 am, when the respondent commenced her shift. Even if video footage of those periods was available, a jury would have to be satisfied that such footage provided complete coverage of those periods. It may not have done, having regard, both to the lost VHS tapes and the often unsatisfactory nature of CCTV surveillance. There are other aspects of the Crown case that are not dependent on the video evidence, including the shredding of the re-schedule documents, and aspects that are only partly dependent on the video evidence, such as the Crown case that the respondent used the cardboard box to secrete the E-cash satchels out of the despatch room and possibly, subsequently, out of the building.  
     
      
    51 The point of examining these aspects of the Crown case is not to analyse each element of the Crown case to ascertain how it might be proved. Rather, I am seeking to analyse by way of limited examples what the Crown would need to prove and how that might be proved, to ascertain whether the jury would give the edited videos more weight than they deserve, or whether their contents, having regard to the editing, would divert the jury from their task. In my opinion, when the content of the edited videos is placed in context and when it is understood that it forms part only of what the Crown needs to prove, I am of the view that it could not reasonably be concluded that the jury would give the edited videos more weight than they deserve, or divert it from its task. Rather, they would understand that the video evidence was part of a circumstantial case advanced by the Crown. Admittedly, it is likely that a jury would pay close attention to the videos. However, that is different from saying that the videos, edited as they are, would divert attention from the jury’s task, which is to determine, on the whole of the evidence, whether the Crown has established the guilt of the respondent. For that reason, I consider that that the trial judge’s determination to the contrary was unreasonable in the House v The King sense. 
     
      
    52 This conclusion, that the prejudicial value of the evidence does not outweigh the probative value of the evidence, is reinforced when the entirety of the Crown brief, and in particular the respondent’s ERISP, is considered. The respondent gave the police an explanation for a number of the matters that are raised as pointing to her having committed the offence. First, she explained why she was carrying the cardboard box, which she said contained uniforms. She said that there were two lots of uniforms, one in the cardboard box and the other in the plastic bag she was seen to carry to the car (A 286 of the ERISP). The respondent said that one lot of uniforms needed mending and another lot were to be returned to a supplier in the city, because the wrong sizes had been forwarded.  
     
      
    53 The respondent also admitted to shredding the re-schedule document, but said that she did so in accordance with usual practice (A 305 of the ERISP). The respondent also admitted that she removed the video tapes from the VHS machine at about 11 am that morning. She said, however, that she discussed doing so with two of her co-workers and that they had a plan to view the video tapes, but decided against doing so in case they made some mistake which might have, for example, caused the videos to be taped over.  
     
      
    54 The respondent stated that she was unloading a lot of trolleys that morning and that her co-worker was wheeling them over from the vault. She said:  
     
      
       
        
        “I was just starting to put them into the runs, like I do every morning. Just frantically … you just start to distribute the stuff ...” (A 88 of the ERISP) 
        
       
       
      The respondent also explained that she was not particularly conscious of what trolleys she was unloading. She said: 
       
       
        
        “I don’t recall which trolley I opened at which time, I just remember just doing what I do every morning, I didn’t really pay attention to that. It was only when I distributed everything I realised things were missing. That’s when I … stopped.” (A 89 of the ERISP) 
        
       
       
      These explanations of how the work was carried out, which will presumably be part of the Crown case, will need to be assessed in conjunction with the edited video evidence. They provide an explanation of the respondent’s activities as recorded on the edited tapes.  
       
      
    55 The Crown also intends to call a number of witnesses to give evidence relating to the period between 11 pm on 3 August and 4.50 am on 4 August. For example, Paul Wharton, in his police statement, says that he accessed trolley No 730 during the evening and that he remained in the supervisor’s office inside the despatch area for the remainder of his shift. Mr Wharton stated that he saw the respondent enter the despatch area, move the trolley away from its location underneath the cameras and break the seal to it. Whilst he does not specifically state that no-one else was in the vicinity of the trolley in the meantime, he is available to give evidence of the comings and goings of persons in the despatch room during the period from 11 pm until 5.08 am. Likewise, Mr Agius, the operations manager, was on duty and assisted Mr Wharton in the tasks which included loading trolley No 730. John Pedley was the night supervisor and commenced his shift at 9 pm on 3 August. His statement is to the effect that trolley No 730 was in the same position from the time he left it in the despatch area to when he handed over to the respondent the following morning. He also confirms that he asked the respondent to change the security tapes at the commencement of her shift, as he had not attended to that task. 
     
      
    56 There are other persons available to give evidence as to the comings and goings within the despatch room in the hours prior to the respondent commencing her shift. There are witnesses available to give evidence as to their presence and activities in the despatch room from 4.50 am, as well as relating to the cardboard box and the VHS videos. The edited discs are available to show movements of the respondent during these times.  
     
      
    57 This material, extracted from the prosecution brief, confirms what I have already said, namely, that the Crown case is dependent upon a body of evidence of which the CCTV video surveillance only forms part. When the Crown case is considered as a whole, I am of the opinion that it could not have been reasonably concluded that the prejudicial value of the edited tapes outweighs their probative value, which was accepted to be strong. It follows that the appeal should be allowed and the determination of the trial judge to exclude the evidence should be set aside.  
     
      
    58 I propose, therefore, the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Set aside the decision of the trial judge excluding the evidence of the edited video tapes and the evidence of Mr Rorke.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at East Maitland on 24 July 2007, following his pleas of guilty to five charges of offences of a sexual nature. Two of the offences were of aggravated sexual assault, contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, which provides a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”), a standard non-parole period of 10 years is prescribed. The remaining three counts were of aggravated indecent assault, contrary to s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act, each of which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 7 years, and in respect of which a standard non-parole period of 5 years is prescribed. 
     
      
    3 In respect of the first count of aggravated sexual assault English DCJ imposed a total term of imprisonment for 10 years, made up of a non-parole period of 6 years, commencing on 22 March 2008. On each of the remaining counts her Honour imposed fixed terms of imprisonment of, respectively, 4 years, 6 months, 2 years and 4 years; the first was also specified to commence on 22 March 2008, and therefore run concurrently with that earlier imposed; the remaining sentences were specified to commence on 22 March 2007. 
     
      
    4 The overall effective sentence was therefore a sentence of imprisonment for 11 years with a non-parole period of 7 years. 
     
      
    5 In so sentencing the applicant English DCJ found, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that special circumstances justifying departure from the proportions between the head sentence and the non-parole period existed. She gave effect to this finding by imposing an overall non-parole period that is sixty-four percent of the overall term. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    6 The victims of all offences were the thirteen year old twin daughters of a woman with whom the applicant had been in a relationship between 2000 and 2004. After the relationship ended the applicant maintained contact with the twins and their younger brother. On occasions when their mother was working the applicant cared for the children at his home. They frequently stayed overnight, in their own accommodation. 
     
      
    7 The three offences of aggravated indecent assault were committed against one of the twins, to whom it is convenient to refer only as “D”. All offences were committed on one evening in April 2006 when D and her brother were staying at the applicant’s home. The other twin (“J”) was not present. D and the applicant watched movies on a DVD player in her bedroom. D then went to sleep. The applicant entered her bedroom and woke her, asked her to come to his bedroom and give him a massage as he had a headache. D complied. She then lay down on the bed and the applicant began to massage her. She removed her clothes, although retaining her underwear. The applicant undid her bra. She asked him to stop. He did not. He removed her pants. She asked him to stop. He did not. He began to kiss her face, and rubbed his penis on her vagina. She told him not to because it hurt. He touched her vagina with his fingers, fondling it and continued to kiss her. She again asked him to stop, smacking his hand away from her vagina. He ceased the activity. D rose, retrieved her clothes, and went back to her bedroom.  
     
      
    8 The three offences of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent occurred on 29 April 2006. The victim of these offences was D’s twin, J. The applicant agreed to have the children stay at his house to enable their mother and her partner to go out. The applicant asked J to come to his bedroom, and walk on his back as it was sore. She agreed to do this. The applicant then offered her a massage and told her to remove her clothing. She removed her outer clothing but retained her underclothes. The applicant began to massage her back and legs and then closed the bedroom door. From a cupboard in the room he obtained a purple vibrator. He removed his shorts and climbed back on the bed. He began to touch J’s vagina. She told him to stop, but he did not. He turned on the vibrator and rubbed it on J’s clitoris. He inserted it into her vagina and moved it in and out for a couple of minutes. His penis became erect. He masturbated for a short time until his penis was completely erect; he removed the vibrator from J’s vagina and told her to sit on top of him. She complied. He inserted his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her for about five minutes until he ejaculated. He told her to have a shower, and took all three children out for dinner. 
     
      
    9 It will be observed that in respect of each victim the offences charged occurred on a single occasion, as part of a continuous course of conduct. The facts were put before English DCJ by way of an agreed statement of facts. In respect of each victim that statement contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “These offences are representative counts. The offences occurred regularly [in the case of J] sporadically [in the case of D] between 2004 and 2006.” 
        
       
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    10 The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Evidence was given on his behalf by his wife, to whom he was married in August 2006, and by his mother.  
     
      
    11 There was also before his Honour a pre-sentence report, and a very comprehensive psychological report. From that material the following emerged. The applicant was born in 1968 and was between 36 and 38 at the time of the offences. He was the owner and manager of a computer business which he operated from his home. He had handed over the management of the business to employees on his being charged and, at the time of sentencing, was supported by his wife’s income and some Centrelink benefits supplemented by occasional work at his wife’s family business and designing internet websites. 
     
      
    12 He had had a very difficult childhood. His biological father left his mother when he was very young and the applicant never knew him. His mother had married a Vietnam veteran who showed extreme symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, manifested in anger and violence, predominantly verbal. His mother felt she needed to protect the applicant from his step-father. She gave some instances of emotional cruelty perpetrated upon the applicant by this man. The applicant told the psychologist that he had, as a child and teenager experienced three instances of sexual abuse by different older men. The psychologist found him to experience a considerable degree of “interpersonal dysfunction across a range of domains.” She found him to be “negative and pessimistic” and dependant. She considered that he posed a “low-moderate” risk of re-offending and recommended participation in therapy designed to address the sexual, emotional and intimacy issues that contributed to his behaviour. 
     
      
    13 The applicant has two sons of whom he has full time care. The elder of these boys suffers from Aspergers Syndrome, which makes him difficult to manage. During his incarceration his wife has the sole care of the boys. 
     
      
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    14 English DCJ recounted the agreed facts of the offences. In relation to the offence of penile/vaginal intercourse with J, English DCJ classified it as “at the mid range of objective seriousness”. She found that this was “not a one off isolated offence”. What her Honour said in full was: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was not a one-off isolated offence and whilst the offender cannot be sentenced in respect of unidentified other instances, this being a representative count, the fact that it was part of an ongoing systemic sexual abuse of a child between the ages of 11 and 13 does increase the objective criminality of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    15 She took into account that the applicant was at the time “the carer” of the victim; and that there was some degree of planning in that the applicant enticed J into his bedroom on a pretext. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[J] was only aged 13 at the time. True it is that age is an element of the offence, but the fact that she is at the youngest end of the scale is a matter which does add to the seriousness of the offence committed. The younger the more vulnerable, the less likely the victim is able to speak out. I find she was vulnerable in the extreme.” 
        
       
       
      And, earlier:  
       
       
        
        “Once again it was not an isolated incident but rather part of a system of sexual abuse of a young girl.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
      
    16 The grounds of the application are pleaded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The learned sentencing judge erred in taking into account uncharged criminal conduct as an aggravating feature in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences in relation to the victim [J] and [D]. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The learned sentencing judge erred in sentencing the applicant for an offence involving the ‘ongoing systematic sexual abuse of a child’ and thereby breached the prohibition in  
        The Queen v De Simoni  
        [1981] HCA 31; 147 CLR 383. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The learned sentencing judge erred in her assessment that the age of the victim [J] was at the ‘youngest end of the scale’, which added to the objective seriousness of the offence.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) The overall sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    17 I shall deal with the grounds in the order in which they are pleaded. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 & 2: “Uncharged criminal conduct as an aggravating feature”;  
      the  
      De Simoni 
       principle. 
       
      
    18 These grounds raise, essentially, the same issue. I have quoted the relevant passages from the agreed statement of facts, and that from the Remarks on Sentence. 
     
      
    19 The extent to which uncharged incidents may be taken into account on sentencing has been considered at length, and determined, by the judgment of Spigelman CJ in R v JCW [2000] NSWCCA 209. His Honour, with the concurrence of the other two members of the Court (of whom I was one) concluded that, even where such conduct is admitted, it is appropriate to be taken into account only for purposes of rejecting any claim to mitigation and attendant reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence; and not as a circumstance of aggravation: see [68]. 
     
      
    20 The real question which determines this ground of appeal concerns whether the remarks made by her Honour ought to be construed as indicating that she treated the admitted “ongoing systematic sexual abuse” of the victim as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    21 The words “ … does increase the objective criminality of the offence”, taken alone, could suggest that her Honour was treating the pattern of offending as an aggravating factor. However, balanced against that, is her Honour’s reminder to herself, immediately preceding those words, that the applicant could not be sentenced in respect of unidentified other instances. 
     
      
    22 On the other hand, the observation appears in a relatively lengthy part of the Remarks on Sentence which commences with a reference to an assessment of the seriousness of the offences, and moves on to deal with specific matters expressly identified as aggravating circumstances in s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act – such matters as that the applicant was in a position of trust, that there was some degree of planning, and the age of the victim. 
     
      
    23 Further, as the Crown pointed out in this application, her Honour had the benefit of carefully prepared written submissions in which her attention was drawn to the correctly stated principles by counsel for the applicant and the solicitor appearing for the Crown. The Crown accepted, on the application, that her Honour could have “used more precise language” but argued that, nevertheless, it ought not to be concluded that the admission that the counts on the indictment were “representative” and that other offences had been committed, was treated as an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    24 In my opinion the submissions of the Crown ought to be accepted. The Remarks on Sentence ought not to be subjected to minute scrutiny in search of any indication of error. It is of some significance that, not withstanding that observation, her Honour found the offence at the mid range of objective seriousness. That was an eminently proper finding to make in relation only to the offence with which she was dealing. It is hardly to be thought that a similar finding would have been made had her Honour been treating the course of conduct as a feature aggravating that offence – that would inevitably have given rise to a finding of greater than mid range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion this ground ought to be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: “The age of J” 
       
      
    26 At the time of the offences s 61J(2)(d) of the Crimes Act created an offence of which the aggravating feature was that the victim was under the age of 16 years. S 66A created a separate offence, punishable more severely, of such an offence against a victim under the age of 10 years (in which case consent was not an issue).  
     
      
    27 I have earlier set out that passage in the remarks in which her Honour held that J was, at the time of the offences against her, “at the youngest end of the scale”. If it is taken that, by reason of the provisions of 66A, s 61J(2)(d) created an offence that was in practical terms, referable to victims between the ages of 10 and 16, this was, strictly speaking, inaccurate. The victim was, at 13, in fact closer to the upper end of the range. However, I regard the inaccuracy as of little moment. The fact is these offences were committed against a 13 year old who, the sentencing judge held, was “vulnerable in the extreme”. I would reject this ground of the application. The same applied to the other victim. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: “Manifestly excessive” 
       
      
    28 No separate submissions were directed to this ground of appeal, which, essentially, drew upon the matters argued in relation to the earlier grounds. I would not hold that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion, it has not been demonstrated, as is required by s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (if the application is to succeed) that any other sentence (in total) was warranted in law and ought to have been passed. 
     
      
    30 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
        
       
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 13 June 2007, a jury was empanelled following pleas of not guilty by the Offender, Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, to each of three counts in an indictment, namely: 
     
      
       
      (a) one count of defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to s.29D  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      ; 
       
       
      (b) one count of agreeing to receive a benefit on an understanding that the exercise by him of his duty as a Commonwealth officer would be affected contrary to s.73  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      ; and 
       
       
      (c) one count of publishing to a person to whom he was not authorised to publish, documents which came into his possession by virtue of him being a Commonwealth officer, and which it was his duty not to disclose, an offence under s.70  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
      . 
       
      
    2 On 18 December 2007, the jury found the Offender guilty of the second and third counts, being the offences under ss.73 and 70 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The jury could not agree upon a verdict with respect to the first count under s.29D Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and were discharged on that count without verdict. On 27 March 2008, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions determined not to proceed further with the s.29D count against the Offender.  
     
      
    3 A sentencing hearing took place before me on 16, 23, 28, 29 and 30 May 2008. At the conclusion of the sentencing hearing, I reserved my decision on sentence until today. The Offender has been on conditional bail since 18 December 2007. 
     
      
       
      Fact Finding on Sentence 
       
      
    4 It falls to me as the trial Judge to determine punishment and, for that purpose, to make findings of fact relevant to sentencing. The primary constraint is that the view of the facts adopted by me for purposes of sentencing must be consistent with the verdicts of the jury. Any findings of fact against the Offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: Cheung v The Queen [2001] 209 CLR 1 at 12-13 [14].  
     
      
    5 The Court may not take facts into account on sentence, in a way that is adverse to the interests of the Offender, unless those facts have been established beyond reasonable doubt. On the other hand, if there are matters which the Offender relies upon in mitigation of penalty, it is enough if those matters are proved by the Offender on the balance of probabilities: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28].  
     
      
    6 It is necessary that I keep in mind, at all times, the fact that the Offender was not convicted of the s.29D fraud count. He stands to be sentenced only for the two offences of which he was found guilty by the jury. The sentences to be imposed on the Offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offences of which he has been found guilty, but he is not to be punished for an offence for which he has not been convicted. In imposing sentence, I am entitled to consider all the conduct of the Offender, including that which would aggravate his offences, but I cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence, in this case, the s.29D fraud offence: The Queen v De Simoni [1980]-[1981] 147 CLR 383 at 389. 
     
      
    7 The history of the litigation giving rise to the trial at which the Offender was convicted may be found in a series of judgments delivered by me in 2006 and 2007. See, in particular, R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 1) [2006] NSWSC 788 (refusal of stay) and R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 30) [2007] 214 FLR 311; [2007] NSWSC 1119 (refusal of application for verdicts by direction). 
     
      
    8 The trial before this jury proceeded for six months. The sentencing hearing occupied five sitting days. It is necessary that I make findings on a range of matters for the purpose of passing sentence. This will take a little time. 
     
      
    9 At the time of these offences, the maximum penalty for offences under each of ss.70 and 73 was imprisonment for two years and/or a fine of 120 penalty units ($13,200.00): ss.4AA(1) and 4B(2) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
       
      The Second and Third Counts 
       
      
    10 The jury were provided with written directions and a detailed chronology: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 34) [2007] NSWSC 1462. The elements of the offences contained in the second and third counts were explained to the jury in the summing up (SU58-61). 
     
      
    11 The second count was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “That between about October 1997 and February 1999 at Sydney, in New South Wales and elsewhere, the accused, then a Commonwealth officer with the Australian Taxation Office, did agree to receive a benefit for himself, namely money, on an understanding that the exercise by him of his duty as a Commonwealth officer would be affected.” 
         
        
       
      
    12 The essential elements of the second count, found proved by the jury, are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
       
      (a) that the Offender was at all relevant times an officer with the Australian Taxation Office (“ATO”) and, thus, an officer of the Commonwealth;  
       
       
      (b) that the Offender agreed to receive a benefit in the form of money for himself; and,  
       
       
      (c) that the basis upon which the Offender so agreed to receive that money benefit was an understanding that he would, in return, be improperly affected in the performance by him of some duty which he owed in his capacity as a Commonwealth officer, namely, as an officer of the ATO.  
       
        
       
      
    13 The third count was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “That between about June 1998 and April 1999 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, the accused, being a Commonwealth officer with the Australian Taxation Office, did publish to Richard Llewellyn Morgan, a person to whom he was not authorised to publish, documents which came into his possession by virtue of him being a Commonwealth officer and which it was his duty not to disclose.” 
         
        
       
      
    14 The essential elements of the third count, found proved by the jury, are as follows:  
     
      
       
        
       
      (a) that the Offender was an officer of the Commonwealth within the ATO;  
       
       
      (b) that the Offender obtained possession of documents which contained information concerning the affairs of any other person by virtue of him being a Commonwealth officer;  
       
       
      (c) that the Offender was under a duty not to disclose the documents to a person to whom publication was not authorised;  
       
       
      (d) that the Offender published, that is gave, the documents to Mr Morgan; and 
       
       
      (e) that Mr Morgan was not an authorised recipient of the particular documents. 
       
      
    15 There was significant factual overlap between each of the three counts on the indictment. In the practical context of the trial, the Crown relied, with respect to the second count, on all evidence relevant to the first count with the exception of evidence which related solely to the element of deprivation. As part of the first count, the Crown alleged that the Offender was guilty of fraud in that he had placed the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk. As the jury could not agree on a verdict on this count, it is necessary to place to one side, for present purposes, all evidence bearing upon the element of deprivation. 
     
      
    16 The Crown case on the second count was based upon a course of conduct on the part of the Offender between about October 1997 and February 1999. The Crown case on the third count alleged unauthorised publication by the Offender in the period between about June 1998 and April 1999. 
     
      
    17 I now proceed to consider the evidence before the jury for the purpose of finding facts, to the requisite standard, and consistent with the verdicts of the jury, with respect to the second and third counts.  
     
      
       
      Facts of the Offences 
       
      
    18 The Offender was born in 1967. By 1996, the Offender had tertiary qualifications in law and had a close interest in revenue law. In 1996, he became acquainted with Mr Richard Morgan at a time when both men worked at Computer Law Services, a provider of information products to taxation-related businesses. In the same year, the Offender became acquainted with Mr Nicholas Panos, Mr Andrew Gray and Mr John McLaren. 
     
      
    19 In about February 1997, the Offender expressed interest in taking up a position within the ATO. On 19 February 1997, as part of that process, the Offender signed an ATO declaration of secrecy acknowledging that he was bound by the relevant secrecy provisions of tax legislation (SU79-80). 
     
      
    20 On 12 May 1997, the Offender commenced as a consultant with the ATO. The term of his appointment as a consultant was ultimately extended until he became a permanent employee of the ATO on 24 November 1997. 
     
      
    21 I am satisfied that, by May 1997, the Offender had determined to go into the business of marketing schemes including employee benefit arrangements (“EBAs”) which would be attractive, from a tax perspective, to taxpayers. When interviewed on 24 March 2000 by Federal Agent Wildman, the Offender explained that he had been helping his then wife with her Masters degree and, in that context, had studied EBAs. The Offender told Federal Agent Wildman (SU299): 
     
      
       
        
        “…then the offer came to go to the ATO so I mean I was really interested in going along with all of this as a business, I thought it was a fantastic business, then I went to the ATO.” 
        
       
      
    22 I am satisfied that the Offender was establishing a business during the course of 1997 involving the marketing of EBAs, and that it was his intention to further those private business interests in the positions which he took up within the ATO, initially as a consultant and later as a full-time employee. 
     
      
    23 In and after June 1997, the Offender met, from to time, with Mr Morgan and Mr Panos concerning business arrangements. I accept the evidence of Mr Morgan concerning meetings at which discussions took place, and agreement was reached, with respect to division of the proceeds of the business.  
     
      
    24 I accept the evidence of Mr Morgan that a meeting took place at the Offender’s home in Campsie which was also attended by Mr Panos (SU310-312). I am satisfied that the Offender was the prime mover of this business scheme. At this meeting, the Offender said that Mr Panos’ principal role in the business would be lodging documentary applications for advance opinions and private rulings. The Offender explained the nature of these concepts to Mr Morgan at the meeting. The Offender told Mr Panos of Mr Morgan’s marketing skills of which the Offender had become aware from their time working at Computer Law Services. At the end of the meeting, Mr Panos had some reservations about Mr Morgan’s involvement given his lack of legal knowledge, but the Offender emphasised to Mr Panos the marketing role which Mr Morgan would play.  
     
      
    25 I am satisfied that agreement was reached between the Offender, Mr Morgan and Mr Panos to divide money with each to receive a third. This agreement continued in 1997 and 1998. Payment was in fact made to the Offender. The entire business arrangement hatched in 1997, which continued in 1998, was motivated by financial gain for all, including the Offender. 
     
      
    26 The documentary evidence adduced in the trial provided powerful corroboration of the marketing role played by Mr Morgan and the documentary preparation and submission role of Mr Panos. I am satisfied that it was the Offender who introduced Mr Morgan to Mr Panos for the purpose of giving effect to the business arrangement of which the Offender was the principal moving party. The arrangements and events proved through the documentary evidence, taken with the evidence of Mr Morgan is, in my view, strong evidence that the Offender entered into these arrangements for personal financial gain and maintained a motive of personal financial gain throughout the active life of the business arrangements from 1997 to late 1998.  
     
      
    27 By June 1997, the Offender had met and clearly impressed a senior ATO officer, Mr Jim Killaly. Mr Killaly provided an impressive referee’s report for the Offender dated 30 June 1997. Mr Killaly’s assessment of the Offender is important for a number of purposes. Firstly, it demonstrates the extent to which the Offender was pressing his involvement within the ATO at a time when, I am satisfied, he was establishing private commercial business interests outside the ATO. Secondly, given an issue which has arisen in the sentencing proceedings concerning the Offender’s mental health and ability to function between 1997 and 1999, the assessment of Mr Killaly provides a reliable contemporary assessment of the Offender. Mr Killaly had discussions with the Offender concerning technical aspects of international tax. Mr Killaly spoke in glowing terms of the Offender’s communication skills (Exhibit D35): 
     
      
       
        
        “Nick is very articulate and a very good writer. He has a clear and concise style and can arrange complex material in a logical and fluent manner. He is personable and presents himself confidently, well able to challenge and contribute ideas. He is well able to discuss issues and think well on his feet. In my view he meets the criterion to a high standard.” 
        
       
       
      With respect to the Offender’s conceptual, analytical and strategic skills, Mr Killaly said (Exhibit D35): 
       
       
        
        “Nick has a demonstrated ability to analyse complex tax issues and distil the assumptions and implications. He has demonstrated this ability to think at a very high level in his academic work, in the private sector as an employee of Mallesons and in his journalism. I have no doubt that he can assimilate several sources of information. He is quick to identify the tax angles and to develop solutions. While he has not had much exposure to public policy I am confident from my discussions with him that he can apply purposive approaches to the interpretation of tax legislation.” 
        
       
      
    28 Mr Killaly considered that the Offender had “demonstrated the ability to thoughtfully weigh up competing arguments and give a considered and well-reasoned view”. He considered that the Offender was “well able to contribute to the development of professional skills of staff”. 
     
      
    29 In about July-August 1997, Mr Panos introduced Mr Geoffrey Strong to the Offender as part of the developing relationships being formed to advance the business.  
     
      
    30 In the meantime, inside the ATO, the Offender was cultivating associations with persons working in the area of EBAs or employee benefit trusts (“EBTs”).  
     
      
    31 On 30 June 1997, Mr Andrew Gardiner posted a message on the ATO GrapeVine system requesting that anyone who had seen an EBT arrangement to contact him. Within a day, the Offender emailed Mr Gardiner, stated that he had come across “a ripper of a scheme in the high wealth projects” which he was investigating and would sit down and review (Exhibit C175). I am satisfied that the Offender took this step, at that time, as part of a process to advance his personal business interests through acts within the ATO which would assist those interests. Before, during and after this time, the Offender intentionally withheld from ATO personnel the true facts concerning his private business interests and relationships. Thus, a process was underway where the Offender was utilising his position, firstly as a consultant and later as a full-time employee within the ATO, to further his private business interests. A clear conflict of interest existed and I am satisfied that the Offender knew that this was the case.  
     
      
    32 The technical nature of advance opinions and private rulings, issued by the ATO, was the subject of directions to the jury (SU52-54; 67-78) and need not be repeated here. It is sufficient to observe that rulings and opinions were regarded as valuable commodities by persons engaged in marketing schemes and tax products in the commercial world. The holder of an opinion or ruling, which expressed the ATO view with respect to the particular circumstances, was perceived as having an advantage for tax purposes. The Offender explained these advantages, in a practical way, to Mr Morgan who was to perform the task of marketing them. I will refer shortly to evidence disclosing the Offender’s own perception of the value of holding an opinion or ruling, and the positive features of them which were to be emphasised for marketing purposes. 
     
      
    33 In August 1997, the Offender engaged in email communications with ATO employees including Mr Gardiner and Mr James Targett concerning EBTs. On 4 August 1997, the Offender attended a seminar conducted by Mr Michael Charles at the Dandenong office of the ATO in relation to employee share schemes.  
     
      
    34 I am satisfied that the Offender’s contact with these ATO officers was primarily for the purpose of him establishing associations, and acquiring information, to assist his own private business interests. 
     
      
    35 A clear example of the collision between the Offender’s private interests and his public duty as an ATO consultant is demonstrated by a document extracted by police, in March 2000, from a storage unit, used by the Offender, in Melbourne under the name of Christopher Marriott, in which a computer hard drive and a large number of documents were located. Extracted from the hard drive was a document dated 17 August 1997 (Exhibit C206, Tab 8). This was a draft application for an advance opinion for the Productivity Incentive Corporation Employee Incentive Plan. On 9 September 1997, Mr Panos sent an application for an advance opinion, marked for the attention of Mr Charles, for the Productivity Incentive Australia Productivity Incentive Plan. This application had been drafted by the Offender. I will refer to this application again later in these reasons. 
     
      
    36 In effect, the Offender was operating on both sides of the tax fence at the same time. He was associating with Mr Charles and others inside the ATO. At the same time, he was preparing an application to be directed to Mr Charles concerning the same subject matter. The Offender’s conflict of interest could be seen in stark relief at this time. 
     
      
    37 At various times in 1997, the Offender was reminded of the importance of identification of actual or potential conflicts of interest. On 18 August 1997, a written agreement was entered into between the ATO and the Offender’s company, Middleduke Pty Limited (“Middleduke”), in relation to consultancy services for the ATO High Wealth Individuals’ Taskforce. The agreement prohibited the Offender from disclosing any Commonwealth material or contract material to any other person without prior written approval of the Commonwealth. In a portion of the agreement headed “Conflict of Interest”, the Offender warranted that, at the date of signing the contract, “No conflict of interest exists or is likely to arise in the performance” of obligations under the contract and that “if, during the term of the contract, a conflict or risk of conflict arises”, the Offender undertook to notify the ATO immediately in writing of that conflict or risk (Exhibit C15).  
     
      
    38 It was submitted for the Offender that I should find that his status as an ATO consultant in 1997 gave rise to some uncertainty, and grey areas, with respect to actual and potential conflicts of interest. I do not accept this submission. I am satisfied that there was, by August 1997 if not before, a clear bright-line test of actual or potential conflict of interest of which the Offender was well aware. This was not a grey area. The obligations of the Offender were, I am satisfied, clear to him at that time. His failure to disclose areas of actual conflict of interest demonstrate the foundation for actual impropriety found by the jury for the purpose of its verdict with respect to the second count.  
     
      
    39 On 19 August 1997, a day after he signed the Middleduke contract, the Offender was communicating by email with Mr Targett concerning an employee benefit trust. He requested Mr Targett to obtain a copy of the trust deed from the relevant entity. 
     
      
    40 On 28 August 1997, a document entitled “The Mechanics of the Productivity Incentive Plan” was created by the Offender on his hard drive (Exhibit C206, Tab 11). I am satisfied that this was a marketing document, further evidencing the active part being played by the Offender in the development of the scheme of marketing EBAs for commercial gain.  
     
      
    41 I accept the evidence of Mr Morgan that the Offender met with him and discussed marketing approaches with respect to the Productivity Incentive Scheme. An entry in the Offender’s diary for 30 August 1997 (Exhibit C227) evidences the fact that the Offender met with Mr Morgan at that time.  
     
      
    42 A further incident occurred in early September 1997 which emphasised, once again, the importance of the Offender identifying areas of actual or potential conflict of interest. A question arose concerning the Offender’s use of ATO facilities for non-ATO purposes. An innocuous event triggered a meeting between ATO officers and the Offender. A memorandum dated 2 September 1997 (Exhibit C16) was prepared following that meeting. The memorandum was entitled “Future Arrangements Regarding Nick Petroulias”. It indicated that the Offender would “focus most of his attention on the review of international issues”. It said “Where Nick in his private consulting work, represents a client which involves an ATO matter, the general nature of the matter should be communicated” to nominated senior personnel and this would “avoid any potential or perceived conflicts of interest”. The memorandum stated “Nick’s dealings with ATO people outside the high wealth individual task force will always be in conjunction with HWI people” and that this would ensure that “other ATO staff have a proper introduction to Nick’s function in HWI”. Once again, this document emphasised to the Offender the lines of demarcation and communication which were appropriate to guard against actual or perceived conflicts of interest given his role in the High Wealth Individuals’ Taskforce. The rules were clear and emphatic. I am satisfied that there was no room for honest controversy or debate concerning the construction and application of these rules. Once again, the Offender was on clear notice of his obligations in the area of conflict of interest. 
     
      
    43 Within days of this memorandum, the Offender was in contact with an ATO officer, Mr Lowman Chow, concerning an application for an advance opinion made by Mr Panos for Productivity Incentive Australia Pty Limited (Exhibit C17). The Offender had social dealings with Mr Chow, by way of yum cha, on 7 September 1997. Over the next two days, the Offender prepared a lengthy facsimile which was sent to Mr Chow on 9 September 1997 supporting the issue of the advance opinion (Exhibit C18).  
     
      
    44 False and misleading statements were made to Mr Chow in September 1997 with respect to the alleged activities of Productivity Incentive Australia Pty Limited. The application of 2 September 1997 for an advance opinion had been directed by Mr Panos to Mr Chow. Mr Chow spoke to Mr Panos by telephone and informed him that Mr Chow’s area within the ATO related to media and communication industries. Thereafter, Mr Panos sent a facsimile to Mr Chow stating that the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan would be developed mainly for prospective clients in the media and entertainment industry. It was asserted that Productivity Incentive Australia Pty Limited was seeking to develop the product for entities such as News Corporation, Fairfax, Village Roadshow, the Hoyts Group, Greater Union, Video Ezy, Civic Video, Dymocks and Angus & Robertson. I am satisfied that this was a false statement by Mr Panos communicated for the purpose of ensuring that Mr Chow retained the application. The Offender wished the application to remain with Mr Chow so that the Offender could exercise his influence to ensure a favourable outcome. Given the intense involvement of the Offender with this application, I am satisfied that he well knew of this contrivance even if he had not proposed it himself, in the first place, to Mr Panos. 
     
      
    45 There were further communications between Mr Panos and Mr Chow with respect to the application in September-October 1997. At the same time, the Offender was communicating with Mr Chow supporting the issue of the advance opinion. At no time did the Offender inform Mr Chow of his personal business association with Mr Panos, let alone his personal interest in the application then before Mr Chow. On 8 October 1997, Mr Chow issued a favourable letter of advice in response to the application (Exhibit C27; Exhibit C95, Tab 1). 
     
      
    46 The nature of the Offender’s conflict of interest was illustrated starkly by a document related to Mr Chow’s letter issued on 8 October 1997. Located on the Offender’s hard drive found in the Melbourne storage unit was an unformatted draft letter created on 24 October 1997 and directed to Mr John McLaren. I am satisfied that the Offender was the author of this document. Mr McLaren was a business associate of the Offender in the scheme to market EBAs. The draft letter urged Mr McLaren to contact Mr Norman Draper, whom the Offender had met at a seminar on 14 October 1997.  
     
      
    47 It is important to note, at this point, that the letter issued by Mr Chow on 8 October 1997 contained what was described as a “Part IVA sign off”, a reference to Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth). The document addressed to Mr McLaren, and written by the Offender, provides powerful evidence of the existence of a business arrangement, in which the Offender was a central figure, and the use by him of his position within the ATO to further those business interests. The document included the following (SU115): 
     
      
       
        
        “Things to note: speeding things along, Accountants tend to be driven by deadlines (ISD, ATO, ASC returns, etc) and therefore are slow to move on product. In order to motivate them to move quicker it should be pointed out that it should not be left to end of year because it looks like a sham/Part IVA; and most importantly, it costs the client money each and every month that it is not implemented in the form of PAYE instalments, payroll tax, Super guarantee charge and workers comp. IE, for even a small company, these on-cost savings pay for the plan. Second opinions: If possible, it would be handy to arrange for second opinions in Melbourne to be done by Andrew Gray rather than the client's other solicitors/advisers. The object would be to minimise potential plagiarism and at the same time ensure that a consistent message is being given. Andrew's number is  
        [XXX] 
        . You could tell the client that being familiar with the product, the costs of any second opinion would be smaller than to take it to someone who is not familiar with it. Competitors - comparison. We are the only ones with an advance opinion which includes a Part IVA sign-off. Arthur Andersen have an advance opinion on their product which sells for $40,000 but does not have a Part IVA sign-off. Part IVA as you know, is very important to accountants so it is a difference that is worth noting. Also, ours is the only advance opinion which is under the new 1997 Act. That is, it is not open to the ATO to argue that the wording of the new Act is different and therefore the advance opinion does not apply.” 
        
       
      
    48 The document continued and referred to some competitor schemes as “shockers”. The Offender continued (SU116): 
     
      
       
        
        “These schemes are a total disaster. Note that even if it did work, there would be indexation for CGT purposes merely on the $1 rather than in our case, on the full value of the contribution. It is important to point out that price should not be a consideration for a scheme that will work for next 10 years or so to reduce tax - particularly when it carries no tax audit risk. If the cheaper end of the market sells theirs at $5,000 less than us for example, that is a small price to pay over a substantial period for avoiding audit risk. If the clients do get audited, they will also have to spend at least the difference on advisers fending off the ATO. They will also be disrupted from their business activities where they should be making money.” 
        
       
      
    49 I am satisfied that the Offender, in this document, was urging Mr McLaren to market the Productivity Incentive Scheme by reference to the letter issued by Mr Chow on 8 October 1997. The Offender was emphasising what are said to be advantages of the scheme including “Part IVA sign off” and “avoiding audit risk”. I am satisfied that the Offender caused Mr Chow to issue the letter of 8 October 1997, and thereafter ensured that the letter would be used by his business associates, on the other side of the tax fence, as a marketing tool. This involved a blatant and actual conflict of interest. The fact that the Offender was a consultant, and not a full-time employee, at this time makes no difference to this conclusion. By this time, there was a clear conflict of interest and flagrant breach of trust on the part of the Offender with respect to his public duties as a consultant with the ATO. 
     
      
    50 Events soon after demonstrated the use of Mr Chow’s letter for selling purposes. On 6 November 1997, Mr McLaren met Mr Draper in an attempt to market the Productivity Incentive Scheme. Amongst the materials provided by Mr McLaren to Mr Draper was a copy of part of the letter of Mr Chow issued 8 October 1997. I infer that the letter was provided to Mr McLaren by the Offender or by Mr Panos. The use by Mr McLaren of the Chow letter for marketing purposes, in my view, confirms that the Offender’s marketing suggestions to Mr McLaren (contained in the 24 October 1997 draft) had been implemented.  
     
      
    51 I am satisfied that the Offender applied a combination of subtle and unsubtle pressure to Mr Chow, which led Mr Chow to issue his letter of advice on 8 October 1997. The Offender’s efforts in this respect were intense and continued for a period of time. Mr Chow, of course, was completely unaware of the Offender’s personal interest in the application.  
     
      
    52 The circumstances surrounding the issue of this letter by Mr Chow provide a graphic illustration of the impropriety of the Offender which forms part of the second count. I am satisfied that the involvement of the Offender in this episode sets the scene for what continued over many months in 1997 and 1998. It provides a clear and reliable insight into the activities of the Offender, surrounding the issue of advance opinions and private rulings, in circumstances of gross conflict of interest and clear impropriety. 
     
      
    53 On 9 September 1997, Mr Panos made application for an advance opinion for Productivity Incentive Australia Pty Limited Productivity Incentive Plan. The application was marked for the attention of Mr Charles. I am satisfied that this application had been drafted by the Offender in and after August 1997. As mentioned earlier, a draft of this document was located on the Offender’s hard drive seized from the Melbourne storage unit by police on 23 March 2000 (Exhibit C206, Tab 8).  
     
      
    54 The Offender played a part in settling a favourable response by Mr Charles to the application. On 25 November 1997, Mr Charles issued a favourable letter to Mr Panos (Exhibit C95, Tab 2). This was a further clear example of a gross conflict of interest by the Offender. He had drafted the application sent by Mr Panos to Mr Charles, and then involved himself in the charade where he purported to assess the application and advise Mr Charles as to the outcome. Like his involvement in the application to Mr Chow, the acts of the Offender with respect to this application involved serious impropriety. 
     
      
    55 I accept that the Offender told Mr Charles that he (the Offender) had advised Mr Panos to forward the application to Mr Charles because it was in his area of experience and that the Offender told Mr Charles that he knew Mr Panos (SU133). This was not much of a disclosure. The evidence demonstrated that very many people knew each other in the tax industry. What was critical was the true nature of the relationship. This limited disclosure to Mr Charles was the extent of any disclosure by the Offender to any of Messrs Charles, Chow or Targett. I am satisfied that it was a grossly inadequate and misleading statement which omitted the true nature of the relationship between the Offender and Mr Panos. 
     
      
    56 On 11 November 1997, the Offender and Mr Morgan together visited an accountant, Mr Calligeros, for the purpose of marketing EBT schemes. Although the Offender was still a consultant to the ATO at that time, I am satisfied that he well understood that actions of this type involved an actual conflict of interest. The visit to Mr Calligeros was for the purpose of the Offender, together with his business associate Mr Morgan, marketing schemes for personal gain. 
     
      
    57 On 24 November 1997, the Offender commenced permanent employment with the ATO, for a fixed term of four years, at the level of Senior Executive Service Band 1, Office of Chief Tax Counsel.  
     
      
    58 On 14 October 1997, the company, Morgan HR Pty Limited, was registered. This was a corporate front to be utilised by Mr Morgan for marketing purposes. At all relevant times in 1997 and 1998, Mr Morgan operated, on his own, out of his small flat in Elizabeth Bay. He had no employees or other staff. I am satisfied that the registration of Morgan HR Pty Limited was effected to further the private business plan of the Offender, Mr Panos and Mr Morgan. 
     
      
    59 On 25 November 1997, Mr Panos made application for an advance opinion for a Productivity Incentive Trust Plan for Morgan HR Pty Limited. The application was marked for the attention of Mr James Targett. The Offender had been in contact with Mr Targett for purposes relating to EBTs since at least August 1997. I am satisfied that the Offender told Mr Panos to mark the application for the attention of Mr Targett. 
     
      
    60 Following the receipt by Mr Targett of the application of 25 November 1997, the Offender communicated with Mr Targett with respect to the application. I am satisfied that the Offender spoke to Mr Targett on about 15 December 1997 and told him, with respect to the application, to “let this one go … we will be looking at these in the new year … we are going to issue a public ruling” (Exhibit C87). On 12 January 1998, Mr Targett issued a favourable advance opinion to Mr Panos with respect to the Productivity Incentive Trust Plan for Morgan HR Pty Limited (Exhibit C95, Tab 3). 
     
      
    61 The application made to Mr Targett on behalf of Morgan HR Pty Limited by Mr Panos included extravagant and clearly false statements concerning that company and its alleged activities. Although it was Mr Panos who wrote the letter in question, I am satisfied that the Offender had knowledge of the falsity of this information, and the fact that it was being proffered to the ATO. It was the Offender who had introduced Mr Morgan to Mr Panos and who was, I am satisfied, the mastermind of the private commercial arrangements put in place between these men, and others.  
     
      
    62 On 2 December 1997, Mr Targett spoke to Mr Panos concerning the application he had received for Morgan HR Pty Limited. Mr Panos informed him that the application had been directed to Mr Targett because Morgan HR Pty Limited was an adviser dealing mainly with Large Business and Industry and Property and Construction clients whereas the Productivity Incentive Australia Pty Limited request sent to Mr Chow had mainly dealt with media clients. At that time, Mr Targett worked in the Large Business & Industry (Property and Construction) part of the ATO. I am satisfied that the Offender had proposed that the application be sent to Mr Targett, with whom the Offender had been in contact on EBT issues. I am satisfied that the false statements by Mr Panos were made at the suggestion of the Offender to ensure that Mr Targett retained the application. That this was plainly false is demonstrated by the fact that Morgan HR Pty Limited had no clients at all. The company, in effect, was Mr Morgan operating out of his small flat in Elizabeth Bay. His sole role was to market schemes. All this serves to demonstrate a level of deceit used in communications with the ATO of which the Offender was, I am satisfied, well aware. 
     
      
    63 On 12 January 1998, Mr Targett issued a favourable advance opinion with respect to the Morgan HR Pty Limited Productivity Incentive Trust Plan (Exhibit C95, Tab 3). 
     
      
    64 I note that the Crown did not contend, nor do I find, that there was any impropriety whatsoever on the part of Mr Chow, Mr Charles or Mr Targett with respect to the applications in which the Offender became involved. I am satisfied, however, that the Offender directed Mr Panos to mark applications for the attention of these persons in circumstances where the Offender had developed an association with these persons, and could thereafter play an active part in promoting a favourable response to the applications. 
     
      
    65 The Offender met Mr Emmanuel Aivaliotes in about April 1997. Mr Aivaliotes had commenced working at the ATO in February 1996. Before then, he had worked for some 18 years as a solicitor in private practice and in other capacities. The Offender asked Mr Aivaliotes to work with him in the SRA and he commenced to work there in late 1997. He had an office on the same floor as the Offender in the ATO’s Centrepoint office in Sydney. 
     
      
    66 Mr Aivaliotes was called as a Crown witness at committal proceedings, in the first trial before Sully J and a jury in 2005, and was in the witness box giving evidence when the second trial before me and a jury was aborted in May 2007: Petroulias v R [2007] NSWCCA 134. By that time, I had acceded to an application by the Crown for leave to cross-examine Mr Aivaliotes as an unfavourable witness under s.38 Evidence Act 1995: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 16) [2007] NSWSC 506. During the course of the evidence in chief of Mr Aivaliotes before the jury that convicted the Offender, I granted the Crown leave under s.38 to cross-examine Mr Aivaliotes, as an unfavourable witness, with respect to seven specified topics: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) [2007] NSWSC 1005. 
     
      
    67 It is appropriate that I record my findings concerning the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes. As will be seen, for a period of months after January 1998, Mr Panos (and others associated with the business, including Mr Morgan, Mr Strong and Mr McLaren) directed applications for private rulings and advance opinions for the attention of Mr Aivaliotes. I am satisfied that these, and other related applications, were made as part of the private business arrangements involving the Offender. Some 65 private rulings or advance opinions were issued by Mr Aivaliotes pursuant to these applications between January 1998 and October 1998. It was the Crown case that the Offender had effectively controlled Mr Aivaliotes over a period of time and exercised influence over him, directly and indirectly, in the issue of favourable rulings and opinions. The evidence of Mr Aivaliotes at committal proceedings and in the 2005 trial demonstrated, in a number of respects, that he had been acting under the effective control and direction of the Offender with respect to the issue of these rulings and opinions.  
     
      
    68 However, Mr Aivaliotes altered his evidence in a number of respects at the two trials in 2007. In those trials, Mr Aivaliotes said that much of the work was done by him and that he acted in a way which reflected his own independent views on matters, rather than following the views given to him by the Offender. The effect of this change in evidence of Mr Aivaliotes was to elevate his own role in the decision making, and to reduce significantly the role of the Offender. It was in areas touching this change that Mr Aivaliotes was cross-examined, by leave, by the Crown at the trial.  
     
      
    69 I am satisfied that the jury accepted, as the truth, the earlier accounts given by Mr Aivaliotes at committal proceedings and the 2005 trial which demonstrated the significant controlling role of the Offender in the issue of favourable rulings and opinions in 1998. In my view, Mr Aivaliotes gave a most unconvincing series of explanations for his changes in evidence. At times, he gave a tangled and confused account of the changes in his evidence. Indeed, his capacity to change positions in the witness box served to highlight an element of malleability which, I am satisfied, existed in 1998 in his role in issuing advance opinions and private rulings whilst under the influence of the Offender. I am satisfied that the jury concluded that Mr Aivaliotes was, in truth, a puppet used by the Offender as a means of ensuring speedy and positive outcomes for applications for advance opinions and private rulings for applicants associated with the Offender’s own private business interests. I am satisfied that the Offender selected Mr Aivaliotes as the person to whom applications should be directed because he had assessed Mr Aivaliotes as a compliant individual who would act in accordance with the Offender’s wishes. 
     
      
    70 Many of the advance opinions and private rulings issued by Mr Aivaliotes were cut-and-paste efforts which, I am satisfied, were not the product of any independent legal assessment. Rather, if the Offender indicated to Mr Aivaliotes that opinions or rulings should issue, Mr Aivaliotes proceeded to act in accordance with the Offender’s wishes. 
     
      
    71 It is not necessary, for present purposes, to refer to each and every advance opinion or private ruling issued in 1998, formally or notionally by Mr Aivaliotes. It is sufficient to observe that applications for rulings and opinions which received favourable outcomes were made by, amongst others, Mr Panos, Mr Morgan, Mr McLaren and Mr Strong.  
     
      
    72 On 19 January 1998, the Offender was appointed Acting Assistant Commissioner, SRA, within the ATO.  
     
      
    73 The evidence of Mr Morgan came under strong challenge by the Defence at trial. The jury was given warnings and directions under s.165 Evidence Act 1995 concerning the evidence of Mr Morgan (SU407-409). I am satisfied that the jury accepted the evidence of Mr Morgan concerning the existence of the business arrangements in and after 1997 involving the Offender, Mr Morgan, Mr Panos, Mr McLaren, Mr Strong and Mr Gray. The evidence of Mr Morgan did not stand alone. There was a powerful documentary case which, in my view, supported the direct evidence of Mr Morgan concerning the role and activities of the Offender with respect to these persons, and their business arrangements, in 1997 and 1998.  
     
      
    74 It is the case that the only direct evidence of payment of money to the Offender, as a result of his involvement in this business arrangement, emanated from Mr Morgan. It is also the case that Mr Morgan’s account with respect to payment of money to the Offender varied. This was a factor referred to in the course of the s.165 warnings given to the jury. I have regard to the s.165 warnings concerning Mr Morgan for the purposes of my own fact-finding function on sentence.  
     
      
    75 I have carefully considered Mr Morgan’s evidence and the arguments advanced with respect to it at the trial and on sentence. In my judgment concerning directions to the jury (R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 34) at [32]-[46]), I gave reasons for giving certain directions to the jury concerning the evidence of Mr Morgan. I referred to a number of pieces of evidence independent of Mr Morgan which, in my view, supported his account in significant respects. It was not necessary for the Crown to prove actual payment of money to the Offender to secure a conviction on the second count. An agreement to receive money was sufficient. However, I am satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt, that the sum of $41,000.00 in cash was paid to the Offender as part of this business arrangement, but that the Offender returned the money at a later time when investigations of his conduct were underway. The Offender was a controlling figure in the arrangement. He was so involved for financial gain. 
     
      
    76 I am satisfied that Mr Morgan’s evidence provides an essentially accurate account of what was happening with respect to the business arrangements outside the ATO in 1997 and 1998, including dealings with the Offender, Mr Panos and others concerning the implementation and advancement of those business arrangements. The documentary evidence, as I have said, provides substantial support, viewed from the ATO side of the fence, for Mr Morgan’s account of events. I am satisfied that the only rational explanation for the Offender’s involvement in these arrangements between 1997 and 1999 was personal financial reward.  
     
      
    77 As 1998 unfolded, applications for advance opinions and private rulings came in marked for the attention of Mr Aivaliotes. The Offender was directly involved in the favourable consideration of these applications. I am satisfied that, at no time did the Offender reveal to Mr Aivaliotes either the fact, or the nature, of his business association with Mr Panos, Mr Morgan, Mr Strong or Mr McLaren. I do not accept the evidence of Mr Aivaliotes, expressed for the first time at the second trial in 2007, that the Offender had disclosed in late 1997 an association with Mr Panos and others. This was a topic in relation to which the Crown was granted leave under s.38 to cross-examine Mr Aivaliotes: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) at [64]-[67], [83]. He had previously said on oath that the Offender had not disclosed any association with these persons. I am satisfied that the earlier evidence of Mr Aivaliotes, that there had been no disclosure, was the truth. I reject his late and unconvincing account to the contrary. 
     
      
    78 In and after January 1998, the Offender held the position of Acting Assistant Commissioner within the ATO. The trust and responsibility vested in him in that senior office was manifest. In breach of that trust, the Offender continued to involve himself, and effectively control, the outcome of applications for advance opinions and private rulings processed through Mr Aivaliotes. 
     
      
    79 On 31 March 1998, the Offender completed a Statement of Registration of Private Interests which required disclosure of any areas of actual or potential conflict with public duty (Exhibit C203). No disclosure was made despite the clear existence of actual conflict. This served as yet another reminder to the Offender of his obligations. He ignored them.  
     
      
    80 Whilst all applications for advance opinions and private rulings by the Offender’s business associates met with favourable outcomes, with the Offender playing an influential role in these outcomes, the evidence demonstrated a different approach was taken by the Offender to six applications by other interests. These applications were declined in 1998, with the Offender playing a significant role in that outcome. Although it was submitted for the Offender that these applications could be distinguished in various ways from those made by the Offender’s associates, I am satisfied that no relevant distinction can be made. This was powerful evidence of favouritism by the Offender towards his business associates. 
     
      
    81 On 26 March 1998, notices under s.264 Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) were directed to Morgan HR Pty Limited and Productivity Incentive Australia Pty Limited through Mr Panos (Exhibits C116 and C117). Thereafter, Mr Morgan wrote to Mr Aivaliotes on 14 April 1998 concerning the s.264 notice to Morgan HR Pty Limited (Exhibit C118). On 21 April 1998, letters were sent by Mr Aivaliotes with respect to these s.264 notices indicating that material in relation to the arrangements had been examined and that the ATO agreed with the tax consequences outlined by the companies and that, accordingly, “We will not be auditing your clients as part of this current project” (Exhibits C120 and C121).  
     
      
    82 I am satisfied that the Offender was aware that these s.264 notices had been sent to the two companies through Mr Panos, and that powers under s.264 were being utilised with respect to these companies, Mr Morgan and Mr Panos. I am satisfied that this was a façade, by which the s.264 power was utilised resulting in letters being provided to Mr Morgan and Mr Panos which were capable of being utilised for marketing purposes. I am satisfied that the involvement of the Offender in this area involved a misuse of an important statutory power under tax legislation. 
     
      
    83 In May 1998, the Offender formed the view that documentation should be created to provide a veneer of authenticity to the process of assessment by the ATO of Productivity Incentive Corporation applications. Located in the hard drive of the Offender’s computer seized from the Melbourne storage unit in March 2000 was a non-formatted version of a document headed “Productivity Incentive Corporation Re Meeting on Wednesday 28 January 1998 and Thursday 29 January 1998” (Exhibit C206, Tab 30). It was a draft of a document which, in settled form, was entitled “Memorandum of Understanding Re the ATO Attitude Toward the Taxation Treatment of Incentive Structures” on the letterhead of Productivity Incentive Corporation (Exhibit C146).  
     
      
    84 This document purported to be minutes of a meeting on 28 and 29 January 1998 attended by the Offender, Mr Strong, Mr Panos and Mr Aivaliotes. When investigations were underway in late 1998 and early 1999, the Offender handed copies of this document to senior ATO personnel. I am satisfied that no meeting took place on 28 and 29 January 1998 as alleged in this document. This was a further topic in relation to which the Crown was granted leave to cross-examine Mr Aivaliotes at the last trial: R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 29) at [23]-[28], [79]. I accept, as the truth, Mr Aivaliotes’ earlier sworn evidence that he had no recollection of being at such a meeting.  
     
      
    85 I am satisfied that this document is a contrived document. Substantial parts of it involve a cut and paste from promotional material for Productive Incentive Corporation which, I am satisfied, was created by the Offender. If the document was genuine, it indicates that a meeting took place between Mr Panos and Mr Strong (representing the Productivity Incentive Corporation interests) and the Offender and Mr Aivaliotes (representing the ATO) at which lengthy and detailed discussions took place concerning Productivity Incentive Corporation activities leading to a “Memorandum of Understanding”. I am satisfied that the Offender was the prime mover of the Productivity Incentive Corporation, with Mr Panos and Mr Strong being secondary players to the Offender in this respect. The content of the document serves to demonstrate its implausibility. I am satisfied that the document was created by the Offender for use in the event that some record was required to seek to explain the ATO’s consistently favourable approach to Productivity Incentive Corporation applications. The fact that it was deployed by the Offender in late 1998 and early 1999 to assist with such an explanation, supports this conclusion. I am satisfied that the document was not created until some time in and after May 1998. So much is demonstrated by the document located on the Offender’s hard drive in the Melbourne storage unit. There had been no such meeting in January 1998. 
     
      
    86 The fact that the Offender went to such elaborate lengths to create a false document of this type speaks eloquently of the true nature of his relationship with Mr Panos and Mr Strong, and the manner in which he was in a grave and continuing conflict of interest throughout 1998. The fact that the Offender was fabricating such a document, at a time when he held one of the most senior positions in the ATO, points starkly to his abuse of trust at that time. 
     
      
    87 I have mentioned, in general terms, that applications for advance opinions and private rulings by the Offender’s business associates were addressed to Mr Aivaliotes in the ATO in 1998. The evidence revealed that some applications came in batches and favourable rulings and opinions were issued frequently in batches. For example, five applications for private rulings were made on 1 May 1998. Mr Aivaliotes issued four private rulings on 3 June 1998 and four more on 5 June 1998. Four private rulings were issued by him on 17 June 1998. Thirteen applications for private rulings were made on 30 June 1998 and 12 rulings were issued by Mr Aivaliotes on 8 July 1998. Five more applications for private rulings were made on 9 July 1998. Seven private rulings were issued by Mr Aivaliotes on 10 July 1998 with two more on 15 July and three more on 16 July 1998. All of these rulings were made by or on behalf of entities associated with the Offender’s undisclosed business interests. 
     
      
    88 On 25 July 1998, a meeting took place at the Airport Sheraton Hotel in Sydney between the Offender, Mr Panos, Mr Strong, Mr McLaren, Mr Gray and Mr Morgan. Senior Counsel for the Offender at trial accepted that such a meeting took place, but contended that it was a meeting attended lawfully by the Offender, in his ATO capacity, with these persons to discuss tax issues. I reject this submission as, I am sure, did the jury. 
     
      
    89 I accept the evidence of Mr Morgan that this was a meeting between business associates to discuss products and marketing strategies for the sale of tax schemes. I am satisfied that the Offender was not present for any lawful purpose. Rather, the meeting was to advance his own private business interests and those of the other persons present. This was a further manifestation of the grave and continuing conflict of interest involving the Offender throughout 1998.  
     
      
    90 I am satisfied that it was about the time of the 25 July 1998 meeting that the Offender provided to Mr Morgan documents, being client lists, containing information which had been obtained in the exercise of the Offender’s duties with the ATO. The provision of these documents to Mr Morgan by the Offender founded the conviction by the jury on the third count. The documents provided by the Offender contained summaries of taxpayers and tax agents whom the Offender considered ought be contacted by Mr Morgan for marketing purposes. It was submitted for the Offender that the documents provided by the Offender contained relatively innocuous information which was otherwise generally available. If this was so, it is difficult to understand why the Offender would have bothered to provide the documents to Mr Morgan, his salesman. 
     
      
    91 The irresistible inference is that the Offender considered that there was a substantial advantage in Mr Morgan having this material for marketing purposes given that it summarised persons and entities who were likely to be receptive targets for marketing of tax schemes. The Offender’s intention was that the information be used to exploit a marketing advantage which possession of this information gave the Offender and his associates over their business competitors. I am satisfied that the Offender provided these documents to Mr Morgan for the purpose of advancing his personal interests. I am satisfied that the information contained in these documents had been compiled from information gathered by use of the ATO’s compulsory powers. 
     
      
    92 This was a clear and serious breach of the tax secrecy provisions which had bound the Offender from the beginning of 1997. He could have been in no doubt that these were confidential documents, the supply of which to a third party would constitute a criminal offence.  
     
      
    93 This was not a technical breach of the law. By this time, the Offender occupied high office in the ATO. The information contained in the documents had been gathered by use of statutory powers, including s.264 notices. The Offender was motivated by private financial gain in handing these documents to Mr Morgan. The fact that Mr Morgan did not, in the end, use the documents for marketing purposes does not assist the Offender, in any material way, on sentence. The Offender intended that the documents be put to use in this way. The provision of these documents, in clear breach or the law, constituted a further example of a grave abuse of trust by the Offender in his office with the ATO. 
     
      
    94 On 25 September 1998, the Offender was appointed First Assistant Commissioner, Strategic Intelligence Network, within the ATO.  
     
      
    95 On 20 October 1998, the Public Rulings Panel of the ATO met in Melbourne to discuss the forthcoming issue of a draft public ruling concerning the associate test. The Offender was in attendance at this meeting (Exhibit C194). 
     
      
    96 On 21 October 1998, Mr Aivaliotes issued six advance opinions or private rulings with respect to non-complying superannuation funds, all in response to applications by Mr Morgan or Mr McLaren. An advance opinion and a private ruling concerning non-complying superannuation funds were issued by Mr Aivaliotes to Mr Strong on 23 October 1998 (Exhibit C95, Tabs 72, 73). 
     
      
    97 On 28 October 1998, the draft tax ruling was issued at a press conference held by Mr Carmody, the then Commissioner of Taxation. At this time, the Offender informed Mr Carmody that there would be a reaction because of rulings that had issued. Thereafter, a process of investigation commenced during which the Offender was asked to identify rulings and opinions which had issued.  
     
      
    98 During this investigation, I am satisfied that the Offender provided incomplete and misleading explanations to ATO personnel who were seeking from him the true facts concerning what had happened. It was during these investigations that the Offender proffered the fabricated “Memorandum of Understanding” said to have arisen from a meeting on 28 and 29 January 1998, to which I have already made reference. 
     
      
    99 I am satisfied that the Offender was in a position to provide, if he saw fit, a full and frank account of the opinions and rulings which had been issued. He did not provide that information to ATO personnel. Located in the Melbourne storage unit in March 2000 were a large number of original ATO documents and copy documents. They constituted a substantial, if not complete, record of applications by the Offender’s business associates for advance opinions and private rulings, and the opinions and rulings themselves. The fact that the Offender had retained, taken away from the ATO and secreted these documents in Melbourne, was significant incriminating evidence at trial. The fact that the Offender did not produce these documents to ATO investigators, nor use them to provide a complete account of events to them, indicates the continuation of a pattern of deceit, motivated by self-interest and now self-protection on the part of the Offender. 
     
      
    100 The Offender’s deception during the investigation extended beyond the suppression of ATO documents which he had in his possession. At the suggestion of the Offender, a meeting took place between Mr Aivaliotes and the Offender at Coogee Beach on 16 March 1999. According to Mr Aivaliotes, whose evidence I accept in this respect, the Offender was somewhat agitated. I am satisfied that the Offender’s state of agitation was the product of a guilty mind and his awareness that the investigation may reveal the true facts of his association and dealings with Mr Morgan, Mr Panos, Mr McLaren, Mr Strong and others associated with his business arrangements.  
     
      
    101 At this meeting, the Offender handed to Mr Aivaliotes a document (Exhibit C147) which identified six “problem areas” and suggested, with respect to each area, a “possible response”. This was an overt attempt by the Offender to persuade Mr Aivaliotes to provide an account in these areas which was consistent with that of the Offender and which might constitute, in the Offender’s eyes, an exculpatory account. One of the problem areas was, tellingly, “Why all applications look the same”. Another picked up the misspelling of the name “Aivaliotes” on a document which, the Crown contended, had been created by the Offender, and not Mr Aivaliotes, who would not be likely to misspell his own name. Another problem area concerned the Ashley Cain applications which bore the date “25 March 1998”, but looked exactly like the “Geoff Strong application of 30 October”, and referred to a Deed of Contribution which had not existed as at 25 March 1998.  
     
      
    102 I am satisfied that the preparation and production of this document by the Offender provides powerful evidence of his knowledge of contrivances used in 1998 with respect to applications for, and the grant of, favourable advance opinions and private rulings to persons with whom the Offender had private business interests. If the process was all above board, and the Offender believed it to be above board, it is difficult to understand why the Offender would not simply present all the material to ATO investigators. Instead, he went to extraordinary lengths to suppress it and to seek to persuade Mr Aivaliotes to get his story straight, and to align it with the Offender’s story. 
     
      
    103 The Offender resigned from the ATO effective on 6 April 1999.  
     
      
    104 On 8 April 1999, the Offender handed to Mr Brown, an ATO investigator, a laptop computer which had been issued to him by the ATO. Technical examination of the Offender’s computer revealed a letter described in the trial as the “Nick to Nick” letter (Exhibit D42). I am satisfied that this letter was prepared by the Offender and was directed to Mr Panos, clearly prior to 8 April 1999. This letter was a powerful piece of evidence against the Offender. It sheds substantial light on the true relationship between the Offender, Mr Panos, Mr Strong and Mr McLaren. I am satisfied that it demonstrates the controlling and pivotal role of the Offender in his secret (from the ATO) business arrangements with these persons.  
     
      
    105 The document provides potent evidence of the Offender’s impropriety (relevant to Count 2) and the provision of ATO documents in breach of the law for private purposes (relevant to the second and third counts). As this letter provides a telling insight into the Offender’s mind, his motives and acts, it is appropriate to set it out in full: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nick, 
        
       
       
        
        The DPP has now become involved. They are looking at favouritism towards certain people. There are a number of loose ends that need to be sorted out. 
        
       
       
        
        These are:- 
        
       
       
        
        Geoff and his mates. As you know, they have been giving us the problems in what they have been saying. It is important that you sort out the position with Geoff. 
        
       
       
        
        Further, the meeting in January - the 2 day one where you, me, Geoff and Emmanuel met in the York Street offices to discuss how PIC would operate its plans and that PIC would be sending in a number of plans. It is important that you and Geoff get familiar with those notes. These are notes prepared by either Geoff or you and sent to me. (They are very suspicious of those notes). 
        
       
       
        
        The client lists - if Geoff has any, make sure they are destroyed. 
        
       
       
        
        McLaren: I believe they now know about Global Growth. What is the relationship with PIC? I don’t know, I am going to say that they are some sort of copycat as Geoff and Mclaren swap ideas and letters. But I would not know the full story. That is for you to sort out. 
        
       
       
        
        There is a problem with the Ashley Cain application. It is dated 25 March (as are all PIC applications - eg Co Ltd by Guarantee and ETP Plan). Further, answers questions that have not yet arisen until October. Ie the Deed of Contribution is in response to the Commissioner’s ruling in October - they can’t have predicted it back in March. 
        
       
       
        
        The only answer I can suggest and please make sure that McLaren has memorised, is that because when they called in October, and I raised the FBT concerns, the  
        [sic]  
        amended the application but not the original date. Ie they changed their submission on the FBT point, without changing the date of the original application and faxed it a few times to the ATO to make sure that they got it. 
        
       
       
        
        Money - This is particularly important. Everything must be accounted for, even if as loans to Geoff and others. No HK shit. It smells bad. The idea of investing in HK was to set up a major superfund as a spin off from the existing operations.” 
        
       
      
    106 There are a number of features of this letter which call for comment. Firstly, the Offender is conscious that the authorities are investigating “favouritism” towards certain people and that, in that context, “a number of loose ends … need to be sorted out”. I am satisfied that the Offender is here acknowledging favouritism towards others in the issue of advance opinions and private rulings. This lies at the heart of the impropriety involved in the second count. The Offender recognises the existence of a conflict of interest and the need to hide the true facts to guard against its discovery. 
     
      
    107 The Offender is directing Mr Panos to “sort out the position” with Mr Strong “and his mates”. There is reference to the notes of the alleged meeting in January 1998. I am satisfied that no such meeting took place. The reference to the alleged meeting in this letter involves recognition by the Offender that there is a need for all concerned to familiarise themselves with the alleged minutes (which I am satisfied were a contrivance), to prepare for the investigation. 
     
      
    108 The Offender directs Mr Panos that, if Mr Strong has any “client lists” he should “make sure they are destroyed”. This direction sheds considerable light upon the role of the Offender with respect to the conduct of the business. This bears upon both the second and third counts. 
     
      
    109 The reference to “money” being “particularly important” and that “everything must be accounted for, even as if loans to Geoff or others” points strongly towards the Offender’s involvement in a business for financial gain. The question may once again be asked - if all was above board, and the Offender believed it was above board, why write a letter such as this to Mr Panos? I am satisfied that the only rational response to this question is one that incriminates the Offender, in a clear way, with respect to the second and third counts. 
     
      
    110 Telephone conversations between the Offender and other persons were recorded in September and October 1999 under telephone intercept warrants and were tendered before the jury at trial. A number of statements of the Offender during these telephone conversations were incriminating. During a conversation between the Offender and Mr McLaren on 24 September 1999, there was discussion concerning what police investigators should be told concerning Productivity Incentive Corporation. The Offender directed Mr McLaren not to mention Mr Morgan to the police. The Offender suggested to Mr McLaren a possible explanation to police as to how he (McLaren) obtained information as the ruling requests “were exactly the same”. The Offender suggested that he tell police that he obtained them on disk from Mr Panos (Exhibit C198). This evidence portrays the Offender in a controlling and central role with respect to the business arrangements, and the persons involved in those arrangements. Once again, if all was above board, why did the Offender wish to suppress information about Mr Morgan from the police? The response is clear and is damaging to the Offender. 
     
      
    111 On 23 March 2000, police executed a search warrant on the Melbourne storage unit held in the name of Christopher Marriott and seized a large number of original and copy ATO documents and the Offender’s hard drive. The Offender had rented this storage unit in April 1999 and had placed the documents and hard drive in the storage unit. 
     
      
    112 The Offender was arrested and charged by police on 24 March 2000. 
     
      
       
       
      Summary of Factual Findings Concerning Offences 
       
      
    113 I have set out, at considerable length, a chronological recital of the facts which I have found concerning the offences. I now express conclusions with respect to these factual findings. 
     
      
    114 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following: 
     
      
       
      (a) the Offender, an intelligent and highly educated lawyer, took up employment as a consultant, and then permanent employee of the ATO, between 1997 and 1999; 
       
       
      (b) the Offender entered employment with the ATO for the purpose of conducting a business with respect to the marketing of EBAs outside the ATO, and using his contacts and influence within the ATO to advance his private business interests; 
       
       
      (c) throughout the period when the Offender worked as a consultant or employee of the ATO between 1997 and 1999, he did not reveal to anyone the true nature of his associations and his private business interests in areas directly relevant to the exercise of his duties; 
       
       
      (d) the Offender did, at the same time, influence favourable outcomes with respect to applications for advance opinions or private rulings in 1997 and 1998 and orchestrate, through Mr Morgan and others, the use of opinions and rulings (and associated documents) for marketing purposes for his own private financial interests; 
       
       
      (e) with respect to the issue of the opinions and rulings, the Offender exercised influence, to varying extents, over Mr Chow, Mr Charles, Mr Targett and Mr Aivaliotes with respect to the issue of favourable opinions and rulings; 
       
       
      (f) in the same period, the Offender used his influence to guide applications made by other interests towards unfavourable outcomes, which were difficult to reconcile with the favourable outcomes for interests associated with the Offender; 
       
       
      (g) the Offender agreed to receive a benefit, namely money, and did receive money (about $41,000.00) as proceeds from these private business interests; 
       
       
      (h) the Offender provided client lists to Mr Morgan in breach of the secrecy provisions in the tax legislation - the client lists were compiled from information obtained by use of the ATO’s compulsory powers and were provided to Mr Morgan for marketing purposes to gain a commercial advantage over their business competitors;  
       
       
      (i) when investigations were underway after October 1998, the Offender withheld ATO documents from investigators which would have revealed the true position, and provided to them a false document (the Memorandum of Understanding), as well as seeking to influence Mr Aivaliotes and to direct others involved in the business arrangement (in particular Mr Panos, Mr McLaren and Mr Strong) as to false accounts which they should give to police, and steps which they should take to frustrate and obstruct the ATO and police investigation; 
       
       
      (j) the actions of the Offender, whilst a consultant and then an employee of the ATO, involved a clear and grave conflict of interest and abuse of trust. 
       
       
      Consequences of the Offences 
       
      
    115 The Crown case at trial on the first count, the charge of fraud under s.29D, involved, as an element of the offence, the need for the Crown to prove that the Offender put the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk by causing private rulings and advance opinions to issue. The jury could not agree upon a verdict on the first count and was discharged without verdict. I am satisfied that it was this element, the so-called element of deprivation, upon which the jury could not agree with the result that no verdict was returned on the first count.  
     
      
    116 I am fortified in this conclusion by the manner in which the trial was conducted by both the Crown and Defence. In practical and evidentiary terms, the parties approached the second count upon the basis that the jury ought convict the Offender of that offence if satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the matters relied upon by the Crown on the first count, with the exception of the element of deprivation.  
     
      
    117 In accordance with the principles in The Queen v De Simoni, I must approach the question of sentence on the second and third counts without reference to the evidence bearing upon the element of deprivation which related solely to the first count. 
     
      
    118 There is one qualification to what I have just said. Senior Counsel for the Offender submitted that the Court ought be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that each of the relevant opinions and rulings issued were correct in law. In this way, the Offender sought to call in aid on sentence on the second count, as a mitigating factor, the assertion that each of the opinions and rulings was correct in law. It was accepted that, in accordance with the principles in The Queen v Olbrich, the onus of proof as to the existence of such an alleged mitigating factor lay upon the Offender.  
     
      
    119 The submission advanced for the Offender on this issue, at the sentencing hearing, did not descend to any level of detail. Rather, it was put as a global submission which sought to refer back, in a general way, to arguments advanced to the jury on this question. I propose to deal with this submission shortly, consistent with the way in which Senior Counsel for the Offender advanced it on sentence.  
     
      
    120 I am not satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that each of the advance opinions and private rulings issued were correct in law. There was significant evidence at trial bearing upon both fringe benefits tax and deductibility which, in my view, stand in the way of such a finding favourable to the Offender. In my view, to the extent that this issue arose as a jury issue, I found the arguments advanced by the Crown to the jury persuasive.  
     
      
    121 Added to this is the body of evidence concerning the modus operandi of the Offender and his associates, including Mr Morgan and Mr Panos, with respect to applications for and the issue of advance opinions and private rulings. A clear inference is available that, if the advance opinions and private rulings were all correct in law, then the Offender and his business associates would not need to go to the very considerable lengths disclosed by the evidence to obtain these favourable opinions and rulings. This process involved deceit by the Offender during the process of consideration and issuing of the various advance opinions and private rulings, and further deceit and a cover up by the Offender when an investigation was underway with respect to the circumstances of the issue of the opinions and rulings.  
     
      
    122 Consideration of the legal questions agitated before the jury, and the body of evidence disclosing the acts and omissions of the Offender over an extended period whilst applications were made and granted, does not lead me to be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the opinions and rulings were correct in law. I emphasise that I have entered into this area because of a defence submission, which I do not accept. Given the global way in which the argument was advanced at the sentencing hearing, my global reasons for rejecting the submission will suffice. 
     
      
    123 The Crown tendered on sentence evidence which was said to relate to the tax consequences or implications of the offences for which the Offender is to be sentenced. A statement of Michael Ingersoll dated 20 December 2004 was admitted, over objection, together with a schedule summarising steps taken within the ATO with respect to tax deductions said to have been claimed by reference to the relevant opinions and rulings (Exhibits B, C, D). I admitted this evidence for reasons shortly given during the sentencing hearing (ST54-55). Mr Ingersoll was cross-examined on this material (ST58-95).  
     
      
    124 I am satisfied that Mr Ingersoll’s evidence is relevant to the question of sentence. Of course, it does not, and cannot, go to any issue of loss to the Commonwealth, including placing the revenue of the Commonwealth at risk. It is relevant, however, to the practical consequences of the ATO needing to untangle, and scrutinise closely, tax deductions claimed by taxpayers as a result of rulings and opinions issued effectively by the Offender. Mr Ingersoll’s statement and the schedules reveal that a total amount of deductions claimed by taxpayers by reference to these rulings and opinions, totalled $42,227,415.00. Three categories of deductions gave rise to this figure: 
     
      
       
      (a) taxpayers who received opinions or rulings regarding employee benefit trusts issued by the Offender, claimed deductions totalling $15,527,585.00; 
       
       
      (b) taxpayers who entered into employee benefit trusts without an advance opinion or private ruling, but who based deductions on rulings and opinions issued, effectively, by the Offender claimed deductions totalling $17,398,277.00; 
       
       
      (c) taxpayers who entered into controlling interest superannuation arrangements without an advance opinion or private ruling, but who based deductions on rulings and opinions issued, effectively, by the Offender, claimed deductions totalling $9,301,553.00. 
       
      
    125 I accept the Crown submission that the acts of the Offender, which constituted the offences, undermined the credibility of the ATO and the system of issuing private rulings. It was an understandable consequence of the offences that the ATO undertook a close examination of deductions claimed, directly or indirectly, as a result of the opinions and rulings issued through the actions of the Offender.  
     
      
    126 The evidence of Mr Ingersoll indicates a process of protracted correspondence and negotiation with respect to the relevant taxpayers. This process was necessitated by the improper acts of the Offender associated with the issue of the opinions and rulings. The acts of the Offender placed a significant cloud over all rulings and opinions with which he had been involved.  
     
      
    127 In the course of submissions (ST339-340), I raised with counsel an analogy which, in my view, is apt. If a police officer or a prosecutor took a bribe in a particular case, it would likely lead to the need for a review of other cases in which the particular police officer or prosecutor had been involved. This would be a consequence of the taint or cloud generated by the improper acts of the relevant police officer or prosecutor and the need to scrutinise the extent of the impropriety. Of course, the Offender had directly influenced the issue of many favourable opinions and rulings. To these were added claims for deductions made by indirect reliance upon the Offender’s opinions and rulings. 
     
      
    128 I am satisfied that the evidence of Mr Ingersoll is relevant to this issue which, in turn, is relevant to sentence. The acts of the Offender served to undermine public confidence in the ATO generally, and, in particular, its system of rulings. Substantial action was required by the ATO to examine deductions claimed by taxpayers which were directly or indirectly referable to the opinions and rulings issued effectively by the Offender. 
     
      
    129 I emphasise that this evidence is not being taken into account to conclude that, in some way, the revenue of the Commonwealth was put at risk. It is not open to me to consider that question given the absence of a verdict on the first count. Rather, as I have said, this evidence bears upon the detrimental impact on public confidence in the ATO and the private ruling system administered in the public interest by the ATO, and the practical need for use of substantial ATO resources to, in the words of the Crown submission, sort out the mess created by the Offender’s improper conduct. The credibility of the rulings and opinions issued by the ATO was integral to the tax system, and the actions of the Offender brought the ruling system into serious disrepute. 
     
      
       
      The Offender’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    130 The Offender did not give evidence at the trial nor in the sentencing proceedings.  
     
      
    131 A presentence report dated 27 March 2008 (Exhibit A) was obtained. In addition, a number of reports of psychiatrists and psychologists together with reference material was tendered in the Offender’s case on sentence. A number of authors of these documents gave oral evidence and were cross-examined. The Offender’s mother gave evidence in support of the Offender. 
     
      
    132 The Offender informed the Probation and Parole Officer, who prepared the presentence report, that he had studied law and economics, obtaining his doctorate shortly before commencing work in the ATO in 1997. The Offender stated that he was married, but separated in April 2000, and no longer had contact with his ex-wife. He had regular contact with his parents and brothers who reside in Melbourne. 
     
      
    133 The Offender informed the Probation and Parole Officer that he had been seeing a psychiatrist and therapeutic counsellor since 2005. 134 With respect to the offences, the presentence report stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “In discussions with Mr Petroulias he acknowledged that in hindsight, he should have declared knowledge of the Productivity Incentive Australia and Productivity Incentive Corporation tax schemes. He also stated that he could not see how providing information to Mr Morgan was an issue, let alone an offence as the information that he provided was reportedly publicly available. Mr Petroulias justified his actions, stating that he was naive due to his lack of work experience at the time. Overall it appears that Mr Petroulias is unwilling to accept full responsibility for his offending behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    135 A statement from Mrs Dimitra Petroulias, the Offender’s mother, was tendered in the sentencing proceedings (Exhibit 4) and Mrs Petroulias gave evidence. I am satisfied, from this evidence, that the Offender was an intelligent and hard-working student who obtained significant qualifications in law. He wrote articles in journals concerning legal and tax issues. The Offender married in 1993. Mrs Petroulias said that the Offender’s wife had left him in January 1998, but this does not seem to accord with the account given by the Offender to the Probation and Parole Officer. It also seemed that Mrs Petroulias’ knowledge of events surrounding the break up of the Offender’s marriage was somewhat tenuous (Exhibit 4, paragraph 10). 
     
      
    136 Having heard and observed Mrs Petroulias giving evidence, I do not consider that her contact with the Offender in 1997, 1998 and 1999 (before his return to Melbourne in April 1999) was of a type and frequency which equips her to provide a reliable account of his conduct and manner during that period.  
     
      
    137 Mrs Petroulias gave evidence through a Greek interpreter. There were features of her statement, which was prepared by the Offender’s solicitor, which did not sound like the words of Mrs Petroulias. For example, it stated that “Nikytas was very mono-focused and had an insatiable thirst for knowledge” (paragraph 16). The Crown cross-examined Mrs Petroulias about the statement that the Offender “became interested in tax law because he saw it as the most important junction between the government and every citizen all of the time” (paragraph 24). Mrs Petroulias, in cross-examination, was not able to sensibly explain these words. I was left with the clear impression that many of the concepts in the statement were not grasped by Mrs Petroulias. I believe she was trying to help her son in her evidence. However, there was something of a disconnect between the statement and her own words in oral evidence. 
     
      
    138 Although aspects of the Offender’s earlier life referred to by Mrs Petroulias were said to be indicative of the possible presence of bipolar disorder or Aspergers syndrome, the events described by Mrs Petroulias did not, it seems to me, provide an objective foundation for some of the opinions expressed by psychiatrists and psychologists to which I will turn shortly. I formed the view that Mrs Petroulias was doing her best to assist her son in his difficult present circumstances, but that her true evidentiary contribution to this case is quite limited.  
     
      
    139 I accept that the Offender was born in a hard-working migrant family and has worked and studied hard, thereby acquiring very significant academic and professional qualifications. It is the manner in which he has used his professional qualifications, and his position of trust in the ATO, which lies at the heart of the present case and which is relevant to the sentencing decision which I must make. 
     
      
    140 Other evidence was tendered concerning the Offender’s history and background. This included a statement of Maria Pallas (Exhibit 3) who was not called to give evidence. Her statement, like that of Mrs Petroulias, used elaborate phrases which suggested that it did not contain her choice of words. The Crown submitted that I should attach no weight to the statement. I accept that submission. 
     
      
    141 I have had regard to the references tendered in the Offender’s case listed hereunder:

    142 The references demonstrate the intelligence and capacity of the Offender, who has obtained substantial tertiary qualifications which he has utilised in professional work which he has undertaken. A number of the referees spoke of the pressures upon the Offender since his arrest in 2000 and whilst the criminal proceedings have been on foot. The references speak, in positive terms of the Offender’s character. Some referees purport to express views concerning the period between 1997 and 1999 when the offences occurred. I do not consider that this material is of particular assistance for the purpose of fact finding on sentence. A real difficulty with many of the references is that the authors are not objective commentators on the Offender. Several portray him as a victim and not an offender. These referees do not appear to have grappled with the powerful body of incriminating evidence to which reference has been made earlier in these reasons. Several are clearly allies of the Offender in business and other activities. All of this affects the weight to be given to this evidence. To the extent that some referees speak of a change in attitude by the Offender since about 2005, this does not sit comfortably with the Offender’s statement to the Probation and Parole Officer in early 2008 referred to earlier. 
     
      
    143 A document entitled “Synopsis of Nick Petroulias” prepared by the Offender’s solicitor and dated 24 March 2008 was tendered (Exhibit 8). I infer that the contents of the document are the Offender’s instructions to his solicitor. The Crown submitted that no weight should be given to this document in the absence of evidence from the Offender. I accept the Crown’s submission. I bear in mind that the evidence demonstrates a pattern of deceit on the Offender’s part in 1997-1999 at the time of the offences and during the investigation. This included the suppression of information, secreting of documents and attempts to influence others as to versions to be given to investigators and the destruction of potentially incriminating evidence. All of these matters emphasise the need for care and the difficulty in relying upon an unsworn and untested biographical account emanating from the Offender.  
     
      
    144 I give this document no weight except insofar as there is evidence from the Offender’s mother, or some other reliable source, which supports any part of it: R v Qutami (2001) 127 A Crim R 369 at 377 [58]; R v Palu (2002) 134 A Crim R 174 at 184-185 [39]-[41]. This document will be treated as if it was a submission made from the bar table, on behalf of the Offender concerning his background and circumstances. 
     
      
    145 I move to the psychiatric and psychological evidence tendered in the Offender’s case. The following reports were tendered: 
     
      
    · Dr Ben Teoh (psychiatrist) dated 9 May 2008 (Exhibit 1) 
     
      
    · Dr Nathan Serry (psychiatrist) dated 20 March 2008 (Exhibit 17) 
     
      
    · Dr Nathan Serry (psychiatrist) dated 8 May 2008 (Exhibit 17) 
     
      
    · Dr Nathan Serry (psychiatrist) dated 19 May 2008 (Exhibit 17) 
     
      
    · Ms Margaret Ann Smith (psychologist) dated 11 May 2008 (Exhibit 2) 
     
      
    · Ms Margaret Ann Smith (psychologist) dated 22 May 2008 (Exhibit 5) 
     
      
    · Ms Margaret Ann Smith (psychologist) dated 28 May 2008 (Exhibit 33) 
     
      
    · Tim Watson-Munro (psychologist) dated 25 March 2008 (Exhibit 9) 
     
      
    · Tim Watson-Munro (psychologist) dated 1 May 2008 (Exhibit 10) 
     
      
    · John Taylor (psychologist) dated 12 May 2008 (Exhibit 13) 
     
      
    · Hamid Dadgostar (psychologist) dated 12 May 2008 (Exhibit 14) 
     
      
    · Dr Christopher Canaris (psychiatrist) dated 31 August 2005 (Exhibit 16) 
     
      
    · 2005 File Note of Dr Canaris (Exhibit 15) 
     
      
    146 In addition to the tender of the reports, Dr Teoh, Dr Serry, Ms Smith, Mr Watson-Munro and Mr Taylor gave oral evidence at the sentencing hearing.  
     
      
    147 The effect of the psychiatric and psychological evidence adduced for the Offender is that the Offender is said to suffer Bipolar 1 disorder and Aspergers syndrome. In addition, Dr Teoh diagnoses depression. I note that each of these psychiatrists and psychologists, with the exception of Mr Watson-Munro and Dr Canaris, examined the Offender for the first time in 2008. It appears that Mr Watson-Munro examined the Offender for the first time on 26 March 2007. Dr Canaris saw the Offender in July 2005. 
     
      
    148 No evidence has been adduced, in documentary or oral form, from a medical practitioner who has examined or treated the Offender prior to 2005, by which time the Offender was 37 years of age. There is, of course, the evidence from the Offender’s mother, but that is not accompanied by any medical evidence. Nor does Mrs Petroulias state that the Offender was subject to any medical assessment or treatment in the past. 
     
      
    149 Dr Canaris was not called in the Offender’s case. A report dated 31 August 2005 addressed to the Offender’s former solicitors was tendered (Exhibit 16). It appears, from that report, that Dr Canaris saw the Offender on 27 July 2005 and 1 August 2005. On the first occasion, the Offender was accompanied, for part of the examination, by his lawyer and, on the second occasion, he was accompanied by his partner. The report of Dr Canaris expresses the opinion that the Offender suffers from Aspergers disorder. The report refers to certain material provided to Dr Canaris which is said to contribute to that diagnosis. No mention is made in the report of any other condition, including bipolar disorder.  
     
      
    150 Dr Canaris’ file notes were tendered (Exhibit 15). Those notes record, for 27 July 2005 “possible bipolarity” and later “bipolar disorder type II - to start Lithium 250 mg twice daily. Blood tests and to come back next week”. The entry for 1 August 2005 records a discussion with the Offender’s partner - “She wonders about Aspergers”. The note states “a definite possibility, note increased co-morbidity with bipolarity, to get s Lithium done”. The next entry, for 22 February 2007, includes the note “Would like a trial of Lithium again - For Lithium Carbonate 250 mg twice daily (202 repeats)”. An entry for 28 February 2007 records “He has not filled the Lithium script - I feel in the circumstances given all the turmoil coupled with his living on his own that he would be better off without filling it. However, he seems to find it helpful to offload his burden. To come back in one week”. 
     
      
    151 The next and final note is for 12 March 2008. It states “Has [come] asking for a medico legal report. I have had to explain that I have seen him too often to be independent but not often enough to write credibly as a treating psychiatrist. He will need an independent report”. 
     
      
    152 It is somewhat puzzling that, if a diagnosis of bipolar disorder was made by Dr Canaris in 2005, he would not refer to it in his report of 31 August 2005. No explanation for this omission has been offered, as Dr Canaris has not given evidence, nor has the Offender. 
     
      
    153 Each psychiatrist and psychologist who produced a report for the sentencing hearing was provided with certain documentation which he or she was asked to assume was correct. This included the synopsis document mentioned earlier. The only material provided to them which has been adopted on oath is the statement of Mrs Petroulias, referred to earlier.  
     
      
    154 In addition, parts of statements of Mr Aivaliotes (Exhibit 11) and Mr Chow (Exhibit 12) were provided to the psychiatrists and psychologists. Reliance was placed upon Mr Aivaliotes’ description of the Offender’s speech and demeanour on 13 March 1999 when they met at Coogee Beach in circumstances described earlier in these reasons. Mr Aivaliotes described in his statement of 1 April 1999, the Offender as being agitated in speech and demeanour. Given the topic under discussion at the meeting as outlined above, this description is hardly surprising and is not, in my view, helpful to the Offender with respect to the existence of some mental disorder.  
     
      
    155 The part of Mr Chow’s statement relied upon included Mr Chow’s view that the Offender’s management style was different from the normal ATO culture, in that he was somewhat disorganised and there appeared to be no real structure. He was “very fast moving, too fast moving”. I do not consider that this statement is of particular assistance to the Offender. There was, of course, in evidence at the trial and before me a substantial body of material disclosing the intelligence, qualities and skills of the Offender over an extended period of time. I have referred earlier to Mr Killaly’s reference of June 1997. I bear in mind, of course, the meteoric rise of the Offender in the ATO in 1998 which does not suggest the existence or manifestation of any psychiatric condition which affected his capacity and judgment. It seems to me that the limited and selective material provided to the psychiatrists and psychologists is of little assistance with respect to the opinions proffered by them. 
     
      
    156 Senior Counsel for the Offender submitted that a finding should be made that the Offender suffered from bipolar disorder and Aspergers syndrome at the time of the offences, and that these conditions had affected the Offender so as to reduce his culpability. He submitted, further, that the Court should find that the Offender suffers presently from these conditions, and that this should be taken into account on sentence having regard, inter alia, to the additional hardship he will experience if sentenced to full-time imprisonment. 
     
      
    157 The Crown did not challenge the diagnoses of the Offender as suffering bipolar mood disorder and Aspergers syndrome, although noting that the diagnoses were based substantially upon a subjective history provided by the Offender or his mother. The Crown accepted that the medical evidence was sufficient to establish that the Offender suffers from a medium-to-long term condition of bipolar mood disorder, and noted that the Crown had led no evidence to the contrary. Whether, and the extent to which, the Offender suffers from Aspergers syndrome was said to be less clear. However, the Crown pointed to the cross-examination of Dr Teoh (ST107.20) as indicating that, if Aspergers syndrome exists at all, the condition is not severe.  
     
      
    158 The Crown accepted that the weight of evidence established that the Offender was currently suffering from depression, but noted that this situation was predictable given his present circumstances. The Crown submitted, however, that the course of conduct on the part of the Offender revealed by the evidence demonstrated a deliberate process of achieving a position of influence in the ATO, whereby he could advance his own business interests. The Crown submitted that, even if the Offender suffered from bipolar disorder in 1997-1999, it played no part in the commission of the offences. 
     
      
    159 The Offender bears the onus of proof with respect to the existence of bipolar disorder and Aspergers syndrome, as he contends that these matters should operate in his favour on sentence: The Queen v Olbrich. It falls to me, as the sentencing Judge, to determine whether I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Offender suffers from these conditions at the present time and whether he suffered from the conditions, or either of them, at the time of the offences.  
     
      
    160 The objective foundation for the opinions expressed by the psychiatrists and psychologists is, in my view, tenuous. I do not consider that the extracts from the statements of Mr Aivaliotes and Mr Chow advance the Offender’s case on this issue. Nor do I consider that the evidence of the Offender’s mother, when considered as a whole, assists on this question. The Offender has not given evidence himself. Other evidence adduced on sentence, including the reference material, does not, in my view, advance the Offender’s case with respect to the existence of one or other or both of these conditions. In forming this view, I have had regard to the reference of Dr Lamont, which I have considered with the rest of the evidence.  
     
      
    161 I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the Offender presently suffers from depression and has done so for some time. This is understandable given the legal process which has been on foot for some years, and the verdicts of the jury in December 2007. I am not satisfied, however, that the Offender was depressed, in any relevant sense, at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    162 Dr Teoh first saw the Offender on 16 April 2008. Dr Teoh reported that the Offender presented with a history consistent with a diagnosis of bipolar mood disorder Type 1 and Aspergers syndrome, together with depression. He has prescribed Lithium and another mood stabiliser, Olanzapine. Since late May 2008, the Offender has apparently been under Dr Teoh’s care as a patient at the Northside Clinic for treatment of bipolar mood disorder. The evidence of Dr Teoh, both written and oral, was confined to a current diagnosis of the Offender and did not purport to express any opinion concerning his mental state at the time of the offences.  
     
      
    163 Dr Serry examined the Offender once in his Victorian rooms on 20 March 2008. According to Dr Serry, the Offender’s history was said to be consistent with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. In his later reports and his oral evidence, Dr Serry purported to express opinions with respect to the Offender’s consciousness of guilt at the time of the offences. The factual material upon which these opinions were based was both thin and incomplete. In my view, no real weight can be attached to Dr Serry’s attempts to explain aspects of the Offender’s conduct at the time of the offences. No satisfactory or complete summary of the evidence in the trial was provided to Dr Serry. No attempt was made by Dr Serry to grapple with the substantial body of incriminating evidence summarised earlier in these reasons. I am not persuaded that any weight should be attached to his opinions concerning the Offender’s mental state at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    164 A number of psychologists gave oral evidence. In approaching their evidence, I keep in mind that it is important that psychologists do not cross the barrier of their expertise. It is appropriate for persons trained in the field of psychology to give evidence of the results of psychometric and other psychological testing, and to explain the relevance of those results, and their significance so far as they reveal or support the existence of brain damage or other recognised mental states or disorders. It is not, however, appropriate for them to enter into the field of psychiatry: R v Peisley (1990) 54 A Crim R 42 at 52.  
     
      
    165 Mr Watson-Munro referred to the diagnoses made by psychiatrists of bipolar mood disorder and Aspergers syndrome. With respect to Aspergers syndrome, Mr Watson-Munro suggested that the Offender had exhibited a range of eccentric behaviour including the development of a fixation on peculiar topics, such as American presidents. The foundation for this appeared to be part of the statement of the Offender’s mother who said the Offender “knew all there was about American presidents”. In evidence, Mr Watson-Munro (understandably) stepped back from his reliance upon an interest in American presidents as being indicative of Aspergers syndrome (ST172). With respect, this was drawing a long bow. At one point in oral evidence, Mr Watson-Munro spoke in terms of “errors of judgment” on the Offender’s part (ST168). Once again, he stepped back from that characterisation when informed that the jury had found impropriety on the Offender’s part. I attach little weight to Mr Watson-Munro’s opinion which attempted to, in some way, relate the Offender’s possible conditions to the events between 1997 and 1999. With respect, Mr Watson-Munro had a slight, almost non-existent, understanding of the evidence adduced at the trial which was strongly adverse to the Offender. 
     
      
    166 Mr Taylor administered a number of tests to the Offender. He reported that the results of the tests administered did not indicate that he had a personality disorder. He was assessed as being severely depressed at the present time (12 May 2008). Mr Taylor observed that his test results, together with the history provided and documents made available, were consistent in indicating that the Offender suffered from bipolar disorder and Aspergers syndrome. Particular emphasis was placed upon the depression from which the Offender was said to be suffering. Mr Taylor did not attempt to express an opinion concerning the Offender’s mental state at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    167 Ms Smith provided a series of reports and gave oral evidence on two occasions. Whilst acknowledging Ms Smith’s academic qualifications, I note that her reports for this case constitute the first report she has prepared for court proceedings since 1984 (ST126.16). She has a very limited clinical practice, confined to pro bono work (ST126.11, 141-142). She interviewed the Offender for the first time on 21 May 2008 for one hour. She examined a number of documents and reports which had been tendered for the Offender on sentence. Based upon the material and her interview with the Offender, she supported the diagnosis of bipolar 1 disorder and Aspergers syndrome. Ms Smith accepted that it was not the role of a psychologist to diagnose mental illness, and she said that she did not intend to diagnose psychiatric disorders or illness in the Offender (ST136-137).  
     
      
    168 At the completion of the sentencing hearing on 23 May 2008, I indicated to counsel that I would be assisted by submissions dealing with factual matters raised in my judgment R (Cth) v Petroulias (No. 34) at [32] and following (ST182-183). The hearing was adjourned until 28 May 2008. On that day, a further report of Ms Smith was tendered (Exhibit 33) and Ms Smith was recalled (ST218ff). The supplementary report of Ms Smith indicated that she had been provided with my Judgments Nos. 29 and 30 and asked to express opinions as to whether the Offender’s illness had substantially contributed to the offences in the period 1997 to 1999. Ms Smith purported to express opinions favourable to the Offender by reference to my judgments.  
     
      
    169 However, as mentioned earlier in these reasons, Judgment No. 29 related to the Crown application for leave to cross-examine Mr Aivaliotes as an unfavourable witness under s.38 Evidence Act 1995. In my view, no part of that judgment concerning the conduct of the Offender could assist, in any objective way, an assessment of the Offender’s mental state at the time of the offences. The judgment deals with changes of evidence by Mr Aivaliotes. Ms Smith fastened on one paragraph in Judgment No. 29, which was said to be supportive of the proposition that the Offender was in a manic phase of illness at the relevant time. In my view, no reasonable and balanced assessment of this judgment could lead to this opinion. When tested concerning this issue, Ms Smith accepted as a possibility that she could have “over-interpreted some of the material” provided to her (ST227.36).  
     
      
    170 Ms Smith expressed opinions favourable to the Offender which were said to arise from an examination of Judgment No. 30. This judgment related to a defence application for a directed verdict of acquittal. In my view, no part of this judgment contained any summary of evidence which could provide any sensible foundation for an opinion concerning the Offender’s mental state at the time of the offences.  
     
      
    171 Ms Smith’s supplementary report of 28 May 2008 (Exhibit 33), at page 3, asserted that Judgment No. 30 (of 8 October 2007) “provides greater details of the category of ‘consciousness of guilt’ that I referred to in my reports which sought to analyse the categories of offensive behaviour - including the ‘Nick to Nick’ letter where Mr Petroulias is seeking to warn and protect the parties concerned of the investigation”. Ms Smith continued in the report “His behaviour at this point is consistent with the depressive phase of the condition where he is acting out of delusions about his prior behaviour, has deep shame and anxiety and believe they are to blame for all that is happening to everyone around them”. 
     
      
    172 However, there was no reference to the “Nick to Nick letter” in Judgment 30. When asked about this, Ms Smith accepted that this was not referred to in Judgment 30, and that she had been provided with this information verbally from a Defence solicitor (ST238). 
     
      
    173 Ms Smith was provided with Judgment No. 34, which reproduced the “Nick to Nick letter”, before entering the witness box on 28 May 2008. Having seen it for the first time then, she purported to express opinions favourable to the Offender by reference to the document. The Crown submitted that the oral evidence of Ms Smith and her supplementary report of 28 May 2008, should be disregarded. The Crown submitted that there was clearly no factual justification for the opinions expressed and that her evidence was, in the words of the Crown, “unconditionally biased” in favour of the Offender. The Crown submitted that Ms Smith’s evidence served the useful purpose of highlighting the fallacy of endeavouring to attribute the conduct of the Offender to his mood disorder.  
     
      
    174 I accept the Crown submissions concerning Ms Smith’s evidence of 28 May 2008 and her supplementary report. In my view, she overstepped the boundary of proper expert evidence by a significant degree. I make due allowance for the fact that Ms Smith had not prepared a report for court proceedings for 24 years. Her first report did not advert to the Expert Code of Conduct, despite the necessity for such a reference under Part 75 r 3J Supreme Court Rules. It is not the function of an expert witness to express opinions favourable to the party calling the witness, irrespective of the existence or otherwise of an objective foundation for the opinion. In my view, no weight whatsoever should be attached to the evidence of Ms Smith in these proceedings, except insofar as she speaks of her academic knowledge of the nature of bipolar mood disorder. In my view, Ms Smith has over-interpreted factual material in a gross fashion in this case, so that the Court can attach no real weight to her evidence which, under the Expert Code of Conduct, is intended to serve the primary function of assisting the Court in discharge of the expert’s duty to the Court. 
     
      
    175 I summarise my findings with respect to the psychiatric and psychological evidence in the following way. I am satisfied that the Offender suffers from depression, and has done so for some time. I accept that this has been contributed to by the protracted proceedings against him, culminating in the verdicts of the jury convicting him of two serious offences.  
     
      
    176 I am not satisfied that the Offender suffers, or has suffered, from Aspergers syndrome. The factual foundation underlying this opinion is, in my view, tenuous. There is very little, if any, sworn evidence of factual matters which would provide a proper evidentiary foundation for such a diagnosis. If, however, the Offender does suffer from Aspergers syndrome, then it is a very mild form of the disorder at most. 
     
      
    177 The evidence which is said to provide an objective foundation for a diagnosis of bipolar mood disorder is somewhat confusing. I do not consider that the evidence of the Offender’s mother provides any real foundation for this diagnosis. Other historical or anecdotal material, all of which is unsworn, does not in my view assist the diagnosis. The small portions of statements of Mr Aivaliotes and Mr Chow which have been referred to do not, in my view, assist the Offender on this issue.  
     
      
    178 A confusing picture emerges with respect to the role of Dr Canaris in 2005. Although bipolar disorder is referred to in the file notes of Dr Canaris, it is not mentioned at all in the detailed report provided on 31 August 2005 to the Offender’s then solicitors. An available inference is that, although bipolar disorder was raised as a possibility by Dr Canaris, he did not in fact diagnose it, and thus did not refer to it in that report. The Offender did not call Dr Canaris in the sentencing hearing. There is a curious file note from March 2008 which seems to suggest (for reasons that are difficult to understand) that Dr Canaris refused to provide a report, in any capacity, for the Offender. 
     
      
    179 The Court is left with the evidence of Dr Teoh, who has been treating the Offender since 16 April 2008, and Dr Serry who saw the Offender on one occasion in March 2008. Beyond that, there is the evidence of psychologists which, in reality, repeats what has been said by the psychiatrists. In my view, they do not materially add to the diagnoses. 
     
      
    180 It is the fact that Dr Teoh has been treating the Offender for some two months for bipolar mood disorder, including prescription of Lithium. This treatment has included inpatient treatment at Northside Clinic. Although I am well satisfied that the Offender is presently depressed and has been for some time, I am not presently satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that he suffers from bipolar mood disorder. If he does, I do not consider that the condition is severe.  
     
      
    181 I am certainly not satisfied, if the Offender has suffered from bipolar mood disorder, that it played any part in the commission of the offences for which he is to be sentenced. 
     
      
    182 The conduct of the Offender which gives rise to the convictions involved a deliberate course of conduct over an extended period of time. He was a well-educated and highly trained professional person. He was promoted several times in 1998, reaching one of the highest positions within the ATO. The fact that he was promoted to that position is powerful evidence of the assessment by those around him that he was a capable, intelligent and resourceful person. I am satisfied that he was each of those things. However, he utilised these skills for criminal purposes. He engaged in significant and sustained impropriety, involving abuse of trust and misuse of his senior office in the ATO.  
     
      
    183 I am satisfied that the Offender’s conduct between 1997 and 1999 was well-planned and motivated by self-gain, that is greed. It was not clouded, in any respect, by any health problem that he may have had. Accordingly, although there is current evidence suggesting psychiatric issues surrounding the Offender, which I will take into account in passing sentence, none of these matters bear upon his culpability for the serious crimes for which he has been convicted by the jury. 
     
      
       
      Application for Psychiatric Probation Order 
       
      
    184 Upon the basis of the psychiatric evidence adduced in the sentencing proceedings, Senior Counsel for the Offender submitted that a psychiatric probation order under s.20BV Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) ought be made in this case. Section 20BV(1) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Where a person is convicted in a State or Territory of a federal offence and the court is satisfied that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person is suffering from a mental illness within the meaning of the civil law of that State or Territory, and 
           
           
          (b) the illness contributed to the commission of the offence by the person; and 
           
           
          (c) appropriate psychiatric treatment for the person is available in a hospital or other place in the State or Territory; and 
           
           
          (d) the person consents to the order being made,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          the court may, without passing sentence on the person, make an order (in this section called a  
          psychiatric probation order 
          ) that the person reside at, or attend at, a specified hospital or other place for the purpose of receiving that psychiatric treatment.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    185 It was submitted for the Offender that such an order ought be made upon the basis of the evidence before the Court. The Crown submitted that the evidence did not satisfy, at the least, the requirements in s.20BV(1)(a) and (b) of the Act. In any event, the Crown submitted that the nature of the Offender’s crimes were such that an order under the section would not be appropriate. 
     
      
    186 I am not satisfied that an order under the section should be made. Firstly, the evidence does not satisfy me that the Offender is suffering from a “mental illness” within the meaning of the civil law of New South Wales, relevantly the Mental Health Act 2007. No psychiatrist has expressed the opinion that the Offender satisfies the test of “mental illness” under that Act. There was passing reference to s.20BV in the report of Mr Taylor (Exhibit 13, page 10). Ms Smith’s first report (Exhibit 5, page 3) purported to provide an opinion that the Offender met the criteria for mental illness in 1997-1998 as defined in the Mental Health Act 1990. However, Ms Smith acknowledged that she was not purporting to cross the line between psychology and psychiatry and diagnose an illness or disorder in the Offender. Further, for reasons explained above, I am not prepared to attach any weight to the opinions of Ms Smith with respect to the Offender. Accordingly, there is no evidence to satisfy the Court that the Offender meets the requirements of s.20BV(1)(a) of the Act. 
     
      
    187 Further, even if the Offender was suffering at present from a “mental illness”, I am not satisfied that any illness contributed to the commission of the offences for which he is presently before the Court. Once again, my reasons for this conclusion are expressed above. Even if the Offender had mental health issues of some type in 1997-1998 (and I am not so satisfied), I am certainly not satisfied that any such issues contributed to the commission of the present offences. 
     
      
    188 It may be that appropriate psychiatric treatment is available to the Offender through Dr Teoh in a hospital (s.20BV(1)(c)). I was informed by his Counsel that the Offender consented to an order being made (s.20BV(1)(d)). However, it is clear that the statutory preconditions for a psychiatric probation order have not been met. I decline to make such an order. 
     
      
       
      Potential For Summary Disposal of Second and Third Counts 
       
      
    189 The Offender submitted that the Court should take into account on sentence the possibility that the second and third counts could have been disposed of summarily in the Local Court. It was submitted that it was the first count which had been the lead count on the indictment throughout, and which had rendered it necessary that all three counts be tried on indictment. The Crown submitted that, given the nature and gravity of the offences alleged in all three counts, the prosecution of the Offender was always going to proceed on indictment and that the theoretical possibility of summary disposal of the second and third counts was not a factor to be taken into account in the Offender’s favour on sentence. 
     
      
    190 I do not consider that the theoretical possibility of summary disposal of the second and third counts bears on the question of sentence in this case. No application was made for these matters to be dealt with summarily. They could only have been dealt with summarily if both the prosecutor and the defence consented: s.4J(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Having regard to the overall seriousness with which the second and third counts were regarded, the Crown submitted that prosecution consent to summary disposal would never have been forthcoming. I agree with this submission.  
     
      
    191 In my view, the nature of these prosecutions, even if confined theoretically to prosecution of the second and third counts only, would always have been regarded, in the proper exercise of prosecutorial discretion, as appropriate matters for prosecution on indictment: R v Gent (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at 47 [86]. This is especially so given that, if the second and third counts had been dealt with summarily, the maximum penalty available would have been confined to 12 months’ imprisonment on each count. Having regard to the objective criminality involved in the second and third counts, I do not consider that the theoretical possibility of summary disposal can be called in aid by the Offender on sentence.  
     
      
    192 I note, in this respect, that it was not submitted at the sentencing hearing that the Offender had ever offered a plea of guilty to the second and third counts, if the Crown determined not to proceed with the first count. In reality, given the objective criminality involved and the high office held by the offender at the time of the offences, these matters were always destined to be prosecuted on indictment. 
     
      
       
      Applicable Principles Under s.16A  
      Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) 
       
      
    193 In determining the sentence to be passed on the Offender for these offences, the Court must impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence: s.16A(1). It is necessary for me to take into account matters contained within s.16A(2) as are relevant and known to the Court. 
     
      
    194 I take into account the nature and circumstances of the offences: s.16A(2)(a). I have made findings concerning the offences committed by the Offender. I am satisfied that each offence was of a very high order of objective gravity. The offence in the second count proceeded over a considerable period of time and the offending conduct did not cease until the offences were detected. 
     
      
    195 The conduct of the Offender, in the second count, involved gross impropriety on his part, continuing over many months and involving an obvious and actual conflict of interest. The Offender well knew, at the time, that what he was doing was wrong. His deceit during the course of the offence, and his acts to conceal the true facts and to direct others to take action to conceal the true facts, provides clear evidence of the Offender’s consciousness of his wrongdoing. At the time of the offences, the Offender was rising quickly in seniority within the ATO, ultimately occupying one of the highest positions in the ATO. The then Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, appointed the Offender to a high and responsible office, clearly unaware of the Offender’s betrayal of trust which had been happening for some months, and continued. This is not a case of corrupt conduct by a junior officer within the Public Service, on an isolated occasion.  
     
      
    196 I am satisfied that the present case involves planned acts of corrupt conduct, carried out over a lengthy period, by a very senior officer to whom others in the organisation were entitled to expect was a model of probity. Where a high official engages in corrupt conduct, the damage to the public fabric is substantial. The Offender’s conviction on the second count is such a case. 
     
      
    197 I am satisfied that the conviction on the third count involves the commission of a most serious offence under the section. The secrecy provisions under tax legislation operate to ensure that information provided to the ATO, including material obtained by use of compulsory powers, is confined to its proper public use within the ATO. I am satisfied that the material contained in the client lists, provided by the Offender to Mr Morgan, had been obtained by use of the ATO’s statutory powers. Although it may not have been sensitive personal information about taxpayers, it was material gathered by the Offender, and provided to Mr Morgan, to be used for commercial gain and to give the Offender’s business interests a marketing edge over competitors. I am satisfied that this was a flagrant breach of the duty of an officer within the ATO to maintain secrecy over information obtained in the course of his duties.  
     
      
    198 I am satisfied that these two offences are very close to the worst cases of crimes of this type: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447 at 451-452. 
     
      
    199 I am required to consider the degree to which the Offender has shown contrition for the offence: s.16A(2)(f). I am satisfied that the Offender has not demonstrated contrition at all for the offences. As demonstrated by his explanation to the Probation and Parole Officer, the Offender does not accept that there was any impropriety or deceit on his part in the conduct giving rise to his conviction on the second and third counts. 
     
      
    200 The offences occurred between 1997 and 1999. The Offender was arrested on 24 March 2000. The committal proceedings proceeded over 37 hearing dates between 5 November 2001 and 17 July 2002. Appellate proceedings flowed from the committal proceedings. A trial proceeded, without verdict in 2005, and then two trials in 2007 before a jury convicted the Offender on the second and third counts in December 2007. 
     
      
    201 A person charged with a criminal offence is entitled to plead not guilty, and defend himself, without thereby attracting the risk of the imposition of a penalty more serious than would otherwise have been imposed: Siganto v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 565 at 663 [22]. However, the Offender is not entitled to any leniency which may flow from a finding of contrition or remorse. Nor, of course, was there a plea of guilty which would attract a discount on sentence. 
     
      
    202 The Court should have regard to specific deterrence of the Offender: s.16A(2)(j). It was submitted for the Offender that he had lost his future career with the ATO as a direct result of his involvement in the arrangements and conviction, and that specific deterrence, with regard to his functioning as a Commonwealth officer, had been achieved. It was submitted that his professional future has been effectively destroyed and that this bears upon specific deterrence.  
     
      
    203 The Offender’s loss of a future career within the ATO was an inevitable and necessary consequence of his corrupt conduct involving abuse of trust whilst working within the ATO. I take into account the fact that appointment to pubic office is not likely to happen again. I do take into account the likely professional consequences of the Offender’s convictions for these serious crimes.  
     
      
    204 A difficulty for the Offender in the area of specific deterrence flows from his refusal to acknowledge his clear and gross wrongdoing. An offender who acknowledges wrongdoing, and has some insight into his offending, may attract a lesser element of specific deterrence. However, despite the Offender’s clear impropriety and deceit during the period when the offences were committed and the investigatory aftermath, the Offender lacks any insight into his criminal conduct. I am satisfied that a significant element of specific deterrence is appropriate in his case. 
     
      
    205 In forming this view, I have taken into account the medical evidence adduced in the sentencing hearing. I do not consider that the medical evidence, to the extent to which I have accepted it, operates to reduce the appropriateness of specific deterrence with respect to the Offender. 
     
      
    206 The Court must take into account the need to ensure that the Offender is adequately punished for the offences: s.16A(2)(k). I have regard to this factor, and propose to pass sentences which, in my view, will fulfil the requirement in s.16A(1) and also ensure that the Offender is adequately punished for his serious crimes. 
     
      
    207 The Court must have regard to the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the Offender: s.16A(2)(m). The Offender has no prior criminal history. Some of the reference material is relevant on sentence to his prior good character. However, the weight to be given to evidence of good character on sentence depends, to an extent, on the character of the offence committed: R v Gent at 41 [51]. Less weight is attached to prior good character with respect to white-collar offences, where it has been observed that such crimes are rarely committed by people who have a criminal history: R v Gent at 43 [59]. In my view, the Offender’s prior good character is of limited assistance to him on sentence. It may be taken that prior good character was a prerequisite to his appointment and elevation to high office within the ATO. He came to occupy a senior office, being a position of trust and responsibility, because he was meant to be a person of good character. In this way, he could not have been in a position to commit these serious offences if he was not a person of good character. In these circumstances, this factor provides little assistance to him. He stands to be sentenced for offences of serious impropriety and breach of trust in the exercise of his public office. 
     
      
    208 The Offender’s antecedents involve tertiary qualifications at a high level, which equipped him to obtain high office within the ATO. I do not consider that this assists the Offender on sentence. 
     
      
    209 The Offender was aged between 29 and 31 years at the time of the offences. He is now 40 years of age. He was promoted to high office at a relatively young age, no doubt because of the perception of those around him that he was capable, reliable and trustworthy. He acted improperly and abused the position of trust which he occupied from the time when he was a consultant to the ATO through to the time when he was elevated to the position of First Assistant Commissioner and beyond. His age, then or now, does not assist him on sentence. 
     
      
    210 There is some material before the Court, in the presentence report and the reference material, which points to the Offender having expended large sums of money in his defence so that he is now heavily in debt. There is no evidence from the Offender in this respect, but it seems clear that his defence of these proceedings over the years has involved considerable expenditure of funds. I take this into account on sentence. 
     
      
    211 I have already adverted to evidence concerning the mental condition of the Offender. I accept that he is presently depressed and has been for some time. I am not satisfied that he presently suffers from other mental disorders but, if I am wrong in that respect, I consider, at its highest, the evidence points to a mild form of bipolar disorder and an even milder form of Aspergers syndrome. I take into account that the Offender’s present health may serve to increase the hardship of a sentence of full-time imprisonment, but that consideration is limited by the necessity of maintaining proper standards of punishment: R v Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570 at 573-574. I have regard to the fact that medical services are available through Justice Health, the functions of which include the provision of health services to offenders in custody: s.236A Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999. I proceed to sentence upon the basis that medical services will be available to the Offender in custody, albeit not necessarily of a type that may be available to him in the general community. 
     
      
    212 The Court must have regard to the prospect of rehabilitation of the Offender: s.16A(2)(n). Given that the Offender does not accept his guilt of the crimes, nor acknowledge impropriety or wrongdoing, an assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation is not without its difficulties. He has demonstrated a tendency to deflect blame to others for his own wrongdoing. Nevertheless, there is a reasonable prospect that the Offender may be able to reconstruct his life at a future time, so as to be able to live in the community without the commission of offences. 
     
      
    213 General deterrence must also be taken into account in determining the sentences to be passed on the Offender: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370 at 378. I am satisfied that general deterrence is an important factor on sentence in this case. It is necessary to impose sentences upon the Offender which demonstrate the gravity with which the law regards corruption by a public officer occupying a senior position of trust. It is necessary, in my view, that a strong message be sent through the sentences to be imposed upon this Offender to others in public office that criminal abuse of trust of this type will be met by heavy sentences. I do not consider that the Offender’s current mental health issues render him an unsuitable, or less suitable, vehicle for application of the principle of general deterrence. 
     
      
    214 I have regard to the delay between 2000 and today, and the effects of that delay, on the Offender. I also have regard to the lengthy period for which the Offender has been subject to bail conditions and the extended periods when he has been required to attend Court for his trials. 
     
      
       
      The Related Offence Under s.166  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
       
      
    215 A related offence is before the Court, alleging theft by the Offender of ATO documents under s.30 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). This charge was referred to this Court from the Local Court pursuant to the related charge provisions in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. The charge relates to an allegation that the Offender stole a number of ATO documents which were located in the Melbourne storage unit.  
     
      
    216 Having heard submissions during the sentencing hearing with respect to this related charge, I indicated that the appropriate course was to remit the matter to the Local Court under s.169 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (ST48). I formed that view having heard that the matter would be defended, and that evidence additional to that adduced in the trial would be required. The parties were not ready to proceed to a hearing of the related offence, and I determined that it was inappropriate to delay the sentencing hearing further for that to be done. The Crown asked that the matter be remitted to the Local Court and the Defence did not advance a contrary submission.  
     
      
    217 I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice, for the purpose of s.169 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, that the related charge be remitted to the Local Court and I will so order. 
     
      
       
      Determining Appropriate Sentences 
       
      
    218 The proper and impartial administration of the tax laws is critical to the operation of our federal system of government. The law vests substantial powers in those exercising these important functions. Those powers are accompanied by important responsibilities, including the duty to serve the public and to maintain confidentiality according to law. By his crimes, the Offender has betrayed the trust and responsibility vested in him. He has damaged the public fabric of our community by undermining confidence in the fair and impartial administration of the tax system.  
     
      
    219 The Offender acted in this way for personal gain. There was a clear and obvious conflict between public duty and private interest which presented itself starkly to the Offender over many months between 1997 and 1999. He engaged in a course of conduct which involved gross impropriety and abuse of trust motivated by personal gain. 
     
      
    220 These offences involve a very high order of objective gravity. There are few subjective factors which operate in the Offender’s favour on sentence. His prior good character is of little assistance given that it was a qualification for the positions which he occupied and abused. He has not demonstrated contrition. The length of time that the proceedings have been on foot has no doubt taken its toll on him. I accept that his present health is affected by depression arising from the criminal proceedings and, in particular, his conviction by a jury of serious crimes. Specific deterrence and, in particular, general deterrence ought play a significant part on penalty.  
     
      
    221 The Court shall not impose a sentence of imprisonment on a federal offender unless it is satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate in all the circumstances of the case: s.17A(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). I am satisfied that no other sentence is appropriate for these offences and this Offender having regard to the findings made in these reasons and in particular, the objective gravity of his crimes. I am satisfied that no sentence short of full-time imprisonment is appropriate in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    222 The Offender is to be sentenced to imprisonment for two offences. I must have regard to the principles concerning accumulation, concurrency and totality. The offences contained in the second and third counts involved different aspects of the same course of criminal conduct committed by the Offender. I am satisfied, however, that entirely concurrent sentences are not appropriate.  
     
      
    223 The second count involved gross impropriety on the part of the Offender in the performance of his duties over an extended period. The third count involved a grave breach of the specific confidentiality requirements which bound the Offender as a Commonwealth officer. As stated earlier, I am satisfied that the information published by the Offender to Mr Morgan, in breach of the confidentiality requirement, was itself information which had been gathered through the use of compulsory powers of the ATO. The information had been gathered for use by the Offender, and his associates, to advance his own commercial interests to the detriment of his business competitors.  
     
      
    224 Having regard to all factors bearing on the question of sentence, both objective and subjective, I am satisfied that a sentence for imprisonment for one year and nine months should be passed with respect to the second count, the s.73 offence. A sentence of imprisonment for one year and eight months ought be imposed for the third count, the s.70 offence.  
     
      
    225 I am satisfied that the sentences ought be served as partly cumulative sentences giving rise to a total head sentence of three years and two months’ imprisonment. As the sentences for the two offences, in the aggregate, exceed three years, it is necessary to either fix a single non-parole period in respect of the sentences or make a recognizance release order: s.19AB(1) Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
    226 I am satisfied that the appropriate course is to set a single non-parole period of two years to date from today. I am satisfied that this is the minimum period that the Offender should spend in prison having regard to all the elements of punishment, including the objective seriousness of his crimes, specific and general deterrence, denunciation and the Offender’s subjective circumstances: R v MA (2004) 145 A Crim R 434 at 440-441 [33]-[34]. 
     
      
    227 Nikytas Nicholas Petroulias, in relation to each of the counts of which you have been found guilty by a jury, you are convicted. In relation to the second count (the s.73 offence), I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of one year and nine months to date from 20 June 2008 and to expire on 19 March 2010. In relation to the third count (the s.70 offence), I sentence you to imprisonment for a term of one year and eight months to date from 20 December 2009 and to expire on 19 August 2011. The overall term is accordingly one of imprisonment for three years and two months commencing on 20 June 2008.  
     
      
    228 I fix a non-parole period of two years to date from 20 June 2008 and to expire on 19 June 2010.  
     
      
    229 I am required by law to explain to you the effect of this sentencing order. You need to understand that the effect of that order is that you will serve a period of imprisonment of not less than two years and, if a parole order is made on or after 19 June 2010, you will also serve a period in the community, called the parole period, under supervision, so as to complete the overall sentence of three years and two months. If a parole order is made, it will be subject to conditions, and it may be amended or revoked. In particular, it may be revoked if you fail without reasonable excuse to fulfil those conditions, in which event you may be returned into custody, pending further review and possible re-release, depending upon your behaviour and response to any rehabilitation opportunities which may be offered while you are in custody. 
     
      
    230 Pursuant to s.169 Criminal Procedure Act 1986, I order that the related offence under s.30 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) be remitted to the Local Court. 
     
      
    231 I direct that a copy of the report of the Offender’s treating psychiatrist, Dr Ben Teoh of 9 May 2008 (Exhibit 1), together with a copy of my remarks on sentence be placed in a sealed envelope and addressed to the Nursing Unit Manager of the Corrections Centre to which the Offender is to be taken as a result of the sentences which have just been passed.

      2007/3376 REGINA v Grace SOON 
       
       
       
      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Grace Soon, upon an indictment charging you with the murder of Stephen Chin, you pleaded not guilty but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea of guilty in discharge of the indictment and you have been convicted of manslaughter accordingly. The evidence shows that the Crown’s position was founded upon an acceptance that at the time of killing, your relevant capacities were substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind. That such a situation may reduce what otherwise would be murder to manslaughter is recognized and made expressly available by legislation. I proceed on the basis that your culpability for manslaughter is in that category. 
     
      
    2 There has been put before the Court a volume of material adverting to matters of history which occurred prior to the killing as well as professional opinion concerning your level of culpability. I will later make reference to some of this. 
     
      
    3 You were born on 27 May 1937 and are therefore now aged 71 years. You were married in Singapore on 27 April 1967 to Stephen Chin whose date of birth was 4 April 1943. In an interview with police on 5 September 2006 you said that you were “Twenty something” when you married and that you have been separated from Stephen Chin for “about ten years”. A considerable amount of information has been presented in terms which are vague or approximate and it should be appreciated that these have necessarily become reflected in some of these remarks. 
     
      
    4 From early 1999 you and your husband lived in different houses. Over the decade preceding that, you and he had lived separately but within the same premises. On 30 January 1999 Stephen Chin was rendered quadriplegic. The evidence is that he and another person were attempting to engage in a sexual act which involved unusual physicality. Stephen Chin fell a short distance and, in lay terms, he thereby broke his neck. As at September 2006 he was residing alone in one half of a pair of semi-detached cottages. He was dependent upon carers who attended him on a roster. They attended first thing in the morning, then for cleaning the premises, for lunch, to cook the evening meal, to empty his catheter bag and finally to put him to bed late at night. It was estimated that carers would call on about five occasions each day. Mr Chin was incapable of performing for himself most of the ordinary activities of daily life and, significantly, that of transferring himself from his bed.  
     
      
    5 On 4 September 2006 at about 6 am you went to his residence with two cans of petrol. You poured the contents of one of these onto the front fence and threw the other through Mr Chin’s bedroom window and you set fire to the premises. The sound of burning material awakened the neighbour in the adjoining residence and she called the emergency services. Passing motorists stopped, one of them being a constable of police, in order to see if they could render assistance. They could not. The Fire Brigade arrived and had to force entry into the locked premises. They found the deceased in his bed from which, as I have said, he was unable to rise unaided. The post mortem report described the cause of death as “burns.” 
     
      
    6 I shall refer to psychiatric opinion about your mental impairment in due course but I specify that I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you were aware of your actions in starting the fire, that you intended to kill Stephen Chin thereby and that you knew that in his condition he would be unable to save himself from the conflagration. I am satisfied to a similar degree that your motive was to prevent him from pursuing a claim for settlement on him of any of your property as an ancillary to divorce proceedings. 
     
      
    7 The killing did not emerge from a spontaneous outburst of passion and you made plans to carry it out. Over the preceding month you were seen several times in the vicinity of his home and, when spoken to by neighbours, you gave false explanations for your presence. On one occasion you entered the residence and spoke to your husband seeking to persuade him in effect to cease having solicitors act for him in relation to the property settlement. A prime purpose in some other attendances was to inform yourself about the comings and goings of the carers so that you could set the fire in their absence.  
     
      
    8 You went to a shop in the Eastgardens Centre and purchased the portable petrol cans and went yourself to a service station to fill them. It was the usual custom for your son Eugene who resided with you to attend to routine filling of the tanks of his and your cars and your action in filling the cans is another indication of the deliberateness that you applied to the commission of the crime. You even wrote a reminder note to “buy petrol”.  
     
      
    9 On 5 September 2006 you went to Mascot Police Station in response to a request for interview. You were initially informed that you were not under arrest. At that time, this was correct. You denied any relevant knowledge about the fire and gave a detailed but false description of movements on the morning on which it occurred. You either denied or said that you could not remember encounters with some of Mr Chin’s neighbours. You prevaricated about your purpose for being there in respect of the one occasion which you admitted. The text of the record of interview with police shows an ability verbally to spar with the officers, seeking details about the content of questions and exercising your right not to comment or declining to answer concerning some topics.  
     
      
    10 In response to a direct question whether there was a property settlement attached to the divorce proceedings, which you had mentioned to police you said “Not that I know of. It hasn’t started yet”. The prospect of property settlement was uppermost in your mind and in fact inspired your crime. That answer was intentionally deceitful. However you did tell police that the deceased wanted some of your assets. You declined to tell police what the extent of your assets was. You said without offering detail that you had recently inherited some money from your parents. 
     
      
    11 It is convenient to interpolate some comment about apparent assets. Stephen Chin had been declared bankrupt in October 2004. His home was rented from the Housing Commission. A letter from his solicitors to your solicitors declared his total assets at the time to be $6,559. Your assets are not detailed. There is no information about the size of the inheritance which you mentioned to police. There are oblique references to palm oil plantations in Malaysia apparently managed by your brother for a corporation identified as Soon Moon Seng Realty. Soon Moon Seng was your father who died in 2004. Your mother is in a nursing home here in Sydney and the fees are said to be paid for by your brother but I do not know the source of the funds. Your son Eugene, who does not presently engage in employment, described himself on one occasion to policemen as an investor and he told them that you had some shares in “the company”. I note references to several companies but the abovementioned was the only one identified. In evidence he said that no dividends were received. Your son Eugene apparently owns two properties which are let to rental.  
     
      
    12 An “auto titles” search at the Office of the Registrar General in Sydney revealed six properties in the name of Hwee Teong Soon. You are that proprietor. There are eight entries since 1971 in the same name in the purchasers index. That name is a non anglicised form of your name and I do not suggest that its use in lieu of Grace Soon was intended to disguise anything. Your son Eugene is also known as Chin Teck Meng.  
     
      
    13 It was said that some of your property was subject to mortgage but I was given no specific information in that regard. You declined to discuss your assets with police but your son estimated your nett worth to be in excess of $1 million, that his own worth was approximately $600,000 but he commented that, if you took away the house which his grandfather gave to you, you would not be “a millionaire”. He described his grandfather as very rich and a source from which the deceased was able to be, by you, rescued from business ineptitude, profligacy and on one occasion from facing charges for defrauding the social security system.  
     
      
    14 The initial interview with police concluded at 5.12 pm. At 6.47 pm a further interview was commenced. In the interim you had been placed under arrest and cautioned in the usual way. In the course of this second interview you were shown closed circuit television footage from the Big W store at Eastgardens, which had been taken on 28 August 2006. The film showed you leaving the store with the petrol cans. You attempted to “brazen it out”. You claimed not to recognize yourself and asserted that the image did not look like you. You were then taken to a larger television screen and again shown the footage and you responded to police that “it could not be me”.  
     
      
    15 Police then produced a relevant receipt. You declined to sign it certifying it as a document which you were then shown. You declined voluntarily to provide your fingerprints, DNA sample or photographs and you asked whether you had an option about participating in a line-up and on being told that you did not have to, you also declined that. I am not suggesting that you did not have these rights to decline but I mention them to stress that you were far from being overborne by the police officers, whose conduct could not be criticized, and to contrast your obvious capacities shortly after committing the offence with some of your later presentations of seeming ineptitude, particularly when being seen by psychiatric examiners. 
     
      
    16 In this second police interview you continued to deny any involvement in the killing. 
     
      
    17 I am satisfied however that you came to realize that the evidence which the detectives had assembled would overwhelmingly demonstrate your guilt. As Detective Chambers was about to escort you from the interview room, you grasped his arm and said “Wait, sit down, I want to talk about it some more.” He waited and you sat silently in the room. He then said “What do you want to talk about?” Your response was to say “I want to negotiate.” 
     
      
    18 The continuing exchange between you and him should be recited. There was no challenge to Detective Chambers’ description of what transpired and in the following quotation it is Detective Chambers who is referred to in the first person. The exchange was: 
     
      
       
        
        “I said, ‘I’m not sure what you mean, negotiate what? 
        
       
       
        
        She said, ‘Tell me again, what will happen now?’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘You will wait in the charge room, while I complete some paperwork. Then you will be charged and you will go to Court tomorrow.’ 
        
       
       
        
        The accused sat silently. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘Is that all?’ 
        
       
       
        
        She said, ‘How much will this cost?’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘I don’t know.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Again the accused sat silently. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘Okay Grace, can you please come with me.’ 
        
       
       
        
        She said, ‘What if I confess?’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘You will still be charged and you will still be going to Court tomorrow.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Again the accused sat silently. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused pointed to the audio cassettes on the table and said, ‘Can we cancel that interview?’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘No.’ 
        
       
       
        
        The accused sat in her chair looking at me for a moment. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘Were you involved in Stephen’s murder?’ 
        
       
       
        
        She paused for a while and said, ‘Yes.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘What happened?’ 
        
       
       
        
        She paused for a while and said, ‘There are two tins of petrol, I take one tin and pour petrol on the wooden fence at the front, I forget what it’s called and I light it with a match, and the other one I threw inside his bedroom window.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘Why did you do that?’ 
        
       
       
        
        She said, ‘He is coming after my property, I worked so hard to save my money and now he is coming after my property.’ 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘Are you prepared to participate in a further interview?’ 
        
       
       
        
        She said, ‘Yes, but can we cancel that one.’ The accused pointed to the audio cassettes on the table from the previous interview. 
        
       
       
        
        I said, ‘No that interview is evidence. But if you want to do another interview we can get a new set of tapes and conduct a further interview with you.’ 
        
       
       
        
        She said, ‘Yes, okay.’” 
        
       
      
    19 A third formal interview was then undertaken. You were still manifesting sufficient self control to parry some of the questioning, for example when asked whether what you had said in the earlier interview was true, you responded “Oh, like which part?” However, you confirmed your confession, a significant description by you of what happened was in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “I opened the, the can and splashed the petrol on the fence and used a match to light it up and the other one, I opened and use up, used a newspaper to light up, the petrol and threw inside the, the window.” 
        
       
      
    20 You were asked why you did this and I will quote an extract of your responses during this third interview. Again the interviewing officer was Detective Sergeant Chambers: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q108 Uh-huh. Can you tell me why you did this? 
        
       
       
        
        A He hurt me so much. He give me VD. He, he never supported me, half the time I had to support him and, and I was very frustrated that he spent all his money on prostitutes and homosexual and transvestites and I have to work so hard to save my money and now he is coming after my property and also he wants a divorce and life is quite comfortable after he wants to come and get what I have been trying to save up all my life and try to be independent. 
        
       
       
        
        Q109 So how come, you’ve been separated for 10 years. How come you decided --- 
        
       
       
        
        A I --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q110 --- now to do this? 
        
       
       
        
        A I didn’t decide, he decided for me because he has spent all his money and then suddenly he decided that he wanted some money from me. And the problem is that maybe I was stupid, you know. I was a Christian and I didn’t believe in divorces. Maybe I should have divorced him a long time ago. I was just stupid. 
        
       
       
        
        Q111 So did he recent, is this divorce just recent? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q112 Who’s divorcing who? Is he divorcing you or you divorcing him? 
        
       
       
        
        A He wanted my property first so my lawyer said if, if it’s just property settlement it may take a year or so and all that. So my lawyer said why don’t you, you divorce him and then usually is about a year then you can have property settlement. 
        
       
       
        
        Q113 OK. So first off he tells you he wants to do a property settlement so because of that you divorce him. 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q114 When did all this happen? Is this recent? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yeah. I think about 2, 2 months, 1 and a half months or --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q115 So when did you decide you want to put the petrol in his house? 
        
       
       
        
        A I don’t know, all the, the frustration, you know accumulated all the, the hurt and the frustration and the agony and then suddenly, you know, I’ve been working so hard to, to, to make an independent life for myself and suddenly now he wanted everything. He wanted money from the Government because he’s on pension and disabled pension and besides that he want my property too. So I don’t know maybe in the moment might be when he --- 
        
       
       
        
        Q116 Mmm. 
        
       
       
        
        A --- and all the hurt, you know, the thing that brought about, you know, all the hurt and all the thing he had done to me mentally, physically and emotionally, so my brain just snap. 
        
       
       
        
        Q117 And did you decide you want him dead? 
        
       
       
        
        A Not actually. I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q130 Do you know what his mobility is like? 
        
       
       
        
        A … 
        
       
       
        
        Q131 Can he walk? 
        
       
       
        
        A No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q132 How does he move around, in a wheelchair? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q133 And he has carers every day, does he? 
        
       
       
        
        A Yes, he’s better off than me, he got one carer in the morning, one carer in the afternoon to cook for his lunch, one carer at night to cook for his dinner and one carer to put him to bed.” 
        
       
      
    21 Your claims concerning Stephen Chin’s past behaviour are corroborated and I have no doubt that your marriage had been most unhappy and for many years was nothing more than a sham. You had met your husband when you were both engaged in religious studies and your husband in due course entered the ministry. You rejected his requests to engage in an unnatural sexual practice and later discovered that, in a hypocritical contrast with his position as a minister, he had taken to visiting prostitutes. As a consequence at one stage he passed the disease of syphilis to you. You were both treated and as far as I can ascertain this occurred some time during the mid 1980’s.  
     
      
    22 Stephen Chin had exercised religious ministry in Malaysia and Singapore between 1971 and about 1986 when you moved to Sydney. As earlier mentioned you lived under the same roof but separately and apart and this commenced from about 1987. Apparently with the financial assistance of your father, you financed Stephen Chin into a real estate partnership but the partners ejected him. He apparently obtained compensation of some $35,000 as a consequence but he did not refund any of this to you. There were other failed businesses including a cleaning service and shortly before the accident in January 1999, the operation of a convenience store at Redfern. Whilst in the real estate partnership, he continued to draw some social security benefits and you repaid to the Department some $8,000 and he was thereby enabled to avoid prosecution.  
     
      
    23 At one stage Stephen Chin had worked as a manager in Kings Cross. He had formed a relationship with a transvestite known as Rebecca Molloy. In fact his application to the Housing Commission for the rental property in which he ultimately died was made in the joint names of the deceased and Rebecca Molloy. These are the matters to which you were referring in the answers to police about your reasons for killing. 
     
      
    24 Your counsel argued that your conduct was inspired by a perceived need to “save face” and whilst that may have contributed to the situation when you apparently shared the same residence, it could not reasonably have affected the situation after you and the deceased commenced to occupy separate houses.  
     
      
    25 Your initial response to Detective Chambers was eloquent of your state of mind and I repeat that your words were: 
     
      
       
        
        “He is coming after my property, I worked so hard to save any money and now he is coming after my property.” 
        
       
      
    26 I reject the implication of the submissions on your behalf that the cumulating misconduct of Stephen Chin brought you to the point of deciding to eliminate him. I am satisfied that it was fear of the possibility that you might be obliged to share your assets with him as a result of a divorce settlement which determined your course of action and that your ruminations and expressions about his previous misconduct, hypocritical and in gross abuse of your marriage though it was, were agitated in order to seek to justify your intended, and later executed, action.  
     
      
    27 I turn now to make some reference to the psychiatric opinion on the basis of which you have been convicted of the lesser crime of manslaughter. I say at the outset that I accept the assessment that you do not pose a risk of future offending. That conclusion hardly requires psychiatric opinion as it is plain that you have removed the perceived source of a claim upon your assets. 
     
      
    28 The evidence includes reports from Dr Westmore and Dr Quadrio who saw you at the request of your solicitors, and from Dr Skinner who saw you at the request of the prosecution. As well there is a psychological assessment by Dr Reid. 
     
      
    29 I record that I have reservations about the evidence of Dr Quadrio. She appears to have accepted history given to her uncritically, even when there were obvious indications for doubt. For example, she records you as having a “traditional upbringing”, your father believing that girls should remain at home. That version of history is contradicted by the facts. You left home in Malaysia for Singapore to study when a comparatively young woman and then proceeded to university in West Virginia in the United States well before your marriage. Significantly, and although it was not sought to advance it at a trial, Dr Quadrio expressed the opinion that you did not fully appreciate “the quality or the nature of the act” (of killing). Dr Quadrio expressed herself as referring to the McNaghten rules. I cannot find any evidence to support the proposition that you did not appreciate the nature and quality of your act which was of course setting a fire in circumstances when you knew that the deceased was in a bed and unable to move himself from it. On the day following the event, when you finally admitted to police what you had done, you were able to describe in detail what you did with each can of petrol. Your pre ignition preparations and your ability to describe what you did contradict an absence of knowledge of the quality of your act. It was not Dr Quadrio’s opinion, as she expressed it, that you did not appreciate that what you were doing was wrong. It is the extravagance reflected in the level of handicap in the expressed opinion of Dr Quadrio which leads me to have the reservation which I have stated. 
     
      
    30 Dr Westmore saw you just three weeks after the killing. You claimed to him that you were not sure what charges you faced, which was in some contrast with your stance at the conclusion of the third police interview which terminated with your enquiry “Is that sufficient to convict me?” The consultation with Dr Westmore had, to say the least, some peculiar aspects. I extract from his report of 5 October 2006: 
     
      
       
        
        “Lying on the desk when I examined her was the police charge sheet. She saw the three charges relating to malicious damage. She was very preoccupied that she may need to ‘pay the insurance’ in relation to the damage of the house by fire. I tried to explain to her that while those charges were very serious, they were perhaps far less serious than the charge of murder which she also faced. She repeatedly expressed concerns about the insurance issue.” 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “I note her preoccupation with money and financial issues and I have made a brief reference to that in the body of this report. She also enquired about my fee on the day (I) examined her and my fees during any subsequent visits. She also expressed concerns about the possible fee should she be required to undergo a neuropsychological assessment.  
        
       
       
        
        I again attempted to explain to her if she were in a position to afford various medical, psychological and legal fees, then those costs were relatively inconsequential when considering the very serious nature of the matters now before the court. She again became obsessed and preoccupied with the ‘maliciously destroy or damage property charges’.” 
        
       
      
    31 Dr Westmore saw you again on 28 March 2007. You claimed virtually to know nothing and remember nothing about killing your husband. You asserted that you did not know what the word “guilty” meant. A mental state examination by Dr Westmore produced a score which would reflect moderate dementia but I am not satisfied that you were genuinely responding to Dr Westmore’s questions. He observed that there were considerable inconsistencies in your cognitive presentation.  
     
      
    32 A third consultation with Dr Westmore took place on 16 May 2007. You then provided him with a considerable amount of information, not all of it reliable. One example was that you said you purchased the petrol in order to kill weeds, but had in so saying you dramatically altered your previous stance when you had told Dr Westmore that you knew and remembered nothing of any consequence. Dr Westmore referred you to some of your answers to police including your feelings of chagrin about the deceased’s claims on your assets. In reference to the record of interview on 5 September 2006 he observed that your answers did not suggest that your memory was as impaired as you were claiming in 2007. You had put forward matters including a cut on the head with a machete during childhood, a family history of Alzheimer’s Disease and heart problems but Dr Westmore found, and I accept, that an organic explanation for your reported cognitive problem seemed unlikely. Psychodynamic explanation was unlikely because of the nature of reported memory difficulties. I am satisfied that a significant contributor to any psychodynamic manifestation is your conscious prevarication.  
     
      
    33 Dr Westmore finally noted in his report of 24 July 2007: 
     
      
       
        
        “It might be argued that her actions were the result of an angry, money obsessed woman who killed for the sole purpose of financial reward. If however one looks at her overall history and the specific difficulties that arose in her relationship with the deceased and the description of her by her son, it is my view that her mood was more depressed than angry at the time she committed the alleged offence.” 
        
       
      
    34 The reference to the description by your son is to a statement that, although you have always been a bit obsessive about things, he had noticed a big change in your mood when he returned to Australia on 2 August 2006 after a trip to Malaysia. He recounted conversations with you about a possible property settlement and recalled your remark “What if I burnt your father and killed myself”. He did not think you were serious and told you that you were silly and, in any event, you would never get away with it. However he was worried about your mental state and although you always had obsessive tendencies he thought these were becoming extreme. As submissions by your counsel noted, between 1999 and 2001 you were treated with drugs for anxiety and depression but, in the absence of apparent threat to your property, you did not then demonstrate any focus on your husband’s misconduct. 
     
      
    35 I interpolate that attempts have been made to suggest that the cut on the head may have caused some significant either physical or other damage. Dr Quadrio seemed impressed by the history but I am not satisfied that it represents any matter of consequence to your conduct more than sixty years later. 
     
      
    36 I do accept however, that you did not complete your studies in the United States because of what was described as a “nervous breakdown” and that you were treated at Woodbridge Hospital in Singapore, a psychiatric institution. The records from Woodbridge Hospital are no longer available but I accept and I infer from the history that you have a vulnerability to succumbing to psychological defect. That would seem to be confirmed by the results of testing by the psychologist Dr Reid. 
     
      
    37 Dr Westmore stated that he believed that the (partial) defence of substantial impairment should be raised on your behalf. It has been raised and of course accepted by the Crown. Nevertheless one of the ultimate issues is the extent to which there should be a reflection of this impairment in the sentence. 
     
      
    38 Dr Skinner examined you on 29 February 2008. As with all psychiatric consultations had with you I regard it as necessary to treat history which you gave with some reserve unless it is corroborated or supported in some way. Dr Skinner was told that you were “struggling to pay off the mortgage” and became frustrated and upset when you received a solicitor’s letter about property settlement because you had helped the deceased in the past and now he wanted more of your money. It was slightly more than deceptive not to mention that “the mortgage” might have applied to as many as six properties. 
     
      
    39 You claimed to have difficulty in understanding why you were in gaol. There is no suggestion that you had been unfit to plead and did not understand the plea which you offered at the outset of these proceedings. Dr Skinner reported that she did not find any evidence of abnormal or unusual affect or disinhibition as had been described by Dr Quadrio. To Dr Skinner you denied the presence of psychotic phenomena such as hallucinations or delusional beliefs. Dr Skinner opined that there were no signs of psychosis such as distraction or perplexity. I accept Dr Skinner’s opinions in these regards. 
     
      
    40 However, for the reasons which she mentioned, Dr Skinner expressed the view that, at the relevant time, your judgment was probably substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind being a melancholic or possibly psychotic depression. This opinion is essentially in harmony with the conclusion of Dr Westmore and those conclusions are accepted. 
     
      
    41 Although I accept in those terms that the impairment was substantial, the objective seriousness of the killing perpetrated by you remains and your responsibility for it is not extinguished. On any view killing by fire a person whom you knew had no capacity to self mobilize from bed was a monstrous act. To do so motivated by an obsession with ownership of property does little to diminish that quality.  
     
      
    42 As I have said you are now seventy one years of age. I take into account that the incidents of imprisonment are likely to be more onerous for you than they would be for a prisoner enjoying the health of youth. There is evidence, which I accept, that in the months before the killing you made several calls to the Salvation Army and Lifeline Services and I infer that you had some insight into where your obsession was leading you, and that you had a need at least for some counselling. 
     
      
    43 There is some paradox in the good judgment manifest in seeking such assistance and the reduction in your capacity for good judgment which is integral to the psychiatric opinion that at the time of killing you were suffering from a substantial impairment in capacities including your capacity for judgment. 
     
      
    44 Of course, I do not question the appropriateness of your conviction for manslaughter and it is to reflect that offence and only that offence that sentence must be assessed. 
     
      
    45 This is the only occasion in your lifetime in which you have offended and your prior unblemished record will count in your favour. Your plea of guilty was offered at the earliest opportunity once it was available and you will receive what is currently termed a discount for the utilitarian value of that plea of guilty. 
     
      
    46 A plea of guilty can also contribute to a finding that an offender is remorseful. It is difficult to reach that conclusion in this case. There is a scarcity of any expression of contrition by you. To Dr Quadrio and to Dr Skinner you claimed not to remember your offending and I have mentioned aspects of the matters which you raised when speaking with Dr Westmore.  
     
      
    47 I have given particular attention to the evidence of the Reverend Mr Hobson in the light of my finding that your ruminations about the deceased’s past misconduct were in effect triggered by your concerns about protecting your possessions. It is true, as Mr Hobson testified, that you told him of the betrayal of your marriage but your initial meetings involved discussions about faith, sin and forgiveness and it was at later meetings that the agitation which he observed occurred. On the last occasion this was associated with your production of some documents which I am satisfied related to the foreshadowed claim for property settlement. Although I accept Mr Hobson did not, as he said “Look at them properly” his evidence does not undermine the conclusion which I have reached about your focus on matters of long past misconduct by the deceased after you became fearful that he may acquire some of your property. 
     
      
    48 There was an express submission by counsel that you were provoked by the victim. So far as property settlement was sought, the evidence shows no more than that the deceased was making a claim which would be dealt with according to law and in respect of which he may or may not have been successful. So far as his past betrayal of the marriage was concerned, I am not satisfied that the incidents of it were operative except in the sense already discussed that your fears about property loss triggered ruminations about the distant past. I do not find that the conduct of the deceased constituted relevant provocation. 
     
      
    49 Mrs Chung’s evidence shows that she did not have, nor did she seek, any discussion with you about your crime or what feelings you harboured by reason of your commission of it. Her descriptions of encounters between you fortify the opinion that you do not represent a future danger to others and that there is little risk of re-offence by you. 
     
      
    50 Before I turn to imposition of sentence I record my acknowledgement of the content of the victim impact statement by the deceased’s mother Mrs Reilly. Every human life is of value and I have no doubt that Mrs Reilly’s pain consequent upon the loss of her son is acute and continuing. It is a myth that a parent will ever “get over” the death of a child or reach, as is a current jargon, closure. However, these considerations do not act to increase any penalty which is otherwise appropriate to your crimes, the circumstances of its commission and your own circumstances. 
     
      
    51 Whilst I accept that your judgment was impaired as assessed by the psychiatric evidence which I have accepted, you are responsible for deliberately causing the death by fire of a person whom you knew had no ability to save himself from the flames which you had ignited. At the hearing I remarked that so to do was extremely evil and, objectively, I see no reason to alter that view. That being said, assessment of sentence must take into account subjective matters including the level of impairment to your capacity for judgment and you are entitled to the benefit of mitigating factors which I have mentioned.  
     
      
    52 The legislature prescribes an available maximum penalty for manslaughter of imprisonment for 25 years. With the exception of the matter of your early plea of guilty, I would, taking into account all other matters, assess a term of 12 years imprisonment to be appropriate. Authority suggests that your early plea of guilty should be reflected in a discount of up to 25 percent and I propose to apply that in full, which results in a term of 9 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    53 The setting of a non parole period is formulated in legislation and may be departed from if special circumstances are found. In your case I find there are such circumstances prominently arising out of the inevitability that custody will be more onerous for a person of your years than would be the case for a younger person.  
     
      
    54 Grace Soon, for the manslaughter of Stephen Chin, you are sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non parole period of 5 years 6 months commencing on 5 September 2006 and expiring on 4 March 2012, with a balance term of 3 years 6 months commencing on 5 March 2012. The earliest date of eligibility for parole is specified as 4 March 2012.

     SENTENCE 
      
       
    INTRODUCTION: 1. On the 18th of December 2007 a jury convicted, Alan Rees (the offender). On one count of sexual intercourse without consent. The jury found him not guilty of an offence of indecent assault.  2. The victim, a young woman, to be named here only as Miss S. at the time of the offence was living in the house of the offender. The offence occurred on the 30th of September 2006. The offender denied he was guilty of this offence and continues to deny his guilt. It follows that he has no remorse or contrition. I am obliged to accept the jury verdict, and I must treat him as a person who has been convicted of a very serious offence.  3. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. The standard non-parole period applying to any offence assessed as being a middle range offence is seven years.  4. The offender is now over 65 years old, is a rigger and a man of good character. He came to this country via New Zealand as a migrant and has lived and worked in this country for many years. He is married and has children and grandchildren. He is well regarded by his employer and by other people who know him. He has contracted the condition of asbestosis and will be afflicted by it until the day he dies. His wife is partially dependent upon him the support and at his age. And with this offence, he will find the serving of imprisonment, very difficult. It is unlikely that he would commit any offence, particularly an offence such as this ever again.  5. The offence was a single event of penile/vaginal sexual intercourse committed on a very young woman by a man who was the grandfather of her child. It has caused this young woman, considerable suffering and she will continue to suffer.  6. I have said, when sentencing offenders in the past for offences of this type, that for a woman, penile/vaginal rape is about the worst crime that can be committed since it involves the penetration of her body by the sexual organ of a male. The offender had a dominant position and abused it. In my opinion, the facts show that this offence is a mid range offence.  7. I must take into account, of course, factors which I have mentioned already, such as his prior good character, his hard-working and responsible attitude to life, his state of health, his relatively advanced years, and the fact that he is unlikely to commit any such offence in the future. It is a case in which I find special circumstances.  8. His counsel has surged strongly that I should impose a sentence of two years imprisonment and suspend it. I have given anxious consideration to this submission, because of the offender’s age and his poor state of health. I am also aware that because of the nature of this offence, he may well need to seek protection within the prison system, if I were to sentence him to full-time custody. It has been said in recent years in various cases in the Court of Criminal Appeal, that judges should not rush to concluding that because prisoners are in protection, that their lives unnecessarily more difficult than the lives of other prisoners.  9. I have taken the trouble myself to visit prisons, such as Goulburn, Bathurst, the Metropolitan remand and reception prison at Silverwater and all of the prisons at Long Bay. I have talked to the governors of prisons and the staff of prisons, and it is clear to me that persons on protection have a very much-restricted life within the prison in which they are housed. Many protection prisoners have to be protected not only from prisoners in the main section of the jails, but also from other prisoners on protection. Many protection prisoners are denied the opportunity of using sporting ovals and have restricted use of library facilities. This man, because of his age, in my opinion, would be considerably at risk of assault, or worse, were he confined to a prison.  10. At the same time, I must give effect in any sentence I impose to the seriousness of this offence. principles of general deterrence and retribution require that a sentence be imposed which will have general deterrent effect and will appropriately provide a sanction for the offence, which the offender committed.  11. The offender owns his own home and has employment. I have given consideration to the question whether I could impose a sentence of two years imprisonment and require the offender to pay a substantial fine of say $50,000.  12. If there had been a plea of guilty, an acknowledgement of remorse and contrition and an expressed willingness to undergo sex offender counselling, I might well have imposed such a sentence. However, the offender continues to maintain he is innocent and shows no remorse or contrition; I have assessed the offence is a midrange offence, and it would be inappropriate for me to impose this sentence.  13. I take into account the two guideposts of the maximum sentence and the standard non parole period and weighing up the subjective factors to which I have referred. I have decided to impose a sentence of a non-parole period of four years with the balance of three. I propose to recommend that the offender be classified as soon as a possible and that consideration be given to placing him in a minimum security institution.  FACTS: 14. Miss S. met the offender's son, David Rees, whilst both of them were attending a technical college. She met him in September 2000 when she was only 16 years old. David Rees was 26 years old. The offender and his wife did not approve of this relationship but permitted her to live with David Rees at their home. She first met the offender in November 2000 and she went to live in the Rees home about a year later. From an early time in her relationship with the offender, she had difficulties with him and regarded him as having a sexual interest in her.  15. At various times between 2001 and 2006, the complainant and David Rees lived at places other than the Rees home. In January 2002, she found she was pregnant to David Rees and on the sixth of September that year, her son Ethan was born. A third ever September 2006 the complainant was visiting the Rees home with her son. It would appear that she was staying at the house, with David Rees and Ethan over the weekend and that this was something she had done on a number of previous weekends. So that we offender and his wife, could have access to their grandchild on in the morning of the 30th of September 2006, she gave her son. Some breakfast and went to go to a toilet. As she did she saw the offender coming out of the bathroom with some red boxer shorts on he came towards her and cuddled her and tried to kiss her.  16. This was conduct that he had engaged in on earlier occasions. She did not like this conduct. He told her to go to the bedroom with him. He did so he stood in front of her in the bedroom took his pants off and told her to lie on the bed. He then told her to take her underwear of. He then sucked her nipples pushed her right thigh, away from her left thigh, popped on top of the and stuck his penis in her vagina, thrusting in and out for about five minutes. She thought that he had Jackie waited he then got off and told her not to tell anyone. She thought that he used a condom, but I cannot be certain whether or not he did.  17. He denied that there were ever any condoms in the house. She complained, very soon after the event to her cousin Laura, ECA double if Ari why but she did not go to the police. Rather, the offender drove her to work and after work. She told her mother about this episode of rape. next day she told Gemma Gutsche, a social worker at a women's refuge, a woman called Barbara and also David Rees. There was evidence independent of the complainant that supported the fact of these complaints being made. When she did go to see the police, it was too late for any tests to be conducted to verify that sexual intercourse had taken place.  18. The offender denied that these events had occurred, and sought to establish that they could not have happened. His wife, supported his denials about the verdict of the jury indicates that they rejected what the offender, and his wife said. I am bound by the jury verdict.  19. There was no subsequent conduct of this type, and there is no suggestion that the offender sought to engage in this type of conduct with the complainant on any subsequent occasion.  20. The events make it plain that the complainant submitted to what the offender was doing. I accept, as the jury did that he forced himself upon her and she chose to submit rather than to be injured. She cannot be criticised for this. There is no suggestion that any physical injury was caused to her but it is clear from the victim impact statement which I take into account that she has suffered considerably as a result of this forced sexual intercourse.  SUBJECTIVE MATTERS: 21. The offender came originally from Wales and met his future wife, in London. He and his wife married in 1966 and migrated to New Zealand in 1974 and then to Australia in 1979. The offender and his wife have a daughter, two sons and seven grandchildren. His wife claims to be close to him and claims that he is close to everyone in the family. There was evidence of the trial, and subsequently that the offender and his wife cared for his parents from 1984 until they died and it would seem that he also continues to support his younger brother who has alcohol dependency problems.  22. He has worked as a rigger and scatter older, since he arrived in Australia and has been permanently employed in a series of jobs. His present employer provided an excellent reference for him stop he is evidently a very valued employee he works six days a week. He suffers from chronic degenerative arthritis in his left ankle and he has asbestosis the evidence presented to me about his asbestosis suggests to me that whilst he is in custody he will be able to continue to receive a appropriate treatment.  23. He has no criminal convictions and is to be regarded as a man of good character. It is unlikely that he would offend again, and there is no doubt that his imprisonment will impose hardship upon him and require him to seek protection which will impose additional hardship on him. Whilst he is in prison the financial and moral support which he gives his wife and other family members will not be able to be given. They will suffer some deprivation as a result of this, but not such deprivation as to cause any substantial lessening of his sentence.  SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS:  24. Because this offence has a standard non-parole period of seven years for a midrange offence, I must give consideration to whether the offence is a midrange offence. In my opinion, it is because it was a penile/vaginal intercourse between an old man and a quite young girl who was required to submit to his lust.  25. Taking into account the subjective factors, which I have already mentioned, it is appropriate that I give consideration to imposing a sentence which is less than that of a non parole period of seven years.  26. On the 16th of December 2005, I sentenced Edmund Turnell for of a similar offence of sexual intercourse without consent to a non-parole period of five years. His offences also involve penile/vaginal sex of a woman with whom he had been in a sexual relationship. Mr Turnell was very much younger than the current offender and persisted with the intercourse for a greater period.  27. The subjective factors to which I have referred, and led me to impose a lesser sentence than that which I imposed on Mr Turnell.  SENTENCE:  28. I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of four years. That sentence commences today the 20th of June 2008 and will expire on the 19th of June 2012 the balance of the term commences on the 20th of June 2012 and expires on the 19th of June 2015.  29. I recommend that consideration be given to releasing him on parole on the 19th of June 2012 and I recommend that he be classified as soon as possible, and that consideration be given to placing him as soon as possible in a minimum security institution.

   JUDGMENT1. The issue in this case is whether I exercise my discretion to set aside a plea of guilty entered by Ms Susan Samy to a charge of malicious wounding. On 11 May 2007 Ms Samy pleaded guilty to a charge that at Yagoona on 6 October 2006 she maliciously wounded Chandra Pal. Ms Samy now asks me through her counsel, Ms Orman-Hales, to set aside that plea of guilty. I have the undoubted discretion to set aside the plea. The question is whether I exercise that discretion or not.  
    2. The relevant principles are clear. In Regina v Sagsagiv (1986) 22 A Crim R 73 Lee J, as his Honour then was, speaking on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “The law regards a plea of guilty made by a person in possession of all the facts and intending to plead guilty as an admission of all the legal ingredients of the offence and is the most cogent admission of guilt that can be made, for the court is prepared to act upon it and proceed to conviction or final disposal of the proceeding.” 
        
       
      In Regina v Liberti (1991) 55 A Crim R 120 Kirby J, when his Honour was President of the Court of Appeal, said on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal that an application to set aside a plea is approached by the courts:  
       
        
        “ 
        with caution bordering on circumspection. This attitude rests on the high public interest in the finality of legal proceedings and upon the principle that a plea of guilty by a person in possession of all the relevant facts is normally taken to be an admission by that person of the necessary legal ingredients of the offence.” 
        
       
      In Regina v Hura (2001) 121 A Crim R 472 Spigelman CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, noted that successful applications to set aside a plea of guilty were exceptional. Circumstances would normally involve a miscarriage of justice. His Honour identified a number of circumstances where such applications have been granted in the past. Those circumstances include where the plea was not a free and voluntary confession and where the plea was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. In Regina v Wilkes (2001) 122 A Crim R 310 the Chief Judge at Common Law, Wood J, speaking on behalf of the Court of Criminal Appeal referred to a passage from the joint judgment of Dawson and McHugh JJ in Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501. Dawson and McHugh JJ had said as follows:  
       
        
        “ 
        The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage.” 
        
       
      
      
    3. In this case Ms Orman-Hales argues on behalf of her client that the plea which was entered was, in the circumstances, not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt. The events of 6 October 2006 may be briefly described. The allegations are that Susan Samy, armed with knives, attacked and wounded a number of people. As a result of those events she was charged with a number of offences. At least one of the offences with which she was originally charged was attempted murder.  
     
      
      In addition she was charged with maliciously wounding Chandra Pal with intent to do grievous bodily harm. An alternative charge in respect of Mr Chandra Pal was that of maliciously wounding him. It is to that charge that she pleaded guilty on 11 May 2007. 
      
    4. The events of 6 October 2006 are the subject of a number of exhibits which were tendered by Ms Orman-Hales. Amongst the exhibits were three statements by persons who were present, including victims of the alleged assaults. Mr Chandra Pal’s statement claims that he saw Susan Samy on the ground with his wife. Susan Samy was holding a knife. He ran to his wife’s help and Susan Samy swung the knife at him which cut the inside of his left thumb causing it to bleed. He then pinned her to the ground.  
    5. Another account is given by Mr Chandra Pal’s wife, Saraswati Pal. Ms Saraswati Pal said that Susan Samy was holding a knife which she described as a meat cleaver. Ms Saraswati Pal wrestled her to the ground. Then her husband came and helped her to hold Susan Samy down and to get the knife from her. Ms Saraswati Pal said that she was holding her down on her back and her husband was near her head and their nephew was holding both her legs.  
    6. The person referred to as the nephew is a man named Rajneel Kumar. In his statement he said that Susan Samy was holding his aunt, Ms Saraswati Pal, and brandishing a butcher’s knife towards her. Mr Kumar said he saw Chandra Pal had overpowered Susan Samy and had held her to the ground with the help of his wife. Mr Kumar then grabbed her by the legs and held her down.  
    7. Another account of events on 6 October 2006 is provided by exhibit 3. Exhibit 3 is a document with the heading “Statement of Agreed Facts, DPP v Susan Samy”. It is unsigned. It was tendered in these proceedings by Mr Cooley, who appears for the respondent Director of Public Prosecutions, as the document referred to at relevant times in court as the Agreed Facts. I note, as was drawn to my attention by both counsel, that the document is undated and unsigned. The document records that Mr Chandra Pal ran to help his wife who was on the ground with the offender. The document records that the offender swung the knife at Mr Chandra Pal who suffered a wound to his left thumb. Mr Chandra Pal and his wife, with the help of Rajneel Kumar, then overpowered and subdued the offender and disarmed her.  
    8. Those accounts are all reasonably consistent in my opinion. They are also consistent with the sequence of events being that Mr Chandra Pal was wounded first and then with the help of the others overpowered and pinned Ms Samy to the ground. However, that version of the sequence of events is challenged in these proceedings which were commenced by a Notice of Motion dated 14 April 2008. They are challenged in the affidavit of Ms Susan Samy sworn on 14 April 2008 and in her evidence which she gave before me today. 
    9. Her affidavit gives an account of her conversations with her legal practitioner on 11 May 2007, the day that she pleaded guilty. Ms Samy asserts in her affidavit that on that day she told Mr Townsend, who was representing her at the time, that she did not know how Chandra Pal got injured. She told him that by the time Chandra Pal came into the incident she was on her stomach on the ground. She was being held down by Saraswati Pal and Mr Kumar. She says that Mr Townsend advised her that the circumstances could be seen as being reckless. By this I understand that Ms Samy is saying that she was receiving advice from Mr Townsend to the effect that despite what she was telling him the likelihood was that she would be found guilty of maliciously wounding Chandra Pal based upon the legal conception of recklessness. 
    10. In her affidavit Ms Samy said that she did not understand what Mr Townsend was saying to her but she signed the document. I infer that the document was a form of instructions to plead guilty. Ms Samy elaborated in evidence before me today on the circumstances of her signing those instructions. She said that she signed it blindly without knowing. She said that Mr Townsend kept repeating that the circumstances were consistent with recklessness. She said in her evidence that she was forced to sign the document in that she was told to do it by Mr Townsend. She said she was very nervous and signed blindly without knowing. She said that she knew that she had not hurt Chandra Pal but she signed the document and pleaded guilty because she was told to by Mr Townsend. The account given by her in the affidavit and in court before me is not consistent with Ms Samy being guilty of the offence that she was charged with. It is in fact inconsistent.  
    11. Ms Samy, it is agreed, shoulders the burden of proof in satisfying me that I ought to set aside her plea of guilty. For the reasons which I have referred to in the authorities, applications such as this must be approached cautiously and even with circumspection.  
    12. It is of course in Ms Samy’s interests to give the account which she gives in the affidavit and in the evidence before me. There is no evidence before me from Mr Townsend. In that sense her account of the conversation with Mr Townsend is uncorroborated. However, that account does secure some support of a transcript of evidence of an appearance in court by Ms Samy some three months after she pleaded guilty. She was back in court, this time at Campbelltown before his Honour Judge Keleman SC. It was Friday 10 August 2007. The matter had evidently been listed for the hearing of the sentence proceedings. The proceedings did not commence for reasons that are not directly relevant. However what is relevant to this application is something that was said to his Honour by Mr Townsend who still appeared for Ms Samy at that stage. Mr Townsend told his Honour that his client  
     
      
       
        
        “raises a significant and important factual dispute that I had understood had been resolved but in fact, and in absolute fairness to her, she did not tell me about this early on when I first spoke to her. I thought it had been resolved. She is insistent, as is her right, that she would not accept one particular aspect of these facts that is quite important. I am asking for some time to discuss the matter with my friend to see whether or not there would be any chance, or if the Crown would be prepared to amend the facts. And if not it may be a matter that we do need to go into evidence about over this quite important factual dispute.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      The representative of the prosecution indicated that the issue referred to by Mr Townsend was not conceded and there was then discussion of the need to call evidence. The matter stood in the list whilst Mr Townsend saw his client again. It was adjourned a couple of times and then Mr Townsend returned to his Honour and indicated that “ 
      Ms Samy is not going to dispute the facts 
      .” The facts referred to by Mr Townsend are those which are exhibit E before me. 
      
    13. The possibility of a dispute over the facts had been anticipated by the representative of the Crown before it was raised by Mr Townsend. The prosecutor said that the case may be one where there may be some dispute and where the parties may need to go into evidence in some aspects. 
    14. I will now make the following observations and findings. First I do not find Ms Samy was forced to sign the document by Mr Townsend. Such a finding would of course represent serious professional misconduct. 
     
      
      The assertion is uncorroborated so far as that particular allegation is concerned and I have not heard any evidence at all from Mr Townsend.  
      
    15. Secondly I do find that at the time of signing the instructions to plead guilty Ms Samy was very nervous. Such a finding is consistent with the feelings which anyone would have in Ms Samy’s position at such a time. In addition I find that she signed the document without properly turning her mind to the contents of the document and its significance.  
    16. The findings which I have made about the circumstances in which she signed the document are in my opinion supported by the transcript references which I have already referred to. Although we do not know what the factual dispute was that was being referred to by Mr Townsend and the prosecutor, it is apparent that the question of what facts Ms Samy was prepared to plead guilty to was attended by some doubt. The parties were talking about the need to go into evidence and that circumstance changed when Ms Samy decided to plead guilty. Ms Samy’s assertions before me, both in the affidavit and in evidence, and my findings about those assertions are supported by the transcript of what occurred in court on 10 August 2007. When I say supported, they are supported to some extent. Her account is not directly corroborated but her assertion which was made in evidence before me today that she knew she had not hurt Chandra Pal is supported by the discussion about the factual basis of her plea which occurred in court on 10 August 2007.  
    17. Returning to the principles which I must apply in determining an application such as this I am not satisfied that the plea was unequivocal. Given that the onus is on the applicant, I should perhaps more accurately say that I am satisfied that the plea of guilty was equivocal. It was attended by a degree of uncertainty and by nervousness and preoccupation on the part of Ms Samy. There was still some confusion some months later about the facts that she was prepared to plead guilty to. It is significant in this regard that Exhibit E, the document representing the agreed facts, was not signed by either of the parties. I am satisfied that the circumstances in which instructions were taken and in which the plea was entered in court suggest that it was not a true admission of guilt. That suggestion, as I said, is corroborated to some limited extent by events which occurred in court some months later. Another way of putting this is that the circumstances indicate that the plea of guilty was not really attributable to a genuine consciousness of guilt.  
    18. In my opinion therefore it is appropriate that the plea be set aside and that Ms Samy be given an opportunity to contest her guilt or otherwise of the offence. I should add that Ms Orman-Hales has convinced me that there is some arguable doubt attending the question of her guilt. There is some confusion over the number of knives and the identification of the knives. There is evidence of a possible source other than the knives of Mr Chandra Pal’s wound. Accordingly I propose to allow the application.  
    19. Accordingly I determine this application by granting to the applicant, Susan Samy, leave to withdraw her plea of guilty entered on 11 May 2007 to the charge that on 6 October 2006 at Yagoona she maliciously wounded Chandra Pal. 
    HIS HONOUR: Anything else?COOLEY: I’ve had some discussions with my friend and wonder whether the matter might be stood over for mention to fix a trial date at Campbelltown District Court this Friday 27 June.HIS HONOUR: That’s the mention date is this Friday?COOLEY: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Do you agree with that Ms Orman-Hales?ORMAN-HALES: Yes I do. Yes I’d ask that that take place if it’s at all possible.HIS HONOUR: In addition I direct that these proceedings, namely the prosecution of Ms Susan Samy, be stood over for directions to this court sitting at Campbelltown this Friday 27 June 2008. Exhibits can stay with the file. HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else? Is bail applied for Ms Orman-Hales?ORMAN-HALES: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Bail is not applied for and refused. Does anyone want Ms Samy to be at the directions hearing?ORMAN-HALES: Yes your Honour, just because the issue is she’s housed at Mulawa and it would be of assistance so we can just know what date we’re working towards.HIS HONOUR: I don’t think I need to issue an order under section 77 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act do I because she’s bail refused but I will anyway.ORMAN-HALES: With respect in my submission it seems to be the usual practice that Ms Samy has been brought in under section 77’s in the past and I would just like her to be there, only if that’s suitable to your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I’ll issue the - you don’t disagree do you Mr Cooley?COOLEY: No not at all your Honour, if only for abundant caution.HIS HONOUR: Under section 77 of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences Act) 1999 I am satisfied that it is necessary that Ms Susan Samy should attend before the District Court on Friday 27 June 2008 for the purposes of directions being given in her prosecution and that her absence may prejudice her rights. Accordingly I direct by order the Commissioner for Corrective Services to cause Ms Samy to be produced at the District Court at Campbelltown on that day by 10.00 am.

     KENNETH BENTON v SCOTT’S REFRIGERATED FREIGHTWAYS PTY LTD 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA:  
     
      
       
      Nature of the Case 
       
      
    2 The Appellant is a truck driver who was injured on 27 October 2003. Immediately before the injury he had been driving a prime mover, identified as vehicle PM51, that was owned by the Respondent. The injury occurred when the Appellant was alighting from the cabin of the vehicle. His foot slipped on the top step of a pair of steps affixed to the side of the fuel tank of the vehicle, by means of which a driver could enter or leave the cabin. He fell backwards onto the ground, and sustained injuries. The claim the Appellant ultimately pressed was that the step was defective, in two particular respects, as a result of the Respondent’s negligence. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiff’s claim was tried in the District Court. Judgment was given on 25 May 2007 by her Honour Judge Truss. Her Honour gave a verdict and judgment for the Respondent, and ordered the Appellant to pay the Respondent’s costs.  
     
      
    4 The Respondent conceded at the trial that it owed to the Appellant a duty to exercise reasonable care in the use or operation of the vehicle. The trial judge held that that duty had not been breached. 
     
      
    5 The Appellant submitted that the Respondent owed him a “higher” duty than the duty that the Respondent conceded. The Appellant contended that the duty that the Respondent owed was “akin to the duty owed by an employer to an employee”. The trial judge did not accept that any such “higher” duty was owed. One issue on the appeal relates to whether that decision of the trial judge was correct. 
     
      
    6 The trial judge was not satisfied that the step was defective in either of the ways the Appellant contended. In consequence she was not persuaded that the Respondent had breached its duty of care. The Appellant disputes the correctness of those findings of the judge. 
     
      
    7 Against the possibility that this Court might hold that her decision concerning liability was wrong, the trial judge assessed damages. That assessment was carried out (as it is common ground it should have been) applying the provisions of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (“MAC Act”). If all the damages of the Appellant were assessed in accordance with that Act, the trial judge found they would amount to $516,515. The Appellant does not dispute the manner in which her Honour arrived at that figure. 
     
      
    8 The step in the trial judge’s reasoning concerning damages that the Appellant disputes is that her Honour found that the employer of the Appellant was not the Respondent, but was another company, Restaco Pty Ltd (“Restaco”). While Restaco had made various payments of workers’ compensation to the Appellant, the Appellant had at no time sued it for common law damages. The trial judge adjusted the amount of $516,515 pursuant to section 151Z(2) Workers Compensation Act 1987. In the course of making that adjustment she found that Restaco owed a non-delegable duty to the Appellant to provide safe plant and equipment, and that a finding of negligence against Restaco would be an inevitable consequence of a finding of negligence against the Respondent. She found that the non-delegable nature of the duty that an employer owes to an employee would mean that any reliance by Restaco on the Respondent in relation to the supply or maintenance of trucks would not absolve it of its responsibilities to the Appellant. Her Honour apportioned liability between the Respondent and Restaco pursuant to section 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965, and assessed the respective responsibilities of Restaco and the Respondent as being 25% and 75%.  
     
      
    9 Her Honour assessed the damages that the Appellant would have recovered if his damages were assessed in accordance with Division 3 of the Workers Compensation Act. She found it likely that the 15% threshold provided by section 151H of that Act would be exceeded, and that the damages to which the Appellant would have been entitled, if damages were assessed in accordance with Division 3 of the Workers Compensation Act, were $422,725. Her Honour then carried out the calculation required by section 151Z(2)(c) and found that the amount of damages recoverable by the Appellant should be reduced by the amount of $23,447. If that reduction were made, the damages of the Appellant would be $493,058.  
     
      
    10 In this appeal, the Appellant disputes the correctness of the trial judge reducing the damages under section 151Z Workers Compensation Act. 
     
      
    11 The Appellant also submits that the trial judge gave insufficient reasons for her decision, and that in consequence there should be a new trial limited to liability.  
     
      
       
      PM51 
       
      
    12 The Appellant was a professional driver, and (leaving aside for the moment any question of who his employer was) his regular daily work involved him in driving a prime mover as part of the business of the Respondent. However, PM51 was not the vehicle that the Appellant usually drove, nor even the same make of vehicle as the Appellant usually drove. PM51 was a type of truck known as an International Transtar 4700. The vehicle that the Appellant usually drove was a Kenworth. Mr Timothy Brookhouse also worked for the Respondent’s organisation, and was one of the usual drivers of PM51. 
     
      
    13 The Kenworth had a different means of access to the cabin to the Transtar, that involved something more like a conventional stepladder suspended from the cabin. The Appellant’s uncontested evidence was that he could use the access ladder on the Kenworth by sliding his foot forward on the step until his heel encountered the edge of the step, but that the configuration of the access steps on the Transtar did not permit that to be done. The organisation also had some trucks called S-Lines, that were like Transtars but smaller. The Appellant had at one stage expressed the view to his superior, Mr Gradon, that he did not like the way the steps were set up on the S-line and thought they were a danger. 
     
      
       
      The Truck Steps 
       
      
    14 The cabin of PM51 is reached through a doorway the bottom sill of which sits approximately 1.38m from ground level. Between the floor of the cabin and the ground are slung two cylindrical fuel tanks, one immediately behind the other, aligned so that the axis of each cylinder lies along the length of the prime mover. Those fuel tanks had around them five metallic bands, with an appearance somewhat similar to the hoops around a barrel. Two aluminium steps are secured by brackets to those bands, in such a manner that each step is horizontal, and positioned out a little from the surface of the tanks. The distance from the ground to the bottom step is approximately 415mm, though this can vary according to factors such as fuel and load. The distance from the bottom step to the top step is 485mm. The distance from the top step to the sill of the cabin is 480mm. The tread of each of the aluminium steps is 110mm wide. At least when the top step is sitting on a bracket that is undamaged, the clearance between the inner edge of the top step and the curved surface of the fuel tank is 60mm. Thus, if the toe of the footwear of a person seeking to climb undamaged steps was just in contact with the tank’s surface, the hindmost part of the sole of the footwear that was in contact with the step would be 170mm from the tip of the footwear. 
     
      
    15 The step is manufactured with some features designed to make it slip-resistant. Each step has three rows of what have been referred to as “dimples” running along its length. The dimples rise from the surface of the step. They are spaced so that anyone using the step would have a number of the dimples under the sole of his or her footwear, no matter where on the step he or she trod. Each dimple is circular in plan, comprising two distinct annular areas with a central hole. The outermost annulus is where the dimple gradually rises from the surface of the step. The next annular area is immediately before the hole. It is configured so that a narrow ridge of metal surrounds the end of the hole. Raising the dimples from the surface of the step keeps the user’s foot clear of the surface where water or slippery substances might gather. The hole in the centre of each dimple aids in drainage, and also enables there to be a level surface across the diameter of each hole. The main purpose of elevating the boot, in the manner the dimples did, was explained by an expert, Professor Frost: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… there will be a small area of high pressure contact between the ridge around the hole and sole of the boot … [and] that in itself will lead to some hopefully transient indentation of the sole of the boot."" 
        
       
      
    16 He said that evidence was given on the basis of assuming that the type of boot that the truck driver was wearing was something like a Blundstones, that had a polyurethane sole or something similar, and that ""… it's soft enough to have an indentation in view of the small area and the high pressure of contact"", leading to a feeling of positive engagement with the ridges on the step. 
     
      
    17 There was also uncontested evidence, from both the plaintiff and Mr Brookhouse, that the edges of the holes in the dimples of the steps on the Transtars when new had what the plaintiff described as ""like a frayed sort of metal"", and other evidence described as a ""burr"", that wore down with time. This burr was a product of the manufacturing process, by which the dimples were machined into the step. Professor Frost gave uncontested evidence that the burr was not just an accidental or coincidental by-product of the manufacturing process, but rather was a deliberate feature that is left there to promote the grip. 
     
      
    18 There is a primary handgrip located immediately to the rear of the cabin door – ie on the left-hand side of the door opening, as one faces it. That handgrip runs vertically from just above the level of the sill to somewhat below the top of the cabin door opening. A secondary handgrip is located inside the cabin, on the right-hand side (as one faces into the cabin) of the cabin door opening. Descending from the cabin involved the driver backing out of the cabin and using both handgrips to assist his descent. The trial judge found that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… egress from the vehicle requires a change from forward facing posture as the driver leaves his seat to facing towards the cabin as he descends. … it is not possible to see the top step when alighting from the cabin and … the normal practice is to extend the leg and feel for it with the left foot.” 
        
       
      
    19 One attribute of the design of this method of access to the cabin was described by another expert, Mr Bailey. It is that while exiting the cabin: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the main mass of the torso is necessarily located outboard of the feet and steps, so that it is essential to maintain a firm grip on the handrail(s) to prevent simply ‘toppling’ outwards. Outwards ‘toppling’ will occur without loss of footing and simply as a consequence of the vertical alignment of the steps.” 
        
       
       
      The Injury 
       
      
    20 The trial judge accepted that the plaintiff was injured in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “[He] slid his buttocks off the seat and placed his left hand on the back of the driver’s seat and his right hand on the steering wheel. He then moved his left hand onto the rail to the left of the steps with his right hand still on the steering wheel as he led off with his left foot and placed it on the top step. He had his weight on his left leg and was in the process of moving his right leg from inside the cabin to place it on the bottom step when his left foot started to slide and despite tensing his grip with his hands he fell to the ground landing on his back.” 
        
       
      
    21 At the time of the accident the Appellant was wearing Redback work boots, which the trial judge accepted “have a deep tread composition sole of the type depicted in exhibit 13”.  
     
      
       
      The Case on Negligence Presented 
       
      
    22 Though aspects of the pleading and evidence went to a contention that the design of the vehicle was negligent, that contention was not persisted in. As ultimately presented, the Appellant’s case was that there were two separate deficiencies in the top step.  
     
      
    23 The first was that it was worn, so that it had insufficient slip-resistant property at the time the accident occurred.  
     
      
    24 The second was that the step was damaged through having been pushed towards the fuel tank so that the distance between the step and the fuel tank was reduced. Though not fully articulated in the evidence, the contention seems to have been that the ball of the foot is the part that can most effectively bear weight when one is descending a set of steps backwards, and if the distance between the step and the fuel tank were to be reduced, that would lessen the surface area over which the sole of a driver’s boot, immediately below the ball of the foot, could come in contact with the surface of the step. 
     
      
    25 The Appellant contended that these conditions of the step together contributed to the Appellant actually slipping. Further, he contended that the step being in that condition was a product of the negligence of the Respondent. 
     
      
       
      Pleadings Re Identity of Employer 
       
      
    26 The plaintiff’s Amended Statement of Claim contained the following material allegations: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On or about 27 October 2003 the Defendant was the owner of a Kenworth Prime Mover registered number SCW-814 (VIC). 
        
       
       
        
        2. On or about the said date and at the Primo Smallgoods Depot at Chullora the Plaintiff was attempting to alight from the cabin of the Defendant’s vehicle when he slipped from a defective metal step below the cabin on the said vehicle and fell to the ground below suffering injury, disability, loss and damage. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In the circumstances the Defendant was under a duty of care to the Plaintiff and was in breach thereof and was negligent.” 
        
       
      
    27 The Amended Defence to Amended Statement of Claim responded to those paragraphs as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The Defendant does not admit paragraph 2 in the Statement of Claim. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The Defendant denies the Defendant is negligent as alleged or at all. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
       
       
      As well, the Amended Defence to Amended Statement of Claim said: 
       
       
        
        “5. Further in answer to the whole of the Statement of Claim the Defendant relies on the provisions of section 151Z(2) of the  
        Workers Compensation Act 
        .” 
        
       
      
    28 That last-mentioned pleading was not further elaborated on, either by additional paragraphs in the Defence, or by particulars. It should be said at the outset that this pleading concerning section 151Z is quite inadequate. A fundamental requirement of pleading is set out by Uniform Civil Procedure Rule 14.7: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subject to this Part, Part 6 and Part 15, a party’s pleading must contain only a summary of the material facts on which the party relies, and not the evidence by which those facts are to be proved.” 
        
       
      
    29 While UCP Rule 14.19 specifically provides “A pleading may raise any point of law”, if the point of law in question requires material facts to be proved and accepted by the court, those material facts must be stated. 
     
      
    30 The provisions of section 151Z(2) that are presently relevant are: 
     
      
       
        
        “If, in respect of an injury to a worker for which compensation is payable under this Act:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) the worker takes or is entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from a person other than the worker’s employer, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the worker also takes or is entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from that employer, 
        
       
       
        
        the following provisions have effect:  
        
       
       
        
        (c) the damages that may be recovered from the person by the worker in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a) are to be reduced by the amount by which the contribution which the person would (but for this Part) be entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise exceeds the amount of the contribution recoverable, 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the amount of the contribution that the person is entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise is to be determined as if the whole of the damages were assessed in accordance with provisions of Division 3 as to the award of damages” … 
        
       
      
    31 The reference to section 151Z(2) in the Defence would make sense only if it was the contention of the defendant that it was not the worker’s employer, and that the worker was taking or entitled to take proceedings independently of the Workers Compensation Act to recover damages from that employer, and the defendant was seeking a reduction in any damages it might have to pay to the plaintiff, with that reduction being quantified in the manner set out in section 151Z(2)(c).  
     
      
    32 I have explained how that quantification proceeds in J Blackwood & Son Limited v Skilled Engineering Limited [2008] NSWCA 142, and will not repeat that here.  
     
      
    33 The material facts that would need to be established for a claim under section 151Z(2)(c) would include identification of the person alleged to be the employer, the material facts by virtue of which that relationship of employment was alleged to exist, the material facts which showed that the worker had taken or was entitled to take proceedings independently of the Act to recover damages from the employer, and any material facts that entered into the quantification of the reduction that was sought in section 151Z(2)(c). As both the contribution that the non-employer tortfeasor could recover from the employer but for Part 5 of the Workers Compensation Act, and the contribution that the non-employer tortfeasor is entitled to recover from the employer under section 151Z(2)(d) both depend upon the relative causal efficacy and culpability of the actions of the employer and the non-employer tortfeasor, the facts material to those matters, and any special facts, that if not pleaded could take the other party by surprise, would need to be pleaded. 
     
      
    34 Further, if the non-employer tortfeasor wanted to contend that the amount of contribution it could actually recover from the employer tortfeasor was nil, because the worker did not pass the 15% permanent impairment threshold set by section 151H before damages assessed in accordance with Division 3 of Part 5 of the Act are payable at all, that failure to pass the threshold would also need to be pleaded. 
     
      
    35 The only material facts that the Amended Statement of Claim pleads, as the “circumstances” referred to in paragraph 3 of the Statement of Claim that give rise to the duty of care, are the defendant’s ownership of the vehicle, that the plaintiff was using the vehicle, and that the plaintiff was injured in consequence of a particular defect in the vehicle. That pleading does not allege that the defendant was the employer of the plaintiff, and in consequence had any particular duty of care to the plaintiff. 
     
      
    36 Notwithstanding the Statement of Claim, counsel for the Appellant, Mr Lidden SC, sought at the trial to raise an issue that the Respondent was the employer of the Appellant. Counsel for the Respondent, Mr Campbell SC, objected to that issue being raised. After a preliminary skirmish that followed an objection to one item of evidence, based on there being no averment in the Statement of Claim that the defendant was the employer of the plaintiff, the trial judge expressed her view that that particular piece of evidence was neutral. The transcript then records: 
     
      
       
        
        “CAMPBELL: Well, thank you, your Honour, as long as it’s clear that that’s the limited use of the evidence, I’m very content. 
        
       
       
        
        LIDDEN: I won’t be stopping there, your Honour, but that’s what I’m doing at this stage.” 
        
       
       
      The evidence proceeded. Shortly after, the transcript records: 
       
       
        
        “OBJECTION. TO EVIDENCE BEING LED THAT SUGGESTS THAT SCOTT’S REFRIGERATED FREIGHTWAYS PTY LIMITED IS EMPLOYER OF PLAINTIFF. LEGAL ARGUMENT. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: I think Mr Lidden would be hard pressed in these circumstances to argue that the defendant owed to the plaintiff the duty of care an employer owes an employee. 
        
       
       
        
        CAMPBELL: On the pleadings, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Yes, on the pleadings. 
        
       
       
        
        CAMPBELL: May it please the court. 
        
       
       
        
        LIDDEN: I’ll just state my position again, your Honour. We don’t know who employed this plaintiff. 
        
       
       
        
        FURTHER LEGAL ARGUMENT. 
        
       
       
        
        LIDDEN: Well, your Honour knows what the issue is between us, so I’ll just proceed, but I’m not making any concessions that Mr Campbell seems to be seeking.” 
        
       
      
    37 It is not clear from the transcript what were the “concessions that Mr Campbell seems to be seeking”. The evidence continued, so far as the transcript shows, without further clarification of the issues, or a ruling under section 136 Evidence Act 1995 being sought or given, limiting the use to which evidence relevant to a question of who was the employer of the plaintiff might be put. 
     
      
    38 To experienced counsel (as those conducting the trial were) the defective pleading concerning section 151Z(2) Workers Compensation Act would no doubt convey that the defendant’s contention was that it was not the employer. Though the question of who was the employer was in this way within the issues raised by the pleadings, the plaintiff still had no affirmative pleaded case that the Respondent was his employer. However, in the course of the plaintiff’s evidence some documents were tendered which went to that issue, and no objection was taken to them. Those documents included a certificate of earnings, in the form approved by the Motor Accident Authority, relating to the plaintiff, that identified his “place of employment” as being “Restaco Pty Ltd trading as Scott’s Refrigerated Freightways Pty Ltd”, for a period from 19 May 1999 until the date of the accident. 
     
      
    39 On the third day of the trial, still in the plaintiff’s case, Mr Lidden sought to tender a collection of documents. They were the Appellant’s group certificates, his tax returns, and certain other documents relating to payment of his wages, and searches of various companies named in those documents as being his employer at different times. Those searches showed, in broad terms, that all the companies were in the same ownership and control. At the time they were tendered the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        CAMPBELL: Your Honour, Mr Lidden showed me these yesterday and I said I had no objection to them being tendered. But may I say this, I think I’ve been objecting from the moment the case started about any case being mounted against me as an employer your Honour, and I maintain that objection. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: There isn’t one on the pleadings at this stage anyway. 
        
       
       
        
        CAMPBELL: That’s why I maintain the objection your Honour. But in terms of showing the wages history and the like I’ve got no objection to them being received into evidence.” 
        
       
      
    40 The fourth day of the trial was the last day on which evidence was taken. Close to the end of the fourth day, Mr Campbell tendered in his case some wage records relating to the plaintiff. At that time he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… there’s been this undercurrent which I’ve been resisting and my friend has been promoting in the case about the status, if I can put it neutrally, of Restaco. I’m producing these wages records not so much for what they contain but to demonstrate that they in fact exist.” 
        
       
      
    41 In London Passenger Transport Board v Moscrop [1942] AC 332 Lord Russell of Killowen said, at 347: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any departure from the cause of action alleged, or the relief claimed in the pleadings should be preceded, or, at all events, accompanied, by the relevant amendments, so that the exact cause of action alleged and relief claimed shall form part of the court’s record, and be capable of being referred to thereafter should necessity arise. Pleadings should not be ‘deemed to be amended’ or ‘treated as amended’. They should be amended in fact.” 
        
       
      
    42 In Dare v Pulham [1982] HCA 70; (1982) 148 CLR 658 at [6], 664 Murphy, Wilson, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Apart from cases where the parties choose to disregard the pleadings and to fight the case on issues chosen at the trial, the relief which may be granted to a party must be founded on the pleadings ( 
        Gould and Birbeck and Bacon 
          
        (1916) 22 CLR at 517–8;  
        Sri Mahant Govind Rao v Sita Ram Kesho 
         (1898) LR 25 Ind App 195 at 207.)” 
        
       
      
    43 Similarly, in Gould and Birbeck and Bacon v Mount Oxide Mines Ltd (in liquidation) [1916] HCA 81; (1916) 22 CLR 490 at 517 Isaacs and Rich JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… pleadings are only a means to an end, and if the parties in fighting their legal battles choose to restrict them, or to enlarge them, or to disregard them and meet each other on issues fairly fought out, it is impossible for either of them to hark back to the pleadings and treat them as governing the area of contest.” 
        
       
       
      They went on at 517-8, to recognise that: 
       
       
        
        “… each case must depend for the proper application of the principle upon its own facts. It has been laid down by the Privy Council that ‘as a rule relief not founded on the pleadings should not be granted.’ ‘But in this case’ (said their Lordships) ‘the substantial matters which constitute the title of all the parties are touched, though obscurely, in the issues; they have been fully put in evidence, and they have formed the main subject of discussion and decision in all three Courts. The High Court are right in treating the case as not within the rule’:  
        Sri Mahant Govind Rao v Sita Ram Kesho 
         (1898) LR 25 Ind App 195 at 207.” 
        
       
      
    44 In the present case there was no consensual abandonment of the pleadings by the way the parties conducted their case. Mr Campbell objected at the outset to Mr Lidden raising a case that the Respondent was the employer of the Appellant, and did not depart from that objection throughout the course of the trial.  
     
      
    45 The trial judge rejected, on the facts, a submission that the Respondent employed the Appellant at the time of the accident. She also said “in any event, as I read the Statement of Claim no such allegation is pleaded.” 
     
      
       
      The Duty of Care Owed by the Respondent 
       
      
    46 Ms Norton SC appeared as counsel for the Appellant on the appeal. The focus of her submissions concerning duty of care was not on the identity of the actual employer of the Appellant but on the significant extent of practical control that the Respondent exercised over the conduct of the industrial operation within which the Appellant worked. That industrial operation involved the employment of more than 100 people and the procuring, maintaining and operating of a fleet of trucks. It had a head office at Prestons, near Sydney, and depots at Cootamundra, Scone, Adelaide, Brisbane and Melbourne. A sign at the head office read “Scott’s Refrigerated Freightways”. The prime movers and trailers of trucks were painted with prominent signs saying “Scott’s Refrigerated Freightways”. Indeed, the cabin door of PM51 had such a sign on it. The Appellant, and other drivers that he knew, were issued with a uniform that had “Scott’s Refrigerated Freightways” on the chest. Consignment notes that the Appellant issued for goods had “Scott’s Refrigerated Freightways” printed on them.  
     
      
    47 When the Appellant was first employed to work in that organisation, his employer was the Respondent. Over the years he worked there, various companies under the same ownership and control as the Respondent, and with the same registered office or principal place of business, were shown on the Appellant’s group certificates, and other documents recording his pay, as being his employer. However, it never impinged on the Appellant’s consciousness that any change of any significance had occurred. It appears from the evidence that at any one time a variety of different companies were used to be the employer of different drivers, wash bay employees, workshop personnel, and managers within the organisation. Further, a particular person who worked for the organisation might have payslips and records of earnings issued by one company in one year, and a different company in the next. Notwithstanding this, to the outside world, and to the Appellant, it appeared as though there was a single integrated organisation called Scott’s Refrigerated Freightways. 
     
      
    48 According to the internal records of the organisation, the employer of the Appellant at the time of his accident was Restaco Pty Ltd. Indeed, it was the holder of the workers’ compensation insurance policy under which the Appellant has received benefits.  
     
      
    49 The evidence included a copy of a letter (on the letterhead of the Respondent) that replied to a request for particulars: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Please provide a copy of any agreement between Restaco Pty Limited and the defendant for the provision of drivers which agreement was in force at the time of the plaintiff’s accident. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          There is no verbal or written agreement between Restaco and the defendant to the best of our knowledge. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. If there is no written agreement or if the agreement to provide drivers is partly written and partly oral then: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a) Please set out the Terms of the Agreement; 
           
          b) Please tell us when the Agreement was made; 
           
          c) Please tell us the persons between whom the agreement was made; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          There is no verbal or written agreement between Restaco and the defendant to the best of our knowledge 
          .” 
          
         
        
       
      
    50 In my view it is not necessary to decide who was the actual employer of the Appellant for the purpose of deciding what duty of care the Respondent owed to the Appellant. That is because there is no relevant difference between the duty that the Respondent owed to the Appellant in its capacity as owner of PM51, and the duty it would owe if it were the employer of the Appellant. 
     
      
    51 An employer owes a common law duty to its employees to take reasonable care for their safety, and part of that obligation is an obligation to take reasonable steps to provide a safe plant and machinery: Andar Transport Pty Ltd v Brambles Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 28; (2004) 217 CLR 424 at [34], 439. Thus, if the Respondent were the employer of the Appellant, by virtue of its obligations as an employer it would be required to take reasonable care to provide the Appellant with a vehicle that was safe to use. However, any vehicle owner who makes its vehicle available to another person to drive owes that person a duty to take reasonable care that the vehicle is safe to use. An employer’s duty of care is non-delegable, while the duty of care of a vehicle owner who lent its vehicle could in some circumstances be discharged by establishing that any defect in the vehicle was due to inadequate performance of repair or maintenance work by some identified independent third party, and that the vehicle owner had exercised reasonable care in entrusting the carrying out of the repair and maintenance work to that third party. However, in the present case, the Respondent did not seek to argue that any deficiencies in the condition of the vehicle were due to the action of some independent third party. Rather, what had been done in the course of maintaining the vehicle was examined as though any deficiency in the maintenance would be a deficiency for which the Respondent was responsible. Thus, in the way the case was run the difference between the non-delegability of an employer’s duty of care concerning provision of equipment, and the delegability of the duty of care of a vehicle owner who is not an employer, but who lends his vehicle to another, made no practical difference. 
     
      
       
      Whether the Step was Worn 
       
      
    52 PM51 was one of a number of trucks which the Respondent acquired second-hand in November 1999. It was built in July 1998. At the date of the accident it had done just over one million kilometres. So far as he could recall the Appellant had never driven PM51 before the day on which he was injured, though “may have driven one or two” other Transtars. The organisation of which the Respondent was part had some trucks called S-Lines, which the Appellant described as a “smaller version of the Transtar”. The Appellant had driven S-Lines, and identified their steps as being “exactly the same” as the steps depicted on a photograph of a Transtar. His evidence was that he had noticed with the S-Line trucks that the “holes in the steps” over time  
     
      
       
        
        “… would get smoother. They wouldn’t be so – they wouldn’t grip your boots as well as they were when they were new.” 
        
       
      
    53 He also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And if it got worn, what would it be like to tread on? 
         
        A. It’d just feel like a little bump in the step. It just – they – no grip. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. If it was in new or nearly new condition, did it grip your foot? 
         
        A. Yep.” 
        
       
      
    54 In cross-examination the Appellant was reminded of his evidence of the rough edge around the hole. The evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And that was the type of thing which wore off fairly quickly with the driver climbing up and down the steps? That’s right, isn’t it? 
         
        A Yep.” 
        
       
      
    55 He later qualified that evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Once they’ve been used for a relatively short period of time, those burry edges are worked off, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        A. I wouldn’t say in a short period of time, in a – after many – I suppose a lot of use, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But after that burry edge goes, you’re still left with the islands, are you not? 
         
        A. You’re still left with a little bit of the islands, yeah.” 
        
       
      
    56 An expert witness, Mr Bailey, was able to inspect PM51 on 13 August 2005. By that time PM51 had been sold to a new owner. Mr Bailey took a close-up photograph of the then condition of the dimples on the top step. That photograph shows a ridge around the hole of each dimple. The Appellant was shown that photograph: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And I suppose, would you say, that you didn’t make a very close examination of the step on that day? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But looking at that photograph, figure 4 on page 8 of the report, it looks the same, do you agree? 
         
        A. It’s similar, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well are there any differences that you made? 
         
        A. I could not say whether that was exactly the same step or if it was the actual step. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. All right. But do you agree with me that whether or not it’s the actual step, that photograph looks like the step that was on the truck? 
         
        A. Yep.” 
        
       
      
    57 The cross-examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now you’ve told her Honour you were wearing proper work boots with what, a polyethylene sole or something? 
         
        A. Yeah, with really good, with grip, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And do you agree with me that when you put the sole of the boot onto either the top or the bottom step that it goes onto those islands we identified? 
         
        A. Mm-hmm. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That’s a yes? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that the sole of the boot engages with those ridges we identified in the close up photograph on top of the islands. That’s right, isn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And those islands and those ridges provide good traction when you’re climbing in and out of the truck wearing proper boots, do they not? 
         
        A. If they’re new, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Even if that burr which is there from the manufacturing process has worn off, the islands and the ridges still provide good traction to the sole of a good work boot, don’t they? 
         
        A. Not always, no.” 
        
       
      
    58 The Appellant lived in Cootamundra. On the day in question he had driven PM51 from Cootamundra to Sydney, and it was when he was getting out of the vehicle in Sydney that he was injured. He gave evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And indeed up until you met with your injury, you got in and out of this truck on three occasions without any mishap. That’s right, isn’t it? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And on each of those three occasions that we’ve been talking about, the sole of your work boot engaged with the step, didn’t it? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And on each of those occasions it engaged with the step and you got good traction. That’s right, isn’t it? 
         
        A. Each time, yep.” 
        
       
      
    59 Mr Brookhouse had been a regular driver of PM51 for about a year and a half before the Appellant’s accident. His usual routine was to do about three trips a week in it, on each of which he would be gone about 24 hours. He gave evidence that at the place on the steps that was the normal means of passage, the surface of the steps was “smooth”, but further down towards the back of the vehicle the surface of the steps was “rough”. He gave evidence that he had slipped two or three times, in the smooth section underneath the front door, in the time before the Appellant had the accident. However, on those occasions he landed on his feet, and never made any formal report about it. 
     
      
    60 In cross-examination Mr Brookhouse was shown the close-up photograph that Mr Bailey had taken. He agreed that it had the dimples, and the hole. The cross-examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And it’s got, you can see that there’s no burr on those is that right? 
         
        A. Oh I could only see if I felt them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I see, but it does have a little ridge around the circumference of the hole at the top of the dimple? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that photograph shows what the top step on PM51 looked like at about October 2003, do you agree with that? 
         
        A. I never took that close of a look, sorry.” 
        
       
      
    61 He also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. But even when they have that smoother feeling underfoot, you still have the dimple? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You still have the hole? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you still have the ridge? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that’s what PM51 was like at about October 2003? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    62 Another expert, Professor Frost, (who had never inspected PM51) was shown Mr Bailey’s photograph, and accepted that the step probably still looked satisfactory. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. But the fact that it may feel smoother underfoot doesn’t mean – may feel smoother underfoot compared to those more remote areas, doesn’t mean that it’s unsatisfactory for safe use, do you agree with that? 
         
        A. Well it’s a matter of degree.” 
        
       
      
    63 When asked about what life could be expected from a step like that, he said he had not done a life analysis on them, that they are probably left in place for lengthy periods of time, and would probably have a satisfactory working life of some years, dependent upon the type of use to which the truck was put. 
     
      
    64 Mr John Hutcheon was in 2003 the General Manager, Equipment and Procurement of the Scott’s organisation. He accepted that steps of the type fitted to PM51 could get blunt over time. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. If those projecting pieces of metal formed by the punching process wear off, the step is less slip resistant isn’t it? 
         
        A. I don’t believe they actually wear off sir, they just become dull. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well I’m asking you about these projections that you’ve told me start off sharp and then I’m asking you about the stage where, according to you, they can get blunt. And you’ve agreed with me I think that reduces their effectiveness in providing purchase for a driver’s boot, you’ve agreed with that haven’t you? 
         
        A. Yes sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Once that happens you’d replace them, wouldn’t you? 
         
        A. If it’s reported you’d replace it, if the people servicing the truck deem it to be unserviceable, they would replace it. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        A. The driver had a pre-check book that he could do the pre-checks on the truck. He also had another book called a defect book, an internal defect book and he could write a defect out and pass that defect in, “Yes I’ve fallen off the step. Could you please look at my step. I don’t think it’s serviceable any more”. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You agree, don’t you, that these things wear, the sharpness wears over time? 
         
        A. Yes sir. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Be a good idea to have the people in the workshop keep an eye on that, wouldn’t it? 
         
        A. I believe they did sir. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What I was asking Mr Hutcheon was that the maintenance staff who do the services on these vehicles would be expected to look for a worn step and if necessary replace it? 
         
        A. Not targeting steps so anything worn that looks as though where the vehicle could fail or driver safety is -- 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Including steps. 
         
        A Oh yes, steps. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I realise not only steps, but they look – their job is to look over all the vehicle, including the steps and see if something’s worn and compromises driver safety. Correct? 
         
        A. Yes sir.” 
        
       
      
    65 Though Mr Hutcheon had ceased having direct day-to-day involvement with the defendant’s workshop by 2000, prior to that time he tried to walk around the yard on a daily basis, and if he noticed damage to a vehicle he would advise the workshop supervisor to fix it. The workshop supervisor at the time of the accident was a Mr Morris, who was not called. However, that occurred in circumstances where orders had been made for short service of a subpoena on Mr Morris, but Mr Lidden announced he agreed that “Mr Morris would have followed a managerial line much as Mr Hutcheon’s”, and “I won’t complain that he wasn’t called by the defendant or that any adverse inference arises from the failure to call him”. 
     
      
    66 When Mr Bailey inspected PM51, he reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “When assessed using boots which had polyurethane soles, there was a feeling of positive engagement with the upper surface of these steps at a time when they were somewhat contaminated with oil. Whilst assessment of slip resistance of a step can be performed by several different means, it was clear during the inspect that the upward deformed edges of the holes punched in the aluminium steps were in good condition and fairly sharp, so that they would provide positive engagement with the sole material of any conventional footwear.” 
        
       
      
    67 He reported that the step as inspected by him: 
     
      
       
        
        “… provides well in excess of the minimum tread depth (ie 160mm vs 127mm required) between the outer edge of the step and the fuel tank, and substantial and effective slip resistance features.” 
        
       
      
    68 The evidence included maintenance records relating to PM51 that spanned a period from 23 January 2002 to 23 May 2005. Those records do not disclose any step being replaced on PM51. The records came to be in evidence in a rather haphazard way – they had not been subpoenaed, but Mr Hutcheon happened to have the records which were ultimately tendered with him at the time he gave evidence. 
     
      
    69 There is some reason to believe that the records are incomplete. The rear of the front section of the bottom step is bent towards the ground in photographs that Mr Brookhouse took of PM51 a couple of months after the accident. So far as one can tell from those photographs, it seems as though it is the rear corner that is furthest away from the truck body that has bent down so as to be below the level of the corresponding section of the rear step, but the rear corner of the edge that is closest to the truck body is at the same level as the back section of that step. Another photograph of PM51 taken on 7 April 2005 shows the bottom step correctly aligned. Notwithstanding that, there is no record in the maintenance documents of that step being fixed, or replaced. 
     
      
    70 Even so, the maintenance records in evidence show that the vehicle was regularly serviced. The vehicle defect report book is a set of printed forms, each of which is headed  
     
      
       
        
        “ALL DEFECTS FOUND DURING THE PRE-TRIP CHECK AS PER PRE-01 OR ANY DEFECT FOUND DURING OPERATIONS WILL REQUIRE THE COMPLETION OF THIS REPORT.” 
        
       
      
    71 The form identifies various components or potentially defective conditions of the truck, with provision for ticks to be placed in boxes alongside applicable ones. None of those components or potential defects relates specifically to the condition of the step, but one of them relates to “other”. Defects actually reported concerning PM51 include “could you put new mudguard on”, “heater not working”, and “centre cab light out”. Different types of standard form are provided for use in the workshop, to identify parts checked, or replaced, or repaired. 
     
      
       
      The Trial Judge’s Finding Concerning Wear of the Step 
       
      
    72 In the course of stating her Honour’s findings on this topic I will deal with two minor criticisms of them. 
     
      
    73 Her Honour noted Mr Brookhouse’s evidence “of having slipped on the smooth section of the upper step 2 or 3 times landing on his feet”. She specifically said that she accepted that evidence. She noted as “uncontroversial” the fact that the burr around the edge of the hole in the dimples wore off in trafficked areas. She noted Mr Bailey’s evidence that on his inspection in August 2005 the tread was sufficient. She noted the plaintiff’s evidence, referred to at para [56] above, and regarded that evidence as being the plaintiff agreeing that the condition of the step shown in the photograph “was consistent with the condition of the step at the date of his accident”.  
     
      
    74 The Appellant submits that this last-mentioned statement of her Honour mischaracterises the evidence – the plaintiff’s evidence could only be taken as referring to the appearance of the step as a whole, in a fairly gross way, not to any detail concerning its condition, particularly when he did not make a very close examination of the step on the day in question. I accept that submission. However, the correctness of the submission delivers, in my view, only a pinprick to her Honour’s own overall reasoning process, nothing like a fatal wound. 
     
      
    75 After reviewing other aspects of the evidence, her Honour stated (at [47]): 
     
      
       
        
        “What the plaintiff relies upon is a defective system of maintenance. The evidence establishes that there was a maintenance program for roughly every fifteen thousand kilometres which represented about a month’s use and there was a checklist and that whilst the maintenance was supposed to be thorough there was no evidence to suggest that the worn steps on the truck were ever replaced.” 
        
       
      
    76 Ms Norton pointed out that the Appellant relied upon far more than a defective system of maintenance – he also relied upon Mr Brookhouse’s evidence, the plaintiff’s evidence about the circumstances in which he fell, expert evidence about the manner in which the steps wore, expert evidence about the age and number of kilometres travelled by the truck, and some alleged Jones v Dunkel [1959] HCA 8; (1959) 101 CLR 298 points.  
     
      
    77 However, all of those matters were specifically referred to in her Honour’s judgment. Even though the trial judge would have removed any scope for even possible criticism had she started the passage I have just quoted by saying, “One of the things the plaintiff relies upon is a defective system of maintenance”, a reading of her judgment overall leaves no real doubt that that is what she meant. A busy trial judge is not to be criticised for slight infelicities of expression when the overall sense of the trial judge’s reasoning is clear.  
     
      
    78 Her Honour said that in her view “the evidence suggests that the defendant had a proper maintenance system and [the maintenance records indicate] a detailed and regular maintenance program in relation to the truck.” In my view that conclusion, correctly expressed with a measure of tentativeness as is shown by the words “the evidence suggests”, is the correct conclusion to draw from the evidence of Mr Hutcheon and the possibly incomplete collection of maintenance records tendered. 
     
      
    79 The trial judge’s conclusion on this topic was: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view what is fatal to the plaintiff’s case is the absence of any clear evidence as to the step being worn or otherwise requiring maintenance or replacement at or immediately before the time of his injury.” 
        
       
       
      Failure to Accept Evidence of Appellant and Mr Brookhouse? 
       
      
    80 The Appellant submits that the trial judge was in error in failing to accept the Appellant and Mr Brookhouse that “the step was worn, slippery, and dangerous”. I do not accept that the evidence of either of them went that far. The evidence that the trial judge specifically accepted, about Mr Brookhouse’s two or three slips, shows that those slips occurred at unspecified times, that might have been any time in the 18 months or so that he had been driving this truck before the Appellant’s fall. There had been many times when he had negotiated the steps without slipping, and he had never lodged a formal report relating to a defect in the step. While the trial judge accepted the plaintiff’s account of the manner in which he fell, the plaintiff had not looked at the step with any care, and had, earlier on the same day, been able to use it and obtain “good traction” from it. Acceptance of the evidence of the Appellant and Mr Brookhouse does not involve concluding that on the day of the accident the step was in such a condition that reasonable care required its replacement or repair. 
     
      
       
      Professor Frost’s Evidence 
       
      
    81 The Appellant submits that the trial judge ought to have accepted evidence of Professor Frost as to the wear characteristics of the step, and the need for replacement of the truck’s step.  
     
      
    82 Professor Frost’s report in chief was directed to the design issue that was ultimately not pressed. Professor Frost’s report in reply to that of Mr Bailey was likewise (unsurprisingly, when Professor Frost had not inspected the vehicle in question, or been asked to make any assumptions about the wear characteristics of the particular step) confined to the design issue. Apart from questions concerning the durability of the step, to which I will shortly turn, Professor Frost’s cross-examination related to design issues. 
     
      
    83 While the trial judge recorded that “Professor Frost considered that the steps would wear to the point of becoming slippery within a year”, and contrasted that with Mr Bailey’s view “that they might last the life of the truck which was 1 to 2 million kilometres”, and “he thought that on average it would be reasonable for the steps to be replaced 2 or 3 times in a truck’s life” that evidence of Professor Frost was heavily qualified. As well, he expressed the views that I have set out at paras [62] and [63] above when pressed by counsel to express an opinion about how long a step might last, he gave the sensible reply: 
     
      
       
        
        “[It’s] going to vary enormously on the use to which the truck is put. I mean one can pick a hypothetical figure out of the air but it’s pretty meaningless really. I mean, if the truck is involved in lots of short runs and stops and the driver is in and out a lot of times in a day, obviously it’s going to last less time. If the truck was used mainly on interstate runs and the driver was only in and out three or four times a day and bearing in mind the drivers do stop and have a rest and get out and run around and so on, it would obviously last longer. I mean, I think it’s fairly misleading for me to attempt to give one figure that encapsulates all of that.” 
        
       
      
    84 After he had expressed the view that he would expect a step to last a year, he was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Be more than a year wouldn’t it Professor Frost? 
         
        A. Oh as I say, it depends – it depends on what the use the truck is put to. It also depends on the surfaces that are available on the ground for the driver to step down onto. If he’s getting up on the truck again with residual gravel adhering to the soles of his boots, he’ll wear that step out a lot quicker, and you know, the conditions are so varied that it’s virtually impossible to give a blanket figure.” 
        
       
      
    85 Similarly, Mr Bailey’s evidence about how long the steps might last was very much dependent upon the precise circumstances in which the truck was used. 
     
      
    86 In my view, Professor Frost’s evidence as to the wear characteristics of the step and the need for replacement of the step provide no basis for concluding that the step involved in this case was defective at the time the Appellant fell. 
     
      
       
      Jones v Dunkel 
       
      
    87 The Appellant submitted that the trial judge should have drawn Jones v Dunkel inferences arising from the failure to call the workshop manager, or mechanics who had actually carried out the maintenance and repair of PM51. I do not agree. Jones v Dunkel is one available tool in a judge’s task of fact-finding. It licenses, but does not require, the drawing of inferences in certain circumstances. Applied to the facts of the present case, if it were open to infer that at the time of the Appellant’s fall the step had worn to an extent and manner that would not have occurred had reasonable care been exercised, Jones v Dunkel would authorise the trial judge to draw that inference more strongly when people who were in the Respondent’s camp and could cast light on that fact were not called. But it must be open to draw the inference in the first place, before it can be drawn more strongly. 
     
      
    88 The Appellant also criticises the trial judge for not drawing a Jones v Dunkel inference arising from the failure of the Respondent to call evidence of “the use or uses to which PM51 had been put and the types of terrain available to its drivers alighting from the vehicle”. The pleadings gave no hint that this would be an issue in the trial. The relevance of such use and terrain arose from the evidence of Professor Frost and Mr Bailey. The trial judge made no error in not using the absence of such evidence as the basis for inferring that PM51 had been used in circumstances that would subject the step to such a degree of wear that reasonable care required it to be replaced or repaired.  
     
      
    89 In my view, the trial judge’s conclusion that the Appellant had not shown that the step was worn or otherwise required maintenance or replacement at, or immediately before, the time of his injury, has not been shown to be erroneous. 
     
      
       
      Whether the Top Step Had Been Pushed In 
       
      
    90 Mr Bailey constructed a model of the cross-section of the front fuel tank, the step, and the bracket attaching the step to the fuel tank. That model was constructed in accordance with the measurements that he made when he inspected PM51. Thus, it showed the step as having a width of 110mm, and a gap of 60mm between the innermost edge of the step and the tank.  
     
      
    91 When the Appellant was shown, in cross-examination, a photograph (figure 2) that Mr Bailey had taken of the steps at his inspection, he agreed there was “a slight gap” between the inside edge of the bottom step and the fuel tank. The cross-examination continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And although it’s not visible in that photograph, you’d agree with me wouldn’t you that there is a gap between the inside edge of the top step and the fuel tank? 
         
        A. Yes there’s a very narrow gap, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well I suppose – you never measured - it I suppose? 
         
        A. No but I’ve watched [washed?] enough tanks to know that – I got my finger caught in there a few times.” 
        
       
      
    92 Mr Bailey also constructed a model of the profile of a size 10 work boot. The Appellant agreed that the profile showed a similar style of boot to that which he was wearing at the time of the accident, though he wore a size 9. The Appellant was shown a demonstration of how the model of the boot interrelated to the model of the step and tank, and asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And would you agree with me that if I conduct this demonstration that you are able to get most of the sole of the boot onto the top step without riding up on the fuel tank as depicted in this model anyway? 
         
        A. On this model it shows that but on the tank – on the actual truck, no.” 
        
       
      
    93 Mr Brookhouse gave unchallenged evidence that he could get less than half his foot onto the top step of the actual truck. The question he was asked appears to relate to the entire foot, from the tip of the toe to the rear of the heel, so his answer is quite consistent with the measurements that Mr Bailey obtained.  
     
      
    94 The Appellant points out that Mr Bailey’s measurements found that the gap between the bottom step and the tank was 50mm, while that between the top step and the tank was 60mm. Those submissions continue that an examination of a photograph taken by Mr Brookhouse a couple of months after the accident suggests that the gap between the top step and the tank was significantly narrower, rather than marginally wider, than the gap between the bottom step and the tank. Having inspected that photograph (particularly the part of the photograph that shows the part of the top step that is closest to the front of the vehicle and the tank immediately adjacent to it), I decline to draw that conclusion. 
     
      
    95 In the context of discussing whether the top step had been pushed towards the tank on or prior to the day the Appellant fell, but had been repaired or replaced by the time Mr Bailey inspected PM51, Mr Bailey was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So someone can fix the bracket? 
         
        A. Those brackets are integral with the tank brackets and so to have been so deformed to close that gap up on the step would require that the brackets would have damaged the tank itself so that it would be quite a major issue. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well we’ve got some photos of these brackets Mr Bailey. The steps are held to the brackets by bolts are they not? 
         
        A. Yes they are. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The brackets have a rubber buffer underneath the bracket and around the tank or some sort of synthetic material buffer don’t they? 
         
        A. Yes they do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well [it’s] perfectly possible to bend the bracket where the step is attached to it and not damage the tank isn’t it? 
         
        A. No it’s not.” 
        
       
      
    96 Mr Bailey accepted that on the occasion of his inspection he did not look underneath the step to inspect the bracket there. 
     
      
    97 In connection with evidence of fingers becoming trapped behind the step in question, Mr Bailey said: 
     
      
       
        
        “My concern is just that the model is a 2D representation of a 3D object. There are places where one’s fingers could get entrapped which are not related to the position of the step.” 
        
       
      
    98 That topic was taken further in re-examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You mentioned that there were features of the construction that you saw that could enable someone’s finger to become entrapped, do you remember that? 
         
        A. Yes I do. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What features were you talking about there? 
         
        A. Where the strap, bracket which holds the tank is extended to support the step there are acute angles formed which would enable – which close to zero tolerance so that they become a point of entrapment. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Does that have anything to do with the available foot clearance inboard of that step? 
         
        A. No.” 
        
       
      
    99 In support of the submission that the top step had been pushed in, the Appellant relied upon the fact that the bottom step had been damaged and remained unrepaired for months. No case was put to the effect that the damage to the bottom step was likely to have resulted from some incident that was likely to have also damaged the top step by pushing it in. Rather, it is relied upon as an example of clear damage to a step that remained unrectified for months. However, while the damage to the bottom step was clearly visible, there was no evidence to the effect that it was in any way dangerous. Without evidence that the bottom step in its damaged condition was dangerous, I do not see that the damage to the bottom step assists the Appellant’s case.  
     
      
    100 The trial judge said (at [39]): 
     
      
       
        
        “I also have regard to Mr Bailey’s evidence which I accept, that had the steps been pushed in to the extent suggested some observable damage to the brackets supporting the steps would have been manifest but there was no evidence of any such damage. Further, I consider the plaintiff’s evidence about catching his fingers to be somewhat puzzling given his evidence that he did not recall having driven the truck previously although he had driven Transtar 4700s.” 
        
       
      
    101 She also noted that it was not part of the ordinary duties of the Appellant to wash trucks, and indeed the Respondent had a wash bay on the premises and employed persons who worked there. She was not persuaded that at the date of the accident the top step had been damaged in a manner that reduced the gap between it and the fuel tank.  
     
      
    102 The Appellant criticised the first sentence I have quoted from the trial judge. The basis of the criticism was: when Mr Bailey did not look under the step, how can one say there was no evidence of any such damage? In my view, her Honour’s remark is not confined to damage that was observable by Mr Bailey, it related to damage observable by anyone. There was no evidence of damage of the degree of seriousness that Mr Bailey described having been reported or repaired, in the maintenance records.  
     
      
    103 In my view her Honour was right to be puzzled by the plaintiff’s evidence about catching his fingers. The evidence of Mr Bailey shows that it was an inherent feature of the design of Transtars that there were some tight spots around the step, bracket and tank portion of a Transtar in which fingers could become trapped. The Appellant’s evidence about his fingers becoming trapped did not make clear whether he was talking about PM51, or some other similar vehicle. If he was not talking about PM51, the evidence about entrapment of fingers could not be the basis of a finding that the top step on PM51 had been pushed in on the day in question. Ms Norton hypothesises that the Appellant was talking about catching his fingers on PM51 when washing down the tank, on the day of the accident. However, the Appellant did not say so, and it could not be assumed. 
     
      
    104 In my view the trial judge was right, in light of all the evidence, not to be persuaded that the top step had been damaged in the fashion that reduced the gap between it and the fuel tank. 
     
      
       
      Inadequate Reasons  
       
      
    105 Various of the criticisms of the trial judge’s reasoning that I have referred to in the course of these reasons for judgment were relied upon in the alternative as showing that the trial judge had not adequately given reasons for her conclusion. I have dealt with those criticisms in the course of the judgment. In my view, the reasoning process by which her Honour arrived at her conclusion is sufficiently clear to the reader. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion and Orders 
       
      
    106 In my view, the Appellant has not succeeded in showing any error in the trial judge’s conclusion concerning liability. I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    107 The issues at the trial were obscured and complicated by the pleading of both parties, in the way discussed earlier in this judgment. At the hearing of the appeal the Court enquired of Ms Norton whether, if the Court were to come to the view that the appeal on liability failed, but that there had been significant deficiencies in the defendant’s pleading, that would make any difference to the usual order as to costs. She accepted it would make no difference. 
     
      
    108 In those circumstances the orders I propose are that the appeal be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
    109 BELL JA: I agree with Campbell JA. 
     
      
    110 McDOUGALL J: I agree with Campbell JA.

      JUDGMENT - Application to set aside subpoena issued on behalf of Khaled Cheikho - Search warrant material collateral challenge to warrants 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Khaled Cheikho is one of nine men accused of conspiring with each other to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. Pre-trial applications have been heard by the Court over the last four months. The stage has now been reached where there are a significant number of issues relating to subpoenas issued on behalf of various of the accused. This application relates to one of those issues. 
     
      
    2 Khaled Cheikho's lawyers caused to be issued a subpoena addressed to the New South Wales Crime Commission. The subpoena was issued by the Registrar, Mr P. G. Ryan. It is dated 14 March 2008. The paragraphs of the subpoena that are especially relevant for the present application are paragraphs 1 to 4 inclusive. They are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Copies of any and all applications pursuant to s 39  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 
         1979 on behalf of the Crime Commission for warrants in respect of the accused.  
        
       
       
        
        2. Any and all authorisations issued pursuant to s 55  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 
         1979 permitting the authority conferred upon the Crime Commission by the warrants issued as a result of the applications set out in paragraph 1 to be exercised by officers and/or staff members of the Commission.  
        
       
       
        
        3. Any and all documents which set out the names of those persons who, in fact, exercised the authority conferred upon the Crime Commission by the warrants issued as a result of the applications set out in paragraph 1; 
        
       
       
        
        4. The affidavits which, pursuant to s 42(1)  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 
         1979 accompanied the applications for warrants and that resulted in the issuing of the following warrants: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) EO1352-00-00 
           
          (b) EO3167-00-00 
           
          (c) EO3169-00-00 
           
          (d) EO3361-00-00 and 
           
          (e) EO3754-00-00.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    3 (The documents sought not only relate to interceptions on Khaled Cheiko’s service but also to services in the name or names of other of the accused). 
     
      
    4 On 16 June 2008, Mr Singleton of counsel announced his appearance for the New South Wales Crime Commission. Mr Singleton was given leave to file a notice of motion which sought an order that the subpoena I have identified be set aside. Mr Waterstreet appeared for Khaled Cheikho and sought to persuade the Court that a legitimate forensic purpose had been established. The principal argument focused on the four paragraphs of the subpoena I have set out above. It is agreed, however, that if the motion is successful, the whole of the subpoena should be struck out. 
     
      
       
      Nature of the Crown case 
       
      
    5 I shall now briefly refer to the nature of the Crown case. 
     
      
    6 The accused are nine men who are said by the prosecution to be parties to the conspiracy involved in the charge contained in the indictment. The prosecution case is that each of the conspirators considers himself to be a devout Muslim; each held certain beliefs in common relating to their interpretation of the Muslim faith. These common beliefs included the following: - 
     
      
       
      (a) Islam throughout the world was under attack and there was a religious obligation to come to the defence of Islam and other Muslims; 
      
     
     
      
      (b) “Jihad” was the primary means by which this religious obligation should be fulfilled; 
       
        
       
      (c) a significant and legitimate aspect of the fulfilment of this obligation was violent Jihad, which involved the application of force and violence, including in certain circumstances the killing of “infidels” or “kuffir” (that is, persons who do not have the same fundamentalist beliefs). 
       
        
       
      
    7 These views are evidenced by, amongst other things, the finding of a large volume of material supporting such views (“extremist material”) at the premises of each accused upon the execution of search warrants. That extremist material was found in the form of electronic media including videos, DVDs, CD’s and material from websites downloaded and saved on each of the accused’s computer or computers.8 In accordance with the holding of those common beliefs, the accused entered into an agreement to obtain the capacity or capability to prepare for a terrorist act (or terrorist acts). This involved equipping themselves with the knowledge, ability and means to prepare for or plan a terrorist act (or terrorist acts). In furtherance of the agreement the accused amongst other things: 
     
      
       
      (a) obtained or attempted to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials which could be used (directly and/or indirectly) in the construction of an explosive device; 
       
      
      
      (b) obtained or attempted to obtain weaponry and ammunition; 
       
       
      (c) possessed large amounts of extremist and instructional material. 
       
        
       
      
    9 In undertaking their activities the accused became aware that they were being monitored by the authorities. This investigative activity by the authorities included physical and electronic surveillance, interviews and search warrants conducted on the premises relating to various accused before they were arrested. Despite this awareness, each of the accused continued with their activities in relation to the offence. In undertaking these activities, the accused displayed a high level of planning to avoid detection. For example, some of the covert means which the accused utilised included the following:(a) acquiring and using mobile telephones in false names (these telephones were used, for example, to make enquiries and purchases relevant to the conspiracy and to organise meetings); 
     
      
    (b) using coded SMS messages (with mobile telephones in false names) to arrange covert meetings and to pass messages to each other; 
     
      
    (c) using false names when making enquiries about purchases and purchasing items; 
     
      
    (d) using false names to book camping trips; 
     
      
    (e) using techniques to avoid physical monitoring (“anti-surveillance”) and/or techniques to detect physical monitoring (“counter-surveillance”); 
     
      
    (f) using public telephones (in circumstances where the accused were known to be in possession of mobile telephones); 
     
      
    (g) using electronic equipment to check whether they were the subject of electronic monitoring. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    10 In particular, the accused used techniques to avoid and/or detect monitoring by the authorities during the weeks leading up to the arrests in early November 2005. During this period, certain of the accused arranged covert meetings in public places using coded text messages from mobile telephones subscribed in false names. These arrangements included meetings to be held during the early hours of the morning. The accused engaged in anti-surveillance and/or counter-surveillance before these meetings took place. On a number of occasions, these meetings were cancelled by the accused when they discovered that they were under surveillance. 
     
      
    11 This brief statement of the Crown case does not, of course, do justice to the complexity and detail of the factual circumstances to be relied upon by the Crown at trial. It indicates, however, that an important part of the Crown case will include listening device and telephone interception material. 
     
      
    12 In relation to the latter product, this was on occasions obtained by interceptions secured at the behest of the New South Wales Crime Commission. The subpoena in question seeks documents surrounding the circumstances in which warrants were issued to enable various interceptions to take place.  
     
      
       
      Interception Warrants 
       
      
    13 There is no need for me to detail the number and nature of warrants to be relied upon at trial. It is clear that there are a considerable number. The warrants relevant to the present application were obtained, so I was told, pursuant to the provisions of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act (1979) (Cth). It will be necessary, in order to understand the arguments advanced on the present application, to refer to a number of sections of this legislation. I shall now turn to these.

        Where an agency applies to an eligible Judge or nominated AAT member for a warrant in respect of a telecommunications service and the Judge or nominated AAT member is satisfied, on the basis of the information given to the Judge or nominated AAT member under this Part in connection with the application, that: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) Division 3 has been complied with in relation to the application; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) in the case of a telephone application—because of urgent circumstances, it was necessary to make the application by telephone; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that a particular person is using, or is likely to use, the service; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) information that would be likely to be obtained by intercepting under a warrant communications made to or from the service would be likely to assist in connection with the investigation by the agency of a class 1 offence, or class 1 offences, in which the person is involved; and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) having regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the extent to which methods of investigating the offence or offences that do not involve so intercepting communications have been used by, or are available to, the agency; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) how much of the information referred to in paragraph (d) would be likely to be obtained by such methods; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) how much the use of such methods would be likely to prejudice the investigation by the agency of the offence or offences, whether because of a delay in obtaining some or all of that information or for any other reason; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        some or all of that information cannot appropriately be obtained by such methods; 
        
       
       
        
        the Judge or nominated AAT member may, in his or her discretion, issue a warrant authorising interceptions of communications made to or from the service. 
        
       
       
        
        49 Form and content of warrant

        (2A) Without limiting subsection (2), a named person warrant may state that the warrant does not authorise the interception of communications made to or from a specified telecommunications service. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) A warrant shall specify, as the period for which it is to be in force, a period of up to 90 days. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A Judge or nominated AAT member shall not vary a warrant by extending the period for which it is to be in force. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) Neither of subsections (3) and (4) prevents the issue of a further warrant in respect of a service, or a person, in respect of which a warrant has, or warrants have, previously been issued.

        (1) Subject to this part, a person shall not, after the commencement of this part: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) communicate to another person, make use of, or make a record of; or

        ...” 
        
       
      
    18 There are other sections relevant to the present argument. I will not set these out in full. I will simply refer to their content. 
     
      
    19 An agency may apply to an eligible Judge or nominated AAT member for a warrant in respect of a telecommunication service or a person (the New South Wales Crime Commission is an agency for the purposes of the legislation). 
     
      
    20 Save in cases of urgency, an application for a warrant is to be in writing (s 40(1)). A written application by an agency for a warrant is to be accompanied by an affidavit which is required to comply with the matters stated in s 42. 
     
      
    21 Section 43 deals with the information to be given where an application is made urgently by telephone. 
     
      
    22 Section 61 enables the issue of a written certificate signed by the Managing Director of a carrier, the Secretary of a carrier or an employee of a carrier authorised to furnish the certificate. The certificate may set out facts considered relevant with respect to acts or things done by, or in relation to, employees of the carrier in order to enable a warrant to be executed. Such a certificate is to be received in evidence in an exempt proceeding without further proof and is conclusive evidence of the matters stated in the document (the present proceedings answer the description of ""an exempt proceeding""). 
     
      
    23 Section 61(4) and (5) enable the issue of a written certificate which provides prima facie evidence of certain matters. 
     
      
    24 Section 61A enables the tender in evidence of a document certified in writing as a true copy of a warrant. It is to be received in evidence as if it were the original warrant. 
     
      
       
      Legitimate forensic purpose - Submissions of counsel 
       
      
    25 Mr Waterstreet accepted the general principles underlying the rule that a subpoena is liable to be set aside if it does not exhibit a legitimate forensic purpose. Counsel identified the legitimate forensic purpose in the present matter as a need to obtain documents to ascertain whether the various warrants affecting his client and others had been validly issued. For example, the issuing officer must be satisfied that Division 3 has been complied with in relation to the application and the application must itself provide the sole basis upon which satisfaction by the issuing officer of the various matters set out in s 45(b)-(e) can be obtained. 
     
      
    26 Mr Waterstreet argued that, unless the accused could access the applications, the affidavits and authorisations mentioned in paragraphs 1 to 4 of the subpoena, it would be simply impossible for his client to satisfy himself that the warrants had been validly issued (see by way of further example, s 55(1) of the legislation relating to the authorisation of an officer or staff member of an agency).  
     
      
    27 Secondly, Mr Waterstreet argued that support for the legitimacy of the defence proposition was to be found in the decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in DPP v Webb (2001) 52 NSWLR 341, 346-47 at (20)-(26) per Mason P. 
     
      
    28 Thirdly, Mr Waterstreet pre-emptively sought to distinguish the recent decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Attorney-General v Chidgey (2008) NSWCCA 65. This was on the basis that the controlled operation authority in Chidgey was not a prerequisite to the admissibility of the evidence sought to be led in that trial. For that reason, counsel argued, the present case was governed by the decision in Webb. 
     
      
    29 Fourthly, support was sought to be obtained from a decision of Smith J in the Victorian Supreme Court. This decision was the Australian Crime Commission v Magistrates Court (Vic) (2007) 173 A Crim R 572. Although this decision is not binding on the Court in the present matter, Mr Waterstreet suggested that it should be considered of considerable persuasive value, both because of the general principles of judicial comity and because of the desirability of a common approach between State courts in Federal matters (Lipohar v The Queen (1999) 200 CLR 485).  
     
      
    30 Finally, Mr Waterstreet drew particular attention to the documents sought in paragraph 4 of the subpoena. The legitimate forensic purpose identified here was stated more specifically. It arose from the fact that material tendered before the Court on the subject application suggested that the relevant warrants were executed in some joint fashion by two carriers, and not by one. 
     
      
    31 Exhibit 2, for example, shows that there is an evidentiary certificate from Louise Sexton, the company secretary of Hutchison Telecommunications Limited (TRADING AS ORANGE). The certificate shows that Hutchison Telecommunications received the warrant and that the relevant telecommunications service, in the name of Jamal, was one provided by Hutchison Telecommunications. There is, in addition, a second certificate from the company secretary of Telstra Corporation referring to the fact that Jamal's telephone service was provided by Telstra Corporation. 
     
      
    32 The position may be further exemplified from material in Exhibit 1. There, Phillip Bradley, the Commissioner of the New South Wales Crime Commission (referring to interceptions on Jamal's telephone in relation to the same warrant) states: 
     
      
       
        
        “During the relevant period communications made to and from the telecommunications service passed over a telecommunication system operated by Hutchison Telecoms (""Hutchison""). During the relevant period communications made to and from the telecommunications service operated by Hutchison also passed over a telecommunication system operated by Telstra Corporation Limited.” 
        
       
      
    33 Mr Waterstreet argued that there was no apparent explanation given for the fact that communications were being intercepted as a result of actions by two different carriers. He foreshadowed an argument that this would be prohibited by the legislation. The anticipated argument would raise the suggestion that interception communications passing over a telecommunication system, other than the one which enables the relevant telecommunication service, would be unlawful. The prospect of this argument, Mr Waterstreet argued, made legitimate the subpoena seeking the warrant affidavits in paragraph 4 of the subpoena.  
     
      
    34 Mr Singleton, on the other hand, argued that no legitimate forensic purpose had been established or demonstrated. Mr Singleton accepted that the Crown, at trial, could be put to strict proof of the existence of the relevant warrants. It was his understanding that those warrants were already in the possession of the accused as a consequence of the Crown's duty of disclosure. If there were legitimate arguments to enable those warrants to be challenged, then Mr Singleton accepted that forensic attacks could be mounted on the use of the interceptions as evidence at trial. Mr Singleton accepted that this was the position underlying decision in Director of Public Prosecutions v Webb.  
     
      
    35 Mr Singleton took issue with the proposition, however, that a legitimate forensic purpose had been established in relation to the suggested production of the applications, the affidavits and the authorisations underlying the issue of the warrants. Counsel argued that the defence were simply seeking to engage in a fishing expedition to see whether there was material in existence that might help it identify a point or points of attack on the warrants. That course was directly prohibited by the decision of the Court of Appeal in Carroll v The Attorney-General (1994) 70 A Crim R 162, especially at 181-182 per Mahoney AP. Mr Singleton submitted that the import of this decision had recently been reaffirmed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Chidgey's case.  
     
      
    36 In relation to the fourth paragraph of the subpoena, Mr Singleton argued that, even if there were some problem with the manner in which the warrants had been executed, there could be no suggestion that any explanation for this was likely to be apparent in the affidavits in support of the application. Again, it was argued that Khaled Cheikho had not shown a legitimate forensic purpose for this material.  
     
      
    37 Finally, Mr Singleton suggested that the decision of Smith J in Australian Crime Commission v Magistrates Court was clearly distinguishable from the present case. Secondly, if it were suggested that the decision was persuasive in a way that was inconsistent with the principles in Carroll's case, it should be regarded as simply wrong and should not be used for any guidance in the present matter. Mr Singleton noted, with emphasis, that Carroll's case had not been cited before Smith J.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    38 There is no doubt that the accused would be entitled to raise a challenge to the interception warrants. They are, after all, the basis on which damaging intercepts were obtained and they will be relied on by the prosecution at trial. It was for that reason that the Court of Appeal in DPP v Webb held that the obligations of the prosecution were to produce the warrants and evidentiary certificates in fulfilment of its obligation to make disclosure. There is no suggestion in the decision, however, that in that case the disclosure obligation extended beyond the warrants and evidentiary certificates.  
     
      
    39 If, in the present trial, an attack were to be launched on any of the warrants, it would be necessary at that time to determine the permissible scope and ambit of the attack. This would no doubt depend upon the resolution of competing submissions between the Crown and those seeking to attack the warrants. At this stage, those matters have neither been identified nor argued. 
     
      
    40 On a preliminary basis, however, the law appears to be reasonably clear. In general, any such attack is to be confined to defects appearing on the face of the warrant or to some other plainly apparent jurisdictional matter. An attack on the sufficiency of the material used in procurement of the warrants is not, in general terms, permissible (Ousley v The Queen (1997) 192 CLR 69 at 79, 81 per Toohey J; at 101-103 per McHugh J; at 125-126 per Gummow J; Murphy v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 94 at 104-106 per Mason CJ and Toohey J; Coco v The Queen (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 435). Mr Waterstreet was at pains to point that the anticipated collateral challenge would not be concerned with the sufficiency of the material in support of the warrants. Rather it would be concerned with the fulfilment of conditions precedent and the like. Such a distinction, it might be observed, may be more apparent than real. Again, the true position cannot be determined at this stage, but may be examined more closely when any such attack is mounted. 
     
      
    41 Against the background of these introductory remarks, I turn now to consider the principles that are applicable to the resolution of the present matter. The general position relating to an application to set aside a subpoena where a party has sought to have documents produced following the issue of a subpoena is that stated by Sir Frederick Jordan in Commissioner of Railways v Small (1938) 38 SR NSW 564 at 575. The Chief Justice said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A party is no more entitled to use a subpoena than he is a summons for interrogatories for the purpose of fishing, ie endeavouring not to obtain evidence to support his case but to discover whether he has a case at all.” 
        
       
      
    42 This statement was mentioned with approval by Mahoney AP in Carroll's case; that is, Carroll v the Attorney General of New South Wales (1993) 78 A Crim R 162.  
     
      
    43 A clear statement of the correct test to be applied in the present circumstances, and one which is often referred to, is the statement of Simpson J in The Queen v Saleam (1999) NSWCCA 86, at paragraph 11, where her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The applicant must identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought and must establish that it is 'on the cards' that the document will materially assist the case.” 
        
       
      
    44 The Chief Justice and Studdert J agreed with her Honour in relation to this statement of the law. (See also the earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal: R v Saleam (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18 A-F per Hunt J). 
     
      
    45 The expression ""on the cards"" is one that has been approved in a number of cases in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal. It appears to have derived from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Alister v The Queen (1983) HCA 45; (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414. There the Chief Justice had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although a mere fishing expedition can never be allowed, it may be enough that it appears to be on the cards that the documents will materially assist the defence.” 
        
       
      
    46 (Gibbs CJ had used the phrase in a different context, namely in a discussion concerning whether, in a public interest immunity argument, the Court should itself inspect the documents and whether disclosure should be made to the applicant). See also Burmah Oil Company Limited v Bank of England (1980) AC 1090 at 1129 per Lord Edmund Davies).  
     
      
    47 In Attorney General for New South Wales v Dillon Chidgey at 71 to 80, Beazley JA, with whom James and Kirby JJ agreed, held, according to the headnote (which appears to accurately record the findings of the Court): 
     
      
       
        
        “The test of determining whether a party is required to produce documents pursuant to a subpoena is a two step process before access is granted. The applicant must (1) identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought and (2) establish that it is 'on the cards' that the documents will materially assist his or her case. Mere relevance is not sufficient to establish a legitimate forensic purpose ( 
        Carroll v The Attorney General for New South Wales 
         (1993) 78 A Crim R 162, paragraphs 59 to 63).” 
        
       
      
    48 In that particular case, the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the legitimate forensic purpose which had been identified by the Magistrate amounted to no more than a proposition that the respondent was entitled to engage in a fishing expedition to ascertain whether there had been compliance with sub-s 5 (2A) and ""to discover whether he had a case at all"".  
     
      
    49 I should also mention the earlier decision in the New South Wales Court of Appeal of New South Wales Commissioner of Police v Tuxford & Ors (2002) NSWCA 139, in particular the decision of Brownie JA with whom Spigelman CJ and Ipp JA agreed. See also the decision of Barr AJ in Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court v Ali Tastan (1994) 75 A Crim R 498. This too is an authority often cited with approval in cases of the present kind. 
     
      
    50 Having stated these general principles, it will be necessary for me to say something more in amplification of two of the decisions to which I have been referred. The first is Carroll's case and I turn to discuss it now. 
     
      
    51 In that case, the plaintiff had sought a review of warrants issued under the Listening Devices Act 1984 (NSW). He contended that there had been no proper supporting material before the Judges who issued them. In that context, the plaintiff sought access to affidavits by police officers which had been relied upon when the warrants had been sought. The defendant argued that such access should be refused by the Court. 
     
      
    52 The proceedings were referred to the Court of Appeal. Mahoney AP and Hunt AJA, Kirby AJA dissenting, held that the affidavits should not be made available for inspection by the plaintiff. At page 70, the Acting President said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But it is not the right of a party to litigation, merely by subpoenaing documents from a third party, to achieve inspection of them. As I have said, the Court must, in general, be satisfied that the documents are relevant to an issue for decision by the Court in the litigation. It is not open to a party, as on a 'fishing expedition', to subpoena documents merely in order to determine whether they may be relevant and may be of assistance to his case in the proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    53 At page 182, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “To have access to the subpoenaed document, the party must show or it must appear that the document is relevant to the issue for decision. But mere relevance is not enough: Thus, it is not enough for the party to show only and without more that the document plainly shows and shows only that his case cannot be made out. It is not enough for the party to say 'the documents are relevant in a sense that prima facie they establish the case against me: Therefore I am entitled to see them and tender them' 
        
       
       
        
        In the case in which the party did not know what was the nature or the contents of the documents, the position would be plain. He could not claim to look at the documents merely to see whether they contained something which might be relevant or help his case. But in this case it is accepted that the documents are affidavits directed to showing 'that there are reasonable grounds for' the 'suspicion’ or ‘belief' referred to in s 16(1). Accordingly, prima facie, the documents are relevant to the issue to be decided, namely whether there was in fact no material that could reasonably justify the relevant belief. But, in my opinion, it is not sufficient for a party subpoenaing the document to say 'the document is relevant because, if it does anything, it establishes the case against me'. He must be able to indicate that the document is relevant in the sense that it may assist his case. In the present case that could not be claimed. Nor was it shown. At best, the claim was 'I wish to see the document to see if it may assist my case'. That, in my opinion, is not sufficient.” 
        
       
      
    54 Hunt AJA also did not accept that the material put forward by the plaintiff established that it was ""on the cards"" that the affidavits before the Judges would assist him in his application. His Honour said that it was by reason of such absence of any legitimate forensic purpose that he agreed in the majority decision of the Court to deny the plaintiff access to the affidavits which were before the various Judges who issued the warrants under challenge.  
     
      
    55 The views of the majority in Carroll's case are binding on me and are sufficient to dispose of the present application. 
     
      
    56 In Chidgey's case (which was decided on 28 March 2008) the Court of Criminal Appeal affirmed the remarks of Mahoney AP which I have set out above. Beazley JA (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) accepted, upon analysis, that the judgment of Mahoney AP represented a majority statement on the issue. Moreover, her Honour said that the statement of Mahoney AP had been applied in a number of subsequent decisions both in New South Wales and Victoria. Those decisions are set out in paragraph 63 of her Honour's judgment. I will not repeat them here. Further, her Honour endorsed the traditional approach represented by such authorities as R v Saleam and R v Ali Tastan.  
     
      
    57 The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Chidgey's case confirms the proposition that there will be no legitimate forensic purpose if all the party is trying to do is to get hold of documents to see whether they may assist him or her in the case. 
     
      
    58 Beazley JA suggested that the relevant authorities showed that the formulation of Simpson J in R v Saleam represented the commencement of a line of authority in which the test for the production of, or access to, documents was specifically stated as comprising two steps: A legitimate forensic purpose, and that it was ""on the cards"" that the document would materially assist the case. However, in stating the test in this specific ""two step way"", Simpson J did not, the Court said, state any new principle. 
     
      
    59 Finally, the Court rejected as inappropriate other recent statements of the test by individual Judges, both in New South Wales and Victoria (Beazley JA at 72-80).  
     
      
    60 In the light of these statements of principle, I am satisfied that paragraphs 1 to 4 of the subpoena sought to be set aside constitute what is commonly called a ""fishing expedition"". No matter how it is dressed up in argument, the plain position is that the lawyers for Khaled Cheikho are attempting to have access to the materials used as a basis for the issue of the warrants (and other materials relevant to the execution of the warrants) in the hope that something will emerge from the material which will allow or provide a possible basis for attack on the warrants themselves. This is simply not permissible. 
     
      
    61 In the letter of 15 April 2008, Mr Cheikho's solicitors said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As you will no doubt be aware, a significant aspect of the Crown case against all of the accused in this impending trial is evidence of conversations intercepted under the  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 
         1979.  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Webb 
         (reference supplied) makes clear that in such circumstances the defence is entitled to insist on strict proof and require that it be demonstrated that any such conversations were lawfully intercepted pursuant to a warrant validly applied for and executed as per the regime set up by the Act. The provision of the material we are seeking then is an essential precondition to the admissibility of the substantive evidence sought to be led by the Crown in this case and indeed falls within Crown disclosure obligations.” 
        
       
      
    62 First, it will be seen that Webb's case does not support the allegation made in the last sentence at all. Secondly, the overall thrust of the paragraph I have quoted demonstrates beyond doubt that this is a fishing expedition. The accuseds’ lawyers hope to have produced material which, when examined, may show some flaw in the way the warrant was issued or in which it was executed. They cannot point to any such flaw, but hope, no doubt, that it will emerge once the material has been scrutinised. 
     
      
    63 In relation to the paragraph 4 documents, I accept Mr Singleton's submission that, despite the feature that two telecommunication carriers may have been involved in the interception of communications, no justification has been established on the evidence for the production of the material anterior to the issue of the warrant. It is not “on the cards” that the affidavits will address this situation at all. 
     
      
    64 This is not to say that the accused cannot otherwise assert that there is an invalidity arising from the execution of the warrant. What he cannot do, however, is to maintain a subpoena which is not supported by the existence of a legitimate forensic purpose.  
     
      
    65 This leaves me only to consider the decision of Smith J in Australian Crime Commission v Magistrates Court. This is the second authority I identified as requiring discussion. 
     
      
    66 The issues in the case arose in markedly different circumstances from those involved in the present application. The second defendant in those proceedings, Michael Brereton, was charged with the offence of refusing to be sworn in response to an examination summons issued by the Australian Crime Commission. The summons required him to attend before an Examiner appointed under the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth). Mr Brereton apparently refused to be sworn in the proceedings involving the proposed examination. This led to the charge against him. At his committal, he issued a number of subpoenas. One of those sought a document recording the examiner’s reasons for the issue of the summons. Section 28 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 (Cth) required the Examiner to be satisfied that it was reasonable to issue the summons and, importantly, to record his reasons in writing. The subpoena that was the critical focus of Smith J’s decision sought, as I have said, the production of the document recording the Examiner’s reasons for issue of the summons. Mr Brereton argued before Smith J that this document was a condition precedent to the valid exercise of the power to issue the examination summons itself.  
     
      
    67 At the hearing before Smith J, the ACC sought orders in the nature of certioraria to have the subpoena quashed. It was the plaintiff’s argument that the subpoena could serve no legitimate forensic purpose. However, in the course of argument, counsel for the ACC conceded that the existence of a document recording the reasons of the examiner for issuing the examination summons was a condition precedent to the valid exercise of the power to issue the examination summons. 
     
      
    68 Smith J dismissed the plaintiff’s motion. In so doing, his Honour held that the concession made by counsel for the plaintiff necessarily revealed the existence of a legitimate forensic purpose. As to the “on the cards” test, Smith J said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “I was referred to a number of cases in which the test to be applied, including the often quoted so called “on the cards” test is considered. In my view, that phrase and other phrases used by Judges are attempts to state ways in which the ultimate question might be approached in a particular case. The ultimate question, however, is whether there is a legitimate forensic purpose which the subpoena will serve. It is necessary to consider, among other things, the importance of the issue to which it is said the subpoena relates and the importance of the document in question in the determination of that issue.” 
        
       
      
    69 In addition, his Honour made reference to a number of remarks made by members of the High Court in Alister v The Queen. These included the observations of Gibbs CJ at 414-415, and those of Brennan J at 451 and 456. After a thorough analysis, Smith J determined that the plaintiff’s argument could not be sustained. It ignored the rights of Mr Brereton to test the validity of the summons. Smith J held that an accused in criminal proceedings is afforded compulsory process to allow an accused to conduct his or her defence. His Honour advocated “a more liberal approach to inspection of documents so that the secrecy appropriate to some Government activities was not misused in a criminal process”.  
     
      
    70 I have given careful consideration to his Honour’s analysis and to the conclusions he drew. I do not, however, find the decision particularly persuasive or helpful in the resolution of the present matter. First, his Honour was dealing with an application for relief in the nature of prerogative relief which sought to attack the issue of the subpoena. That seems to me to be rather a different exercise than the one I am engaged in, namely, an application to set aside a subpoena returnable before me on the basis that the person causing the issue of the subpoena has not demonstrated a legitimate forensic purpose. Secondly, it must be conceded that the legislation his Honour was examining was unusual in a number of respects. Importantly, the very offence with which Mr Brereton was charged with was his failure to allow himself to be sworn before the Examiner who had issued the summons.  
     
      
    71 In the present matter, the applicant for the subpoena is an accused person charged with an offence under the terrorism provisions of the Criminal Code Act. The evidence to be led against him will include evidence of intercepted telecommunications. The warrant or warrants enabling those interceptions may be attacked if there are legitimate grounds to do so. But that has nothing to say about the question of the appropriateness or otherwise of the subpoena. In addition, there was a concession before his Honour that the existence or otherwise of reasons for the issue of the summons was a condition precedent to the valid exercise of the power to issue the examination summons. This concession may be contrasted with the present situation where the warrant in the present matter is available for challenge, whereas the sufficiency of the materials supporting the warrant is not. 
     
      
    72 I should make it clear that I am not intending to be critical in any way of Smith J’s conclusion. It is not my province, nor is it my function, to sit on appeal, as it were, from his Honour’s decision. I would, however, respectfully point out that Smith J does not appear to have been referred to the considerable body of New South Wales jurisprudence relating to the issue of setting aside a subpoena in circumstances where no legitimate forensic purpose has been demonstrated. His Honour, of course, made reference to the earlier of the two Saleam cases. But it seems clear that he was not referred to, for example, Carroll v The Attorney General of New South Wales. Whether his Honour may have arrived at a different conclusion had his attention been drawn to these authorities, I am unable to say. Nor is it necessary for me to do so. 
     
      
    73 Finally, I would note that the passages in Alister’s case referred to by Smith J in his decision are not directly relevant to the application before me. As those passages make clear, their Honours were referring to the particular issue which arose on the appeal. At issue was a public interest immunity question of considerable dimension. This was whether Lee J should have, as trial Judge, inspected the documents produced under the subpoena to ASIO to determine whether they demonstrated a matter that would have been critical or important to the defendant’s position. The secondary issue was, in the event that those documents had demonstrated such a degree of critical importance, whether they should have been produced to the accused. As it happened, the High Court Justices decided to inspect the documents for themselves and, having done so, determined that they would not order production to the accused. In the present matter I do not need to see the documents because I am satisfied that the accused is merely engaged in a speculative fishing expedition. This, as I have said, is not permissible. Secondly, unlike the situation in Alister’s case, this is not a case where any claim for public interest immunity has been raised so that it is unnecessary to go to the balancing process that needs to be undertaken when such a situation arises. 
     
      
    74 Accordingly, I order that the subpoena dated 14 March 2008 be set aside.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    2 PRICE J: The applicant Abboud Yassine pleaded guilty in the Local Court to one count of supply of a prohibited drug, to wit, cocaine being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug. He was committed for sentence to the District Court where he adhered to his plea. He asked the Judge to take into account a further six matters on a Form 1. 3 The Court Attendance Notice (CAN) to which the applicant adhered to his plea was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985, Section 25(2) – SI 
        
       
      
     Supply prohibited drug  
     
      
       
        
        between 8.00am on 20/12/2005 and 2.00pm on 30/03/2006 at Merrylands. 
        
       
       
        
        That Abboud YASSINE between the 20th day of December 2005, and the 30th day of March 2006, at MERRYLANDS, in the State of New South Wales, did supply an amount of a prohibited drug, to wit, 383.1 grams of cocaine, being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.” 
        
       
      
    4 The amount of cocaine which was alleged to have been supplied was originally stated in the CAN to be 392 grams. This amount, it seems, was amended to 383.1 grams at the time of the applicant’s committal to the District Court for sentence.5 The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months to date from 30 March 2006 and to expire on 29 September 2009 with an additional term of three years and six months to date from 30 September 2009 and to expire on 29 March 2013.  
     
      
    6 The offence being contrary to s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 is punishable by 20 years imprisonment or 3,500 penalty unit fine or both. A standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment has been prescribed: s 54B Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and table in Division 1A. 
     
      
    7 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      1. The sentence imposed upon the applicant’s co-accused, Mr Hamid,  
       
        
        gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the applicant; and  
        
       
      
     2. His Honour erred by sentencing the applicant on the basis of a  
     
      
       
        
        larger quantity of drugs than that with which he was charged and to which he pleaded guilty.  
        
       
      
    8 The first ground of appeal raises the issue of parity of sentences. As the determination of the second ground will impact upon the parity issue, it is logical and convenient to consider this ground first. 
     
      
    9 Mr Lange for the applicant contends that the Judge appears to have sentenced the applicant on the basis that he supplied approximately 500 grams of cocaine, rather than 383.1 grams which was the amount stated as the quantity of the prohibited drug in the CAN. He argues that the charge related only to 383.1 grams and the Judge was in error when he took into account on sentence 112 grams of cocaine which had not actually been supplied. He submits that it may well be that his Honour was led into error by the inclusion of the agreement to supply the 112 grams of cocaine in the fact sheets. It is not clear, he argues, why reference to the agreement was not removed, as it should have been prior to the statement of facts being tendered, since such a statement of facts should not contain facts that would aggravate the offence in breach of the principle in R v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
     
      
       
      
    10 In oral argument Mr Lange refers to the written submissions on behalf of the applicant which were handed to the Judge during the proceedings on sentence and contends that it appears that the applicant’s counsel was not aware that the offence for which the applicant was to be sentenced included the 112 grams of cocaine which the applicant had agreed to supply. He submits that defence counsel may have considered the agreement to supply to be part of the factual scenario in which the offence occurred.  
     
      
    11 The Crown accepts that the CAN stated as the quantity of the prohibited drug 383.1 grams of cocaine but submits that is a particular. The Crown argues that the facts presented on sentence (exhibit A3) included the four actual supplies [amounting to 383.1 grams] and the agreement to supply cocaine [112 grams] which occurred within the dates specified in the charge. All five occasions, the Crown submits, were part of the offence despite the pleading of an erroneous quantity. There was no issue raised, the Crown argues, by experienced defence counsel regarding the inclusion of this aspect of the offending within the facts which clearly stipulate five discrete offences supporting the one charge. There is no evidence that there was error in including it in the facts, or that the erroneous particular in the charge was misleading. The Crown submits that the combined documentation makes it apparent that the applicant’s criminality extended to being involved in the supply of 495 grams of cocaine and confirmation of this can be obtained by reference to the record of proceedings.  
     
      
    12 The applicant accepts that the statement in the CAN that the amount of the supply was 383.1 grams of cocaine was a particular: see Boujaoude v R [2008] NSWCCA 35. As was said by Giles JA in Boujaoude at [48]: 
     
      
       
        
        “48 Particulars might reveal a flaw in the Crown case, but that does not mean invalidity of the basal indictment. The basis of particulars is that procedural fairness calls for the accused to know the case the accused must meet: “For a defendant is entitled to be apprised not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he is charged but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge” ( 
        Johnson v Miller 
         (1937) 59 CLR 467 at 489 per Dixon J). It is not necessary that all particulars appropriate for that purpose appear on the face of an information 
         (Preston v Donohoe 
         (1906) 3 CLR 1089 at 1091 per Griffiths CJ;  
        ex parte Lovell; re Buckley 
         (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 153 at 170 per Jordan CJ;  
        Knaggs v Director of Public Prosecutions 
         at [72]-[74] per Campbell JA, Mason P and Tobias JA agreeing), nor in an indictment since particulars can be ordered (see generally  
        Johnson v Miller 
        ;  
        S v The Queen 
         (1989) 168 CLR 266;  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Parmenter 
         (1992) 1 AC 699). “ 
         
         
        
       
      
    13 Further particulars of an offence with which a person is charged may be provided by the service of the Crown brief or by a statement of the facts alleged by the prosecution to be the foundation of the charge. This is what the Crown says happened in the present case. Mr Lange argues that the particulars were not varied as defence counsel when setting out the factual basis upon which he apparently believed the applicant was to be sentenced stated in his written submissions that the amount in question was 392 grams. 14 During the proceedings on sentence in the District Court the applicant was represented by Mr Dhanji, an experienced counsel. The Crown brief was tendered and admitted without objection (exhibit A3). Included in the Crown brief was a document entitled “Fact Sheets – Drug Offences – Yassine”. Below the heading Offence (seq6): Supply prohibited drug (exceed commercial quantity) between 20/12/05 – 30/03/06, the document detailed the facts alleged under a number of sub-headings which were in the following manner and order:· Supply Prohibited Drug on 20/12/05 – 54.1 grams Cocaine 
     
      
    · Agree to Supply Prohibited Drug on 17/01/06 – 112 grams Cocaine  
     
      
    · Supply Prohibited Drug on 14/02/06 – 111.3 grams Cocaine  
     
      
    · Supply Prohibited Drug on 09/03/06 – 109.6 grams Cocaine  
     
      
    · Supply Prohibited Drug on 30/03/06 – 108.1 grams Cocaine  
     
      
    15 The facts disclosed the actual supply of cocaine by the applicant on four occasions, namely, 54.1 grams on 20 December 2005; 111.3 grams on 14 February 2006; 109.6 grams on 9 March 2006 and 108.1 grams on 30 March 2006. Each supply was to an undercover operative. It is clear that the amount of the prohibited drug specified in the CAN is the total weight of cocaine actually supplied. 
     
      
    16 Also disclosed was an agreement to supply 112 grams of cocaine on 17 January 2006. Shortly stated, the Judge was informed that on 13 January 2006 the undercover operative spoke with the applicant who agreed to supply four ounces of cocaine to him. As a result of the applicant’s delay in obtaining the prohibited drug, the undercover operative indicated to him that the supply could not take place. The metric equivalent of four ounces is 112 grams.  
     
      
    17 The fact sheets, in my opinion, explicitly identified the agreement to supply as being one of the five offences which supported the charge. There could be no misunderstanding that the 112 grams was included merely as part of the factual scenario in which the offence occurred.  
     
      
    18 “Supply” as defined in s 3 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act includes: 
     
      
       
        
        “agreeing to supply” 
        
       
      
    19 The agreement to supply occurred within the period specified in the CAN for the supply of the prohibited drug and could properly be included in the charge. As I have stated, no objection was taken by defence counsel to the inclusion of the agreement to supply in the fact sheets. 
     
      
    20 During the applicant’s testimony in the proceedings on sentence, he was asked by Mr Dhanji: (T 19 L 18-28) 
     
      
       
      “Q. You made contact with the undercover operative? 
       
      
     A. I did. 
     
      
       
      Q.  
      You entered into the arrangement to sell cocaine on the various occasions in the fact sheet 
       (emphasis added)  
       
      
     A. Yep. 
     
      
       
      Q. And I think you’ve told us effectively already that in relation to those  
      on each occasion that you actually supplied cocaine 
       you took some of the cocaine (emphasis added).  
       
       
      A. I did.”  
       
      
    21 Both Mr Dhanji and the applicant, it is plain from this exchange, had turned their attention to the contents of the fact sheets. The applicant by the first answer acknowledges the accuracy in the facts of the arrangements to sell cocaine.  
     
      
    22 At the close of the applicant’s case, Mr Dhanji tendered to the Judge written submissions saying; (POS at 28 L24-37): 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour I’ve prepared some written submissions, obviously enough they’ve been prepared prior to the evidence that’s been heard and I may need to just put a line through something…” 
        
       
       
        
        “Perhaps I raise two matters, these submissions I must confess were prepared somewhat late last night and I picked up a piece of paper the supply matter that’s on a Form 1. I have in fact had to put a line through it because the submissions were prepared under a misunderstanding in relation to that. I’ll hand up the submissions and I apologise for the crossing out in texta.” 
        
       
      
    23 It seems that Mr Dhanji then crossed out the reference in his submissions to a charge of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act as that charge had been included on a Form 1. Mr Lange points to the crossing out of the second charge and to the retention in the document of the statement that the amount of the drug was 392 grams.  
     
      
    24 The following paragraphs in Mr Dhanji’s submissions are of particular relevance and are said by Mr Lange to support the submission that Mr Dhanji’s understanding of the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced was confined to the actual supply of cocaine: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The objective gravity of the offence 
          
        
       
       
        
        4. The primary offence involved the actual supply of cocaine to an undercover operative. The initial supply on 20 December 2005 involved 56g. Subsequent supplies involved 112g. The total amount supplied was 392g. The commercial quantity in relation to cocaine is 250g. The large commercial quantity is 1kg. 
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       9. In addition, the amount of the drug, 392 grams, is at the lower end of the scale in relation to the commercial quantities  
       
      (250g – 1kg).” 
       
      
    25 The written submissions had been drafted the previous night. It appears that at the time of drafting Mr Dhanji understood the primary offence to be that of actual supply. Paragraph 4 contains errors of fact. 112 grams was the amount agreed to be supplied whereas subsequent actual supplies amounted to 329 grams.  
     
      
    26 In discussions with counsel which followed the tender of the submissions, the Judge referred to “the large amount”, “the large amounts” and “the large quantities” of the drugs.  
     
      
    27 When oral submissions had been completed, the Judge sentenced the applicant. During his sentencing remarks, the Judge said that “the facts in this matter are set out in full in exhibit A3”. His Honour then detailed the four occasions of actual supply and went on to say (ROS p 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “During that period on 17 January the offender also agreed to supply 112 grams but no actual supply in that amount was made or any money received for it. 
        
       
       
        
        In total during the stated period the offender supplied to the undercover police operative 383.1 grams which had a total purchase value of $91,600.00  
        and he agreed to supply 112 grams 
         (emphasis added). The amount of $65,600.00 was not recovered.” 
        
       
      
     And further (ROS at p 3): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is to be noted that for this particular charge the supply of 250 grams or more brings it into the not less than commercial quantity and the upper end of the range of commercial quantity is one kilogram or 1,000 grams. Accordingly the 383.1 grams which was supplied is a little below the halfway mark  
        and about the halfway mark when you add the 112 which was not supplied but which he did agree to supply  
        (emphasis added). The purity percentages are reasonably high.”  
        
       
      
    28 His Honour’s remarks, to my mind, made it clear that the applicant was being sentenced not only for the 383.1 grams which had actually been supplied but also for the 112 grams agreed to be supplied. It is not a reasonable possibility that experienced defence counsel could have understood the Judge to be referring to the 112 grams as demonstrating the factual scenario in which the offence occurred.  
     
      
    29 When the Judge had completed his ex tempore remarks on sentence, he asked Mr Dhanji: 
     
      
       
        
        “I take it there are no matters I should have mentioned or no corrections?” 
        
       
      
      
     
      
     to which Mr Dhanji responded that there was nothing to be raised. 
     
      
    30 It is not a reasonable possibility in the circumstances of the sentencing hearing that experienced defence counsel would not have raised with the Judge that his client had been sentenced on an incorrect basis if that had been the case. The written submissions, it is apparent, were prepared the night before with a degree of confusion and perhaps haste. I am satisfied that nothing was raised as defence counsel and the applicant were aware at the time of the proceedings on sentence that the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced included the agreement to supply 112 grams of cocaine.  
     
      
    31 The fact sheets detailed the actual supply of 383.1 grams of cocaine and the agreement to supply 112 grams of the prohibited drug. The particulars of the amount of the supply had been varied to 495.1 grams. His Honour was obliged to take into account on sentence the 112 grams of cocaine that the applicant had agreed to supply and the principle in R v De Simoni was not breached. No error has been established and the second ground of appeal fails.  
     
      
    32 I turn to the first ground of appeal. 
     
      
    33 The applicant contends that the sentence imposed upon his co-offender Wajde Hamid gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on his part. 
     
      
    34 Wajde Hamid pleaded guilty to three counts of supply of the prohibited drug cocaine contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and was sentenced by the Judge on 20 July 2007 to a total effective term of imprisonment of three and a half years with an effective non-parole period of one year and nine months. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to s 25(1) disposed of upon indictment is imprisonment for 15 years or 2,000 penalty unit fine or both. There is no standard non-parole period prescribed for this offence.  
     
      
    35 Mr Lange contends that during the proceedings on sentence the Crown took the view that any difference in the criminality of the applicant and Hamid arose from the nature of the charge. The applicant had been charged with one count of supply of not less than the commercial quantity of cocaine contrary to s 25(2) whereas Hamid had been charged with three counts of supply contrary to s 25(1). Mr Lange points out that the total quantity of cocaine, which was the subject of the three charges preferred against Hamid, amounted to 275 grams – itself over the commercial quantity. It would have been open to charge Hamid, Mr Lange contends, with one count of supplying a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. Mr Lange cites what was said in R v Kerr [2003] NSWCCA 234 by Miles AJ (with whose judgment Beazley JA and Adams J agreed) at [13]: 
     
      
       
       
        
        “…the principle of parity in sentencing, or rather the policy behind it, was not so easily dismissed, in my view. The policy behind the principle is not to be avoided by the prosecuting authority simply charging co-operative offenders with less serious offences. The whole of the circumstances need to be examined.” 
        
       
      
    36 So far as the extent of the applicant’s involvement in the supply was concerned Mr Lange argues that there was little to distinguish between the criminality of the applicant and that of Hamid. Of the greatest importance, he contends, is the fact that the quantity supplied by the applicant (383.1 grams) was not substantially greater than that supplied to the applicant by Hamid (275 grams) for the purpose of onward supply. This submission has been dealt with in the consideration of ground 2.  
     
      
    37 Hamid, he submits, took an active role in each exchange for which he supplied cocaine. Not only would he supply the applicant with the drugs, but on each occasion on which he had done so, he would be in the vicinity of the exchange with the undercover officer. Mr Lange points out that on 20 December 2005 and 14 February 2006 Hamid remained in the same vehicle the applicant had used to drive to the place where the exchange took place.  
     
      
    38 Mr Lange concedes in written submissions that there were factors which could justify the imposition of a greater sentence upon the applicant than upon Hamid, such as the difference in age, the applicant being 26 years old and Hamid 20 years old and the fact that the applicant had supplied approximately 100 grams more than Hamid. However, it is submitted that such differences could not justify the imposition which was twice as severe at that imposed upon Hamid, especially where the applicant was essentially of good character. 
     
      
    39 The Judge carefully and sympathetically considered the subjective circumstances of the applicant. Whilst the subjective circumstances of the applicant and the co-offender were not identical, they were not such as might explain the different sentences imposed.  
     
      
    40 During the proceedings on sentence, the following exchange took place between the Judge and the prosecutor: (POS at 3) 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour: Does the Crown put them forward as being on the same plane of criminality? Or at the same level of criminality? 
        
       
      
      Byrne: Yes your Honour.  
     
      
       
        
        His Honour: So the distinction if there be one in terms of the outcome is likely to be as a consequence of subjective matters rather than criminality -- 
         
         
        Byrne: Mr Yassine’s offence is set at the commercial quantity, whereas the other accused are not. 
         
         
        His Honour: So he does have the more significant criminality then than the others. 
         
         
        Byrne: That’s correct.” 
        
       
      
    41 What the prosecutor intended to convey to his Honour is not, in my opinion, entirely clear. If it be the case, as Mr Lange contends, that on the prosecutor’s view any difference in criminality arose from the nature of the charge, then his Honour was not bound by that submission. Fact sheets and other material were before the Judge when he came to sentence the applicant and then at a later stage Hamid. It was open to his Honour to make his own assessment of the respective criminality of the applicant and the co-offender.  
     
      
    42 His Honour in sentencing Hamid noted that he had assisted the applicant to supply cocaine to the undercover operative on the three occasions when a total of 275 grams was supplied. The applicant had contacted Hamid on each occasion in order to source the cocaine with Hamid accompanying the applicant to the general area where the supplies took place. His Honour remarked that Hamid was not physically with the applicant when the supplies took place. The Judge observed that the applicant was involved in a number of other supplies. He noted that Hamid did not have a Form 1 whereas the applicant had a number of matters on a Form 1. He remarked that Hamid had “pleaded guilty to three actual supplies totalling 275 grams or approximately half the amount supplied by Mr Yassine.” His Honour found that the “question of parity does not strictly apply to Mr Yassine because of the more serious charge and his greater involvement” (ROS at 3).  
     
      
    43 The Judge, in my view, carefully analysed the participation by the accused and the co-offender Hamid in the criminal offending. The finding that the applicant’s involvement was “greater” was clearly correct. This is not a case where the discrepancy in sentences on the two co-offenders arises solely from the difference in the charges they faced. The criminal culpability of the applicant for which he was sentenced was of a significantly more serious character than that of Hamid. Hamid had participated neither in the supply of cocaine on 30 March 2006 nor in the agreement to supply on 17 January 2006. It was the applicant who spoke with the undercover operative on each occasion and agreed to supply cocaine to him. Having sourced the cocaine he met with the purchaser exchanging the drug for an agreed sum. The supply did not take place on 17 January 2006 as the applicant experienced delay in obtaining cocaine through another co-offender, Assoum. The financial rewards for the applicant were more than for Hamid.  
     
      
    44 In determining the appropriate sentence his Honour took into account, as he was required to do, the six matters on the Form 1. One of those matters was an offence of supply of cocaine in an amount of 13.25 grams which his Honour noted was a “deemed supply”. The Judge was entitled to increase the penalty for the primary offence because of the criminality involved in the Form 1 offences. There were no matters on a Form 1 to be taken into account when Hamid was sentenced.  
     
      
    45 Although it is true that Hamid could have been charged with the more serious offence under s 25(2), his Honour was obliged to take into account on sentence the different charges they faced. For the offence with which the applicant was charged a standard non-parole period of 10 years imprisonment has been prescribed. This was not an irrelevant consideration.  
     
      
    46 The applicant has not shown that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard his grievance as justified: Lowe v The Queen (1985) 154 CLR 606, Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295, R v Kollas & Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491 at [45-50]. The sentence imposed by the Judge does not give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. The first ground of appeal fails. 47 I propose that leave to appeal be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.  
     
      
    48 McCALLUM J: I agree with Price J.

   JUDGMENT HIS HONOUR: Application pursuant to s.38 Evidence Act to cross-examine witness in re-examination1. On 26 June - that is, yesterday - towards the end of the Crown case the Crown called John Paul Holloway. He was, as it seems to me, a key witness for each side and an alleged co-conspirator. He gave evidence yesterday afternoon.  2. The Crown case was that the accused had conspired with Holloway and others to steal [a container] TEXU’ 351 and its contents at a time when it was at the Port Botany terminal. It is agreed between the parties that Holloway pleaded guilty to a charge under section 131.1 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code of dishonestly attempting to appropriate such property. It is also agreed that he had a role in the commission of the theft of TEXU 351 and was, in fact, caught shortly after the theft, driving a truck away from the P&O Port Botany container facility.  3. In March 2007 Holloway gave evidence on his own sentencing proceedings before Judge Zahra, and that was the only account that he had given of his role in the theft of the 40-foot container. He had not agreed to co­operate with the prosecution, he had not received any discount from the Court at the sentencing proceedings on account of any intention to co-operate with investigators or prosecutors.  4. During the course of his evidence-in-chief in this trial I took the view that he was generally co-operative and gave an account of his involvement consistent, generally, with the Crown case. From Holloway's point of view, it had been three years since his arrest. With the passage of time he was sometimes imprecise on detail. His evidence was that he had never met the man who entered the cabin of the truck while it had been at the parking bay prior to entering the terminal proper.  5. On the Crown case, the person who entered the cabin of the truck was the accused. Holloway had given evidence that the man entering the truck had scribbled on a document which, on the Crown case, is Exhibit AP. On the Crown case, this document was then handed to security at the exit gate.  6. The witness had told Judge Zahra on sentencing that when the scribbling was done he was told by the man who entered the truck to ""hand it"" - meaning, the document on which he had scribbled - ""in when you're leaving,"" meaning leaving the terminal. While Holloway gave evidence of being told to hand a document out at the exit gate, he did not nominate that particular document that the Crown was entitled to have him nominate in the light of the evidence he had given before Judge Zahra. The Crown made an application to cross­examine Holloway for the purpose of securing the evidence he had given before Judge Zahra.  7. Significantly, the Crown did not seek to identify through Holloway the person who entered the truck. Questions asked in chief by the Crown were these (page 708):   
     
     “Q. Is it the situation that you're not able to recognise the person who came into the truck?  
      
     A. I don't understand what you mean. 
      
       
      
     Q. The person that got into your truck while you were in the truck parking area, was that someone that you had or hadn't seen before?  
      
     A. No, I hadn't seen them before. 
      
       
      
     Q. You are not able to recognise that person? 
      
     A. If they (sic) were standing in front of me I might be able to. They (sic) were only in my presence for a few minutes.""  
      There was perhaps some further evidence that went to identification at page 711:   
     
     “Q. Were you told that by telephone? 
      
     A. Yes. 
      
       
      
     Q. Were you told that by John or by the other person? 
      
     A. By the other person. 
       
      
       
      
     Q. Did that person appear to be the same person that you had spoken to in the trailer?  
      
     A. Yes I think so, yeah. 
      
       
      
     Q. The person who had got into the trailer? 
      
     A. Yeah. Well the voice might have sounded a bit different on the phone but yeah, I assumed it was the same person.""  
     8. Why it is significant that the Crown did not seek to identify the person is that the proceedings before Judge Zahra were conducted upon an agreed assumption that the accused person was the person who had entered the truck. From the transcript before Judge Zahra on 1 March 2007   
     
     “Q. So you had met Mr Hufnagl before? 
      
     A. No, I hadn't. 
      
       
      
     Q. I take that to mean, on this night was your first encounter with him? 
       
      
     A. That's correct.  
      
       
      
     Q. And what happened? He got the truck at some point?  
      
     A. Well, a man entered the truck and since then I've worked out that it is that Hufnagl. Only reading the statement of facts and stuff like that, he did get in the truck for a short period of time and wrote something on one of the documents that I had, that I had been given to by the person who asked me to drive the truck.""  
     9. That evidence given by Holloway before Judge Zahra had been made after both Holloway and the accused had been co-accused before the Local Court on charges relating to this very matter. Each had been in the presence of the other on that occasion for at least some time. It is to be remembered that the proposition of inability to recognise the male who entered the truck was evidence led by the Crown. When the Crown made this application to cross-examine Holloway earlier in this trial, while the application was not confined to the topic on which leave was ultimately granted, there was no application to cross-examine on the identity of the male person who had entered the truck.  10. I accept that it would have been inappropriate to seek to identify the male person by the Crown pointing to the accused and asking the question, ""Is that him?"" But that was not the only means available. The Crown had the opportunity of raising the very issues in cross-examination when the first leave was given that he would now be seeking in this application, because the Crown now seeks leave to cross-examine Holloway for a second time. The application is made pursuant to section 38(1)(a) and (c). I should point out that the evidence given by Holloway in relation to ""working out that it was Hufnagl"" was never tested by the Crown in the proceedings before Judge Zahra. Section 38(4) appears predicated upon natural justice issues. It together with section 38(1)(b) are indicators of the desirability that the cross-examination constitute part of the evidence-in-chief of the witness.  11. However, it is clear from authority that that cannot always be so. See R v Parkes [2003] NSWCCA 12 at paragraph 70 per Ipp JA.  
     
       
      
     “There is ample authority that an application to question a witness under section 38 may be allowed where unfavourable evidence is led in cross-examination: It is sufficient to refer to  
     R v Milat 
      and  
     Pantoja, Mansour 
     . There is also ample authority to the effect that section 38 is not limited to circumstances where the unfavourable evidence is unexpected. It is sufficient to refer to  
     R v Esho 
     ,  
     R v Fowle 
     r 
     ."" (References excluded).  
     12. Further, it appears that the Crown is concerned with an issue of fact, that is, he seeks to overturn the exclusion of the accused as the person who entered the truck. He seeks to do that through attacking the witness's credibility on the issue but it seems to me he is interested in more than this. He is interested in obtaining relevant evidence as to the identification of the person entering the cabin as being the accused. My reading of section 38(3) is that cross-examination is limited to matters relevant to credit only.  13. The credit only issue would require the Crown to impugn credibility of the witness to a leading question asked by him, and at a time when he was not really prepared to contest the evidence he now regards as being untrue. In my view, that would be unfair to the witness and indeed to the defence, who crafted the cross-examination of the exclusion of the witness upon, he claimed, non-recognition of anybody at a time when Holloway was in Court seated basically opposite the accused.  14. The defence council had started his cross-examination by referring back to that proposition, as I recall, that Holloway was unable to recognise anybody, and built upon that a scenario where the two men had seen each other on two occasions, one before his sentencing proceedings when they were both at the Local Court and one after the sentencing proceedings when they were both at the District Court in different roles on that occasion.  15. So the dilemma for me is this, the Crown is entitled to impugn the witness on this issue, but it seems to me that particularly at this late stage in the trial and given that he earlier had an opportunity so to do, it would be unfair to allow him to ventilate much more than is needed to be permitted to impugn Holloway before the jury.  16. In giving leave, matters that I need to take into account: the extent to which it would be unlikely to add to or shorten the length of the hearing, given the nature of the leave I anticipate this hearing will not have much time added to it. Indeed, more time has been spent, I imagine, agitating the issue than would be taken in the course proposed. The extent to which it would be unfair to a party or to the witness, I have dealt with both of those in my remarks thus far. The importance of the evidence in relation to which leave or permission is sought:- the issue is an important one and hence the leave that I am giving. The nature of the proceedings:- they are proceedings in a criminal trial in which the liberty of the accused would be at risk in the event of a conviction and a significant issue of responsibility to seek out those guilty of crime in respect of looking at it from the Crown's point of view.  17. Mr Crown has supplied two issues on which he seeks to ask questions. That is, that the witness was lying on the issue when he said that it was not Hufnagl who had entered the truck and, secondly, that his reason for lying was to assist Hufnagl evade conviction. Provided the cross-examination is strictly confined to those issues, I would permit it.    0O0

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: I have had the advantage of reading in draft the judgments of Giles JA and Campbell JA. I agree the appeal should be dismissed and have nothing to add to the reasons of Campbell JA in respect of contributory negligence; the application of the November 2001 amendments (Workers Compensation Legislation Further Amendment Act 2001); and the trial judge’s apportionment of responsibility for the worker’s injuries as at 70:30 between the appellant and respondent respectively. I otherwise agree with Giles JA’s reasons for the dismissal of the appeal. 
     
      
    2 GILES JA: I have had the considerable benefit of reading the reasons of Campbell JA in draft. Drawing extensively upon them, I can state concisely my reasons for dismissal of the appeal. 
     
      
    3 The respondent’s recovery from the appellant under s 151Z(1)(d) of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (“the Act”) was limited by that provision to the amount of the damages which the appellant was liable to pay to the worker, and was also subject to the operation of s 151Z(2)(e).  
     
      
    4 The potential recovery after excision of statute-barred payments was $130,736.08. The trial judge held that the “pool of notional damages” relevant to recovery was $159,600, and that there could be full recovery of the $130,736.08. 
     
      
    5 His Honour’s reasoning is seen from his apparent adoption of the respondent’s submissions, which he stated as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        “Pursuant to s 151Z of the Act, the plaintiff’s claim for indemnity from the defendant is as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) The worker’s full entitlement to common law damages as against the defendant/occupier totals $228,000. 
         
         
        (b) The worker’s full entitlement to damages as against the plaintiff/employer is nil dollars. 
         
         
        (c) The apportionment of the responsibility for the accident is seventy per cent for the defendant/occupier and thirty per cent for the plaintiff/employer, that is, the plaintiff/employer is liable for thirty per cent of $228,000, that is an amount of $68,400. 
         
         
        (d) The percentage liability of the plaintiff/employer (thirty per cent) multiplied by the worker’s entitlement to damages pursuant to the Act as against the plaintiff (nil) equals nil, that is the amount of contribution recoverable by the defendant/occupier against the plaintiff/employer is nil. 
         
         
        (e) The maximum amount of money which the worker would have been entitled to recover from the defendant/occupier in common law proceedings is $228,000, less thirty per cent, as referred to in paragraph (c) above, equals $159,600. Therefore, $159,600 is the pool of notional damages which is relevant to the plaintiff/employer’s claim for recovery from the defendant/occupier. 
         
         
        (f) Section 151H of the Act prevents this worker from recovering damages from the plaintiff therefore as no damages would have been assessed there is no damages to which the defendant/occupier could look for contribution. 
         
         
        (g) Section 151Z(2)(e) of the Act sets out the position if the worker does not take proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        In conclusion, therefore, the indemnity payable by the defendant/occupier to the plaintiff/employer is the total of the non-statute barred payments of $130,736.” 
        
       
      
    6 As I understand the reasoning, the “pool of notional damages” of $159,600 was the amount of the damages which the appellant was liable to pay to the worker, constituting the limit in s 151Z(1)(d). That figure was arrived at on the basis that the reduction in the damages of $228,000 required by s 151Z(2)(c) was $68,400, being the excess of the amount of the contribution which the appellant would be entitled to recover from the respondent but for Pt 5 of the Act ($68,400; para (c)) over the amount of the contribution recoverable determined as directed by s 151Z(2)(d) (nil; para (d)). 
     
      
    7 It is not correct that contribution turns on there being damages payable by the respondent “to which [the appellant] could look for contribution” (para (f)), but no point was taken over this expression of the reasoning and it was not submitted that contribution was recoverable from the respondent notwithstanding that the damages determined as directed by s 151Z(2)(d) were nil. 
     
      
    8 The trial judge referred to s 151Z(2)(e) (para (g)), but did not set out how it operated. Implicitly, his Honour considered that it did not operate so as to impose a lower limit on the indemnity than that under s 151Z(1)(d). That is not correct. Section 151Z(2)(e) did apply, because the worker had not taken proceedings against the respondent. By s 151Z(2)(d) the amount of the contribution that the appellant could recover from the respondent was to be determined as if the damages were assessed in accordance with Div 3 of Pt 5 of the Act. On the trial judge’s findings, the compensation paid by the respondent ($157,973.45) exceeded the amount of the contribution which could be recovered from the respondent as joint tortfeasor (nil; para (d)). By force of s 151Z(2)(e)(i), the indemnity was “for the amount of the excess only”, that is, the $157,973.45. So there was a lower limit, although not lower than the total of the non-statute barred payments. 
     
      
    9 The appellant’s submissions were directed more to s 151Z(2)(e) than to s 151Z(1)(d). They were concerned with - 
     
      
      
      (i) contributory negligence on the part of the worker;  
       
       
      (ii) recoverability of damages by the worker from the respondent and so of contribution by the appellant; and 
       
       
      (iii) greater apportionment to the respondent of responsibility for the worker’s damage. 
       
       
      (i) Contributory negligence 
       
      
    10 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to find that the worker was contributorily negligent. If so, the starting-point of $228,000 for the “pool of notional damages” would be reduced and, if contribution could be recovered from the respondent ((ii) below), there would be reductions in damages flowing through to the amounts of contribution for the purposes of s 151Z(2)(c) and s 151Z(2)(e). However, not so. The submission was but faintly pressed. For the reasons given by Campbell JA, it should not be accepted. 
     
      
       
      (ii) Damages from the respondent 
       
      
    11 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in holding that the damages which the worker could have obtained from the respondent were to be assessed under the regime introduced by the amendments to the Act coming into force in November 2001 (Workers Compensation Legislation Further Amendment Act 2001). So assessed, the damages were nil, and there was no contribution recoverable. The appellant said that the damages assessed under the prior regime were a substantial sum, although one which could not be determined because the trial judge had not, in consequence of his holding, made the necessary findings. The appellant’s purpose was to have contribution recoverable from the respondent for the purposes of s 151Z(2)(e), and the further submission was that the damages recoverable by the worker from the appellant would be considerably greater than the $228,000 and the damages recoverable from the respondent would be correspondingly, although not identically, the substantial sum. 
     
      
    12 The oddity of an appellant saying that the damages for which it was liable were more than the damages assessed by the judge comes from s 151Z(2)(e)(i). The greater the damages, the greater any contribution recoverable from the respondent and the smaller the excess in accordance with that provision. As I have said, the appellant’s submissions were directed more to s 151Z(2)(e) than to s 151Z(1)(d). Greater damages would increase the limit under s 151Z(1)(d), to the appellant’s disadvantage. 
     
      
    13 The appellant submitted that the trial judge was in error because the transitional provision now found in cl 9(1) in Schedule 6 of the Act, relevantly giving the November 2001 regime retrospective application, did so “in respect of the recovery of damages”, but the respondent’s claim under s 151Z(1)(d) was not a claim for damages: Westpac Banking Corporation v Tomassion (1993) 32 NSWLR 207. However, for the reasons given by Campbell JA the respondent’s claim was in respect of the recovery of damages although not a claim for damages. The trial judge was not in error. 
     
      
       
      (iii) Apportionment 
       
      
    14 The appellant submitted that the trial judge erred in apportioning responsibility for the worker’s damage 70:30 between the appellant and the respondent. It said that his Honour imposed upon it an excessively onerous duty of care by putting it in the position of an employer, and otherwise placed its responsibility at too high a level in comparison with that of the respondent, and that the apportionment should have been 30:70.  
     
      
    15 This would have been material to the contribution recoverable by the appellant from the respondent, for the purposes of s 151Z(2)(e), if contribution could be recovered, and would have brought a greater amount recoverable as contribution and a smaller excess in accordance with that provision. Since no contribution is recoverable, the submission takes the appellant nowhere. In any event, for the reasons given by Campbell JA the submission should not be accepted. 
     
      
    16 The available indemnity in accordance with s 151Z(2)(e) was $157,973.45, the lesser figure than the limit under s 151Z(1)(d) of $159,600. Recovery of some of the paid compensation for which the respondent was entitled to be indemnified, however, was statute-barred, and the recovery of $130,736.08 was within the limit. The appeal should be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
    17 CAMPBELL JA: Jody Heterick (the “Worker”) was an employee of the Respondent. The Respondent is a labour hire company. It arranged for the Worker to work in a warehouse of the Appellant. While the Worker was working there on 21 August 1997 she suffered an injury to her right knee. In consequence of that injury the Respondent has paid the Worker compensation pursuant to the Workers Compensation Act 1987 (‘the Act”).  
     
      
    18 The Worker has never sued either the Appellant or the Respondent seeking damages for her injury. 
     
      
    19 The Respondent brought proceedings against the Appellant in the District Court, seeking indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) of the Act concerning the workers compensation payments it has made. His Honour Judge Coorey assessed the amount of damages that the Worker would have been able to recover, had the Worker sued the Appellant and the Respondent had not breached its duty of care in a way that caused the Worker’s injury, as being $228,000. He held that the Respondent had breached its duty of care to the Worker in a way that caused her injury, but assessed the amount of damages that the Worker would have been able to recover, had she sued the Respondent, as being nil. He held that the Worker’s injury had not resulted from any contributory negligence on her part. He held that, as between the Appellant and the Respondent, culpability should be apportioned in the proportions 70:30 respectively. 
     
      
    20 By the time of the trial, the Respondent had paid over $157,000 in workers compensation payments to the Worker. Part of those payments had become statute barred, leaving an amount that was not statute barred of $130,736.08. Seventy percent of $228,000 is $159,600. As that amount exceeded the amount of non-statute barred payments that the Respondent had made, the primary judge held that the Respondent was entitled to recover from the Appellant an amount of $130,736, plus interest and costs. 
     
      
    21 The issues that were argued on this appeal are: 
     
      
       
      (i) the nature of any duty of care that the Appellant owed to the Worker; 
       
       
      (ii) the correctness of the 70:30 apportionment between the Appellant and the Respondent; 
       
       
      (iii) the correctness of the finding that the Worker had not engaged in any contributory negligence; 
       
       
      (iv) whether the trial judge had applied the correct legal principles in coming to assess the damages that the Worker would have recovered from the Respondent at nil; and 
       
       
      (v) in the event that the trial judge did not apply the correct principles in assessing those damages at nil, what course should be followed to obtain an assessment on the correct principles. 
       
      
    22 After those issues are decided, so far as is necessary, some consideration needs to be given to the manner in which the operation of the Limitation Act 1969 affects the order that should be made. 
     
      
       
      Operation of Section 151Z 
       
      
    23 To understand the steps that the trial judge took in reaching the amount of the judgment – namely, assessing the amount of damages the Worker would have been able to recover had the Worker sued the Appellant, assessing the amount of damages that the Worker would have been able to recover had she sued the Respondent, deciding whether the Worker had engaged in any negligence that was a contributing cause of her injury, and assessing the respective culpabilities of the Appellant and the Respondent – one must first understand how the indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) of the Act operates. 
     
      
       
      Text of Section 151Z 
       
      
    24 So far as is relevant, section 151Z of the Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If the injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a liability in some person other than the worker’s employer to pay damages in respect of the injury, the following provisions have effect:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) if the worker has recovered compensation under this Act, the person by whom the compensation was paid is entitled to be indemnified by the person so liable to pay those damages (being an indemnity limited to the amount of those damages), 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If, in respect of an injury to a worker for which compensation is payable under this Act:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the worker takes or is entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from a person other than the worker’s employer, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the worker also takes or is entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from that employer, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          the following provisions have effect:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the damages that may be recovered from the person by the worker in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a) are to be reduced by the amount by which the contribution which the person would (but for this Part) be entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise exceeds the amount of the contribution recoverable, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the amount of the contribution that the person is entitled to recover from the employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise is to be determined as if the whole of the damages were assessed in accordance with provisions of Division 3 as to the award of damages, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) if the worker does not take proceedings against that employer or does not accept satisfaction of the judgment against that employer, subsection (1) applies as if the worker had not been entitled to recover damages from that employer, except that:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) if the compensation paid by that employer exceeds the amount of the contribution that could be recovered from that employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise—the indemnity referred to in subsection (1) (d) is for the amount of the excess only, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) if the compensation paid by that employer does not exceed the amount of that contribution—subsection (1) (d) does not apply and the employer has, to the extent of the compensation so paid, a defence to an action for such a contribution.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    25 The reference to “this Part” in section 151Z(2)(c) is to Part 5 of the Act, which runs from section 149 to 151AC. Part 5 includes the “Division 3” that section 151Z(2)(d) refers to.  
     
      
    26 Division 3 in its present form contains provisions that make extensive modifications to the common law concerning the amount of damages that may be awarded in respect of an injury to a worker, where that injury was caused by the negligence or other tort of the worker’s employer. It has consistently been construed as applying where a worker claims such damages from his or her employer, but as not limiting the damages recoverable from someone other than the employer, even if the worker’s injury is caused partly by the tort of the employer and partly by the tort of that other person. Division 3 prohibits the award of damages for certain types of loss that the common law took into account in assessing damages, and limits the amount of damages that may be awarded for certain other heads of damage. No damages at all are recoverable unless the injury results in the death of the worker or in a degree of permanent impairment of the worker that is at least 15% (section 151H(1)). Division 3 also prohibits the awarding of damages for certain types of injuries. It alters the common law concerning mitigation of damages, contributory negligence, voluntary assumption of risk, exemplary or punitive damages, and payment of interest on damages. It alters the “once and for all” rule of the common law, whereby payment of a single sum of money was the means of providing compensation for the entirety of the damage that a plaintiff had suffered up to the time of judgment and might suffer thereafter, by permitting the court to make orders for “structured settlements”.  
     
      
       
      Background to Introduction of Section 151Z(2) 
       
      
    27 As Allen J pointed out in Leonard v Smith (1992) 27 NSWLR 5, section 151Z(2) of the Act was necessitated by legislation that established a special regime that limited the damages recoverable by a worker injured as a result of the tort of his or her employer, and different legislation that established a different special regime that limited the damages of a person injured as a consequence of the negligent driving of a motor vehicle. Even after those two special statutory regimes had been introduced, there remained a significant number of situations in which a person might be injured as a consequence of a tort or other legal wrong to which neither of those special statutory regimes applied, and concerning which damages would be assessed in the common law’s traditional way, with the objective of providing the injured plaintiff with full restitution.  
     
      
    28 Before the two special statutory regimes of damages were introduced, if a worker sustained an injury partly as a consequence of the tort of his or her employer, and partly as a consequence of the legal wrong of some other person, the worker could sue the employer, the other wrongdoer, or both the employer and the other wrongdoer, as the worker might choose. In the usual situation where the other wrongdoer was a tortfeasor, if the worker had decided to sue only one tortfeasor, it was open to that tortfeasor to join the other tortfeasor in the action. Whether the other tortfeasor had been initially joined in the action, or was later joined, it was open to the two tortfeasors to seek contribution from each other, in accordance with section 5(1)(c) Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 (the “1946 Act”). That legislation enabled the court to order contribution by reference to what was “just and equitable having regard to the extent of [each tortfeasor’s] responsibility for the damage”. If the court decided that one tortfeasor was X percent responsible, and the other tortfeasor had a responsibility of (100 minus X) percent, the amount of damages for which each tortfeasor was ultimately held liable was ascertained by applying those percentages to the common law’s single measure – namely, restitution damages – of the quantification of the damage that the worker had suffered as a consequence of the torts.  
     
      
    29 With the enactment of specialised regimes for quantification of damages when a worker sued his or her employer, or when a person sued in connection with a negligent driving of a motor vehicle, this simple way of adjusting liability between the several tortfeasors was no longer available. Section 151Z(2) provided the means by which the ultimate respective liabilities of an employer tortfeasor, and a non-employer wrongdoer, were to be ascertained. 
     
      
    30 There are obiter statements in this Court that section 151Z(2)(c) is capable of operating to reduce the damages a worker can recover from someone other than his or her employer in a situation where the non-employer was legally liable to the worker for the worker’s injury by reason of a cause of action that was not a tort, such as a claim for damages under section 82 Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), the worker’s employer is liable to pay damages to the worker for the same injury, and contribution between the employer and the non-employer is available under the general law rather than under the 1946 Act: Hampic Pty Ltd v Adams [1999] NSWCA 455; (2000) ATPR ¶41-737 at [45], [53]-[59]; Lapcevic v Collier [2002] NSWCA 300 at [87]. It is not necessary to decide the correctness of those obiter statements in this appeal, and I shall not do so, but I shall give an account of section 151Z in a way that accommodates the possibility that those obiter statements will ultimately be adopted as the ratio of a case. 
     
      
    31 This Court has recently considered the operation of section 151Z(2)(c) and (d) in Forstaff Blacktown Pty Ltd v Brimac Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 423; (2005) 4 DDCR 179. I should state at the outset that I disagree with none of the conclusions expressed in paras [74] and [75] of that decision. However, as the conclusions arrived at in those paragraphs of Forstaff assume that the liability of both the employer and the non-employer on which section 151Z(2)(c) and (d) operates is liability as a tortfeasor (and hence contribution between those two tortfeasors occurs only on the basis of the 1946 Act), and as the reasoning by which I have arrived at my conclusions is not identical with that used in Forstaff, I prefer to state my reasons in my own words. 
     
      
       
      Objectives of Section 151Z(2) 
       
      
    32 Section 151Z(2) sought to achieve two separate objectives. The first was that, as between the employer tortfeasor and the non-employer tortfeasor, the same principle of what is “just and equitable having regard to the extent of [a tortfeasor’s] responsibility for the damage” as had previously operated in contribution proceedings under the 1946 Act should continue to apply to divide how liability ultimately fell between them. Likewise, if contribution was available between a wrongdoer and an employer tortfeasor on some other principle, that other principle should continue to apply to divide how liability ultimately fell between them. The second was that the amount that the employer tortfeasor ought ultimately be liable to pay should not be any greater than if its proportionate share of the responsibility for the damage had been applied to an amount of damages that had been quantified under the modified damages provisions of the Act.  
     
      
    33 Section 151Z(2) deals with the consequences of an employer tortfeasor never ending up paying, by way of damages, more than its proportionate share of the responsibility for the worker’s injuries, multiplied by the total damages that the worker is entitled to receive under the modified damages regime established by the Act. The consequences with which it is concerned are on the liability of a non-employer wrongdoer to pay damages to an injured worker, and on the employer’s right under section 151Z(1)(d) to obtain indemnity for workers compensation payments it has made to the worker.  
     
      
       
      Preconditions for Operation of Section 151Z(2) 
       
      
    34 The way in which section 151Z(2) operates is as follows. First, it states, in its chapeau and paras (a) and (b), the preconditions for operation of section 151Z(2). There must be an injury for which compensation is payable under the Act, and both paras (a) and (b) must be satisfied before section 151Z(2) can apply at all. Those two paragraphs are satisfied if the worker is entitled to take proceedings for damages against the worker’s employer, and is also entitled to take proceedings for damages against a wrongdoer who is not the worker’s employer. It is the entitlement of the worker to take those two types of proceedings that matters, not whether the proceedings have actually been taken. The expression “is entitled to take proceedings” is construed as referring to the worker presently having, or at any time having had, that entitlement to sue: Leonard v Smith at 11; Clout Industrial Pty Ltd (in liq) v Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 89; (2004) 61 NSWLR 111 at [20], [52], [68]. 
     
      
       
      Ascertainment of Contribution Recoverable From Employer Tortfeasor 
       
      
    35 The next logical step that is taken in the application of section 151Z(2) is that required by para (d). Section 151Z(2)(d) deals with the amount of contribution that the non-employer wrongdoer can recover from the employer tortfeasor. Application of section 151Z(2)(d) requires the court to assess the amount of the damages to which the worker would have been entitled if all the damages that the worker received were calculated in accordance with the modified common law damages regime established by the Act. It also requires the court to ascertain the respective proportionate responsibilities of the employer tortfeasor and the non-employer wrongdoer. When the employer and the non-employer are both tortfeasors, that will be under the 1946 Act even though section 151Z(2)(d) makes no express mention of the 1946 Act, because that Act provides the only means whereby, under the law of this State, one tortfeasor can recover contribution from another tortfeasor. The manner of operation of the contribution provisions of the 1946 Act has been modified by some subsequent statutes, such as section 12 Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965, and section 19 Civil Liability Act 2002, but it is still the 1946 Act that is the source of any right of contribution between tortfeasors concerning any claim arising out of personal injury. (Section 34(1)(a) Civil Liability Act provides that the more extensive amendments to the law of contribution between tortfeasors made by Part 4 (section 34-39) Civil Liability Act do not apply to “any claim arising out of personal injury”). No argument has been put in this appeal that any of the statutory amendments to the 1946 Act bear upon the present case. 
     
      
    36 Once the amount of modified common law damages, and the proportionate responsibility of the employer tortfeasor have been ascertained, the amount of contribution that the non-employer wrongdoer can recover from the employer tortfeasor is calculated by multiplying the amount of modified common law damages by the proportionate responsibility of the employer tortfeasor. 
     
      
    37 Section 151Z(2)(d) says nothing about the amount of contribution that the employer tortfeasor can recover from the non-employer wrongdoer. However, there is no need for there to be any special statutory provision that deals with the amount of contribution that the employer tortfeasor can recover from the non-employer tortfeasor. That is because if a worker had sued only an employer tortfeasor, who then sought contribution from a non-employer tortfeasor, the damages recoverable by the worker from the employer tortfeasor would, through the operation of provisions of Part 5 of the Act other than section 151Z, be the modified common law damages. The application to those damages of the 1946 Act (or whatever other principle for deriving contribution is applicable) would result in the employer tortfeasor ultimately bearing exactly the same amount of the damages as arises if the worker sues the non-employer wrongdoer who then obtains contribution from the employer tortfeasor under section 151Z(2)(d). 
     
      
    38 The operation of para (d) will have the effect of reducing the amount of contribution that the non-employer wrongdoer can recover from the employer tortfeasor below the amount that would have been recoverable if the damages payable by the employer tortfeasor had continued to be assessed in accordance with the common law’s principle of restitution. Section 151Z(2)(d) is “a substantive provision limiting what otherwise would be the right under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act [1946] to recover contribution from the employer"": Grljak v Trivan Pty Ltd (in liq) (1994) 35 NSWLR 82 at 91. The policy of the Act is that the burden of the reduction that it makes in the amount of contribution recoverable should fall on the worker, not on the non-employer wrongdoer.  
     
      
    39 It is to be observed that there is nothing in section 151Z that positively requires that the damages that the worker can recover from the employer be damages for tort. It well may be that the attempt made in Concrete Constructions (NSW) Pty Ltd v Nelson [1990] HCA 17; (1990) 169 CLR 594 by a worker to use an alleged breach of the Trade Practices Act as a means of recovering damages from his employer for an industrial accident was inspired by the prohibition on damages contained in the Act as originally passed. (The Act commenced operation on 30 June 1987, and the industrial accident involved in Nelson occurred in July 1987). Even though the result of Nelson is that many industrial accidents will not attract liability under the Trade Practices Act because the “in trade or commerce” element of a cause of action under many of the provisions of the Trade Practices Act will be missing, it may be the case that sometimes some other non-tortious cause of action will be available to a worker against his or her employer concerning an industrial injury. 
     
      
    40 While section 151Z(2)(d) requires the contribution that it talks about to be calculated “as if the whole of the damages were assessed in accordance with the provisions of Division 3”, it does not require that any of the damages involved in the calculation actually be assessed in accordance with the provisions of Division 3. Section 151E(1) provides that Division 3 applies only to damages concerning an injury “caused by the negligence or other tort of the worker’s employer”. Thus when Division 3 has work to do in a non-hypothetical situation it can only be when the employer is tortfeasor. (Whether Division 3 applies when the employer is a tortfeasor, but as well a worker has some non-tortious cause of action available against the employer concerning the same injury need not be considered in the present case). It may be that the calculation that is required by section 151Z(2)(d) on the basis “as if the whole of the damages were assessed in accordance with the provisions of Division 3” could be done even when the liability of the employer to pay damages in respect of compensable injury is a liability that does not arise in tort. If that is so, it might possibly be the case that the general account I am giving of how section 151Z(2) operates should be modified to take account of the possibility that the damages against the employer might be as a wrongdoer who is not a tortfeasor. However that issue does not arise on this appeal, and I shall say nothing more about it. 
     
      
       
      Effect of Section 151Z(2)(d) on Damages Worker Can Recover from Non-Employer Wrongdoer 
       
      
    41 Para (c) deals with one of the consequences of the amount of contribution that the non-employer wrongdoer can recover being thus reduced. It gives effect to the Act’s policy in the situation where the worker is suing the non-employer wrongdoer. That is shown by para (c)’s reference to “in proceedings referred to in paragraph (a)” – a reference back to section 151Z(2)(a). Para (c) requires the following steps to be taken: 
     
      
       
      (i) Calculate the total amount of damages that would be payable by the non-employer wrongdoer, if the non-employer wrongdoer bore all the damages. If no statutory modification of the common law applies to that non-employer wrongdoer, the measure of damages will be full restitution damages. If the non-employer wrongdoer has a special statutory regime for calculating damages applicable to it (such as that arising under the  
      Motor Accidents Compensation Act  
      1999 
      , or under the  
      Civil Liability Act  
      2002 
      ) the amount of damages payable by the non-employer wrongdoer will be calculated in accordance with that special statutory regime. 
       
       
      (ii) Calculate in dollars the amount of the contribution which the non-employer wrongdoer would have been entitled to recover from the employer tortfeasor if the modifications to the law effected by Part 5 of the Act had not been made. The amount of that contribution will be ascertained by multiplying the total amount of damages that the non-employer wrongdoer would have to pay, if it were solely liable, by the proportionate responsibility of the employer tortfeasor ascertained in accordance with the  
      1946 Act 
       or any other applicable contribution principle. As Handley JA said in  
      Grljak v Trivan Pty Ltd  
      (Court of Appeal, 19 April 1996, unreported, at 6), calculating the contribution that  
      “but for this Part” 
       the non-employer tortfeasor would be entitled to recover from the employer tortfeasor involves a  
      “statutory fiction” 
      , but it is none the less a fiction that section 151Z(2)(c) requires to be employed. 
       
       
      (iii) Calculate in dollars the amount of the contribution that the non-employer wrongdoer is actually entitled to recover from the employer tortfeasor, in accordance with section 151Z(2)(d). 
       
       
      (iv) Subtract the amount obtained in step (iii) from the amount obtained in step (ii). 
       
       
      (v) Subtract the amount obtained in step (iv) from the amount obtained in step (i). The resulting amount is the amount of damages that the worker can recover from the non-employer wrongdoer. 
       
      
    42 The effect of this is that the non-employer wrongdoer ends up paying no more than it would have had to pay if the modification of the common law by the Act had not been made and the non-employer wrongdoer had recovered contribution from the employer tortfeasor, but the total amount of damages that the worker can recover is less than would have been the case if the employer had not been a tortfeasor. 
     
      
       
      Effect of Section 151Z(2)(d) on Indemnity Recoverable by Employer for Compensation Payments Made 
       
      
    43 Para (e) carries through the policy of the Act in a different situation. 
     
      
    44 It is the prima facie effect of section 151Z(1)(d) that an employer who has paid compensation to a worker is entitled to recover the amount of that compensation from any non-employer wrongdoer whose wrong has caused the injury that led to the payment of the compensation, provided only that the non-employer wrongdoer does not end up paying more than the amount of the damages which the non-employer wrongdoer would have had to pay if sued for that wrong. Further, that prima facie right of the employer under section 151Z(1)(d) is one that the employer has whether or not the employer is itself a tortfeasor who has caused the injury to the worker with respect to which the compensation has been paid. 
     
      
    45 Section 151Z(2)(e) modifies that prima facie situation in a situation where (A) the worker has an entitlement to take proceedings for damages against both the employer and a non-employer, and (B) the worker has not taken proceedings against his employer or, having taken those proceedings and obtained a judgment, has not either (i) been paid the amount of the judgment or (ii) received whatever it may be that the worker has agreed to accept in satisfaction of the worker’s right to be paid the amount of the judgment. 
     
      
    46 In that situation the following steps are to be carried out: 
     
      
       
      (i) Ascertain the amount of compensation that has been paid by the employer. 
       
       
      (ii) Ascertain the amount of contribution that the employer would have been liable to make, under section 151Z(2)(d), to the non-employer wrongdoer. 
       
       
      (iii) If the amount ascertained in step (i) is greater than the amount ascertained in step (ii), the indemnity obtainable by the employer under section 151Z(1)(d) is not the prima facie amount, but is only the amount by which the amount ascertained in accordance with step (i) is greater than the amount ascertained in accordance with step (ii). 
       
       
      (iv) If the amount ascertained in accordance with step (i) is less than the amount ascertained in accordance with step (ii) the employer has no right of indemnity at all from the non-employer wrongdoer. However, if the non-employer wrongdoer were at some time to sue the employer seeking contribution, the employer would have a defence to that action for contribution, in an amount equal to the amount of the contributions it had paid. 
       
       
      How Contributory Negligence of a Worker Fits Into Section 151Z 
       
      
    47 Contributory negligence has effect on the quantum of damages through section 9 Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1965. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If a person (the  
        claimant 
        ) suffers damage as the result partly of the claimant’s failure to take reasonable care ( 
        contributory negligence 
        ) and partly of the wrong of any other person:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a claim in respect of the damage is not defeated by reason of the contributory negligence of the claimant, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the damages recoverable in respect of the wrong are to be reduced to such extent as the court thinks just and equitable having regard to the claimant’s share in the responsibility for the damage.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    48 Whether a worker has been injured partly as a result of failure to take reasonable care for his or her own safety enters into the operation of section 151Z in several places.  
     
      
    · Contributory negligence can sometimes operate to reduce the amount of the damages that a non-employer wrongdoer is liable to pay to the worker, and so affect directly the upper limit on the indemnity that an employer can recover under section 151Z(1)(d).  
     
      
    · It can affect the calculation of the damages that can be recovered from a non-employer wrongdoer if Part 5 of the Act had not been enacted, and thereby enter into the operation of Section 151Z(2)(c).  
     
      
    · It can (as modified by section 151N of the Act) affect the calculation of the amount of damages that an employer tortfeasor is liable to pay to the worker, and thus the amount of the contribution that a non-employer wrongdoer can recover from the employer if all the damages are assessed in accordance with the provisions of Division 3 of Part 5 of the Act. In that way, contributory negligence enters into the operation of section 151Z(2)(d).  
     
      
    · If contributory negligence entered in this last mentioned way into the operation of section 151Z(2)(d), it would have a consequential effect on the operation of section 151Z(2)(e).  
     
      
    49 While the detail of the manner in which the law of contributory negligence operates has been affected by sections 5R–5T Civil Liability Act, it was not submitted that those provisions of the Civil Liability Act bore upon the facts in the present case. 
     
      
       
      Trial Judge’s Findings on Where this Case Fits Into Section 151Z(2) 
       
      
    50 The trial judge found that the Appellant had breached a duty of care which it owed to the Worker, and had thereby caused the injuries that led to the payments of compensation being made by the Respondent. The trial judge also held that the Respondent was in breach of a duty of care which it owed to the Worker, and that that breach of duty had also caused the injuries in question. Thus, the trial judge held that the Worker was “entitled to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from” both the Appellant, and the Respondent. Hence, he reasoned, the preconditions for the operation of section 151Z(2) were satisfied. Further, because the Worker had not taken any proceedings against her employer, it was the provisions of section 151Z(2)(e) that governed the availability to the Respondent of an indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) concerning the amount of compensation it had paid. 
     
      
    51 The trial judge held that the amount of damages that the Worker would be entitled to if the whole of the damages were assessed in accordance with Division 3 was nil because the 15% threshold for damages was not passed. Thus, he reasoned, the amount of contribution that could be recovered from the employer under section 151Z(2)(d) was also nil.  
     
      
    52 Even though the trial judge gave no express consideration to it, from the fact that he applied section 151Z(2)(d) at all, it seems that he took the view that the preconditions for operation of section 151Z(2) were satisfied. In taking that view he was acting consistently with the decision of this Court in Grljak v Trivan Pty Ltd (in liq) (1994) 35 NSWLR 82. The Court there considered two separate arguments.  
     
      
    53 The first argument was that, because the right of a worker to sue an employer for damages was totally abolished when the Act was first enacted in 1987, but the regime of modified common law damages was established by an amendment to the Act in 1989, the right of a worker to sue the employer was purely one that arose under the Act, and so not one “to take proceedings independently of this Act to recover damages from” the employer. Mahoney JA (with whom Kirby P and Priestley JA agreed) held that the right to sue for damages, as reinstated in 1989, was still a common law right, not a purely statutory one.  
     
      
    54 The second argument was that a worker is not “entitled to take proceedings” to recover damages if the result of those proceedings is that, because the circumstances in which the Act permitted recovery of damages against an employer did not apply, the worker actually recovers no damages. Mahoney JA rejected that argument, saying at 88: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not think that this is the intended operation of par (b). The test which in this regard par (b) applies is “entitlement”. The entitlement is entitlement “to take proceedings” not “to recover damages”. It looks, I think, to the existence of what conventionally is described as a cause of action rather than to whether the enforcement of the cause of action will result in an award of damages. I am conscious that, in principle, a right of action in negligence or for breach of statutory duty involves the proof not merely of duty and breach of duty, but also of loss by the plaintiff. I do not think that it was the intention of the 1989 amendments to alter the nature of a proceeding of this kind at common law. The purpose and effect of the 1989 amendments was to change and, in many respects, to limit the damages which could be awarded and the way in which they were to be quantified. But that, in the relevant sense, does not go to the “entitlement” to bring the proceeding; it goes rather to the quantum of the damages which (if any) may be recoverable. Accordingly, the fact that, in the proceeding to recover damages, the assessments made by the trial judge are such that, in the event, no damages are awarded does not mean that, within par (b), the worker was not “entitled to take proceedings … to recover damages from” the employer.” 
        
       
      
    55 That the preconditions for operation of section 151Z(2) are satisfied even when no damages are recoverable from an employer because the worker’s injuries do not pass the threshold is also implicit in the decisions of this Court that section 151Z(2)(c) is capable of operating to reduce the damages recoverable by a worker from a non-employer tortfeasor even when the contribution “recoverable” from the employer is zero: Grljak v Trivan Pty Ltd (in liq) (1994) 35 NSWLR 82 at 89; Grljak v Trivan Pty Ltd (Court of Appeal, 19 April 1996, unreported) at 5; Clout Industrial Pty Ltd (in liq) v Baiada Poultry Pty Ltd [2004] NSWCA 89; (2004) 61 NSWLR 111 at [50], 130 per Giles JA; Forstaff Blacktown Pty Ltd v Brimac Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 423; (2005) 4 DDCR 179 at [107], 204-5 per McColl JA.  
     
      
       
      Circumstances of the Worker’s Injury 
       
       
      The System of Work 
       
      
    56 The Worker’s duties were performed in part of the Appellant’s warehouse known as the “decombi area”. It included a shelving system consisting of tall blocks of shelves, each block separated from its neighbours by a very narrow laneway, and each block several storeys high. A system of conveyors ran perpendicular to those narrow laneways, above a mezzanine floor. Each conveyor was a combination of a central belt and rollers on both sides of the belt. At the outer extremity of each side of the conveyor was a steel rail about an inch wide, elevated somewhat from the bed of the conveyor. It operated as a guide, to help to stop items that were travelling along the conveyor from falling off. 
     
      
    57 There were three different conveyors that were located at different heights above the floor of the mezzanine level. The bottom conveyor was about a metre from the floor, the middle conveyor about waist high, and the top conveyor about armpit height. The conveyors were used to bring empty receptacles for goods into the shelving system. Then, once the receptacles had had goods placed into them, the conveyors were used to transport goods from the shelving system, to the place where the goods were needed. Branches of that conveyor system fed into each of the narrow laneways.  
     
      
    58 In each laneway was an “elevating and translating platform” that operated somewhat like a cherry picker. An operator stood on it, and could manoeuvre it to travel either along its laneway, or up and down in height, and thereby reach any part of the shelving system. Having thus reached the appropriate part of the shelving system the operator would remove from the shelf any particular goods that were needed, and place them in a bucket-like plastic receptacle shaped like a rectangular prism that lay on its longest and widest side, was hollow, and had no top. These bucket-like receptacles were called “totes”.  
     
      
    59 The system involved paperwork identifying the type of goods that were needed being placed into an empty tote outside the decombi area, and that tote being transported by the conveyor system to one of the operators of a mobile platform, who would use the platform to ""pick and pack"" the required items – i.e., locate the required items in the shelving system, and then place them in the tote. The filled tote would then be placed on the conveyor system which would take it to the place where it was required. In this way the conveyors in the decombi area were just one part of a more complex system for the procuring and storing of large quantities of many different types of goods, and the supplying of goods to meet particular orders of customers.  
     
      
    60 Different coloured totes were used to indicate orders that were especially urgent, or orders that were to go to a special destination. Use of the different coloured totes enabled the workers in the decombi area to prioritise their work. Sometimes an employee of the Appellant also gave a specific instruction if particular urgency needed to be accorded to a particular order. 
     
      
    61 The Appellant had carried on its business at the factory in question since 1979. The system whereby goods were transported within the warehouse using the conveyor lines had been in operation for that time. 
     
      
       
      How the Worker Fit Into the System 
       
      
    62 At Easter 1997 all the unskilled staff who had previously worked in the Appellant’s warehouse were made redundant, and the Respondent provided an entire substitute workforce of about 90 people. The Worker was part of that substitute workforce. She had been working at the Appellant’s warehouse for about four months at the time she was injured. 
     
      
    63 After the unskilled workers at the Appellant’s warehouse were made redundant, three managerial employees of the Appellant remained working at the warehouse – Mr Geoff Leak was the warehouse manager, Mr Gordon Clark was the assistant manager, and Mr Cal Rixon was the dispatch manager. They were assisted in their duties in the warehouse by a number of other employees of the Appellant. Mr Clark had worked at the warehouse since 1995. He said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Those Blackwood’s employees and the management team were responsible on a day to day basis for the direction and control of the Skilled workers in the performance of their various tasks, weren’t they? 
         
        A. Initially, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That was after Easter 1997 we are talking about? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. … Skilled Engineering brought in a number of unskilled employees to operate various areas such as the decombi area or the picking and packing there and those workers needed direction and control in what they were doing. It wasn’t a complex system, but it was a system that required some knowledge to keep the factory working, wasn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that knowledge resided in you and the warehouse manager and other Blackwood staff, that’s true isn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you had personally developed that over the last period of 95/96 and into 97? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    64 The Worker gave evidence in the proceedings. The trial judge said of her: 
     
      
       
        
        “She struck me as being a very frank witness. She was not one of the parties in these proceedings, that is, there was no reason for her to exaggerate or to distort the true facts.” 
        
       
      
    65 When the Worker first began to do work of any kind for the Respondent she was shown a video that related to industrial safety procedures generally. After she was chosen to join the new workforce to be sent to the Appellant’s factory the members of the new workforce were given some training by the Respondent in meetings at the Wetherill Park RSL. Some people wearing T-shirts or labels bearing the Appellant’s name were there also. This occurred before there was allocation of specific tasks amongst workers.  
     
      
    66 Two busloads of workers were taken to the Appellant’s factory, where they were addressed by two employees of Blackwood, Mr Clark and a woman referred to as lady “L” (because the Worker was not sure of her name). They told the Worker “what to do and what not to do in the Blackwood's factory”. The Worker was allocated to the decombi area, and instructed how to use the apparatus there by Mr Clark and the lady L.  
     
      
    67 Mr Clark acted as the overseer of the Worker, and gave her instructions as to her day-to-day duties.  
     
      
    68 The Worker said that 
     
      
       
        
        “Gordon and lady “L” walked the whole of the bottom area of Blackwood’s supervising everybody in there.""  
        
       
       
      Lady L ceased doing this work two weeks after the Worker first arrived at the factory. 
       
      
    69 Mr Clark gave evidence:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And the most significant part of your day, that is greater than 50 per cent, was going from section to section to assess how the system was working? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. With the changeover at Easter your role as assistant manager and your duties continued in the same manner, didn’t they? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You would walk the floor, you would assess how the areas were performing? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you would assess how the Skilled workers were performing their tasks, that’s true isn’t it? 
         
        A. As a department, yes.” 
        
       
      
    70 Mr Clark also said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Nonetheless the Skilled employees did not have the wealth of experience that the Blackwood employees did in operating the warehouse did they? 
         
        A. No, they did not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. They were entirely reliant upon you and the other Blackwood staff as to how the place worked weren’t they? 
         
        A. I’m not sure how to answer this. Could I just say that they relied on the people that were placed in each strategic section, being decombis and other areas you mentioned and I would assist those people to do that, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Those people you referred to were also Skilled employees weren’t they? 
         
        A. No they were not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. They were Blackwood’s staff? 
         
        A. Yes I thought I mentioned a couple of times that we placed experienced personnel in each department. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And they were Blackwood’s employees weren’t they? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And those Blackwood’s employees and the Blackwood’s staff, the management staff, taught the Skilled employees how the system worked didn’t they? 
         
        A. Yes they did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And directed their day to day activities didn’t they? 
         
        A. Yes they did.” 
        
       
      
    71 The Worker gave evidence that “there was a yellow painted line in front of the entrance of the decombi area and anyone that was not working in the decombi area was not allowed to go past that yellow line.” Mr Clark had an office that “was just above the whole warehouse area and it had windows all around, so he could see everything that was going on downstairs.” 
     
      
    72 An employee of the Respondent, Mr Barry Woodham, was on the site of the warehouse most of the time. On occasions when he was away he was relieved by another supervisor from the Respondent. He had an office there, but not near the Worker. The Worker explained his role:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. And your recollection is that he explained that he was to supervise you at Blackwoods? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You understood that as a supervisor he was somebody that you could go to or that he would direct you to do things? 
         
        A. That we could go to. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. Not the directing but. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That you could go to if there was any concern that you had in relation to the work being carried out at Blackwoods? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Again, just clarifying your understanding that he was your supervisor, in other words, the next level up, the person you could go to? 
         
        A. Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You were told that by Skilled Engineering weren’t you? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    73 She explained the respective responsibilities of Mr Clark and Mr Woodham:  
     
      
       
        
        “A. Barry – we just went to Barry if there was a problem. Barry didn’t allocate work at all for us. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who allocated the work? 
         
        A. Gordon did.” 
        
       
      
    74 Mr Woodham's own account of his duties was:  
     
      
       
        
        “To co-ordinate the time sheets, to be there, to be made available for people that wished to see me or ask me questions or as a point of contact for the Blackwood’s management. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In what circumstance would the Blackwood’s management contact you? 
         
        A. That they would need staff moved from one area to another, that they would have a foreseen extra workload in another area and they would say that we need staff moved so I would co-ordinate that with their instruction.” 
        
       
      
    75 He also gave evidence:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In terms of hours of work and lunch breaks and smokos, were they included in the site rules and dos and don’ts? 
         
        A. Yes they were. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And who set those? 
         
        A. Blackwoods. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And who enforced those? 
         
        A. Blackwoods. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. With regard to the decombi area, were you aware of a need for prioritisation of orders at times? 
         
        A. No, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you aware of who had control of the decombi area on a day to day basis? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who was that? 
         
        A. Blackwoods. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And who in particular during the period March to August 1997? 
         
        A. Gordon Clark and Geoff Alcock. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did that include the Skilled workers operating the decombi area-- 
         
        A. Yes it did.” 
        
       
      
    76 His duties on the factory floor during the course of the day were to act “as the liaison between Skilled and Blackwood's.” He had a daily meeting with Mr Clark, at which he could have raised any matters of concern that he had. 
     
      
       
      Blockages on the Conveyor 
       
      
    77 From time to time a tote that had been placed on a conveyor would become jammed. There were “many, many blockages” of the conveyor. The blockages always occurred on the top line. The trial judge found that “whenever the workers had a problem with a jammed tote it was necessary for the workers to unblock the jammed tote immediately because the other totes would pile up and fall from the conveyor.” 
     
      
    78 The Worker’s evidence included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now did anyone give you any instruction as to any action when a blockage occurred or when a jam occurred? 
         
        A. Yes Gordon [Clark] actually climbed on to the conveyor belt and showed us how to unblock it. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When do you recall first observing a blockage or a jam, involving a tote at the Blackwood’s factory after you started? 
         
        A. Within a week. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What, if anything, occurred when that blockage happened? 
         
        A. The totes blocked up, so someone was sent down to get Gordon so that Gordon could have a look and let us know what was going to happen, none of us knew what we were going to do about the blockage. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. Gordon came down to the decombi area, I personally then turned around with a few others and asked Gordon, “How do we unblock it?” Gordon then climbed onto the conveyor belt and showed us how to unblock the conveyor belt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did he do? 
         
        A. He climbed onto the bottom of the conveyor belt, pulled the tote across, took the tote off and came down to us with the tote. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was he standing on the conveyor belt? 
         
        A. He was standing on the conveyor belt. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When he took the tote off, did he put it down on the ground or -- 
         
        A. He put it on the ground and then picked it up, he put it down, dropped it, he then came off the conveyor belt and came down to us with the tote. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did he say anything to you? 
         
        A. He just said “That’s how we unblock the conveyor belt.” 
        
       
      
    79 On occasions Mr Clark was there when a blockage occurred, and a worker climbed onto the conveyor belt to unblock it.  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. On how many occasions do you recall him being there? 
         
        A. At least three times a week when a tote would jam, you could guarantee that Gordon would be there at least one of those times.” 
        
       
      
    80 The Worker gave evidence:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you recall on any occasion talking to Gordon about the jamming of the totes on the conveyor belt? 
         
        A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall if that was on more than one occasion? 
         
        A. Yes it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall how many occasions you might have talked to him? 
         
        A. Two – three occasions. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall what you said on one of those occasions? 
         
        A. That it wasn’t safe for us to be climbing onto the conveyor belt, that we did need ladders there to unblock the top line. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you recall what Gordon said to you? 
         
        A. Yes I was told to go back to work and he’d look into it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What, if any, difference would ladders have made in regard to unblocking the conveyor belt? 
         
        A. Well, if there were ladders there, you wouldn’t be standing on the bottom conveyor belt which is made up of just little rings that allows the tote to flow. Standing on the conveyor belt you had to try and balance yourself as well as get the tote. If there was a ladder there, you wouldn’t have to worry about the wheels or anything else spinning underneath your feet. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you repeat that request for ladders to Gordon on other occasions? 
         
        A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What was his response? 
         
        A. The same as it was the first time, go back to work and he would look into it.” 
        
       
      
    81 As well as the Worker herself asking Mr Clark for a ladder, she heard another worker in the decombi section also asking Mr Clark that a ladder be provided. She gave evidence  
     
      
       
        
        “I complained to Gordon about needing ladders and I was told to go back to work it’d be seen to. You had to do as you were told or you were out of there.” 
        
       
      
    82 Mr Clark’s evidence was that he had not demonstrated to workers how to unblock a tote by climbing onto the conveyor belt, but the trial judge did not accept his evidence in that respect. The judge accepted the Worker’s evidence on this topic. 
     
      
    83 After the Worker felt uneasy in the course of her first experience of climbing up onto the conveyor to unblock the tote, she said she sought Mr Woodham out and told him ""that it wasn't safe for us to be doing it"", and that ""we needed ladders"". He ""said that he’d look into it"". Mr Woodham did not recall any such incident. Indeed, his evidence was that he would not have approved of using a ladder to climb up to unblock the totes, because he regarded even that method as unsafe. The trial judge accepted the Worker’s evidence on this topic also. 
     
      
    84 No ladder was provided by anyone prior to the Worker sustaining her injury. 
     
      
    85 As to the accessibility of Mr Woodham, the Worker said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You could have gone, could you not, left the decombi and walked over to where Mr Woodham was? There was no problem with that? 
         
        A. A little bit of a problem in the fact that we weren’t allowed to leave our decombi until it was our break times. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But it wasn’t working, the conveyor belt was blocked? 
         
        A. Yeah, that doesn’t matter because as soon as the conveyor belt stops and it’s unblocked its no more than five minutes and it would take you actually longer than five minutes to get from the decombi area down to where Barry would have been.” 
        
       
      
    86 There was an occupational health and safety officer at the warehouse, with whom Mr Woodham had occasional meetings. The usual practice was that if he raised anything with the occupational health and safety person, it would be followed up. 
     
      
       
      The Worker’s Injury 
       
      
    87 On the occasion when the Worker was injured a tote travelling along the top conveyor had become jammed. The conveyors were stopped, whereupon the Worker went to the mezzanine floor, climbed onto the bottom conveyor, stood upright on it, lent towards the jammed tote, and lifted it. She then sought to place the tote on the middle conveyor. She found that the tote had an unusually heavy load in it. Having lifted the tote, the Worker twisted her body in order to place the tote on the middle conveyor. In the course of so doing she felt a sharp pain in her right knee. It is the injury that she thus sustained that led to the Respondent making workers compensation payments to her.  
     
      
       
      Findings Concerning Breach of Duty 
       
      
    88 Dr Johnn Olsen, a consultant physician in occupational and environmental medicine, gave evidence that the rails at the side of the conveyor gave inadequate foothold for obtaining access to places above the conveyor, both because the rails were only one inch wide, and because they were likely to be greasy. He expressed the view that the use of a stepladder would have been a reasonable alternative to the use of standing on the side rails of the lower conveyor for access to the upper conveyor. He identified inadequacies in the system of work as being, failure to provide a suitable ladder or other suitable platform; failure to adequately supervise the work to identify hazards; and inadequate instruction of workers to avoid a dangerous situation. Dr Olsen was not cross-examined. 
     
      
    89 The trial judge concluded that there was an unsafe system of work in operation at the time of the accident. He found that the Appellant exercised day-to-day control over the employees of the Respondent in their daily work in the Appellant’s commercial activities, and the Respondent did not. In particular he accepted that it was the Appellant, not the Respondent, who had given instructions to the workers in relation to the work to be done in the decombi area. He accepted that it was foreseeable that a worker could stand on a conveyor belt to unblock a jammed tote, and that it would have been a relatively cheap and easy thing for the Appellant to have provided a ladder for the Worker to allow her to unblock a jammed tote without having to climb onto the belt. He held that there was a breach of duty on the Appellant’s part in failing to devise and maintain a safe system of work, including an appropriate system to ensure that workers were not unreasonably exposed to risk of injury in unjamming totes on the top conveyor line. He was satisfied that this breach of duty on the part of the Appellant caused the Worker’s injury.  
     
      
    90 The Respondent conceded that it owed the Worker a non-delegable duty to take reasonable care that she was provided with a safe system of work. It is implicit in the judgment of the trial judge that the absence of a safe system of work relating to the manner of unblocking jammed totes, that could readily have been remedied, was in itself a breach of that duty. The trial judge was also satisfied that the Worker had asked Mr Woodham to provide a ladder, that her request was ignored by Mr Woodham, and that the Respondent took no action towards devising a system of work which removed the risk of injury to the plaintiff while she was working at the conveyor belts.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – Duty of Care Owed by the Appellant  
       
      
    91 The trial judge held that the Appellant owed to the Worker “a duty to take reasonable care to avoid foreseeable risk of harm occurring to the worker analogous to that owed by an employer to an employee. The plaintiff has referred me to the Court of Appeal decision of Forstaff Blacktown Limited v Brimac Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 423, at paragraphs 35 and 36”. Forstaff is now reported at (2005) 4 DDCR 179. It was the finding that the duty was “analogous to that owed by an employer to an employee” that was the subject of the first ground of appeal.  
     
      
    92 Forstaff was another case involving a worker employed by a labour hire company, who was injured while working at the premises of a company to whom the worker was hired. The occupier of the premises in that case was Brimac. McColl JA (with whom Hodgson and Ipp JJA agreed, save on a point not presently relevant) said at [35]-[36], 189: 
     
      
       
        
        “Brimac’s effective concession that the primary judge correctly concluded that it owed a duty to take reasonable care to avoid the risk of injury to Mr Johnston akin to that of an employer was, in my view, properly made. The evidence revealed that Mr Johnston had been working for Brimac for several weeks prior to the accident. He was working there five days a week and received his instructions on a daily basis from a leading hand employed by Brimac. He wore safety clothing supplied by Brimac and used its equipment. It is apparent, in such circumstances, that Brimac treated Mr Johnston as its worker: see  
        TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie 
         [2003] NSWCA 47; (2003) 65 NSWLR 1 at [41]. 
        
       
       
        
        In such circumstances, Brimac’s duty was clear. It owed a non-delegable duty to take reasonable care to avoid exposing Mr Johnston to unnecessary risks of injury.” 
        
       
      
    93 In its written submissions the Appellant dealt together with the questions of whether the Appellant owed the Worker such a duty of care, whether the Appellant had breached any such duty, and apportionment of responsibility between the Appellant and the Respondent. It should in fairness be said that the Appellant did not submit that it owed no duty of care at all to the Worker. Rather, the forensic thrust of its submission was that any duty it owed was not the same as the comparatively stringent non-delegable duty that an employer owes to an employee, and that that difference should be reflected in the apportionment of responsibility between Appellant and Respondent. 
     
      
    94 Even so, it is necessary to identify whether the Appellant owed a duty of care to the Worker at all, and the content of any such duty so far as is relevant to the facts of the particular case. It is unnecessary for the purposes of this case to enter into the debate about whether the content of a duty of care is properly seen as part of the question of existence of a duty, or part of the question of breach: Sheather v Country Energy [2007] NSWCA 179 at [20]–[21] per Hodgson JA cf at [55]–[68] per Ipp JA. One way or another, both the existence of a duty and its content must be identified, because it is only by making that identification that one can be clear about whether any such duty of care has been broken, and if so, the respects in which the Appellant and the Respondent have each failed in their duty to the Worker. Identifying the respects in which they have each failed in their respective duties to the Worker is necessary to be able to form a view about the causal contribution that each of those failures has made to the injury that the Worker has suffered, and the culpability of those failures. Any apportionment of responsibility between the Appellant and the Respondent requires such an assessment of the causal significance of any breach of duty of each of them, and of their culpability concerning any such breach of duty. Those factors of causal significance and culpability were identified by the High Court in Podrebersek v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Limited [1985] HCA 34; (1985) 59 ALJR 492 at 494 and (1985) 59 ALR 529 at 532–533 as ones relevant to apportionment of responsibility between a defendant and plaintiff who has been guilty of contributory negligence. When the wording of the statutory test by reference to which apportionment for contributory negligence is made is the same as the statutory test by reference to which apportionment of contribution between tortfeasors is made, those factors are equally relevant to apportionment of contribution between tortfeasors. 
     
      
    95 The Appellant pointed out (correctly) that both Forstaff Blacktown Limited v Brimac Pty Ltd and TNT Australia v Christie [2003] NSWCA 47; (2003) 65 NSWLR 1 involved a worker who was an employee of a labour hire company whose services were made available to an enterprise which then exercised comprehensive control of the circumstances and manner in which the employee carried out his daily duties.  
     
      
    96 In TNT Mason P at [41], 9 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “TNT exercised day to day control over the plaintiff’s work activities, treating him to all intents the same as its employees as regards work on the factory floor … It can be seen that the plaintiff and TNT placed themselves in a relationship, day in and day out, indistinguishable from that of employee and employer. I am not saying that every client of an employment bureau will assume such a relationship with a person at whose workplace he or she attends. But here the plaintiff had for months been under the daily control of TNT 
          
        and its managerial staff at the brewery. He was a relatively unskilled labourer. He reported daily to the brewery and everything that he did there was done under the full control of TNT. TNT’s 
          
        relationship was more than that of an occupier of a factory. In all respects relevant to the imposition of a duty of care the plaintiff was in an identical position to the four TNT 
          
        employees with whom he worked.” 
        
       
      
    97 By contrast, the Appellant submits, in the present case the Respondent had a full-time employee (either Mr Woodham, or his substitute) at the warehouse all the time. As well, in both Forstaff and TNT the “hired” employee was integrated into an existing workforce of the occupier of the premises, while in the present case all the unskilled workers of the Appellant were replaced. Further, the Appellant points out (accurately) that the Worker in the present case wore a name badge that bore the name of the Respondent and (one would infer) had been supplied by it.  
     
      
    98 Those factual distinctions between the present case (on the one hand) and Forstaff and TNT (on the other) do not suffice to show that in the present case the Respondent owed a duty to the Worker that differed in any presently relevant respect from that owed by an employer to an employee. 
     
      
    99 By virtue of the contract of employment, the Respondent had a legal right to direct the Worker concerning the day-to-day conduct of her work. However, by its conduct, the Respondent made clear to the Worker that what it required of her was to do work of the type and in the manner directed from time to time by the Appellant. The work of the Worker at the Appellant’s warehouse involved her, so far as has any causal bearing on her injury, in using equipment installed and supplied by the Appellant, in the course of carrying out a system of work that was devised and supervised by the Appellant. Her work in the decombi area was one part of a larger industrial operation that the Appellant carried out. It was the Appellant who had instructed her in the manner of carrying out the particular work tasks she was required to perform. By the yellow line the Appellant required people it had not authorised to keep out of the decombi area. Mr Clark and the other employees of the Appellant exercised personal supervision over the Worker. Even though all the unskilled workers of the Appellant were replaced, the Appellant continued to employ managerial staff and experienced workers who supervised and instructed the workers supplied by the Respondent, so that those new workers could carry out the same tasks, in accordance with the same system, as the replaced workers had previously carried out. In those circumstances, the Appellant was under a duty to workers in the position of the Worker to take reasonable care to provide a safe system of work. The duty arises from the particular relationship between the Appellant and the workers, in a similar way to that in which a company that coordinates the activities of various people working in a common enterprise can have an obligation to set a safe system of work even if the people involved are not its employees (Stevens v Brodribb Sawmilling Co Pty Ltd [1986] HCA 1; (1986) 160 CLR 16 at [29], 31), or an occupier with control over premises can have an obligation to provide warnings in relation to dangerous features of those premises (Maricic v Dalma Formwork (Australia) Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 174 at [47]-[53]). 
     
      
    100 That Mr Woodham had the opportunity to have input into the conditions under which the Respondent’s employees worked at the Appellant’s warehouse, and may well have been listened to if he had complained about the inadequacy of the system of work insofar as it affected the Worker, does not relieve the Appellant of its duty of care. That the Respondent provided the Worker with some generalised industrial safety training, and some other industrial safety training not related to the specific tasks she was required to perform in the decombi area, does not relieve the Appellant of its duty of care.  
     
      
    101 If the Worker had been injured through a chain of events in which her name badge played a causal part, this analysis might possibly be different. But when her wearing the name badge is irrelevant to the cause of her injuries, and is not an indicium of how any relevant training occurred or day-to-day control of activities in the warehouse was exercised, it has no bearing on any relevant duty that is owed by the Appellant to the Worker. 
     
      
    102 An employer owes a variety of different duties to its employee independently of statute, and the common law makes those duties non-delegable. It is not necessary to examine whether the duties owed by the Appellant were co-extensive with those owed by the Respondent, across the full range of the duties that the Respondent owed to the Worker. That is because only one aspect of an employer’s duty to an employee was relevant in the present case, namely that requiring the employer to take reasonable steps to provide a safe system of work.  
     
      
    103 McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Hayden JJ pointed out in Koehler v Cerebos (Australia) Ltd [2005] HCA 15; (2005) 222 CLR 44 at [19]-[22], 53-54, that it can be inviting error to assume that there is a one-size-fits-all duty of care owed between all people who are in a relationship that can be categorised in a particular way, without considering the other obligations, both contractual and statutory, that exist between the parties. However in the present case there is no other obligation existing between the Respondent and the Worker that requires any qualification to the usual duty of an employer to provide a safe system of work. 
     
      
    104 The first ground of appeal seizes upon a particular phrase that the trial judge used, that the duty owed by the Appellant was “analogous to that owed by an employer to an employee” without seeking to take into account how that phrase fits into the overall reasoning of the judge. It need hardly be said that a finding that the duty was “analogous to that owed by an employer to an employee” would be an inadequate one, if that was all that was said about the existence of duty and it did not make clear in what respect the analogies existed. But the trial judge said more about the existence of duty, and was quite specific about the respect in which the relevant analogies existed. He found explicitly that:  
     
      
       
        
        ""… there was a breach of duty by the defendant by failing to devise and maintain a safe system of work, including an appropriate system to ensure that workers were not unreasonably exposed to risk of injury in unjamming totes on the top conveyor line."" 
        
       
      
    105 It is the latter finding that contains his operative finding concerning the relevant duty that existed. That finding is correct. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – Apportionment of Responsibility 
       
      
    106 On the appeal it remained common ground that the Respondent, as an employer, owed a duty of care to the Worker. The content of the duty is stated by Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Hayne, Callinan and Heydon JJ in Czatyrko v Edith Cowan University [2005] HCA 14; (2005) 79 ALJR 839 at [12], 842-843: 
     
      
       
        
        “An employer owes a non-delegable duty of care to its employees to take reasonable care to avoid exposing them to unnecessary risks of injury. If there is a real risk of an injury to an employee in the performance of a task in the workplace, the employer must take reasonable care to avoid the risk by devising a method of operation for the performance of the task that eliminates the risk, or by the provision of adequate safeguards.” 
        
       
      
    107 The fact that the Respondent operated a business of making its employees available to work in the enterprises of others did not relieve the Respondent from its duty to its employees: TNT Australia Pty Ltd v Christie at [67]-[69], 15-16; Burke v Victorian Work Cover Authority [1998] VSCA 24; [1999] 1 VR 189; Atkinson v Gameco (NSW) Pty Ltd [2005] NSWCA 338 at [18]-[19]. The specific breach of duty that the trial judge found the Respondent had engaged in was breach in its duty to provide a safe system of work.  
     
      
    108 Turning to how responsibility for these breaches should be apportioned, it was an inadequacy in the manner of operation of the conveyor system that the Appellant supplied that caused the totes to jam in the first place, requiring the Worker to unjam them. However, it was not suggested that having a conveyor system that had a tendency to jam was itself negligence. Rather, the fact that there was a known, and frequently occurring, risk of the conveyor system jamming, made it important for the Appellant to provide a means by which the problem could be fixed without exposing a worker to unreasonable risk of injury. Without that means being provided, there would not be, so far as this particular warehouse was concerned, a safe system of work. It was adoption of the precise method of unjamming that Mr Clark had instructed the Worker in, that led to the injury.  
     
      
    109 Taking steps to have available equipment that is needed for work to take place safely is part of providing a safe system of work. There is no suggestion in the evidence that, as between the Appellant and the Respondent, it was any part of the Respondent’s tasks to itself provide any equipment for use by its employees at the warehouse. If a ladder was to be provided to enable the totes to be unjammed, it would be the Appellant who provided it. It did not do so even when asked. In all these respects the Appellant was in breach of its duties to the Worker.  
     
      
    110 Because the Respondent’s duty as employer was non-delegable, the fact that it had handed over to the Appellant the task of providing the equipment and systems of work with which the Worker worked, does not relieve it from liability when that equipment and system of work proved defective, in a readily avoidable way, and injured the Worker.  
     
      
    111 The trial judge correctly recognised that Mr Woodham had the opportunity to avoid the very problem which eventually caused the Worker to be injured, yet he did not take it. 
     
      
    112 At its most basic level, the cause of the Worker being injured was the absence of a safe system of work, and both the Appellant and the Respondent were at fault in there being no safe system of work. However apportionment of responsibility for the purpose of contribution should be performed with greater attention to detail than this, if the evidence permits. When the trial judge assessed the respective responsibilities of the Appellant and the Respondent as being in the ratio 70:30, he evidently regarded the causal significance of the Appellant’s breaches, and the culpability of those breaches, as being significantly greater than the causal significance and the culpability of the Respondent’s breaches. I agree.  
     
      
    113 The particular figures that the trial judge chose shows that he regarded the significance of the Appellant’s breaches as being a little more than twice as serious as the significance of the Respondent’s breaches. He made specific mention of the control that the Appellant had over the day-to-day work, and of it having been the Appellant who provided the relevant specific training. Both of those matters are ones that significantly differentiate the position of the Appellant from that of the Respondent. The conclusion he arrived at concerning apportionment is comfortably within the range within which a trial judge could decide such a question without appellable error. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – Contributory Negligence 
       
      
    114 The trial judge disposed very briefly of a submission that the Worker had engaged in contributory negligence: 
     
      
       
        
        “The worker was shown by the assistant warehouse manager how to unblock a jammed tote and she followed his instructions. Her complaints about the procedure were ignored by the assistant warehouse manager and by the site coordinator. The worker had no control over the system of work. There is no evidence of negligence on her part.” 
        
       
      
    115 Though the Appellant did not abandon its challenge to this finding, the argument supporting the challenge was very brief. In essence, it was that the Worker realised that the method of unblocking the conveyor line that she had been shown was unsafe – indeed, so unsafe that she complained about it to two separate people in authority – but she persisted in using that unsafe method for months until eventually its use injured her. The Appellant submitted that contributory negligence is an objective standard, and that this behaviour on the part of the Worker involved a departure from the standard of reasonable care required of her.  
     
      
    116 I do not accept that submission. It is not as though the Worker was injured by an act of carelessness for her own safety that was incidental to the performance of her duties – she was injured through performance of her duties in the precise way in which she had been instructed to perform them. Any assessment of what reasonable care for a plaintiff’s own safety requires that plaintiff to do must take into account the practical opportunities for choice that the plaintiff has concerning his or her own safety. In the present case, the only practical choice that the plaintiff had, short of resigning, was to complain to people in authority about the inadequacy of the system, and seek to have it fixed. She complained, more than once. Taking reasonable care for her own safety did not require her to take the further step of resigning when her complaints proved useless. The trial judge was right in holding that there was no contributory negligence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – Error of Principle in Assessing Respondent’s Damages at Nil? 
       
      
    117 The Appellant submits that the trial judge was in error in concluding that the amount of contribution obtainable from the Respondent pursuant to section 151Z(2)(d) was nil. The Respondent made periodical payments to the Worker for many months after the date of the accident, and paid medical and related expenses, but the final payment that it made was on 15 May 2000, when a payment was made to the Worker of a lump sum in commutation of her entitlements. 
     
      
    118 The Workers Compensation Legislation Further Amendment Act 2001, Schedule 1, introduced a new section 151G and 151H into Division 3 of Part 5 of the Act. They provided, so far as relevant: 
     
      
       
        
        “151G(1) The only damages that may be awarded are: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) damages for past economic loss due to loss of earnings, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) damages for future economic loss due to the deprivation or impairment of earning capacity.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        “151H(1) No damages may be awarded unless the injury results in the death of the worker or in a degree of permanent impairment of the injured worker that is at least 15%.” 
        
       
      
    119 That 2001 legislation had transitional provisions, now contained in clause 9, Part 18C, Schedule 6 of the Act, which included: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) An amendment made by Schedule 1 to the  
        Workers Compensation Legislation Further Amendment Act 2001 
         applies in respect of the recovery of damages after the commencement of the amendment (and so applies even if the injury concerned was received before the commencement of the amendment) but does not apply in respect of the recovery of damages if proceedings for their recovery were commenced in a court before the commencement of the amendment.” 
        
       
      
    120 Those particular amendments all commenced on 27 November 2001: New South Wales Government Gazette, No 195A, 21 December 2001, at 10175. There was no relevant change to any of them between the date of their commencement and now. 
     
      
    121 The trial judge applied the law contained in the 2001 amendments when deciding the amount of contribution that the Appellant could recover from the Respondent. It was because he was not satisfied that the degree of permanent impairment of the Worker was at least 15% that he decided that the Worker would have received no damages if her damages had been assessed in accordance with Part 3 of the Act, and hence that the amount of contribution that the Appellant was entitled to recover from the Respondent was nil.  
     
      
    122 The Appellant attacks the starting point of the trial judge’s reasoning, namely that the damages recoverable by the Worker that are relevant to the assessment of contribution are ascertained in accordance with the 2001 amendments to the Act. 
     
      
    123 The first payment of workers compensation was made to the Worker on 15 October 1997. The Appellant points out that this Court held in South Eastern Sydney Area Health Services v Gadiry [2002] NSWCA 161; (2002) 54 NSWLR 495 that a separate right of indemnity arises under section 151Z(1)(d) in relation to each payment of compensation that is made, that hence there is a separate limitation period for each right to be indemnified against a payment of compensation, and that the limitation period for each right of indemnity concerning each payment of compensation commences to run when each such payment is made. See also Turner v George Weston Foods t/as Tip Top Bakeries (Newcastle) [2007] NSWCA 67; (2007) 4 DDCR 571 at [41], 580-581. The Appellant submits that because all the payments of compensation were made prior to 27 November 2001, any rights that the Respondent had to indemnity concerning those payments had all accrued before the 2001 amendments came into operation. 
     
      
    124 This Court has also held that a claim for indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) of the Act is not a claim for damages in either form or substance: Westpac Banking Corporation v Tomassian (1993) 32 NSWLR 207 at 209 (Kirby A-CJ agreeing) 215, 220 per Mahoney JA; Turner v George Weston Foods at [33], 579. The Appellant implicitly recognises that the words “in respect of the recovery of damages” in the transitional provision in clause 9 of Part 18C, Schedule 6, of the 2001 legislation could impose a limited degree of retrospectivity on the amendments made by the 2001 legislation. However, the Appellant’s argument goes, because the proceedings for indemnity are not for the recovery of damages, any retrospectivity of the 2001 legislation does not apply to those proceedings. 
     
      
    125 The Appellant’s argument requires closer examination. I start by considering the significance of the accrual of the right of action for indemnity. That a cause of action has accrued means nothing more than that the person in whose favour it has accrued could, if minded to go to court to enforce it, succeed in doing so. However, this Court has held that because the right of indemnity is subject to an upper limit prescribed by section 151Z(1)(d) (namely, the amount of the damage that the worker can recover from the non-employer tortfeasor) it is part of the statutory intent that the amount of those damages must be assessed, in their entirety, on the first occasion when a claim for indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) is made: Grant v Royal Rehabilitation Centre [1999] NSWCA 250; (1999) 47 NSWLR 263 at [8]-[9], 265. Prima facie, that assessment would be made as at the time of that hearing: Turner v George Weston Foods at [34], 579; [62], 585. The hearing took place in May 2006, with judgment being given in December 2006. Both of those dates are after the 2001 amendments became operative. 
     
      
    126 In the circumstances where the worker is entitled to take proceedings independently of the Act against both the employer and a non-employer tortfeasor, section 151Z(2)(e) must also be applied to calculate the amount of any indemnity. As explained earlier at [45], application of section 151Z(2)(e) involves calculation of the amount of contribution that the non-employer tortfeasor could recover from the employer tortfeasor “if the whole of the damages were assessed in accordance with the provisions of Division 3 as to the award of damages”. Division 3 runs from section 151E to 151T inclusive of the Act. Prima facie those damages would likewise be calculated as at the time of the first hearing in which a right of indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) was claimed – in the present case, after the 2001 amendments became operative, and thus using Division 3 in the form that it had after those amendments became operative. In this way it might be argued that the right of indemnity has as an essential part of it the quantification of the relevant amounts of damages, and because those amounts of damages had not been quantified by 27 November 2001 there was no accrued right to indemnity prior to 27 November 2001. 
     
      
    127 In my view that argument is incorrect. It is possible for a right of indemnity to be an accrued right, even though the amount for which the indemnity exists has not yet been quantified. For example, an insured under an insurance policy can have an accrued right to indemnity from the insurer against a particular liability before the quantum of that liability is established. Even though it is often presumed that when a statute creates a new right and gives a remedy for enforcement of that right, no other remedy is available (Pearce and Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 6th ed (2006) LexisNexis, Butterworths, para [5.35]), section 151Z confers a new right to indemnity but does not confer any special remedy for its enforcement – enforcement is left to ordinary action in the courts. Thus, it seems to me that the fact that the statute requires quantification of damages as part of establishing the amount for which the indemnity exists is not a sufficient reason for concluding that it is the provisions of Division 3 in its present form that should be applied. In my view, it is right to approach the application of section 151Z in the present case on the basis that the Appellant had an accrued right to indemnity before the 2001 amendments became operative, even though the precise quantum of that indemnity had not been established. 
     
      
    128 There is a well-established principle of statutory construction that: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… a statute changing the law ought not, unless the intention appears with reasonable certainty, to be understood as applying to facts or events that have already occurred in such a way as to confer or impose or otherwise affect rights or liabilities which the law has defined by reference to the past events."" (Per Dixon CJ,  
        Maxwell v Murphy 
         [1957] HCA 7; (1957) 96 CLR 261 at [7], 267). 
        
       
      
    129 When the right to an indemnity under section 151Z was the type of right that existed independently of the means for its enforcement, and had accrued before the 2001 amendments came into effect, the reference to “Division 3” in section 151Z(2)(d) would need to be construed in accordance with that principle of construction. So construed, if a fully accrued right existed before the terms of Division 3 were changed in 2001 the manner in which it was enforced would not be altered by the law having changed, unless it appeared with reasonable certainty that it was the intention of Parliament that the alteration of Division 3 would apply to that right. That would then require close attention to the terms of 2001 legislation and in particular the transitional provision. 
     
      
    130 The transitional provision states in terms that the amended provisions apply “in respect of the recovery of damages after the commencement of the amendment”. The expression “in respect of the recovery of damages” is wider than the expression “claim for damages” with which Westpac Banking Corporation v Tomassian was concerned. The fact that the expression ""in respect of the recovery of damages"" appears twice in the transitional provision assists one in concluding that the use of that phrase was quite deliberate. The expression “in respect of” is capable of having a meaning indicating any type of connection or relation between the two subject matters to which the words refer, though its precise shade of meaning must be gathered from its context: Wonall Pty Ltd v Clarence Property Corporation Ltd [2003] NSWSC 497; (2003) 58 NSWLR 23 at [41]-[43], 44-45 and cases there cited.  
     
      
    131 In the present case it seems to me that there are two reasons why the correct construction of the transitional provisions requires that the version of Division 3 introduced in 2001 apply to the assessment of the quantum of contribution towards damages, where proceedings seeking those damages were not begun before the 2001 amendments commenced.  
     
      
    132 First, it is well within the ordinary meaning of words to regard proceedings claiming contribution towards damages as being proceedings ""in respect of the recovery of damages"", even though they are not themselves proceedings for the recovery of damages. I see nothing in the context to lead to any different reading. 
     
      
    133 Second, a clear objective of the amendments made by the 2001 legislation is that from the time of commencement of those amendments the liability of employers to pay damages to workers should be quantified in accordance with Division 3, even in relation to injuries that had occurred prior to that date. The only exception was if proceedings to recover the damages had been started before the commencement date of the amendment. To require contribution to be paid by an employer on any different basis to that on which damages would be assessed against the employers would not be consistent with that objective. Of course, the amendment should be construed in accordance with the usual presumption that I have identified from Maxwell v Murphy, but it seems to me that it is easier to find ""reasonable certainty"" of an intention to alter the basis on which the quantum of the contribution is calculated when so doing advances the general policy of the legislation.  
     
      
    134 Adopting the construction I advanced at [132] is not contrary to earlier decisions of this Court that consider the effect of the transitional provisions, though not in the precise factual context in which they arise in the present case. In Clout v Baiada a hired worker (Mr Raj) was injured before the 2001 amendments became operative, sued the factory owner to whom he had been hired, and began those proceedings for damages before the 2001 amendments became operative. Thus, there were proceedings for recovery of damages commenced in the court before the commencement of the amendment, and the qualification in the transitional provision whereby an amendment “does not apply in respect of the recovery of damages if proceedings for their recovery were commenced in the Court before the commencement of the amendment” was also operative. It was in that context that Sheller JA said at [38] said that if the object of section 151Z(2) of reducing the damages which would otherwise have been recoverable by the worker from a non-employer is to be achieved equitably, as one would suppose the legislature intended, it can only be achieved by all steps in the calculation being taken on the common assumption that the November amendments apply, or alternatively a common assumption that they do not apply. Giles JA at [62] said that not to proceed in that way would be “incongruous”. In my view the fact that in Clout proceedings were on foot prior to the commencement date of the amendments distinguishes Clout from the present case. 
     
      
    135 In Forstaff v Brimac a hired worker was injured before the 2001 amendments became operative, sued the factory owner to whom he had been hired, and began those proceedings for damages after the 2001 amendments became operative. McColl JA at [77], 198-9 observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Underlying the reasoning in  
        Clout 
         is the premise that because the hypothetical s 151Z(2)(d) exercise requires assessment in accordance with Pt 5 Div 3, the Court should apply the provisions of that Pt 5 which would apply if the plaintiff worker had taken proceedings against the employer at the time the proceedings were commenced against the non-employer. As Mr Raj’s proceedings were commenced before 27 November 2001 and were immunised from the operation of the 2001 amendments by cl 9 Pt 18C of Sch 6, the s 151Z(2)(d) assessment was to be undertaken in accordance with the pre-amendment Pt 5, Div 3."" 
        
       
      
    136 The factual situation in Forstaff was distinguishable from that in Clout because the proceedings that the worker brought in Forstaff were commenced after the 2001 amendments became operative. McColl JA held at [78] that application of the process of reasoning in Clout required that the 2001 amendments should apply to the assessment of contribution in Forstaff. 
     
      
    137 In the present case, the proceedings from which this appeal is brought were commenced in 2004, and the Worker has never brought proceedings seeking damages for her injuries. Thus, the present is not a case in which the qualification in the transitional provision applies in the manner in which it did in Clout. When the Worker has not brought proceedings even after the amendments commenced, the ratio decidendi of Forstaff is not applicable to the facts of the present case. However Forstaff supports the construction of the transitional provision that seems to me to be the correct one. 
     
      
    138 Thus I conclude that the judge made no error in assessing the contribution to which the non-employer tortfeasor was entitled from the employer tortfeasor in accordance with the law as established by the 2001 amendments. 
     
      
    139 An issue was argued on the appeal concerning whether the trial had been conducted on the basis that the method of calculating damages as established by the 2001 amendment was the appropriate one to apply. Clearly, the plaintiff’s written submissions at the trial specifically put that the post-2001 provisions applied, and the written submissions of the defendant did not specifically take issue with that. In light of the conclusion to which I have come concerning the correctness of applying the post-2001 law, it is not necessary to consider these arguments further.  
     
      
       
      Ground 5 – Assessment of Damages 
       
      
    140 As I understand the submissions of the Appellant, this ground only arises in the event that the judge ought to have applied the law as it was before the 2001 amendments in assessing damages. In light of my conclusion so far, this ground does not need to be considered. 
     
      
       
      Calculation of Judgment Amount – Operation of  
      Limitation Act 
       
      
    141 There remains to be considered what is the appropriate amount for which judgment should have been given, in light of the findings so far. Because the worker was entitled to take proceedings independently of the Act to recover damages from her employer, but has not done so, and neither has she accepted satisfaction of a judgment against her employer, the present is a situation in which section 151Z(2)(e) applies. 
     
      
    142 The Appellant submits that the way in which section 151Z(2)(e)(i) operates is “by subtracting from the payments of compensation which are not statute barred the employer's contribution to the notional damages”. In my view that is not the calculation that section 151Z requires to be made, but (at least in the present case) it comes to the same mathematical answer as a calculation performed on the correct principle.  
     
      
    143 In a situation where a worker has not taken proceedings against the employer or accepted satisfaction of a judgment against the employer, the consequence that the chapeau of section 151Z(2)(e) says then follows, namely that “subsection (1) applies as if the worker had not been entitled to recover damages from that employer”, needs to be understood bearing in mind the history of this section and its statutory predecessors. Giles JA in I & J Foods Pty Ltd v Bergzam Pty Ltd (1997) 14 NSWCCR 486 explained that the statutory predecessor of section 151Z(1) contained in section 64(1) Workers Compensation Act 1926 was held in Public Transport Commission of New South Wales v J Murray-More Pty Ltd [1975] HCA 28; (1975) 132 CLR 336 to not entitle an employer to indemnity from a wrongdoer for compensation payments if the employer’s negligence had contributed to the occurrence in respect of which a right to compensation arose. Giles JA held that the phrase “as if the worker had not been entitled to recover damages from” the employer, in the chapeau of section 151Z(2)(e) was 
     
      
       
        
        ""… a tolerably clear statement that the limitation declared in  
        Public Transport Commission of New South Wales v J Murray-More Pty Ltd  
        should be deemed out of existence so as to permit partial indemnity.” 
        
       
      
    144 Sub-paras (i) and (ii) of section 151Z(2)(e) go on to state how that “partial indemnity” operates.  
     
      
    145 The operation of each of those sub-paras requires the calculation of two amounts.  
     
      
    146 The first is “the compensation paid by that employer”. In my view the clear meaning of that expression is the total amount of compensation ever paid by the employer (in the present case, $157,973.45, which for ease of explanation of the method I shall treat as $157,000 in round figures), not a figure that has been reduced in some fashion pursuant to a statute of limitations. 
     
      
    147 The second amount that must be calculated for the operation of sub paras (i) and (ii) is “the amount of the contribution that could be recovered from that employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise”. That amount of that contribution is ascertained under section 151Z(2)(d). The phrase “the amount of the contribution that could be recovered from that employer as a joint tortfeasor or otherwise” echoes the similar phrases (differing only saying “the employer” instead of “that employer”) that occur in section 151Z(2)(c) and (d). All those phrases mean the same thing. In the present case, the amount of that contribution is nil. 
     
      
    148 When the correct amount to adopt for “the compensation paid by that employer” is $157,000, that amount exceeds nil, and so it is sub-para (i) that applies. The operation of subpara (i) would then give the amount for which indemnity can be obtained under subsection (1)(d) as being the difference between those amounts, namely $157,000.  
     
      
    149 It is still necessary, however, to apply section 151Z(1)(d) according to its terms. Because of the words in brackets at the end of section 151Z(1)(d), the amount actually recoverable under the indemnity is limited to the amount of the damages that the indemnifier is liable to pay to the worker. The practical effect of this is that the indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) is for whichever is the lesser of the amount derived from section 151Z(2)(e)(i) and the amount of the damages that the indemnifier is liable to pay to the worker. 
     
      
    150 The reasoning so far does not mean that the Limitation Act does not enter into the calculation of the amount of an indemnity that is recoverable in a situation where section 151Z(2)(e) applies. All that it shows is that the Limitation Act does not operate on section 151Z(2)(e) itself.  
     
      
    151 It would be seriously anomalous for a limitation period to apply when section 151(1)(d) operated in circumstances where a worker had sued his or her employer, but not to apply when section 151(1)(d) operated in circumstances where a worker had not sued his or her employer. In my view no such anomaly arises. 
     
      
    152 South Eastern Sydney Area Health Service v Gadiry [2002] NSWCA 161; (2002) 54 NSWLR 495 shows that the rationale for there being a limitation period in the action under section 151Z(1)(d) is that there is a separate right of indemnity in relation to each amount of compensation paid, and as each amount of compensation comes to be more than six years old the statutory right to recover it become statute barred.  
     
      
    153 The provision that operates to bar recovery in an action that sues on section 151Z(1)(d) is section 14(1)(d) Limitation Act 1969, which establishes a six-year limitation period for any cause of action to recover money recoverable by virtue of an enactment: Turner v George Weston Foods at [41], 580-581. Considered by themselves sections 151Z(2)(e) (i) or (ii) do not involve the assertion of any cause of action to recover money recoverable by virtue of an enactment. Rather, what 151Z(2)(e)(i) and (ii) do is to set out a means by which a calculation is performed for the purpose of the cause of action that arises under section 151(1)(d), and any limitation period then applies to section 151(1)(d). 
     
      
    154 There are two different ways, not different in substance, in which one can explain how section 14(1)(d) Limitation Act operates in a situation where section 151Z(2)(e) also applies, and the first payment of compensation was made more than six years before proceedings to enforce the indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) were commenced. One is if one first considers what the right of the employer would have been to recover indemnity under section 151Z(1)(d) immediately before six years prior to the date of commencement of proceedings. If, at that date, the amount of compensation paid by the employer exceeded the amount of the contribution that could be recovered from that employer, there would be a cause of action to recover the amount of the excess under section 151Z(1)(d) (“the Six Years Old Amount”). By the time proceedings were actually brought, the cause of action to recover the Six Years Old Amount would have become statute barred. By the operation of section 63 Limitation Act, the right to recover that sum is extinguished. At the time the calculation is done for the purpose of the proceedings that are actually brought, “the compensation paid by that employer” is treated as being the total amount of compensation ever paid by the employer, the operation of subpara (i) then proceeds to calculate the excess of that total amount of compensation over the amount of contribution that could be recovered from the employer, and the amount of that excess is then the amount for which proceedings for indemnity can be brought. However, in those proceedings the defendant has a partial defence to a claim to recover that amount, by reason of the right to recover the Six Years Old Amount having become statute barred. 
     
      
    155 The other way of explaining it is that, at the time that the indemnity is actually sued for, the combined operation of section 151Z(2)(e)(i) means that the upper limit on the amount for which the indemnity is recoverable is the lesser of the amount obtained by performing the calculation in section 151Z(2)(e)(i), and the amount of the damages that the worker could recover from the person from whom the employer seeks indemnity. Even so, the indemnity is still for a series of individual payments of compensation. Insofar as the amount for which the employer seeks indemnity is made up (up to the upper limit of the total amount) of individual payments that are more than six years old, each of those individual payments more than six years old has become statute barred. 
     
      
    156 Doing the calculation in the correct way is of significance in a situation where an amount is recoverable by way of contribution from the employer. As Giles JA explained in I & J Foods v Bergazam, in that situation: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… para (e) adjusted the employer’s indemnity so that the burden of the compensation paid under the Act would remain with the employer to the extent of the employer's fault which led to the employer paying contribution to the third party."" 
        
       
      
    157 If an employer has not committed a tort that has injured the worker, but has paid compensation, the effect of section 151Z(1)(d) is that the employer can recover back from the indemnifier the full amount of compensation paid, up to the limit of the amount of damages that the indemnifier is liable to pay to the employer. However, if the employer is at fault, it is not entitled to indemnity for the full amount of the compensation paid, up to that limit. Rather, the employer is required to bear the compensation, up to the proportion of the compensation that equals the degree of fault of the employer, and only after the employer has borne the amount of compensation to that extent does it have a right of indemnity from some other wrongdoer liable to pay damages for the same injury.  
     
      
    158 This can be illustrated by an example in which the measure of damages that the worker could recover from the non-employer is $200,000, the measure of damages that the worker can recover from the employer is $150,000, the employer has paid compensation of $75,000, and the employer is 40% at fault. The amount of contribution that the non-employer can recover from the employer under section 151Z(2)(d) is 40% of $150,000, namely $60,000. Applying section 151Z(2)(e)(i), the upper limit of the indemnity recoverable under section 151Z(1)(d) is the excess of the compensation paid over the amount of that contribution, namely $15,000. If the employer had paid only $50,000 in compensation, there would be no excess of the compensation paid over the amount of the contribution, and so the employer would not have an indemnity. If the employer had paid $100,000 in compensation, the excess of the compensation paid over the amount of the contribution would be $40,000. In this way, the employer bears the compensation up to the amount of the contribution that can be recovered from it. 
     
      
    159 If the employer had paid $100,000 in compensation, but $20,000 of it was paid more than six years before the action was brought, the method of calculation advocated by the Appellant seems to proceed as though “the payments of compensation that are not statute barred” are $80,000, and the amount of indemnity is ascertained by subtracting $60,000 from that, resulting in $20,000. In my view that is a mistaken way of proceeding. Rather, one should first do the calculation that deducts from the total amount of compensation the amount of the employer's contribution, thereby arriving at a figure of $40,000. But, while that $40,000 is the total amount for which indemnity can be claimed, the indemnity is still in relation to particular payments of compensation that the employer has made. The employer is able to allocate that $40,000 so that the employer seeks indemnity for $40,000 that was paid less than six years before action was brought. In that way, the limitation period does not operate to cut down the amount of indemnity recoverable – the employer is still entitled to indemnity for $40,000. It nonetheless remains true that the employer has paid in total $100,000, of which it can recover back $40,000. Thus, even in the situation where some of the payments of contribution are more than six years old, the employer still ends up bearing the first $60,000 of the compensation paid. 
     
      
    160 The correct calculation of the amount of the indemnity in the present case is as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) The amount of the contribution that Appellant is entitled to recover from the employer under section 151Z(2)(d) is nil.  
       
       
      (b) The compensation paid by the employer is $157,000. The  
      “excess” 
       referred to in section 151Z(2)(e)(i) is thus $157,000.  
       
       
      (c) The full measure of damages that the Worker would have been entitled to recover from the Appellant if the Appellant were the only wrongdoer who had caused her injury was $228,000. The amount of the contribution that the Appellant would be entitled from the Respondent if Part 5 of the Act had not been enacted it is 30% of that amount, namely $68,400. The amount of the reduction that is to be made from $228,000 pursuant to section 151Z(2)(c) is the excess of that $68,400 over the amount of contribution actually recoverable under section 151Z(2)(d). That excess is itself $68,400. Thus the amount of damages that would actually have been recoverable by the Worker from the Appellant is $228,000 -$68,400, ie $159,600. 
       
       
      (d) The maximum amount which can be recovered under section 151Z(1)(d) is thus the lesser of two amounts calculated in (b) and (c), ie $157,000.  
       
       
      (e) However, when one looks for payments of compensation that can be allocated to make up that $157,000, one finds that there is only $130,736 that was paid less than six years before action was brought. Thus, by reason of the operation of section 14(1)(d)  
      Limitation Act 
       on the cause of action under section 151Z(1)(d), there is an extant right of action to recover only $130,736. 
       
      
    161 Thus the trial judge gave judgment for the correct amount.

    162 I propose that the appeal be dismissed with costs.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 Beazley JA: I agree with McCallum J. 
     
      
    2 Johnson J: I agree with McCallumJ. 
     
      
    3 McCallum J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on him in the District Court on 4 May 2007 when he appeared for sentence after pleading guilty to an offence of conspiring to maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm and offences of assaulting and resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty. Two other offences, namely assaulting and resisting a different police officer in the execution of his duty, were taken into account on a Form 1 at the request of the applicant pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    4 The conspiracy offence is a common law offence for which the penalty is at large. However, it is generally considered that the statutory maximum penalty for the offence the subject of the conspiracy indicates the appropriate range. The statutory maximum penalty for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent to do grievous bodily harm is 25 years imprisonment. The statutory maximum penalty for each of the offences of assaulting and resisting a police officer in the execution of his duty is 5 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    5 The sentencing judge imposed fixed terms of 12 months imprisonment commencing on 1 May 2007 for each of the offences on the indictment of assaulting and resisting a police officer. Those sentences were concurrent with each other. In respect of the conspiracy offence, her Honour made a finding of special circumstances and imposed a sentence of 5 years comprising a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 2 years. The sentence in respect of that offence was accumulated by 6 months on the two fixed terms and was to commence on 1 November 2007. Her Honour specifically took the Form 1 matters into account when dealing with the conspiracy offence.  
     
      
       
      Circumstances of the offences 
       
      
    6 The sentencing judge relied on an agreed statement of facts together with some additional facts from other material tendered at the sentence hearing. The agreed facts, in summary, were that one of the co-conspirators, a Mr Zakhem, ran a business importing and selling hairdressing products. Mr Zakhem was in dispute with a Mr Lyons, a former business partner who had become a competitor in the same line of business. The conspiracy was to seriously injure Mr Lyons. Mr Zakhem instructed Mr Awit to arrange the assault. Mr Awit in turn instructed his nephew, Mr Elias, to make the arrangements. Mr Elias recruited three men including the applicant to carry out the assault. The applicant’s role was to drive the two other men, Christopher Duncan and Mark Najem, to and from Mr Lyons’ business premises, a shop named “Beautopia”.  
     
      
    7 Two nights in a row the three men went to “Beautopia” but they were unable to carry out the assault because the premises were closed and unattended. In the meantime, police had become aware of the conspiracy and had commenced conducting surveillance. On the third night, two police posed as Mr Lyons and his employees at “Beautopia”. The applicant drove Mr Duncan and Mr Najem to a nearby street. Mr Najem, armed with a pistol, went to act as lookout on a rooftop car park above the shop. Mr Duncan, armed with a shortened rifle, went to the front door where he spoke to the policeman who was posing as Mr Lyons, Detective Sergeant Phillips. Mr Duncan discharged the rifle towards Detective Phillips’ legs and the shot narrowly missed his knee.  
     
      
    8 Mr Duncan and Mr Najem were pursued by police and arrested. The applicant was arrested after trying to drive his car around a police car blocking his exit. As police tried to remove him from the car, the applicant pushed them away and kicked out at them with his legs. He continued to struggle with two police officers, Detective Lewis and Detective Law, and all three men fell to the ground a number of times. 
     
      
    9 In an interview with police, the applicant said that he was to receive $1,500 for his part in “the job”.  
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was aware the two co-accused were carrying guns. Her Honour declined to rely on that as a matter of aggravation. Her Honour also declined to rely on the fact that the conspiracy offence was part of a planned criminal activity as an aggravating factor, finding that the degree of planning involved was inherent in the formation of a conspiratorial agreement and should not be double counted as an aggravating factor. Her Honour made the same finding in respect of a third aggravating factor relied on by the Crown, namely that the offence was committed in company. 
     
      
    11 Her Honour stated that, objectively, the conspiracy offence was very serious. Her Honour expressed the view that agreeing to participate in serious violence on a stranger for personal gain is callous, serious criminality. Her Honour found that the applicant was in the lower reaches of the conspiratorial hierarchy.  
     
      
    12 As to the assaults on police in the execution of their duty, her Honour observed that those are serious offences that should include a significant element of general deterrence. The particular offences her Honour held were at the lower end of assaults as neither police officer suffered any injury. Her Honour held that the offences of resisting were in the “medium range” of resisting conduct. 
     
      
    Circumstances of the offender  
     
      
    13 The applicant was eighteen years old at the time of the offences and twenty-one at the time of the sentence hearing. He had no prior criminal history.  
     
      
    14 A report from a psychiatrist tendered at the sentence hearing described the applicant’s co-operation in a programme devised for him by the psychiatrist as poor. The psychiatrist attributed the applicant’s failure to adhere to instructions to his state of mind, which the psychiatrist said was characterised by mental retardation. 
     
      
    15 The psychiatrist also referred to a history of substance abuse involving marijuana and amphetamine derivatives. 
     
      
    16 The sentencing judge set out the psychiatrist’s report in considerable detail and recorded his opinion, in summary, that the applicant had a history and diagnosis of developmental delay and that his functionally compromised brain was more vulnerable to the effect of drugs. Her Honour noted the psychiatrist’s view that the applicant’s developmental delay is treatable and that abstinence from drugs was necessary to treating his poor impulse control, while noting that his condition compromises his reliability to attend appointments and treatment. 
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge accepted that the applicant’s developmental delay or mental retardation which caused him to be easily led or influenced by others, and impulsive, may have caused him to become involved in the conspiracy more easily than a person of high intellectual functioning. Her Honour noted, however, that the applicant’s level of intellectual functioning had not prevented him from participating in the community and maintaining employment.  
     
      
    18 Her Honour referred to the relevant authorities and concluded that the applicant’s borderline retarded level of intellectual functioning with its attendant impulsivity moderated his moral culpability to “a slight to moderate extent rather than a great extent”.  
     
      
       
      Duplication of sentence  
       
      
    19 The first ground of appeal is that the sentencing judge erred: 
     
      
       
        
        “in duplicating the sentences imposed for [the counts of assaulting and resisting police on the indictment] with the outcome of the matters taken into account on the Form 1.”  
        
       
      
    20 As this ground was developed, the complaint was not so much one of duplication as of inadvertent additional accumulation. The four offences were all part of the one incident, resulting from the fact that the applicant both assaulted and resisted each of the two police officers who arrested him. The facts were that the applicant was in his car when apprehended by Detective Lewis and Detective Law. He struggled violently with both of them as they removed him from the car, pushing them away and kicking out at them with his legs. In the face of the obvious connection between those four offences, it complicated the sentencing process to have them divided between the indictment and the Form 1.  
     
      
    21 It is apparent from the remarks on sentence at page 26 that her Honour’s intention was to effect some partial accumulation to reflect the fact that the acts of resisting and assaulting police entailed criminality separate from and additional to the criminality entailed in participation in the conspiracy. In respect of the two counts on the indictment, her Honour said “the assaults and resist arise out of the same acts although their elements are different and it is appropriate that those two sentences be concurrent with each other”. Her Honour does not appear to have brought to mind, in that context, the matters on the Form 1. 22 In dealing with the two matters on the Form 1, her Honour noted that she was required to increase the sentence for the conspiracy offence to a greater sentence than would have been imposed if she were sentencing for that count alone. The sentence imposed for that count was accumulated by 6 months on the sentences imposed for the two other charges on the indictment. It follows that the effect of the sentences was that, in addition to the 6 months accumulation intended to reflect the additional criminality of assaulting and resisting police, there was some accumulation of the sentence for the offences against Detective Law (taken into account on the conspiracy count) on the sentence for the offences against Detective Lewis, and a total accumulation of more than 6 months.  
     
      
    23 Mr Cross, who appeared for the applicant, argued that that was inappropriate having regard to the principles in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 160. Owing to the level of generality of the facts before the sentencing judge in respect of the four offences involving the two detectives, it is difficult to ascertain whether in this case a single act was an element of each of two or more different offences involving the two police so as to attract the direct application of the decision in Pearce. Nonetheless, in my view, there is force in Mr Cross’s submission. There is nothing in the facts to suggest a distinction between the acts that constituted the offences against Detective Lewis and those constituting the offences against Detective Law.  
     
      
    24 Further, there is nothing in the reasons of the sentencing judge to suggest that her Honour intended to accumulate any part of the sentences imposed in respect of the offences against Detective Lewis on the sentences imposed in respect of the offences against Detective Law. To the extent that there is any indication on that issue in the remarks on sentence, it is to the contrary. Nonetheless, having regard to the structure of the sentences imposed, they must entail some accumulation of that description, probably as a result of the way in which the offences were presented to the sentencing judge, which appears to have led her Honour into inadvertent error in that limited respect. The consequences of that aspect of the sentence are addressed below.  
     
      
       
      Special circumstances 
       
      
    25 Ground 2 is that her Honour erred in not adequately taking into account her finding of special circumstances. The sentencing judge found special circumstances on the basis of the applicant’s youth, the fact that it was his first time in custody and the need for him to receive treatment under supervision, as recommended by the psychiatrist, for treatable symptoms of his mental condition and drug use. In reliance on that finding, her Honour imposed a sentence in which the balance of the term of the sentence exceeded one third of the non-parole period in accordance with the provisions of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    26 It was submitted that the sentence produced an effective non-parole period of 65% of the total sentence (I note that the percentage properly calculated is in fact 63.6%). In the absence of a finding of special circumstances, the outcome of the ratio required by s 44 would have been a non-parole period of 75% of the total sentence. The gist of the applicant’s complaint is that the extent of the variation was inadequate. 
     
      
    27 Separately, it was put that there was disparity between the percentage adjustment in the sentence imposed on the applicant and those imposed on the two co-offenders, Mr Najem and Mr Duncan which, it was submitted, were respectively 60% and 62.5%.  
     
      
    28 These arguments may be disposed of briefly. The judgment of the extent of the variation to the statutory ratio is one that involves the exercise of a broad discretion with which, absent error, this Court should not interfere. In my view, the extent of the variation achieved in the structure of the sentences in the present case was plainly open in the exercise of her Honour’s judicial discretion.  
     
      
    29 Further, in my view, it cannot be said that the applicant has a justified sense of grievance in respect of the supposed disparity between the percentage of the total term represented by the non-parole periods of his own sentence and those of Mr Najem and Mr Duncan. All of the ratios are within a range of 3.6 percent of each other. The co-offenders were sentenced for different conduct on different evidence. Sentencing is not so precise an art as to warrant the conclusion that a smaller degree of variation was the only correct outcome. 
     
      
       
      Parity  
       
      
    30 Ground 3 is that the sentencing judge erred in failing to observe parity requirements in relation to sentences imposed on co-offenders. This ground was to a large extent overtaken by the fact that, since the lodging of this appeal, there have been successful Crown appeals in respect of two of the co-offenders, Mr Najem and Mr Zakhem. Following the determination of those appeals, Mr Cross acknowledged that the only remaining basis for the argument (leaving aside the specific complaint as to disparity in the composition of the sentences discussed above) was the comparison with the sentence imposed on Mr Duncan.  
     
      
    31 Mr Duncan was armed with a shortened .22 calibre bolt action rifle with which he shot at the police officer posing as Mr Lyons, narrowly missing his knee. Further, when police announced their presence, Mr Duncan ran and turned to fire a shot towards a different police officer. He was caught by a police dog.  
     
      
    32 The significant feature of the sentences imposed on Mr Duncan was that he pleaded guilty to separate offences in respect of his possession of the firearm, the discharge of the firearm with intent to do grievous bodily harm to the policeman posing as Mr Lyons and the use of the firearm to prevent his lawful apprehension. In respect of the conspiracy offence, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 2 years, the same sentence as was imposed on the applicant. For the offence of shooting at the man he thought was Mr Lyons, he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 2 and a half years. The sentence imposed for the use of the gun when he was being chased by police attracted an additional term of 2 years commencing at the expiration of the non-parole period for the conspiracy count, so that the total non-parole period was 5 years.  
     
      
    33 The applicant’s complaint in respect of that sentence is that, despite the fact that Mr Duncan was armed and actually fired the weapon in an attempt to injure the person he believed to be the intended victim, the sentencing judge equated the criminality of the applicant on the conspiracy charge with that of Mr Duncan. That complaint ignores the separate offence, which resulted in an additional sentence, in respect of the use of the firearm.  
     
      
    34 Further, as already noted, the sentence imposed on the applicant for the conspiracy offence took into account the offences of assaulting and resisting Detective Law. It is a premise of the first ground of appeal discussed above that the sentence imposed on the applicant was increased on that account. In addition, as noted in the submissions for the Crown, Mr Duncan had the benefit of findings that he was recruited to the conspiracy at a late stage by the applicant, that his reward was to be the cancellation of a small gambling debt owed to the applicant and that his contrition was genuine.  
     
      
    35 In my view, a comparison between the sentences imposed on Mr Duncan and on the applicant for the conspiracy offence does not demonstrate that a reasonable person, looking at the circumstances of the case, would regard his grievance as justified so as to warrant the intervention of this Court.  
     
      
       
      Undue severity of sentence  
       
      
    36 The remaining grounds of appeal were dealt with together in the applicant’s submissions and it is convenient to adopt the same approach. The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed was unduly severe (ground 7) and, in particular, that the sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s mental disability (ground 4), to evidence of remorse (ground 5) and to assistance given to police (ground 6).  
     
      
    37 With no disrespect to Mr Cross, who developed this submission carefully and in considerable detail, it amounted in substance to an invitation to this Court to exercise the sentencing discretion afresh. The weight to be given to the various factors identified in the submissions was a matter for the judgment of the sentencing judge involving the exercise of a broad discretion. The sentencing judge adverted to all of the matters identified by the applicant and, in a thorough and carefully reasoned judgment, gave them the weight which was appropriate in her Honour’s view. No basis for interfering with the exercise of that discretion has been identified. 
     
      
    38 The objective seriousness of these offences cannot be ignored. Her Honour rightly took the view that participation in the planned offence of seriously assaulting a stranger in response to a solicitation by a business rival calls for a high degree of denunciation by the community.  
     
      
       
        
      Outcome of the appeal  
       
      
    39 It remains to consider what should be the outcome of this appeal having regard to the discussion of ground 1 above. For that purpose, it is necessary to consider the operation of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “On an appeal under s 5(1) against a sentence, the court, if it is of opinion that some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed, shall quash the sentence and pass such other sentence in substitution therefore, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal”  
        
       
      
    40 In R v Burke [2002] NSWCCA 353, Sperling J, with whom Giles JA and Hidden J agreed, said in respect of the operation of s 6(3): 
     
      
       
        
        “ Another example of a special case would be an error which has a narrow and discrete effect on the result, such as, for example, an omission to make an order that the offender is to be released on the expiration of the non-parole period where the sentence is not more than three years. In such a case, the sentence is relevantly more severe than it should have been, in that the offender might be required to serve longer than the non-parole period contrary to law. The appeal would be allowed in such a case, and the error would be corrected by adding the necessary order without the need to re-sentence the appellant afresh, even if the appellate court would have imposed a different sentence were it re-sentencing the appellant afresh. Again, that would be the situation unless the sentence was manifestly excessive, in which case the sentence would be set aside on that ground and the appellant would be re-sentenced.” 
        
       
      
    41 In my view, this is a special case of the kind described by Sperling J. The sentence is not manifestly excessive but an error has occurred which has a narrow and discrete effect on the result, namely, the inadvertent partial accumulation of the sentence imposed for the offences against one of the two detectives on the sentence imposed for the offences against the other detective taken into account with the conspiracy offence. That is an error which, in my view, may be corrected without the need to re-sentence the appellant afresh. Whilst it is not possible to ascertain the precise extent of the additional accumulation, in my view the appropriate result is to eliminate a third of the accumulation in the sentences imposed.  
     
      
    42 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. That leave to appeal be granted.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The defence has made an application that I should give the jury a direction that the delay in complaint is relevant to the complainant's credibility. At common law such a direction was common, if it was not required by some dicta of the High Court. For example, Chief Justice Barwick CJ in Kilby (1973) 129 CLR 460, 465, and Heydon JA in Fuller (2001) NSW CCA 390 at paragraph 28. This principle has also been doubted, in the High Court by Gaudron and Gummow JJ in Suresh (1998) 72 ALJR 769, and by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Markuleski (2001) 52 NSWLR 82.2 The law has now been changed. The relevant provision is now part of s294 of the Criminal Procedure Act. The provisions are quite clear. This particular provision was inserted recently and came into operation at the beginning of 2007. The whole of the section is relevant not only to this issue, but also to the directions as a whole that I must give the jury, and I propose to read it in full. 294 “Warning to be given by Judge in relation to lack of complaint of certain sexual offence proceedings(1) This section applies if, on the trial of a person for a prescribed sexual offence, evidence is given or a question is asked of a witness that tends to suggest: 
     
      
      (a) an absence of complaint in respect of the commission of the alleged offence by the person on whom the offence is alleged to have been committed, or 
      
     
     
      
       (b) delay by that person in making such complaint. 
      
    (2) In circumstances to which this section applies, the Judge: 
     
      
      (a) must warn the jury that absence of complaint or delay in complaining does not necessarily indicate that the allegation of the offence that was committed is false, and 
      
     
     
      
      (b) must inform the jury that there may be good reasons why a victim of a sexual assault may hesitate in making, or may refrain from making, a complaint about the assault, and 
      
     
     
      
      (c) must not warn the jury that a delay in complaining is relevant to the victim's credibility unless there is sufficient evidence to justify such a warning. 
      
    (3) However, if: 
     
      
      (a) the delay in making complaint by the person on whom the offence is alleged to have been committed is significant, and 
      
     
     
      
      (b) the Judge is satisfied that the person on trial for the offence has suffered a significant forensic disadvantage caused by that delay, and 
      
    the Judge may inform the jury (but only if a party to the proceedings so requests) of the nature of the disadvantage and of the need for caution in determining whether to accept, or give any weight to, the evidence or question referred to in subsection (1).(4) For the purposes of subsection (3)(b), the factors that may be regarded as establishing a significant forensic disadvantage include, but are not limited to, the following: 
     
      
      (a) the fact that any potential witnesses have died or are not able to be located, 
      
     
     
      
      (b) the fact that any potential evidence has been lost or is otherwise unavailable. 
      
    (5) The mere passage of time is not in itself to be regarded as establishing a significant forensic disadvantage.3 This application is made under subsection (2)(c). The defence says there is sufficient evidence to justify a warning that the complainant's credit may be affected by the delay in complaint.4 The evidence before me is that the alleged sexual assaults, which fall within the prescribed section, or some of them at least, began in about 1995 and continued until the complainant left the accused's home in March 2004. There is evidence that during that period she lived in the household with her aunt DC, and at least until 2003, her cousin KC. She had a close relationship with both of them, especially her aunt. She had a number of close friends, including one LM, whom she saw frequently. She never complained to any of them until she spoke to LM some time after she left the house. The defence says that she could reasonably be expected to have complained to at least one of those people.5 There is also evidence that while she was still at high school, she spoke to a school counsellor about a number of matters. Early in 2004 she spoke to a social worker at Camden Hospital. She did not complain to either of these people about sexual assaults when at school, although she did complain about the repressive and restrictive approach on the part of her uncle, the accused.6 After the events giving rise to count 15, to which the accused has pleaded guilty, the complainant went to the Camden police station and made a complaint about the assault. Later she withdrew this complaint, because, on her evidence, she knew this could have serious consequences for the accused's career in the Police Force, and because of her affection for him and her aunt. She said she did this at the request of family members, although DC denies discussing the matter.7 The evidence is that in May 2004 she did complain to her partner BH, and to some of her friends, about the sexual assaults, but she did not make a formal complaint to the police until the end of 2005. The officer-in-charge, Senior Constable Lea, is now a member of the police Internal Affairs Unit and I am sure the police took a great deal of care in the investigation of the matter. The accused did not know the complainant had made any allegations about him until he was arrested in September 2006. 8 Counsel for the defence says that because the complainant had the opportunity to complain to a number of people, to whom a reasonable person might be expected to complain, her failure to do so reflects adversely on her credit. I have no doubt that at common law this delay may well have required a warning but, as I have said, the law has now changed. Her evidence is that she decided, after the accused for the first time had penile-vaginal sexual intercourse with her, that she would accept sexual assaults as part of her life and would keep it entirely within her. She did not complain to anybody until she had left the accused’s house and was living with her partner, or at least was in a secure relationship with him. 9 She also gave evidence, and this is corroborated by the evidence of the accused's wife, that he had become cranky. He has pleaded guilty to one assault on her, although there is a dispute about the facts of that assault. She alleges another assault where he kicked her and attempted to strangle her. She gave evidence that she believed her aunt was completely dominated by her uncle. She gave evidence that after she left the home she tried to persuade her aunt to leave the accused and share accommodation with her but the aunt refused. The accused's wife corroborated this. 10 All this evidence is consistent with the fear that the complainant said she had of the accused. 11 These matters of explanation for the delay, in any event, must be put to the jury in the course of directions because of section 294(2)(a) and (b). 12 The jury must also be directed that because the evidence of the complainant is the only evidence of a number of essential elements of the offences charged, they, the jury, must regard this evidence with special scrutiny. This, of course, is a warning that must be given in any case where the evidence of the complainant is the only evidence of any essential element of an offence charged. In addition, in this case the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Markuleski, to which I have referred, requires that the jury be told that if they do not accept the complainant's evidence in respect of one count charged, they should be cautious about accepting it in respect of any other.13 The Crown concedes that the delay in bringing these matters to trial has resulted in a substantial forensic disadvantage to the accused. The complainant has been unable to recall specific dates and times at which the matters alleged have occurred. For this reason the accused has not been able to produce evidence of an alibi nature and certain records, in particular relating to the date upon which the complainant took a holiday with LM’s family and the dates and times when his wife DC was working, have been lost or destroyed and the jury must be warned of those disadvantages. These warnings are clear warnings to the jury that, first, the accused is at a significant forensic disadvantage, and secondly, that, for a number of reasons, they must scrutinize the evidence of the complainant in respect of each count on the indictment very carefully.14 They must also be warned that because this is a criminal trial, the Crown bears the burden of proof of every essential element of each charge. Therefore, if the Crown cannot satisfy them of such matters beyond reasonable doubt, they must acquit the accused. They must not simply balance the evidence adduced by the Crown against that given by the accused and the witnesses he has called. 15 My conclusion is that in respect of the evidence upon which the defence application is based, the law already requires that the jury be warned to treat the complainant's evidence with special caution. Any specific warning in relation to her credit is therefore superfluous and the evidence produced is not sufficient to justify any such warning.

      SENTENCE 
      
    1 HER HONOUR: The offender Trevor Stephens pleaded guilty on 30 June 2008 to the manslaughter of David Paul Willoughby upon arraignment on an indictment carrying the single count of murder. The Crown accepted the plea in full satisfaction of the indictment on the basis that the offender’s response to a threat of violence offered by Mr Willoughby was unreasonable in all the circumstances. This is commonly referred to in the law as excessive self-defence. 
     
      
    2 The offence of manslaughter carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. It is a maximum penalty that appropriately reflects the gravity with which the law regards the felonious taking of a human life. The maximum penalty for any offence is reserved for the worst example of that offence. That is, one that is so objectively heinous that matters personal to the offender leave little or no scope for any mitigation.3 The task of this court is to determine where on the spectrum that is represented by the range of twenty-five years this offender’s culpability falls. That task is complicated by the fact that of all offences manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability, that being a reference to Chief Justice Gleeson’s statement in Blacklidge, CCA 12 December 1995. The assessment of culpability must be made according to the laws of sentencing that are binding on this court. There is a complex interrelationship between the principles that govern sentencing, general and personal deterrence, punishment, retribution, the protection of the community and the rehabilitation of the offender. The purposes of these principles overlap and none can be considered in isolation from the others.4 It must be acknowledged at the outset that to the family and friends of the victim, David Willoughby, the principles that most represent their interest in these proceedings are punishment and retribution. It is entirely understandable that they might expect to see the depth of their loss and grief reflected in the sentence imposed. That is unlikely to occur simply because no sentence can truly compensate for that loss.5 It is also understandable that they might be bemused and angered by the law’s interest in the rehabilitation of the offender, when he has cut short the life of a son, a grandson and a brother. 
     
      
    6 The court acknowledges that these proceedings may well do nothing to address the hurt they have suffered, not just by the death of their loved one, but also at the hands of the criminal justice system itself.7 Since being informed of David’s death they have found themselves in an unfamiliar environment that appears to discount them almost entirely. This experience is one that most people in our community thankfully never have. It is an experience which this court has regrettably seen on many occasions. 8 Whilst understanding that there are aspects of our criminal justice system that contribute to that experience the obligation upon this court to sentence the offender according to law demands impartiality, objectivity and the rigorous application of legal principle. However, no-one could fail to be moved by Mr and Mrs Willoughby’s expression of the impact the offence has had on their lives and the lives of their extended family. 
     
      
    9 The following remarks are intended to inform the offender and the public, including the victim’s family of the reasons for the sentence to be imposed. Necessarily these remarks are focused upon the objective gravity of the offence within the vast range of excessive self defence cases coming before the court and the extent to which the subjective or personal features of the offender affect the offender’s culpability.10 The facts of the offence as described in the statement of facts which is part of exhibit A attribute some responsibility to David Willoughby for initiating a fight between himself and the offender that ultimately led to the victim’s death. Of course, that in no way excuses or justifies the fact that the offender resorted to the use of a knife against an unarmed man but it is critical to an assessment of the offender’s criminality. Nothing in these remarks should be interpreted as derogatory of the victim or detracting from the value inherent in his life. They are simply meant to relate what happened and the tragic consequences for the victim, in particular.11 The offender and the victim were known to each other since at least late 2005. In October 2005 the offender reported an assault to the police allegedly committed upon him by the victim and one other man. However, the offender decided not to press the matter and no charges were laid. In the second half of 2006 the victim had moved into a flat in Ball Street at Mayfield. He invited the offender, who was then homeless, to stay with him for a time. Later there was a dispute between the two men and the victim asked the offender to leave his flat. 12 In about November 2006 the victim complained to a friend that he was having trouble with the offender and that he had told him to leave the premises. The victim told that friend and the victim’s father that the offender had come back to the premises after he had left, forced his way into the unit and had engaged in a fight with the victim. The victim said that he was concerned about the offender stealing a pair of small nail scissors from him. 13 Both the victim and the offender were visitors to The Sole Café situated in Denison Street, Newcastle West and operated by The Life Church. The café provides breakfast three days a week to homeless and disadvantaged people in Newcastle as well as providing lunches on some days of the week. The victim had been a regular patron of the café for about three years prior to January 2007. 14 The victim had experienced difficulties following the breakdown of a relationship in about 2000 and had begun to use illicit drugs. For some period of time he had lived on the streets.15 The victim was friendly with Barry Cameron, a person with whom the victim had shared premises for about three years, at one stage. Mr Cameron was in the habit of visiting the victim about once a week. He and the victim went regularly to the café together to have breakfast and occasionally for lunch. 16 On Friday 12 January 2007 the offender, aged thirty-four, left his home in Telarah early, arriving at The Sole Café some time after 7.45am. Mr Cameron and his girlfriend, Sherri Johnson were also in attendance that day, along with thirty other regular patrons. The victim, aged twenty-seven, was also present, seated across the table from Mr Cameron and Ms Johnson. At about 7.45am the victim assisted the Minister of The Life Church to seat an intoxicated patron.17 Mr Cameron saw the offender seated in the café having breakfast. The offender appeared to be mumbling to himself. The victim came over to Mr Cameron and Ms Johnson and said:  
     
      
       
        
        “I’m going to punch him out, he ripped me off a couple of weeks ago and I’m going to have a blue with him.” 
        
       
      
    18 The victim was pointing towards the offender during this conversation. Mr Cameron told the victim to “make sure you do it outside the gates”. The victim then asked Mr Cameron if he was going to “jump in” but Mr Cameron declined, although he offered to stand there and watch to make sure that it was one-on-one. The victim then said “I’ll go out and wait.” 19 Another patron of the café saw the victim walking around the dining room looking agitated and aggressive. He saw the victim walk over and talk to the offender. The victim then walked out the side door of the café and started shadow boxing. The victim came in and out about four or five times on each occasion speaking to the offender. It is not clear what the victim was saying to the offender but it appeared to others that the victim was, in effect, spoiling for a fight.  20 The offender gave an account to a psychiatrist and a psychologist a year after these events to the effect that the victim threatened to kill him. This account was not confirmed on oath in the course of these proceedings and accordingly I attach little weight to it.  21 Mr Cameron could see that the victim was keeping watch from the side door of the café and at some stage had taken off his shirt. The victim asked another patron for a cigarette saying:  
     
      
       
        
        “I’m waiting to see a bloke in there, I’m going to get him when he comes out. He stole my missus scissors yesterday and I want to see him and get them back.” 
        
       
      
    22 About ten minutes later shortly before 8am the offender walked towards the doors, apparently intending to leave the café. Mr Cameron followed the offender. Mr Cameron told police that he was concerned to make sure that the offender did not have someone else to help him leaving the victim outnumbered. As the offender was getting to the door Mr Cameron saw that he was reaching into his backpack. 23 The victim was moving towards the door from the laneway at the same time as the offender was going to the door from inside the café. The victim and the offender met at the door where the victim pushed the doors open from the outside confronting the offender with “I’m going to smash you.” As this was said the offender pulled a serrated kitchen knife out of his backpack and stabbed the victim in the chest just below the left nipple. The victim turned and ran out of the café, and then turned to head back around the side of the café. 24 Mr Cameron said to the offender: 
     
      
       
        
        “You won’t always have a knife with you, I’ll catch up with you.”  
         
        
       
      
    25 The offender looked at Mr Cameron briefly before running out of the front door. The victim had run into the side lane where he told another patron: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ring an ambulance, he just stabbed me.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    26 Mr Cameron went back into the café, told Ms Johnson that the victim had been stabbed and went to the victim’s aid. There were about fifteen to twenty people in the vicinity of the victim who were standing outside the side door of the café holding his chest. The victim was gasping for breath and losing a lot of blood. The Ministered arrived and assisted the victim to the ground. At this point the victim arched his back in pain and blood began to gush from the chest wound. The Minister took off his shirt and applied the shirt with pressure to the victim’s wound. A nurse who was working at the café also assisted by the application of a dressing to the wound, reapplying the shirt and instructing the Minister to hold the shirt against the wound with pressure. She began to check the victim’s pulse. 27 The ambulance arrived at 8am. Police also arrived at about this time. Ambulance personnel were unable to detect a pulse and despite resuscitation attempts the victim died at the scene.28 A subsequent post mortem determined that the cause of death was a single stab wound to the chest. The track of the wound passed through skin, subcutaneous tissues, external chest muscles, intercostal muscles and rib, damaging the intercostal vessels at that level and then passing through the pleura. The knife then perforated the pericardium and penetrated the left ventricle of the heart terminating in the region of the mitral valve ring. The total length of the track was approximately eleven point three centimetres with approximately five point five centimetres of that track being within the heart muscle. The wound showed a hilt mark which was indicative of the application of heavy force. 29 The knife subsequently found in the offender’s backpack was entirely consistent with the injuries observed to the victim, including the overall size and appearance of the hilt mark. 30 At about 8.28am the offender called his housemate saying  
     
      
       
        
        “I have just stabbed a bloke, what will I do?” 
         
        
       
      The housemate asked the offender what had happened, the offender replied: 
       
        
        “A heap of guys came at me, they were going to beat me up, I didn’t know what to do.” 
        
       
      
    31 The significance of this comment resides in the fact that the offender clearly apprehended an assault by the victim and others. It is consistent with the fact that Mr Cameron followed the offender from the café and that from the offender’s perspective he was at a serious disadvantage. It is also relevant to observe that the offender’s mental illness discussed below included a tendency to persecutory delusions.32 Later that day the offender spoke again to his housemate and was informed that the victim had died. The offender indicated that he was going to flee, however following a phone call from the housemate to police the offender was arrested at his workplace at a Kotara shopping centre at about 2.30pm that day. 33 At the time of his arrest the offender agreed that there was a knife in his bag but refused to say anything further. He later declined a formal interview, although he submitted to certain forensic procedures. 34 The acceptance by the Crown of the offender’s plea of guilty to the offence of manslaughter reflects an acknowledgement by the Crown that had the matter gone to trial on the offence of murder the Crown was not able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not believe that it was necessary to stab the victim in order to defend himself from an imminent assault.35 It is important to appreciate in this context that if a jury had thought it reasonably possible that the offender genuinely believed that it was necessary to respond in the manner that he did then the Crown would fail to secure a conviction for murder. The existence of a genuine belief in the offender stood to be assessed by a jury in the circumstances as the offender perceived them at the time, taking into account the fact that the offender suffered from schizophrenia and was possibly affected by drugs and/or alcohol. 36 This is, in many respects, the most tragic feature of this case. The offender’s conflicts with the victim in the past, the offender’s long standing mental illness and abuse of alcohol and other substances and the obvious aggression exhibited by the victim towards him on that morning all combined to engender a heightened and exaggerated sense of danger which he sought to meet by the use of a knife. 37 The court is not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to kill the victim, although the force of the blow with the knife to the victim’s chest establishes to the requisite standard that the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm. The objective gravity of the offence is therefore considerable. The offender carried the knife with him and did not hesitate to use it. 38 Whilst it is accepted that the offender responded to a perceived threat as he approached the exit to the café, the victim had given him ample notice of his intentions. And it was always within the offender’s means to seek protection by alerting others to his predicament before he moved to leave. Herein lies the offender’s true criminality. It was a grossly disproportionate response to the threat of physical assault in circumstances where, had the offender exercised a moments reflection, the whole confrontation could have been averted. 39 The offender’s subjective case is contained within the report of Dr Delaforce of 30 April 2008, together with a report of Mr Taylor of 26 June 2008. It was noted by Dr Delaforce, in particular, that the offender was a somewhat unreliable historian, although this was not the result of deliberate dishonesty on the offender’s part.  40 The offender reported a happy childhood in Newcastle, although he reported excessive physical discipline at the hands of his alcoholic father. His parents separated when he was fourteen years of age. The offender continued to live with his mother, although his escalating drug and alcohol abuse eventually resulted in the offender leaving her home at the age of eighteen years. Over the following years the offender lived in boarding houses, sometimes on the streets and in New South Wales Department of Housing premises. 41 The offender was convicted of an assault upon his mother and was subject to an apprehended violence order in 1997. Relevantly there was a further assault upon his mother in March 2002, in the course of which the offender brandished a knife. In addition, the offender was convicted in 2004 of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm as a result of an altercation with a member of the public, whom the offender stabbed with a pair of scissors. 42 His criminal history consists of minor assault and AVO offences, recorded at a summary level, all arising out of drug and/or alcohol abuse, coupled with the offender’s mental health issues. To date his propensity to violence has been almost exclusively exhibited in the course of domestic relationships. 43 The offender’s relationship with his mother improved from about 2004 until her death in recent times. The offender now enjoys a good relationship with his father. There was no reported family history of mental illness. The offender was educated to the end of Year Nine following his expulsion from school because of violent behaviour and conflict with teachers. Since that time he has been employed in a number of unskilled and semi-skilled labouring positions. He has supported himself from the proceeds of that employment and some Centrelink payments. 44 Between 1993 and 2006 the offender has had a number of psychiatric inpatient admissions to James Fletcher Hospital related to his intoxication by both alcohol and other illicit substances, and associated with property damage, violence or threats of violence to others and self harm. The records of the Hunter New England Mental Health Services include references to the offender’s homelessness, the difficulties in his relationship with his parents, in particular his mother, the fact that he was a victim of child abuse, and sexual abuse by an adult male at a tender age, and his inability to form lasting relationships. There are also frequent references to his psychotic symptoms such as auditory hallucinations and persecutory delusions.  45 The offender has been most consistently diagnosed with poly substance abuse, substance induced psychoses associated with excessive cannabis, amphetamine and alcohol use, and a specific diagnosis of schizophrenia. These conditions were extant on 12 January 2007, although there is no reason to think that the offender was relevantly substantially impaired at the time.  46 The offender has never married or had children but was in a de-facto relationship for about one year between 2000 and 2001. Significantly that relationship ended following a conviction for assault upon his partner. 47 Notwithstanding the efforts of various public mental health facilities to assist the offender there are numerous references with in the records to his non compliance with treatment regimes and his failure to undergo rehabilitation programs aimed at kerbing his alcohol and substance abuse. In these circumstances the extent to which the offender’s illness ought mitigate the penalty that is otherwise appropriate to the objective gravity of the offence is minimal. There is no suggestion that the offender lacks the cognitive or intellectual capacity to appreciate the consequences of his behaviour. He has chosen, for much of his life, to dull the pain of his existence with alcohol and drugs, thus inducing and exacerbating his schizophrenia. 48 General and specific deterrence play a significant part in the determination of the sentence. Not surprisingly the offender has now expressed a willingness to enter rehabilitation in the realisation that his drug and alcohol abuse has, in effect, led him to his present predicament. I accept that the offender’s expression of remorse to both Dr Delaforce and Mr Taylor is genuine. However his prospects of rehabilitation remain guarded. 49 Whilst the offence and the offender’s imprisonment provide the impetus for change the offender’s acceptance of treatment within the controlled environment of the prison system may not be so readily forthcoming, once the offender is released into the community. It is clear that the offender will require ongoing intensive supervision following his release. However, no great departure from the standard ratio between the non parole period and the balance of term is warranted in this case. The non parole period itself must adequately reflect the objective gravity of the offence. 50 Given the entry of the plea on the date fixed for trial and the fact that it was first confirmed to the prosecution two weeks before the trial date I propose to discount the sentence by fifteen percent. It was always available to the offender to indicate his willingness to plead to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self defence. The fact that the Crown case was not inconsistent with such a plea did not oblige the Crown to make overtures to the offender’s legal representatives at an earlier time. 51 Taking all of these matters into account I propose to sentence as follows. Mr Stephens would you please stand.52 Trevor Stephens you are convicted of the manslaughter of David Paul Willoughby. You are sentenced to a non parole period of seven years to date from 12 January 2007, expiring 11 January 2014 with a balance of term of three years expiring 11 January 2017. You are eligible for release to parole on 12 January 2014.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Danny Rosenthal was found guilty at a trial by judge alone of driving under the influence of a drug, occasioning grievous bodily harm. That is an offence under s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act, carrying a maximum sentence of seven years imprisonment. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3½ years, comprising a non-parole period of 2½ years and a balance of term of 1 year, commencing on the day of the verdict, 18 December 2006. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. He was also sentenced to a short concurrent term of imprisonment for driving whilst disqualified and suffered a further period of disqualification, but those matters were not raised in the application. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    3 Put shortly, the facts as the trial judge found them for the purpose of sentence were these. In the small hours of the morning of 6 March 2005, the applicant and his partner, Ms Kelly Porter, drove from the eastern suburbs of Sydney, where they lived, to the Blue Mountains. Why they did so is unclear. The applicant was driving and Ms Porter, who was thirty-three weeks pregnant, was in the front passenger seat. Some time before they left, the applicant had used the drug commonly known as ecstasy.  
     
      
    4 Having reached the vicinity of Katoomba, they travelled back towards Sydney on the Great Western highway. They reached Glenbrook a little before 3am. There the car left the highway and collided with concrete safety barriers at the intersection with Knapsack Street. Ms Porter was seriously injured, as was the applicant himself. Sadly, their unborn child was killed. It was the injuries to Ms Porter, together with the death of the baby, which constituted the grievous bodily harm charged. 
     
      
    5 The principal issue at the trial was whether the applicant was under the influence of the ecstasy at the time of the collision. The statutory defence provided by s52A(8) of the Crimes Act was also raised. It was put for the applicant that the accident was the result of inefficiency in the car’s braking system, the lighting at the intersection and certain features of the roadway, so as to be in no way attributable to the effect of the drug upon him. His Honour resolved those issues adversely to him.  
     
      
    6 A blood sample taken from the applicant after the accident revealed a reading of 0.45 milligrams of ecstasy per litre and, in the light of pharmacological evidence, his Honour concluded that his driving ability would have been slightly to moderately impaired at the time. There was expert evidence about the braking system of the car, from which his Honour concluded that there was “some inefficiency” in the system but not such as to be significant. He rejected an argument that the condition of the brakes, the lighting and the features of the roadway combined to provide a possible explanation for the car leaving the highway, and expressed himself satisfied that there was no reasonable explanation for the accident other than error on the part of the applicant.  
     
      
    7 His Honour made these findings in the course of arriving at his verdict, and he adhered to them for the purpose of sentence.  
     
      
       
      Subjective case 
       
      
    8 The applicant was twenty-two years old at the time of the offence, and is now twenty-five. His Honour saw nothing of relevance in his family background. His education did not progress beyond mid-secondary school and he had had no more than intermittent employment. However, his relationship with Ms Porter had endured after the accident, and was stable.  
     
      
    9 A psychologist, who provided a report, found him to be in the borderline range of intellectual capability. He had long suffered from Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Tourette’s disorder. Tourette’s disorder is a distressing condition, manifesting itself in vocal and motor tics which were described by the psychologist as “coughing and grunting and distortions of the mouth”. His Honour found that the two conditions caused him frustration and considerable social difficulties, particularly in his formative years. He had been prescribed medication for both these conditions for some years but, as his Honour put it, it had not been easy “to determine a suitable regime of treatment”. 
     
      
    10 He began using ecstasy in his late teens, and was a regular user of the drug at the time of the offence. He had found that it helped control the symptoms of the Tourette’s disorder and he persisted in using it partly for that reason. He had developed a considerable tolerance for the drug. The pharmacologist who expressed the opinion that his driving would have been slightly to moderately impaired at the time of the accident took that tolerance into account in arriving at that view.  
     
      
    11 His criminal history did not assist him. Since the accident he had been sentenced to a relatively short term of imprisonment for offences of dishonesty and driving whilst disqualified. He had been charged with some of those dishonesty offences before the accident, and was on bail in respect of them at the time. More importantly, in January 2005 he had been fined for some traffic offences and his licence was disqualified for twelve months. He was subject to that disqualification, which had been in force for less than two months, at the time of the accident. Otherwise, his traffic record disclosed that he had been licensed since 1999 and had committed seven speeding offences in the period from June 2000 to November 2004. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    12 His Honour referred to the guideline judgment in respect of sentencing for offences of this kind in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, in which this Court reviewed the earlier guideline in R v Jurisic (1998) 45NSWLR 209. In Whyte at [204], Spigelman CJ noted that the “frequently recurring case” of an offence under the relevant provision with which the guideline is concerned involves, among other things, an offender of good character “with no or limited prior convictions”, who has pleaded guilty and shown genuine remorse. In the present case, his Honour observed that none of those three features was to be found. He found that, although the applicant was “distraught” about the consequences of the accident, he had not shown that he was remorseful about his offending conduct. His Honour also considered that general deterrence should be a “prominent consideration”, and found nothing in the applicant’s subjective case to “warrant any amelioration of this”.  
     
      
    13 Whyte confirmed the Jurisic guideline sentence of two years full-time imprisonment for offences involving grievous bodily harm where the offender’s moral culpability is high or, as the Chief Justice put it at [228], where the offender “has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct”. In sentencing the applicant, his Honour accepted that his practice of using ecstasy “at a relatively high dosage level” was “at least partially” to control the symptoms of his Tourette’s disorder, and that he had developed a tolerance for the drug which led him to believe that he was not “as impaired in driving ability as he actually was”. For that reason, his Honour considered the offence less serious than if the applicant had consumed the drug “solely for its pleasurable effects”. However, his Honour continued:  
     
      
       
        
        Nevertheless, to consume a significant quantity of a drug and then to embark upon a long journey as a driver, with an eight month pregnant woman in the car with him, when he should not have been driving at all and was on bail for serious criminal offences, is indicative of a serious abandonment of responsibility. 
        
       
      
    14 Otherwise, the subjective material persuaded his Honour that the applicant’s rehabilitation would require involvement in community based programs for drug treatment and personal development. To that end, he found special circumstances so as to justify a modest departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. This, he concluded, would leave the applicant with a period of parole eligibility sufficient to foster his rehabilitation, while imposing a non-parole period which properly reflected the objective gravity of his offence. He also had regard to the fact that it might be difficult to monitor the treatment of the applicant’s Tourette’s disorder in prison, and that the disorder might lead to his being socially isolated and vulnerable to mistreatment by other prisoners. 
     
      
      The Application 
       
      
    15 Counsel for the applicant, Mr Segal, challenged his Honour’s findings of fact for the purpose of sentence and aspects of his Honour’s approach to sentence. For the most part, I find those arguments unpersuasive. His Honour’s remarks demonstrate a careful review of the evidence at the trial and the subjective material, and address all relevant sentencing considerations. However, there is one matter raised by Mr Segal which, in my view, has substance. 16 From the passage in the remarks on sentence quoted above, it appears that, in determining that the offence amounted to a “serious abandonment of responsibility”, his Honour had regard to the fact that the applicant was a disqualified driver and was on bail for other offences. Clearly, his Honour used the expression ”abandonment of responsibility” in the context of the guideline promulgated in Whyte (supra). However, the notion of abandonment of responsibility or high moral culpability in the guideline is directed to the objective gravity of the offence. It is concerned, where relevant, with the extent to which the driver was affected by alcohol or a drug and, generally, with the course of driving and the danger posed by it in its attendant circumstances. So much is apparent from the aggravating factors, on which a finding of abandonment of responsibility might be based, referred to by the Chief Justice in Whyte at [216] - [217]. 17 It does not appear to me that the fact that a driver was disqualified, let alone the fact that he or she was on bail for other offences, is relevant to that assessment. Of course, they are matters relevant to sentence generally as they bear on the issue of deterrence, both personal and general. However, I am satisfied that his Honour fell into error in taking them into account on the question of abandonment of responsibility. Accordingly, this Court’s discretion to re-sentence the applicant is enlivened.  
     
      
      Re-sentence 
       
      
    18 In all the circumstances, I am satisfied that a lesser sentence than that which his Honour passed is warranted. True it is that this was a serious offence, with dreadful consequences. Appropriate weight must be afforded to considerations of retribution and deterrence, the latter heightened by the fact that the applicant was a disqualified driver and subject to conditioned liberty at the time of the accident. However, this was also a sad and unusual case. 19 I have referred earlier to his Honour’s observation that three of the features of a typical case referred to by the Chief Justice in Whyte at [204] were absent, warranting a sentence above the two year guideline. I accept that a sentence above the guideline is called for, given the circumstances of the offence and the unfavourable aspects of the applicant’s antecedents. However, there are two other features of a typical case to which the Chief Justice referred which are absent, and their absence favours the applicant. They are that the victim of the offence is a stranger, and that the driver or the driver’s intimates suffered “no or limited injury”. 20 Here, of course, the victim was the applicant’s partner. Moreover, there was before his Honour a handwritten statement of Ms Porter in which she spoke highly of the applicant’s conduct in his relationship with her, and made it clear that she forgave him for what had occurred and saw their relationship as enduring for life. Moreover, the applicant himself was badly injured, and he also suffers the loss of their unborn child. 21 The applicant is a young man who has had a difficult background because of his medical problems. Of particular concern is his Tourette’s disorder which, as his Honour said, is likely to make prison life very difficult for him. 22 I would maintain his Honour’s finding of special circumstances, which was well founded in the subjective material. That said, I am mindful of the need for the non-parole period to be adequate to reflect the applicant’s criminality. The appropriate sentence, in, my view, is imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months. 23 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. I would quash the sentence passed in the District Court. In lieu, I would sentence the applicant to a non-parole period of 1 year and 9 months, commencing on 18 December 2006 and expiring on 17 September 2008, and a balance of term of 1 year and 3 months, commencing on 18 September 2008 and expiring on 17 December 2009. I would direct that the applicant be released on parole on 17 September 2008.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: At a pre-trial directions hearing on 4 April 2008 it was directed that an inquiry be held pursuant to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 concerning the fitness of the accused Peter John Coles to be tried. The Crown proposed to present an indictment containing two counts alleging first, that on 5 November 2006 he murdered Janice Eileen Coles (his mother) and second, that on the same date he maliciously wounded Gary Dangerfield. The issue of his possible unfitness was raised before arraignment and he has not yet been arraigned.  
     
      
    2 On 1 July 2008 the matter was listed for the purpose of inquiry. Mr Hoyle SC appeared for the Crown and Mr Winch of counsel for the accused. As stipulated in the statute, the proceedings were not conducted in an adversary manner and there was put before the Court by consent, a bundle of documents comprising, inter alia, witness statements, a transcript of interview between the accused and investigating police conducted after his arrest, and various psychiatric reports. 
     
      
    3 In any event, there is no dispute about the facts and brief reference will suffice to record my findings. Janice Coles and Gary Dangerfield shared a flat in Dee Why over a period of some eight to ten years. At the relevant time they lived, as Mr Dangerfield described, as “strong spiritual friends”. They occupied separate bedrooms. On Saturday night 4 November they had retired to their rooms. In the early hours of the next morning, Mr Dangerfield was awakened by Janice Coles coming into his room and calling that her son Peter (the accused) had stabbed her.  
     
      
    4 They went to her room and eventually the accused entered and stabbed his mother on multiple occasions. Mr Dangerfield had tried to intervene but a struggle ensued and he himself was injured by stabbing. He fled to seek help. In the meantime the accused made his way back to his flat in Manly where police attended and there arrested him. Several hours later in a recorded interview with police he agreed that he had stabbed his mother and had done so, he said, because he loved her. This claim was obviously not rational. The accused has a long history of mental illness and it would be futile to seek to gauge many of his statements against standards of rationality. 
     
      
    5 My present task is not directed to culpability for the acts of stabbing and it would be mere surplusage to recount at length the history of the accused’s manifestations of illness. The issue is his fitness now to plead and be tried. No onus of proof is cast upon the Crown or the accused in relation to inquiry as to fitness. 
     
      
    6 The test to be applied has been classically described by Smith J in R v Presser 1958 VR 45 and it is has consistently been followed in this State: for example R v Rivfkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284. The passage commencing at p 49 of the report in Presser does not in the circumstances of this case to which I will shortly turn, require recitation. It might be observed that forensic psychiatrists are obviously familiar with the “Presser” test. 
     
      
    7 The conclusion that an inquiry as to fitness was required emerged from an opinion expressed by Dr Stephen Allnutt who saw the accused at the request of the Crown on 8 December 2007. In his report following examination on that day he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, the Defendant manifests capacity to understand what it is that he is charged with. He was capable of articulating the nature of the charges to me when I enquired; in my view he has a capacity to understand the general nature of the proceedings – in interview with me the Defendant clearly understood the roles of the various individuals in the Court and that the proceeding was an inquiry into events to determine his guilt or innocence; I believe the Defendant has capacity to plea to the charge – he was able to articulate a choice of plea and a rational reason for choosing that plea. I believe the Defendant has capacity to decide what defence he will rely upon. 
        
       
       
        
        I have concern that the Defendant, presents with a significant disorganisation in his thinking processes, particularly when he discusses his relationship with his mother. This was most evident when exploring his feelings around his mother and the account of the alleged offence. When providing an account (which I have not reported here), the Defendant became quite flagrantly disorganised in his thinking and it was difficult to follow or get a sense that the information that he was providing had reliability; and because of this I believe that the Defendant would have difficulty at this stage in making his defence and answering to the charge and he would have difficulty in giving the necessary instruction by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts are. His thought disorder raises the issue of the reliability of his account of the alleged offence, including the nature of his decision making and reasoning that relates to the alleged offence. I believe this would also impair his capacity to tell the Court or psychiatrists his version what his version.  
        
       
       
        
        He will probably have some difficulty in exercising his right of challenge. 
        
       
       
        
        Overall therefore I believe the Defendant should currently be regarded as unfit to stand trial. The Defendant is taking antipsychotic medication. It is not clear to me the degree to which the Defendant has responded so far to the antipsychotic medication, however, he is taking Clozapine, which is a medication, which is prescribed to individuals who have treatment resistant schizophrenia, and there is a risk that the Defendant would not respond to treatment within the next 12 months. It is however important that if there is fitness hearing that I have the opportunity to reassess him as there also remains a possibility that his mental state could have improved by then to the degree that he is fit. This is difficult to predict.” 
        
       
      
    8 Previously (on 31 May 2007) Dr Olav Nielssen had examined and made an assessment concerning the accused. In his subsequent report he made no reference to an issue of fitness to plead nor did Dr Bruce Westmore who had seen the accused on 19 April 2007.  
     
      
    9 Given what Dr Allnutt had written, Dr Nielssen was asked to re-examine the accused and to turn his attention specifically to the question of fitness. In a report dated 22 February 2008 he stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Coles recognises that he has a mental illness, which is confirmed by his long term adherence to antipsychotic medication in the community. He is aware that he experienced an acute exacerbation of the illness around the time of the offence. He has consistently stated that he intends to enter a plea of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. He has demonstrated sufficient understanding of the nature of the charges and proceedings to be considered fit to enter a plea and fit for the sort of trial that he faces. 
        
       
       
        
        Hence I believe that notwithstanding the effect of a severe communication disorder that would impede Mr Coles’ ability to give coherent evidence on his own behalf in court, that he is on balance now fit to enter a plea.” 
        
       
      
    10 Dr Allnutt was made aware of this expression of opinion. He was invited to reassess the accused and in a report of 30 May 2008 (which it should be noted is after the date for the inquiry had been fixed at the directions hearing) he expressed this further opinion: 
     
      
       
        
        “It should be stated at outset that in examining the Defendant’s capacity to stand trial, his presentation was replete with difficulties in communicating his understanding of the court process as outlined in my report. Notwithstanding this, it was possible to infer from the information he provided that he had adequate capacity in many areas relating to Presser despite his obvious disorganised manner of presenting the information. 
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion, the Defendant manifests capacity to understand what it is he is charged with – while he articulated to me an understanding that he was charged with malicious wounding, inherent in my interview with him was an understanding that he was charged with murder and he was able to provide with an a (sic) basic understanding of the allegations. 
        
       
       
        
        He manifested, in my view, adequate capacity to understand the general nature of the proceedings – he communicated that the proceedings were an inquiry into whether or not he was guilty and that he was hoping to be found not guilty; he manifested capacity to plead to the charge – he communicated to me that he understood the various pleas available to him; with the information he gave me I was able to form the view that he understood the meanings of the terms guilty and not guilty and the consequences of findings related to those terms; in my opinion, he had capacity to understand that he likely suffered from illness symptoms at the time and was able to articulate his intention to pursue a defence of not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        As with my prior interview, when discussing matters that related to the offence itself, he became more disorganised in his thought processes. This is not uncommon in individuals who suffer from thought disorder, discussing things that deal directly with issues relating to his delusional beliefs symptoms or issues that cause a high degree of stress that they experience more difficulties in organising their thoughts. This to some degree explains why at times he was capable of giving myself and Dr Nielssen a reasonably coherent account with regard to his psychiatric history but seemed to become more disorganised when discussing issues relating to the offence and also issue of fitness to stand trial. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe because of his ongoing and severe communication difficulties that he would have difficulty in communicating with counsel. He would probably to able to let his counsel know what his version of the facts and tell the Court his version. However to the listener his articulation of his version would likely sound confusing because of his odd use of language, tangentiality and disorganisation of ideas. The listener would have to infer the underlying meaning based on what the lister (sic) had heard. This, in my view, increases the risk that the listener could misinterpret what the Defendant actually means to state. 
        
       
       
        
        I would agree with Dr Nielssen that if this matter goes to a hearing on the issue of insanity and the Defendant participates to a relatively little degree in his actual defence at such a hearing that he would likely be fit to stand trial. 
        
       
       
        
        However, if the Court adopted the view that at the time of a fitness hearing the Court considers the issue of fitness in the context of a range of possibilities (a plea of not guilty and a trial included), ignoring the assumption that this would go to a hearing on the issue of insanity; then I do not believe that he could be regarded as able to make his defence or answer to the charge by giving necessary instruction to his legal representatives. I believe that his counsel would have difficulty in feeling confident that the information he provided to them with regard to the circumstances around the offence or his interpretation of the evidence as the trial proceeds was reliable. I also believe that due to his thought disorder and his tendency to become easily confused, he would have difficulty in following proceedings in a trial. On this basis he would be found unfit to stand trial.” 
        
       
      
    11 In the light of these developments it is the submission of both counsel who, in conformity with the statutory edict, had adopted for this purpose non adversary posture, that I should determine that there is no longer any need for a fitness inquiry to be conducted. I agree. 
     
      
    12 An election by the accused for trial by judge alone has been filed. It has been forecast that the content of trial evidence, if the accused be arraigned and plead not guilty as anticipated, will be identical with that which is presently before the Court. As I have said, it is not necessary for present purposes to summarize the evidence but it is common ground that there is a unanimity of opinion in the psychiatric evidence that, at the relevant time, the accused was suffering from a mental illness that deprived him of the capacity to understand that what he was doing was morally wrong.  
     
      
    13 As authorized by s 8 (2) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act I determine that there is no longer any need to conduct an inquiry on the question of the unfitness of the accused to be tried.

     Headnote 
     
     
      
    A jury found the appellant guilty of two offences under the Crimes Act 1900: ss 66C sexual intercourse with a person over the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years; and 61K(a) maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm with the intent to have sexual intercourse. In respect of the s 66C offence, the appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance of term of 1 year. In respect of the offence under s 61K(a) the trial judge imposed a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months. The total effective sentence imposed was 7 years, with a total effective non-parole period of 5 years 6 months.The relevant facts relied on by the Crown for the s 61K(a) offence were that the appellant and “TD” were alone in a caravan and the appellant attempted to have sexual intercourse with her. After the appellant left, TD noticed she had scratches on her back, a split lip and marks around her neck. Police photographed the scratches and TD’s mother gave evidence regarding the marks on her neck, scratches on her back and a bruise on her arm. The appellant appealed against his conviction in respect of the s61K(a) on offence on the grounds that: i) the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported on the evidence and ii) a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the trial judge’s directions regarding the requirement that the actual bodily harm be inflicted maliciously. The appellant also sought leave to appeal against sentence.Held per Beazley JA (Johnson and McCallum JJ agreeing):On the question of whether the verdict was unreasonable and could not be supported having regard to the evidence1. Any one of the multiple injuries complained of, if accepted by the jury, was sufficient to establish actual bodily harm: [22].2. As the injuries were clearly specified in the evidence and summing up, it cannot be said that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable on the basis that the Crown had failed to specify a particular injury upon which it relied: [22].3. Where the evidence forms part of a circumstantial case, the bare possibility of innocence should not prevent a jury from a finding of guilt, if the inference of guilt is the only inference open to a reasonable jury upon a consideration of all the facts in evidence: [25] ff.

    4. On the evidence, the only occasion where the appellant and TD had any physical contact was whilst he was attempting to have sexual intercourse. There was no basis to support a contention that the injury was inflicted in some other way: [28]-[29].On the question of whether a miscarriage of justice occurred as a result of the trial judge’s directions regarding the requirement that the actual bodily harm be inflicted maliciously 
     
      
    5. The trial judge properly directed the jury that the actual bodily harm had to be maliciously inflicted and with the intention to have sexual intercourse, beyond the malice inherent in the offence: [40]-[46].On the question of whether the trial judge failed to direct the jury that to prove malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm, it was necessary to prove intent or recklessness 
     
      
    6. There was no miscarriage of justice in the trial judge reading the complete s 5 statutory definition of “maliciously” to the jury, namely, that an act was done (i) of malice; (ii) without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering (iii) with intent to injure and without lawful cause or excuse; or (iv) recklessly or wantonly: [50]-[56], [66], [70].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 14 August 2006, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of 12 of an offence under s 66C of the Crimes Act 1900 (count 2) and a further offence under s 61K(a) of the Crimes Act (count 4). The charge brought under s 66C was that the appellant had sexual intercourse with a person over the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, namely, 14 years, between 1 January 2001 and 31 January 2001. The maximum penalty for an offence under s 66C was imprisonment for 8 years. The offence charged under s 61K(a) of the Crimes Act was that the appellant, on or about 3 April 2002, maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm with the intent to have sexual intercourse. The maximum penalty for this offence was imprisonment for 20 years. The victim of each offence was TD.  
     
      
    2 The jury was unable to reach a verdict in respect of another two offences, one under s 66C (count 1) and one under s 61L of the Crimes Act (count 3). 
     
      
    3 In respect of the s 66C offence (count 2), the trial judge imposed a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 23 August 2006 and to expire on 22 August 2009 with a balance of term of 1 year to expire on 22 August 2010. In respect of the offence under s 61K(a) (count 4), the trial judge imposed a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months to commence on 23 August 2007 and to expire on 22 February 2012 with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months to expire on 22 August 2013. The total effective sentence imposed by her Honour was a sentence of 7 years with a total effective non-parole period of 5 years 6 months. 
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals against his conviction in respect of the s 61K(a) offence on the following grounds:  
     
      
       
        
        “1. The verdict with respect to count 4 was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
         
         
        2. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a consequence of the learned trial judge’s directions with respect to count 4, regarding the requirement that the actual bodily harm be inflicted maliciously.”  
        
       
      
    5 At the time of the commission of this offence, s 61K(a) provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        61K Assault with intent to have sexual intercourse 
         
         
        Any person who, with intent to have sexual intercourse with another person:  
         
         
        (a) maliciously inflicts actual bodily harm on the other person … 
         
         
        is liable to imprisonment for 20 years.” 
        
       
      
    6 The appellant also seeks leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    7 Although the appeal is only brought in respect of the s 61K(a) offence, it is useful to recount the facts in respect of both offences of which the appellant was convicted, as some of the evidence in respect of the s 66C offence explains some of the evidence in respect of the s 61K(a) offence. The facts in respect of the s 66C offence are also relevant should the Court grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      Evidence in respect of the s 66C offence 
       
      
    8 In January 2001, during the Country Music Festival week in Tamworth, TD and two friends, KS and CG, went to a flat that was rented by JG. TD gave evidence that when she was alone with the appellant in a bedroom, he closed the door, took off TD’s underpants and had sexual intercourse with her. She told him to stop. Another person came into the room and then walked out. Immediately afterwards, TD went outside and told her friend, KS, what had happened. KS went back into the flat and later told TD that she, KS, had “abused” the appellant (presumably for what he had done to TD). TD said that she did not remember if she had drunk any alcohol that day and had a poor memory of the day. During the course of cross-examination, TD identified KS as being the person who had come into the room. In her evidence in chief, she had identified this person as JG.  
     
      
    9 KS recalled being at the flat with TD in January 2001 and thought that it was during the Country Music Festival week. She said that she and TD had had a few drinks and that TD was “very very intoxicated, she was slurring”. KS remembered that the appellant and JG were at the flat and she also thought that CG was there. She recalled that TD went into a bedroom and that at one stage, she, KS, went in the bedroom to find her. She saw the appellant on top of TD with his pants down, on a single bed. KS recalled screaming at the appellant and may have pulled him off TD. KS agreed that she was also intoxicated at this time. 
     
      
    10 JG gave evidence of having leased the flat and that whilst he lived there he met somebody called “Hoges”. He said that people used to come around to the flat all the time and that he remembered TD and KS doing so. He said that he didn’t know if they drank alcohol there and agreed that both the girls looked “about 12 or so … like kids”. In his statement to police, JG said the flat was like “a drop in centre where people would drink alcohol”. 
     
      
       
      Evidence in respect of the s 61K(a) offence 
       
      
    11 TD did not see the appellant after this incident until 3 April 2002, when she was living with KS in a caravan. On that date, a friend of KS’s, MR, visited the caravan. Around about lunchtime, JG and the appellant also arrived at the caravan. TD did not initially recognise the appellant because his appearance had changed from when she had seen him at the Tamworth flat, over a year previously. MR, JG and the appellant stayed at the caravan for a number of hours, playing cards and drinking alcohol. At some stage KS and MR left. JG also left and the appellant and TD were alone in the caravan.  
     
      
    12 The appellant tried to kiss TD and she pushed him away. The appellant then pulled his pants down and masturbated. The appellant tried to take TD’s clothes off and “tried to have sex with [her]”. The appellant said to TD that he was “going to fuck [her] right or wrong”. TD could not remember at what stage the appellant said this to her. TD said that whilst the appellant was trying to have sex with her, she scratched him on the arm.  
     
      
    13 TD did not recall how the incident stopped, but she did remember that the appellant rang a taxi and left. TD locked the door of the caravan. She said that she was scared and had scratches on her back, a split lip and marks around her neck. She remembered that it was about 2 or 3 am when the taxi arrived. KS returned at about 7 am the next morning. TD went home to her mother’s house that evening and her mother made her ring the police.  
     
      
    14 During the course of cross-examination in respect of this incident, it was suggested to TD that the scratches on her back had occurred because she had slipped and fallen on the steps of the caravan. TD denied this. The cross-examination was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Did you at some stage when you were in the van that night – I’m sorry, when you were at the van in the annexe did you slip and fall on the steps of the van? 
         
        A:  
        Me? 
         
         
        Q: Yes? 
         
        A:  
        No, [the appellant] did. 
         
         
        Q: I’m suggesting you missed the step and fell  
        on your left-hand side 
         in the van. Do you agree or disagree with that? 
         
        A:  
        I disagree. 
         
         
        Q: And [the appellant] said to you, ‘Are you okay?’ and you said you were. Do you agree or disagree with that? 
         
        A: I disagree. 
         
         
        Q: You say it was [the appellant] who fell on the steps of the van, is it? 
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: Did you see how that happened? 
         
        A: On the one that didn’t have the steps coming down, I had a little footstool thing there and he went on it and it collapsed under him and he fell and injured himself. 
         
         
        Q: So that was the back door, was it? 
         
        A: They both led into the annexe, but there was only one door to get in and out of the caravan that was in the annexe. It was like a sliding door. 
         
         
        Q: Is it possible that you did slip and fall near or on the step of the van and you just don’t remember it now? 
         
        A: No, I did not slip and – trip or fall. 
         
         
        Q: You specifically remember you didn’t – that didn’t happen, do you? 
         
        A: Yes. 
         
         
        Q: See, I’m suggesting to you that [the appellant] didn’t cause the scratches to your back that night, did he? 
         
        A: He did. 
         
         
        Q: He didn’t cause any injury to you that night? 
         
        A: He did.” (Emphasis added)  
        
       
      
    15 KS gave evidence that during the afternoon of 3 April 2002, she was at the caravan with TD when her friend MR came to visit. Later, JG and the appellant arrived with a bottle of alcohol. KS said she had a glass and she also saw TD drinking. MR left. She said that the appellant, TD and JG were playing cards. At one stage when TD had left the caravan to go the toilet, KS was sitting away from the others, when the appellant came over and tried to kiss her and was pushing her. KS told the appellant to get off and pushed him away. He didn’t attempt to touch her again after that. KS decided to leave the caravan park, as she was concerned about the rowdy behaviour of JG and the appellant, who would not leave, despite her request that they do so. KS arranged for MR to come back and pick her up. KS said she returned to the caravan early the next morning and TD told her that “Hoges tried to rape me”. KS described TD as being “hysterical” as she was telling her this. 
     
      
    16 The complainant’s mother, RD, who was a registered nurse, gave evidence that she received a telephone call from her daughter, who was crying and sobbing. TD told her mother that the appellant had hurt her. RD went to the caravan park but “couldn’t get any sense out of [TD] [as she was] just sobbing. She had red marks on her neck, scratches on her back, bruise on her arm or something”. RD said that all that TD “wanted to do was cry, curl up in a little ball”. Eventually she persuaded TD to go home with her and they went to the police the following day. RD said that she couldn’t get her daughter home immediately because TD was too frightened and didn’t want to go outside: “She didn’t even want to go over to the toilet block”.  
     
      
    17 JG remembered being at the caravan park on 3 April 2002 and going to the caravan in which TD and KS were then living. He said there was a long-haired blonde man there already and that they had a few drinks and played cards. JG said that the blonde man left and that a short time afterwards, KS went out to ring him up. JG said that he went with KS and when he returned to the van, the appellant and TD were drinking and playing cards. JG told them he was leaving and the appellant responded, “Oh well I’ll have to ring me mum up”. This appears to have been a reference to how the appellant was to get home.  
     
      
    18 A taxi driver gave evidence that he responded to a job sometime between 12.30 am and 1 am to pick up a fare from the caravan park. He said that he could not find anybody there, but that he picked the appellant up as he headed back into town. 
     
      
    19 TD was spoken to by Detective Senior Constable David Coulton on the afternoon of 5 April 2002. TD mentioned that she had scratches on her back. Photographs were later taken of her back. The photographs taken reveal a number of separate scratches at about waist-height. The marks were located in the middle of the back, extending to both the left and right of the vertebral spine. There were no observable scratches or other marks on her sides. DSC Coulton said that he did not notice any other injuries and did not recall seeing a split lip. He said had he noticed any other injuries, he would have requested that they be photographed.  
     
      
    20 The appellant gave evidence. He said that he was at the caravan park together with JG and there was a time when he and TD were alone together in the van. He said that TD was “flirty” and tried to touch him and that they had consensual sex in the annex to the caravan, which he believed was “her part of the caravan”. He said that they were interrupted by a “bash on the door”. He said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[TD] quickly jumped up and you know, like we were both startled, you know, thinking it might have been [JG] going to walk in or something like that. And so [TD] jumped up and raced up the couple of stairs to get in the caravan as she was getting dressed and slipped over on the top step sort of thing, and done a little roll and I jumped up and I said, ‘You right [TD]?’, she said, ‘Yeah. Yeah I’m all right’. She was a bit, you know, a bit upset. I could see and [JG’s] going, ‘What are you doing Hoges? You going to go home or not?’, you know, ‘You’ve got to go home’, you know. Mum was expecting me to go home. I said, ‘Yeah all right mate. I’ll just go and ring a cab’, you know, and checked on [TD].” 
        
       
       
      The appellant said that JG left immediately after this conversation. 
       
       
      Ground 1: The verdict with respect to the s 61K(a) offence was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence  
       
      
    21 The appellant submitted that in circumstances where TD had not given evidence as to when or how the appellant scratched her, and where the Crown had failed to particularise at any stage of the proceedings what injuries it relied upon in support of “actual bodily harm” that was alleged to have been inflicted, the verdict of the jury was unreasonable.  
     
      
    22 TD complained of three injuries: the scratches on her back, marks to her neck and a split lip. Any one or more of those injuries, if accepted by the jury, was sufficient to establish actual bodily harm. There was a body of evidence additional to that of TD, that she had scratches on her back. There was evidence from both TD and her mother that she had marks on her neck. There was TD’s evidence of the split lip. The trial judge referred to each of the injuries in her summing up. In circumstances where the injuries were clearly specified in the evidence and in the summing up, it cannot be said that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable for failing to specify a particular injury. The Crown relied on each injury, but only needed to establish one injury.  
     
      
    23 I would reject this submission. 
     
      
    24 Alternatively, the appellant submitted that, accepting TD’s evidence that the appellant was responsible for the scratches on her back, there were a number of possible inferences as to when that injury was inflicted. The appellant concedes that it was possible that the injury was inflicted whilst he was attempting sexual intercourse with TD. On that basis, the elements of the offence under s 61K(a) would be made out. The appellant submitted, however, that this was not the only available inference that could be drawn from the evidence and it was possible that the injury was inflicted after the appellant had given up on his intention to have sexual intercourse with TD. It was submitted that another possibility was that the appellant injured her in retaliation after she scratched him on the arm. In either of these two circumstances, the offence would not have been proved. The appellant pointed out that he bore no onus to establish either possibility, or point to evidence that established any such alternative hypothesis and that it was sufficient if the alternative was open on the evidence: Barca v R [1975] HCA 42; (1975) 133 CLR 82.  
     
      
    25 In Barca at 104, Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “When the case against an accused person rests substantially upon circumstantial evidence the jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are ‘such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused’:  
        Peacock v The King  
        (1911) 13 CLR 619 at 634. To enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused it is necessary not only that his guilt should be a rational inference but that it should be ‘the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw’;  
        Plomp v The Queen  
        (1963) 110 CLR 234 at 252; see also  
        Thomas v The Queen  
        (1960) 102 CLR 584 at 605-606. However, ‘an inference to be reasonable must rest upon something more than mere conjecture.  
        The bare possibility of innocence should not prevent a jury from finding the prisoner guilty, if the inference of guilt is the only inference open to reasonable men upon a consideration of all the facts in evidence. 
        ’ (Peacock v The King (1911) 13 CLR 619, at 661). These principles are well settled in Australia.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    26 Rather, as their Honours Mason CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ observed in Knight v R [1992] HCA 56; (1992) 175 CLR 495, at 503: 
     
      
       
        
        “… if a reasonable jury ought to have found that an inference or hypothesis consistent with innocence  
        was open on the evidence 
        , then it ought to have given the appellant the benefit of the doubt necessarily created by that circumstance.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    27 The reference in the above passage to Plomp is a reference to the judgment of Menzies J in that case.  In the same case, Dixon CJ, at 243, after referring to the rule that a jury “cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on circumstantial evidence unless no other explanation than guilt is reasonably compatible with the circumstances”, commented that “much difficulty is found in stating the rule”. His Honour then restated what he had said in Martin v Osborne [1936] HCA 23; (1936) 55 CLR 367 at 375, namely :  
     
      
       
        
        “If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person the  
        evidentiary circumstances 
         must bear no other reasonable explanation. This means that, according to the common course of human affairs, the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    28 I have already set out the evidence upon which the Crown relied. If that evidence was accepted by the jury, the injury or injuries to TD could only have occurred whilst the appellant was attempting to have intercourse with her. As the Crown submitted, on TD’s evidence, the only occasion when the appellant had any physical contact with her was whilst he was attempting to have sexual intercourse, when he said he was going to “fuck [her] right or wrong” and there was then a struggle between them. It was after the appellant gave up on his attempt to have sexual intercourse that TD noticed that she had scratches on her back, and also that she had injuries to her neck and lip. There was no evidence of touching at any other time. There was, therefore, no occasion when the injuries would have been sustained other than in the attempt to have intercourse.  
     
      
    29 Further, even on the appellant’s case (leaving aside the appellant’s assertion that the injuries may have occurred as a result of TD slipping on the steps of the caravan, which was not relied upon by the appellant on this submission), there was no occasion of touching other than whilst the appellant was attempting sexual intercourse with TD. Accordingly, there is no basis to support the appellant’s submission that it was possible for injury to have been inflicted after he gave up on the attempt to have intercourse, or that he injured TD in retaliation for scratching him on the arm.  
     
      
    30 The appellant further submitted that even if it is accepted that the injury was inflicted by him at a time at which he attempted to have intercourse with TD, there was no evidence that he inflicted the injury “maliciously”. It was submitted that although the appellant may have acted “maliciously” in his attempt to have sexual intercourse with TD against her will, such malice was not sufficient to prove malicious infliction of actual bodily harm: see Kippist v Parnell (1988) 36 A Crim R 18. In Kippist, Roden J referred to his decision in Storey v R (1985) 19 A Crim R 275 in which his Honour had also relied upon a passage of C S Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, 19th ed (1966) Cambridge University Press, at 211. In my opinion, this submission is merely a variation of the submission raised under ground 2 of the appeal, which I deal with below.  
     
      
    31 Having regard to the conclusion I have reached in respect of ground 2, ground 1 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: error in trial judge’s directions to the jury in respect of count 4 regarding the requirement that actual bodily harm be inflicted maliciously 
       
      
    32 “Maliciously” was defined in s 5 of the Crimes Act (in the form it was in at the date of the offence) to mean:  
     
      
       
        
        “Every act done of malice, whether against an individual or any corporate body or number of individuals, or done without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering, or with intent to injure some person or persons, or corporate body, in property or otherwise, and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly or wantonly, shall be taken to have been done maliciously, within the meaning of this Act, and of every indictment and charge where malice is by law an ingredient in the crime.” 
        
       
      
    33 The appellant referred the Court to the following directions to the jury in respect of count 4: 
     
      
       
        
        “Turning then to count 4, which charges that the accused maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on [TD] with intent to have sexual intercourse. I will turn to the first element, maliciously. The Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt one of the forms of malice, because maliciously is defined to have four definitions and the Crown must prove one of those. The first definition of maliciously, means with malice. The second is, with the intention to physically injure some person without lawful cause or excuse. The third meaning of maliciously, is without malice, but with indifference to human suffering and without lawful cause or excuse. And the fourth meaning maliciously can have, is recklessly or wantonly, which means the accused realised that some physical harm may possibly be inflicted by his acts, but went ahead and acted. It must be proved, if the Crown is to prove recklessly and if you were to find that the accused acted recklessly, it must be proved that the accused applied his mind to the consequences of his act, though it does not have to be proved that the accused had in mind the precise type of injury which occurred. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Now, as I said, the Crown relies on the words spoken by the accused, according to [TD], ‘I’m going to fuck you right or wrong,’ as indicating the intent to have sexual intercourse, and it asks you to draw the inference that, in the course of the accused trying to remove [TD’s] clothes and have sex with her, which she said happened, which she resisted, that the accused maliciously inflicted those injuries, either deliberately or recklessly, or without malice but with indifference to human suffering. You have to find one of those types of malice proved.” (Summing up, 7, 22-23) 
        
       
      
    34 The appellant makes two complaints about this direction.  
     
      
    35 First, he submitted that the jury was not directed that the malice inherent in the appellant’s attempt to have sexual intercourse with the complainant, whether or not she consented, was not malice for the purposes of the element of the offence of malicious infliction of actual bodily harm.  
     
      
    36 Secondly, he submitted that the jury was not directed that in order to prove the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm, it was necessary to prove that the appellant either intended to inflict some injury, or that he was reckless as to the causing of some injury, proof of which required that the appellant foresaw at least the possibility that he would occasion some injury.  
     
      
    37 The appellant was represented by counsel at trial and did not seek a redirection. Accordingly, the leave of the Court is required before this ground of appeal may be raised: r 4, Criminal Appeal Rules. There is affidavit evidence from counsel who appeared at trial, which was not the subject of cross-examination, that he did not apply for any redirection, in relation to either: the meaning of “maliciously”, or to the requirement that the jury be satisfied the appellant acted maliciously with respect to the infliction of actual bodily harm, rather than that he was acting maliciously in a more general sense. Counsel stated that his failure to ask for a redirection was not for any tactical reason. He said that he has now read the written submissions filed on behalf of the appellant for the purposes of the appeal and he believes his failure to ask for a redirection was an oversight.  
     
      
    38 Leave will not be granted under r 4 unless the error is such that the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 would otherwise not have been applied: R v Stokes and Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25. That determination is best made after a consideration of the bases upon which the appellant alleges error.  
     
      
       
      Failure to direct that malice for the purposes of having sexual intercourse was not malice for the purposes of establishing the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm 
       
      
    39 The directions that the appellant says are relevant to this ground are set out in the second passage in [33] above. The Crown submits that these passages do not fully represent the trial judge’s summing up as to the meaning of “malicious infliction of bodily harm”. The Crown referred the Court’s attention to the paragraph that immediately preceded the second of the paragraphs relied upon by the appellant, which it submits, is relevant to the central complaint made by the appellant, namely, that the direction did not adequately address the fact that there was a requirement for malice beyond the malice inherent in the offence. The additional direction was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, the Crown is required to prove not just that [TD] had actual bodily harm, and it is a matter for you to decide if you accept [TD’s] evidence about those injuries and whether you find they satisfy the legal definition of actual bodily harm, but the Crown also has to prove that the [appellant] maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on [TD] with intent to have sexual intercourse with her.” (Summing up, 22) 
        
       
      
    40 The Crown submits that it is apparent from this passage that the trial judge referred to the requirement that the actual bodily harm had to be maliciously inflicted and with the intention to have sexual intercourse, and that this correctly stated the requirement that as an element of the offence under s 61K(a), there was a requirement for malice, beyond the malice inherent in the offence.  
     
      
    41 I agree with this submission, which is clearly made out when the relevant direction to the jury is read in its entirety. The full direction was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now, the Crown is required to prove not just that [TD] had actual bodily harm, and it is a matter for you to decide if you accept [TD’s] evidence about those injuries and whether you find they satisfy the legal definition of actual bodily harm, but the Crown also has to prove that the [appellant] maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm on [TD] with intent to have sexual intercourse with her. 
         
         
        Now, as I said, the Crown relies on the words spoken by the [appellant], according to [TD], ‘I’m going to fuck you right or wrong,’ as indicating the intent to have sexual intercourse, and it asks you to draw the inference that, in the course of the [appellant] trying to remove [TD’s] clothes  
        and 
         have sex with her, which she said happened, which she resisted, that the [appellant] maliciously inflicted those injuries, either deliberately or recklessly, or without malice but with indifference to human suffering. You have to find one of those types of malice proved.” (Summing up, 22-23) (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    42 In the first passage, her Honour stated the requirement that the Crown had to establish not only actual bodily harm, but the malicious infliction of actual bodily harm with a particular intent, namely, to have sexual intercourse. In the next paragraph, her Honour explained that the Crown relied upon the evidence that the appellant had said to TD that he was “going to fuck [her] …” as indicating the intent to have sexual intercourse. Her Honour continued, by the use of the conjunction “and” that in the course of trying to remove TD’s clothes, and in her resistance to that, the appellant maliciously inflicted injury.  
     
      
    43 The Crown also drew attention to her Honour’s earlier directions as to the elements of the offence: (summing up, 7-8). Her Honour first gave the jury a direction as to the meaning of “maliciously”. (This is the direction set out in the first paragraph at [33] above). She then explained the meaning of “inflict” and “actual bodily harm”. Her Honour then dealt with the element of “with intent to have sexual intercourse with another person”. She reminded the jury that she had already defined “sexual intercourse” for them and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown must prove that the [appellant] did the act of maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm on [TD]  
        and at the same 
          
        time 
         had the  
        intent to have sexual intercourse 
         with [TD].” (Summing up, 8) 
        
       
      
    44 Her Honour explained that a person’s intentions could be inferred from acts or words and pointed out that the Crown was relying on the words “I’m going to fuck you right or wrong”. Her Honour reiterated this portion of the summing up later in the passages to which I have also referred. 
     
      
    45 The jury were thus directed that there were two distinct elements of the offence and were also directed as to the evidence that the Crown relied upon to establish each element. It was also made clear in the direction that the Crown relied upon different aspects of the evidence in support of the two elements.  
     
      
    46 In my opinion, the appellant has not established error as alleged under this heading. 
     
      
       
      Failure to direct the jury that to prove malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm, it was necessary to prove intent or recklessness  
       
      
    47 The definition of “maliciously” has been set out above. It contains four separate notions, namely, that an act was done (i) of malice; (ii) without malice but with indifference to human life or suffering; (iii) with intent to injure and without lawful cause or excuse; or (iv) recklessly or wantonly.  
     
      
    48 The appellant made a hybrid complaint in respect of the manner in which the trial judge left the meaning of “maliciously” to the jury. First, he submitted that her Honour failed to give the jury any direction or assistance as to the meaning of ‘malice’, but had merely read to the jury the statutory definition. He said that this itself was an error. He also submitted that one of the problems that arose from her Honour having done so, was that the jury was thus left to determine for itself the meaning of “every act done of malice”, being the first of the definitions of “maliciously”. Next, he submitted that her Honour left it to the jury to find malice in the third sense, that is, the intentional infliction of injury in circumstances where there was no evidence that the appellant intended or foresaw the possibility of injury. It was submitted, in effect by way of summary, that the direction given in this case was unsatisfactory, as became apparent when the directions in other cases were examined.  
     
      
    49 There has been judicial comment as to the unsatisfactory drafting of the definition of “maliciously” in s 5: see R v Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467 per Hunt J (as his Honour then was) at 472. The problem arises because of the multiple meanings contained in the definition, which do not necessarily sit comfortably together. This has lead to judicial statements that a jury should only be directed in respect of that part, or parts, of the definition that apply to the facts of the case. Thus in Coleman Hunt J stated, at 472, that if one of the elements of the definition was not relevant to the matter before the Court, it was not necessary for the jury to be directed in relation to that matter.  
     
      
    50 In the earlier case of R v Safwan (1986) 8 NSWLR 97, Street CJ, at 101, rejected an argument on behalf of the accused that it would be preferable for a jury to have been given no direction as to the element “maliciously” in the charge of malicious wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 33 [of the  
        Crimes 
          
        Act 
        ] specifically includes ‘maliciously’ as an ingredient and it seems to me that this imports the necessity of at least some formal reference to it in the summing-up. It may be that in many cases the directions already given on intent will inevitably cover the same matters that must be established in order to prove the element of ‘maliciously’. In such cases there is no reason why the trial judge should not simply say just exactly that and leave the matter without further examination. I hesitate, however, to go to the length of assenting to the proposition that this specific reference in the section to ‘maliciously’ can be properly disregarded in its entirety in the terms of the summing-up.  
         
         
        Alternatively, if the trial judge thinks it appropriate, reference could be made in the summing-up to the statutory definition. In so doing it will be necessary to exercise caution to ensure that only so much of the definition is quoted or paraphrased to the jury as will avoid introducing any uncertainty into the separate element of intent. 
         If, for example, the quotation by [the trial judge] in this case had been edited by excluding the words ‘or done without malice but with indifference to human life’ and the words ‘or done recklessly or wantonly’ then there could be no reason whatever for suggesting that the jury may have been confused. The quotation would then have read ‘every act done of malice; that is, with evil intent, or with intent to injure some person or persons, and in such case without lawful cause or excuse, shall be taken to have been done maliciously within the meaning of the Act’.”  
        
       
       
      Lee J, with whom McInerney J agreed on this point, preferred to leave open the question whether a direction as to the meaning of “ 
      maliciously 
      ” was needed in every case. 
       
      
    51 The extent of the direction that should be given where “maliciously” is an ingredient of the offence was raised again in Pengilley v R [2006] NSWCCA 163. The appellant in that case had been convicted of malicious wounding by smashing a beer glass into the victim’s face. McColl JA (Adams and Latham JJ agreeing) stated at [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Crimes of malice require either intention or recklessness, each of which calls for a foresight of the consequences, in addition to the mental element required for basic intent:  
        R v Grant 
         [2002] NSWCCA 243; (2002) 55 NSWLR 80 at [60] per Wood CJ at CL, Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing.” 
        
       
      
    52 In Pengilley, the appellant’s case was that he had put out his arm “reflexively, not being aware or conscious of the glass, or taking it into account or having any intent with it” (at [21]). That argument was advanced in respect of the defence of self defence. However, it was recognised that the same argument raised the issue as to whether the appellant had “the intent, let alone foresight of the consequences, essential to a finding he had acted recklessly” (at [39]).  
     
      
    53 McColl JA stated that, having regard to the issues in the case, it was essential for the trial judge to explain what was needed to establish that the appellant had acted recklessly. On the facts of that case, her Honour considered that the Crown “had to prove [the appellant] acted as he did, realising the possibility that some injury might result from his action” (at [40]). Her Honour continued at [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was not sufficient for the trial judge to read the s 5 definition of ‘maliciously’ to the jury, nor to give the jury a copy of the definition. In  
        R v Safwan, 
         (1986) 8 NSWLR 97 Street CJ (with whom Lee and McInerney JJ agreed, subject to a qualification not presently relevant) said, in substance, (at 102) that, in some circumstances, quoting a section of a statute may mislead a jury. More recently in 
         R v Micalizzi 
         [2004] NSWCCA 406 at [36] Simpson J (with whom Hulme and Howie JJ relevantly agreed) expressed the opinion that ‘it is not good practice to read legislation to a jury’ and that ‘were it necessary to refer to a legal principle derived from a statute, it is the effect of the provision, so far as it is relevant to the issues before the jury, and not its precise terms, that should be conveyed’.” 
        
       
      
    54 Returning to the present appeal, the Crown submitted that there is no error in the complete statutory definition of the word “maliciously” being stated to the jury and referred the Court to R v Smith (1982) 1 NSWLR 1, where Street CJ, Reynolds JA and Maxwell J agreeing, stated at 4:  
     
      
       
        
        “… a judge cannot be said to have erred by following faithfully the words of the section which created the offence and by construing those words for the jury's assistance with specific reference to the all-embracing statutory definition.” 
        
       
      
    55 The Crown contends that her Honour’s direction was no more or less than a restatement, correct in its terms, of the statutory definition and therefore was not erroneous. The Crown acknowledged that where the case against the appellant was that the injuries were inflicted recklessly, it was unnecessary for the jury to be informed of each of the four components of the definition of “maliciously”. The Crown contends, however, that it is apparent that when the totality of the directions are considered, the focus was upon the question as to whether the injury or injuries had been inflicted deliberately or recklessly, as was submitted was the most likely scenario, or without malice but with indifference to human suffering. It was submitted, therefore, that the jury would not have been misled.  
     
      
    56 The appellant submitted that Smith must now be considered ‘old law’ and that the correct principle to apply was that stated in Coleman, Stokes and Difford, Safwan and Pengilley. This effect of this submission is that it is an error for a trial judge to direct a jury in terms of the definition and that a jury may only be directed in respect of that part of the definition applicable to the facts. I do not agree that the law can be stated as starkly as that: rather, as McColl JA stated in Pengilley “it was not sufficient for the trial judge to read the s 5 definition to the jury” (emphasis added). In this case, the trial judge did not only or merely read the definition of “maliciously” to the jury. She explained the meaning of “recklessly” and gave directions as to the elements of the offence that had to be established for the appellant to be found guilty. The appellant submitted, however, that an examination of the caselaw reveals that such directions as were given were inadequate. In particular, the appellant submitted that when regard was had to the direction that Hunt J formulated in Stokes and Difford, the direction in this case was inadequate.  
     
      
    57 In Stokes and Difford, Stokes had been found guilty of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent. Difford had been found guilty of the lesser charge of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm (without the specific intent). The charge against Difford was accessorial to the charge against Stokes. Both appealed against their convictions. One of the questions that arose on the appeal was as to the meaning of “maliciously” for the purposes of each offence.  
     
      
    58 Hunt J, at 40, identified those parts of the definition of “maliciously” that were relevant to the offences charged, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        ""… [e]very act ... done without malice but ... with intent to injure some person ... , and in any such case without lawful cause or excuse, or done recklessly ..."" 
        
       
      
    59 His Honour stated that, in respect of both offences, the word “maliciously” had no stronger meaning “than an intention to cause some physical injury” (emphasis added). His Honour then referred to CS Kenny, Outlines of Criminal Law, where the author stated at p 211: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The principle is that in any statutory definition of a crime ‘malice’ must be taken not in the old vague sense of wickedness in general, but as requiring either (1) an actual intention to do the particular  
        kind 
         of harm that in fact was done, or (2) recklessness as to whether such harm should occur or not (that is, the accused has foreseen that the particular kind of harm might be done, and yet has gone on to take the risk of it).""  
        
       
       
      This statement was also approved in, inter alia,  
      Coleman. 
       
      
    60 Hunt J then, at 41, stated precisely what the Crown had to establish in respect of Difford’s state of mind as an accessory:  
     
      
       
        
        “(1) that Difford knew (or was aware):  
         
         
        (a) of the intention of Stokes to hit [the victim], and  
         
         
        (b) that Stokes:  
         
         
          
           
            
            (i) intended thereby to inflict some physical injury upon [the victim],  
            or 
              
            
           
          
         
         
          
           
            
            (ii) realised the possibility that some such injury might result but he nevertheless intended to go ahead and hit [the victim];  
            and 
              
            
           
          
         
         
        (2) that, with that knowledge, Difford intentionally assisted or encouraged Stokes to commit the crime of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon [the victim].”  
        
       
       
      Paragraph (b) restates what Hunt J had earlier said as to the meaning of “ 
      maliciously 
      ”. 
       
      
    61 Stokes and Difford is consistent with a long line of authority in this Court as to the meaning of “maliciously”: see Coleman; R v Stones (1956) 56 SR (NSW) 25 at 34; Storey; and Kippist. In Stones, the Court (Street CJ, Roper CJ in Eq and Herron J) said, at 34, in relation to “maliciously”: 
     
      
       
        
        “The important thing is not the desire of consequence, i.e. motive or intent, but merely foresight of consequence which is the common factor to intention and recklessness. Every crime involving mens rea requires one or other factor, so that if it does not positively require intention, it requires either intention or recklessness; and particularly is this so in crimes involving malice.” 
        
       
      
    62 This statement was approved in R v Grant [2002] NSWCCA 243; (2002) 55 NSWLR 80 where Wood CJ at CL (Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreeing) stated at [60]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As was made clear in  
        R v Stones 
         (1956) 56 SR (NSW) 25 and  
        R v Cunningham 
         (1957) 2 QB 396, and, as s 5 of the  
        Crimes  
        Act also makes clear, crimes of malice require either intention or recklessness, each of which calls for a foresight of the consequences, in addition to the mental element required for basic intent.” 
        
       
       
      ( 
      Grant 
       was applied by McColl JA in  
      Pengilley 
      : see [51] above). 
       
      
    63 The appellant submitted that when that approach was applied to the facts of this case, the jury would need to be directed that the appellant either intended to cause some form of injury to the complainant or was at least reckless in the sense that he foresaw the possibility of some injury and went ahead anyway. It was submitted that the trial judge’s directions were not sufficient to direct the jury on these matters. 
     
      
    64 As I have already indicated, the Crown acknowledged that it was unnecessary of her Honour to give the appellant the full definition of “maliciously”, but submitted that her directions were sufficient to focus the jury’s attention upon the necessary parts of the definition that were relevant, having regard to the Crown case that the injuries were inflicted at some stage during the attempt to have sexual intercourse, and that they must have been inflicted recklessly. TD’s evidence was specific to the extent that she said that the marks on her back were caused by being scratched by the appellant. She was also specific in her denial of falling down the stairs of the caravan. However, other than being able to identify the scratches as having occurred at that time, TD was not able to give any evidence as to how or precisely when the injuries were inflicted.  
     
      
    65 On the appeal, the Crown conceded that this evidence was insufficient to establish that the infliction of the injuries was intentional and that the case was one of recklessness, although that does not seem to be the position taken at trial. As I understand the way that the trial proceeded, the Crown case was not confined to recklessness. Nonetheless, it was submitted that the trial judge appreciated the need to stress to the jury the necessity to find malice and that malice had to be found in accordance with the definition. In summing up to the jury, her Honour correctly directed them as to recklessness (which I set out again for convenience) when she stated:  
     
      
       
        
        “And the fourth meaning that maliciously can have, is recklessly or wantonly, which means the [appellant] realised that some physical harm may possibly be inflicted by his acts, but went ahead and acted. It must be proved, if the Crown is to prove recklessly and if you were to find that the [appellant] acted recklessly, it must be proved that the [appellant] applied his mind to the consequences of his act, though it does not have to be proved that the [appellant] had in mind the precise type of injury which occurred.” (Summing up, 7) 
        
       
       
      Her Honour also correctly put the second and third meanings of “ 
      maliciously 
      ” to the jury, which in varying degrees of relevance, were open on the way the case was conducted, not only by the Crown but also by the defence.  
       
      
    66 Whilst it would have been preferable for her Honour not to have stated the full definition to the jury, I do not consider that the trial miscarried as a result. To the extent that the jury should have been directed as to the meaning of recklessness, her Honour gave an appropriate direction. To the extent that the facts of the case called for a direction as to the need to find malice, the trial judge directed the jury’s attention of the need to make that finding. Her Honour also directed the jury that the necessary finding had to be based on the second, third or fourth alternative meaning of “maliciously” as defined. Clearly the facts called for a reference to the fourth meaning, recklessness. The facts could also have fallen into the second meaning, indifference to human suffering. As I have said, the Crown now concedes that the evidence did not support a case of intention to injure. The question which arises is therefore, whether a reference to that meaning in the directions given would have misled the jury.  
     
      
    67 The appellant submitted that the observations of Priestley JA in Storey assisted in understanding why the direction was likely to have misled the jury. In that case, the accused lit two fires in the Goulburn Training Centre and was charged with the offence of “maliciously set fire to a building”. One fire was lit in the library, where books and papers had been stacked some seven to eight feet high and which were set alight. Another fire was lit in the activities room. The only evidence as to how that fire started was that some papers, perhaps in a box, had been set alight.  
     
      
    68 The trial judge gave a single direction covering both fires. This direction was challenged on appeal, on the basis that the trial judge failed to adequately differentiate between the two fires, both in respect of the acts of the appellant and the intention with which the fires were lit. Priestley JA considered that the trial judge should have differentiated between the two charges, as it was open to the jury to find that in respect of the fire in the activities room there was no intention to set fire to the building, but only to the contents of the room. Roden J was of the same opinion. 
     
      
    69 There is nothing, in my opinion, in the judgment of Priestley JA which assists in this case. In Storey there were two separate acts, either of which, if accepted, could have been sufficient to establish the offence. However, as Priestley JA explained, the intention in respect of each could have been different. A single direction covering both fires was therefore inadequate. If the jury did not accept that the accused had lit the fire in the library with the relevant intent to set fire to the building, they then had to consider whether the accused had lit the fire in the activities room with intent to set fire to the building. As that was not the only possible intent in respect of that fire (there could have been an intent to damage the room only) the jury should have been so directed.  
     
      
    70 This case is different. There is only one act that is subject of the charge. I do not consider that the jury would have been confused or misled by the reference to intention. It is probable that the jury would have quickly discarded the notion that the injuries were inflicted intentionally. The jury then had available to it appropriate directions as to recklessness or could also have found that the injuries had been inflicted without intent but with indifference. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that there is no appealable error in her Honour’s direction. But in any event, for the same reasons, no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred: Criminal Appeal Act s 6. I would not, therefore, grant leave for this ground of appeal to be raised.  
     
      
       
      Appeal against sentence 
       
      
    71 The appellant raised two grounds of appeal on this application. The first ground was that the trial judge erred in sentencing the appellant on count 2 by taking into account TD’s lack of consent as being relevant to sentencing, in circumstances that by doing so, that factor would have rendered the appellant liable for a more serious offence contrary to the principles in R v De Simoni [1981] HCA 31; (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
     
      
    72 The error, according to the appellant, occurred in her Honour’s Remarks on Sentence at 2. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the day that [TD] went there both [JG] and [the appellant] were present. [TD] drank alcohol during the day. [KS] … gave evidence that [TD] was very, very intoxicated. When everyone but [TD] and [the appellant] were out of the flat, [the appellant] had sexual intercourse with [TD] in the bedroom in the flat which was identified as his, against her will. 
         
         
        A submission was made by Mr Hancock, [the appellant’s] counsel, that I ought not take into account in considering the factual circumstances and the objective seriousness of this offence because consent is not an element of this offence. But I think that the factual circumstances of the offence, particularly given the range of offences which can be covered by this offence can be taken into account. For example this offence could cover a situation where two teenagers close in age had consensual sexual intercourse. And I think that that situation is to be distinguished from the situation here which was that [TD] was fourteen years old, [the appellant] was, at that stage, twenty-nine years old, she was affected by alcohol and she was not a willing participant in the act which occurred.”  
        
       
      
    73 The appellant contends that by taking TD’s lack of consent into account, the Court was in effect sentencing him for an offence against s 61J, namely, aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, which carried with it a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    74 In De Simoni, Gibbs J stated at 389: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the general principle that the sentence imposed on an offender should take account of all the circumstances of the offence is subject to a more fundamental and important principle, that no one should be punished for an offence of which he has not been convicted. Section 582 reflects this principle. The combined effect of the two principles, so far as it is relevant for present purposes, is that a judge, in imposing sentence, is entitled to consider all the conduct of the accused, including that which would aggravate the offence, but cannot take into account circumstances of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for a more serious offence.” 
        
       
      
    75 In R v Fajka [2004] NSWCCA 166, Howie J (Hulme and Simpson JJ agreeing), at [24], expressed considerable doubt as to whether a sentencing judge was entitled to take into account an allegation of a serious criminal offence that the Crown had not charged and which was denied by the offender, when sentencing the offender for an offence of a completely different nature to that alleged. The offence in that case was the offence of affray contrary to s 93C of the Crimes Act, which carried a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment. The affray had occurred at a tavern and there was an allegation that the accused’s brother had obtained the security surveillance tape of the melee. The sentencing judge referred to this in the course of his Remarks on Sentence, expressing a conclusion that the offender had acted jointly with his brother in removing the surveillance tape in an attempt to destroy evidence useful to the prosecution. Such conduct constituted an offence which carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. Howie J concluded, at [24], that if his Honour was using that as an aggravating feature of the offence, then he considered that the principle in De Simoni, or indeed, principles of common fairness, would be offended. 
     
      
    76 The Crown submits that her Honour did not breach the principles in De Simoni. It points out that the offence of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent contains four elements: sexual intercourse; without the consent of the complainant; the applicant knowing there was no consent; and in circumstances of aggravation. The Crown drew attention to the fact that her Honour did not make any finding that the appellant was aware of the absence of consent and, that absent such a finding, the appellant could not be exposed to this offence. It was submitted that this case was unlike R v Bakewell (Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, McInerney and Studdert JJ, 27 June 1996, unreported), where all the elements of the more serious offence had been raised.  
     
      
    77 In my opinion, her Honour has not offended the principle stated in De Simoni. In the first place, she was conscious that consent was not an element of the offence. Indeed, that had been a matter of submission to her Honour. Rather, it is apparent that her Honour considered the question of whether or not TD was a willing participant was relevant, having regard to the wide range of offences that may be covered by the section. It is also apparent that her Honour’s reference to TD not being a “willing participant” was made so as to gauge the relative seriousness of the offence in this case, as against other offences which might be charged under the section.  
     
      
    78 The second ground related to the manner in which her Honour dealt with accumulation. Her Honour imposed, in respect of the s 66C offence, a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 23 August 2006 and to expire on 22 August 2009, with a balance of term of 1 year to expire on 22 August 2010. Her Honour imposed in respect of the s 61K(a) offence a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 23 August 2007, expiring on 22 February 2012, with a balance of term of 1 year 6 months to expire on 22 August 2013.  
     
      
    79 Her Honour declined to find special circumstances for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Her Honour’s reasons for finding that there were no special circumstances was that the appellant had not taken responsibility for his offences, so that it was difficult to see how his offending conduct could be addressed by rehabilitation, when he did not have any insight into the issues.  
     
      
    80 The effect of her Honour’s sentencing was that each individual sentence reflected the statutory ratio, but that the effect of accumulation was to impose an overall non-parole period of 78.5 per cent, thus exceeding the normal statutory proportion of 75 per cent.  
     
      
    81 This Court has consistently held that the accumulation of sentences may result in a finding of special circumstances. It is sufficient to refer to Dunn v R [2007] NSWCCA 312, where Hoeben J (Handley AJA and Smart AJ agreeing) observed, at [40], that a finding of special circumstances was only required where the proportion of the non-parole period as against the total term of the sentence was to be less than 3/4. His Honour added: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nevertheless general sentencing principles suggest that where there is a departure from the statutory ratio there should be some reason provided.” 
        
       
      
    82 His Honour then observed, at [41], that it has been held that where sentences are cumulative, so as to produce a non-parole period which is in excess of the statutory ratio, that of itself may amount to special circumstances. 
     
      
    83 In that case, the effect of accumulation was to produce a non-parole period in excess of 80 per cent of the head sentence. In circumstances where the trial judge made no reference to this in his Remarks on Sentence, the Court was of the opinion that it was not clear that his Honour appreciated that this was the effect of the sentences he proposed to impose. In the circumstances, having regard to the facts of that case and in the absence of an explanation as to why the non-parole period had been increased beyond the statutory ratio, the Court considered it an appropriate case in which to intervene. 
     
      
    84 Almost identical remarks can be made in this case. Her Honour maintained the statutory proportion as between non-parole period and the total term of the sentence in respect of each offence and appears to have overlooked the effect of the accumulation that she determined was appropriate. If the statutory proportion was maintained in respect of the total effective sentence, then the non-parole period would be 5 years 3 months. In my opinion, the appellant should have the benefit of that reduction. Accordingly, the orders which I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction in respect of count 4 dismissed; 
       
       
      2. Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted; 
       
       
      3. Appeal against sentence in respect of count 4 allowed; 
       
       
      4. Set aside the trial judge’s sentence in respect of count 4 and in lieu therefore, impose a non-parole period of 4 years 3 months, commencing on 23 August 2007 and expiring on 22 November 2011 and a balance of term of 1 year 9 months expiring on 22 August 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Ipp JA. 
     
      
    2 IPP JA: The claimant seeks orders in the nature of prerogative relief with respect to a decision of Knox DCJ dismissing his application for a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (“the Act”).  
     
      
    3 The orders dismissing the claimant’s application for a certificate were made after a jury, by direction, had brought in a verdict of not guilty in respect of a charge against the claimant under s 25(1) of the Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. 
     
      
    4 The criminal proceedings against the claimant had had a long procedural history, including a committal hearing over a period of days culminating on 31 July 2006, two no-bill applications, the filing of at least four indictments containing various counts and various alternative counts, and at least one unsuccessful application by the claimant for a permanent stay. Eventually, on 23 July 2007, the matter came before Knox DCJ and a jury, and it was then that his Honour directed the jury to bring in a verdict of not guilty.  
     
      
    5 The claimant’s application for orders in the nature of prerogative relief is based on “error on the face of the record”. It is common ground that the “record” before this Court comprises the orders made by Knox DCJ in relation to the claimant’s application for a certificate and his Honour’s reasons for dismissing that application (as to the latter see s 69(4) of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW)). The claimant filed an affidavit containing other material as well, but read only the orders and reasons. 
     
      
    6 The sequence of events on 23 July 2007 when the claimant was acquitted is not entirely clear from Knox DCJ’s reasons. From those reasons it is apparent that at some stage a voir dire was held at which evidence was adduced. His Honour noted (at [27]) that “[p]arts of the Crown brief” were provided to him “at the outset of the voir dire” and he referred (at [19]) to “complaints made during the voir dire about the hearsay nature of some aspects of the Crown evidence”. The reasons record (at [28]) that before any evidence was led before the jury, the judge required defence counsel to specify his objections to the evidence “so that the matter could proceed when the jury were empanelled without delays”. His Honour observed (at [30]) that this process “led to the alteration and substitution during the voir dire of a number of the Crown police statements”. 
     
      
    7 Knox DCJ pointed out (at [32]) that, after the voir dire was concluded, there still remained in issue certain translation evidence concerning transcripts of certain telephone “intercepts”.  
     
      
    8 The Crown brief contained evidence of intercepts of some 5,000 telephone conversations. These transcripts were in a mixture of English and Arabic and had been translated. The translations, however, had been wrongly certified.  
     
      
    9 Of the thousands of conversations, the Crown proposed, at the trial, to rely only on seven. The translator’s certificate, forming part of the Crown brief, referred however to the wrong conversations. Knox DCJ described (at [9]) the situation as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The translator’s certificate in fact related to telephone intercepts of conversations which were said to have occurred in December, 2004. The conversations on which the Crown case was based were six conversations in August, 2004 and an extract of a further conversation in February, 2005.” 
        
       
      
    10 For reasons not presently relevant, Knox DCJ refused (see at [13]) to allow the Crown to lead oral evidence from the translator that he had translated the seven conversations on which the Crown proposed to rely (that is, which accidentally had been omitted from the certificate). This meant that the Crown was precluded from relying on the translations of the critical intercept conversations. The Crown conceded (see at [14]) that without that evidence its case could not succeed. It followed that, as his Honour stated (at [32]), “the jury were called back in and directed to enter a verdict of not guilty”. 
     
      
    11 On 24 July 2007 the claimant applied for a certificate under the Act. His Honour (at [41]) found: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not consider it has been established that it was not reasonable for the prosecution to have commenced the proceedings on the basis of the evidence that was in the possession of the Crown. There was material available which if properly presented, may have been sufficient to sustain the charge.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour later repeated (at [45]): 
       
       
        
        “On one view, had the defects in the Crown case been rectified, the accused may have had a case to answer in terms of explaining the words and phrases used on what were serious charges.” 
        
       
      
    12 I shall not set out the claimant’s grounds of appeal as, during the course of argument, they were, in effect, reformulated by Mr Sweet, counsel for the claimant. Mr Sweet articulated orally two errors that he submitted the primary judge had made, and relied only on those two asserted errors as grounds for the relief claimed. 
     
      
    13 The two errors contended for by Mr Sweet were: 
     
      
       
      (a) His Honour failed to consider the state of the evidence at the time the hearing was concluded and directed his attention only to the evidence at the time at which the Crown case commenced (Mr Sweet submitted that His Honour did not apply the test referred to by Hidden J in  
      R v Cardona  
      [2002] NSWSC 823 at [3]). 
       
       
      (b) His Honour failed, as required by the Act, to find the “relevant facts” under s 3 of the Act; in particular, he failed to determine whether there were any “further relevant facts” within the meaning of s 3A(1) of the Act. 
       
      
    14 I turn firstly to the first asserted error. 
     
      
    15 In R v Cardona Hidden J repeated the dictum of Hunt J in R v Dunne (Supreme Court, 17 May 1990, unreported): 
     
      
       
        
        “I must ‘put myself in the hypothetical place of the prosecution possessed of knowledge of all of the facts which have now become apparent’ examining the matter ‘with the knowledge gained from such omniscient crystal ball’.” 
        
       
      
    16 The reference to “omniscience” in the context of an order for the costs of criminal proceedings seems first to have been made by Sugerman P (with whom O’Brien J agreed) (Manning JA dissenting) in R v Williams (1970) 91 WN (NSW) 145. The President (at 146) discussed the meaning of the phrase “all the relevant facts” in s 3 of the Act (that is, before s 3A was first introduced into the Act by the Costs in Criminal Cases (Amendment) Act 1971). His Honour (at 146) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What relevant facts? Not ‘all’ the relevant facts in any literal or absolute sense; omniscience is not to be attributed to the prosecution in the hypothetical enquiry.” 
        
       
      
    17 In Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 (which was decided after s 3A was enacted) this Court (Kirby P, Meagher JA and Handley JA), however, took a different view. Their Honours said (at 559 to 560): 
     
      
       
        
        “As we read s 3(1)(a), the task of the court or judge, justice or justices in specifying their opinion is indeed to ask a hypothetical question, as stated by Sugerman P in  
        R v Williams 
        . But that question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial, or afterwards admitted under 3A of the Act. All of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision-maker. The decision-maker must then ask whether, if the prosecution had evidence of all of the relevant facts immediately before the proceedings were instituted it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    18 Allerton was followed by Wood CJ at CL in R v Manley [2000] NSWCCA 196; (2000) 49 NSWLR 203 at [9], and Mordaunt v DPP [2007] NSWCA 121; (2007) 171 A Crim R 510 at [36], per McColl JA (with whom Beazley JA and Hodgson JA agreed). The remarks of Hidden J in R v Cardona reflect what was said in these cases.  
     
      
    19 When pressed to identify the evidence that he submitted Knox DCJ did not take into account, Mr Sweet replied: “The absence of material to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the drug was methylamphetamine”. This submission, however, cannot stand.  
     
      
    20 Firstly, Knox DCJ made it plain that he had regard to the whole of the evidence before him. He said (at [34]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The onus is on the applicant to establish pursuant to section 3(1)(a) of the  
        Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
        , 1967, that, in the light of all the evidence, including the evidence adduced at the trial, it would not have been reasonable for the prosecution to have commenced the proceedings. What is required is an objective analysis of the whole of the evidence – per Wood CJ at CL in R v Manley … - before granting a certificate to the applicant and the consideration of the test established in the Act.” 
        
       
      
    21 Secondly, and more particularly, Knox DCJ made it plain that he had had regard to material in the Crown case that was capable of proving that the drug was methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    22 The judge noted (at [7]):  
     
      
       
        
        “There was no evidence of any actual drugs found on, or recovered from, the accused, nor of, or from, the other persons said to be the parties to the conversations with the accused.” 
        
       
      
    23 Knox DCJ pointed out (at [8]), however, that the Crown case was dependant, in this respect, on inferences drawn from the telephone intercepts and the accuracy of the translation of those intercepts. His Honour observed that the intercepts – and, in particular, the terms used by the persons speaking – were relied on by the Crown to support the conclusion that the accused and those to whom he was talking were discussing the supply of either methylamphetamine or amphetamine. Accordingly, as the judge observed, the translation of these conversations was of crucial importance. 
     
      
    24 The Crown could not adduce the evidence of the intercepts by reason of his Honour’s ruling refusing to allow the translator to certify that he had translated the intercepts in question. Nevertheless, Knox DCJ expressly stated (at [44] and [45]) that, in determining the application for a certificate, he had regard to the evidence that the Crown was so precluded from leading, namely, the evidence tending to prove the supply of the drug in question. It is apparent that his Honour had this evidence in mind when he said (at [41] - as I have mentioned above), “[t]here was material available, which if properly presented, may have been sufficient to sustain the charge”. 
     
      
    25 In the course of argument on appeal, Mr Sweet was asked whether in determining the costs question his Honour wrongly took into account the evidence of the translation that he rejected at the end of the voir dire. Mr Sweet replied “the answer to that question is no”. In the following exchange between the Court and Mr Sweet he affirmed that answer. This concession was correctly made. 
     
      
    26 In the circumstances, the judge did take into account the material available to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the drug was methylamphetamine. It follows that the submissions advanced on the claimant’s behalf in regard to what was asserted to be the first error made by His Honour must be rejected. 
     
      
    27 I turn now to the second asserted error, namely, that his Honour failed to find the “relevant facts” under s 3 and to determine whether there were any “further relevant facts” within the meaning of s 3A(1) before considering the further issues that arose under the Act when deciding the application for a certificate. 
     
      
    28 The relevant sections of the Act are ss 2, 3(1) and 3A(1). These are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        2 Certificate may be granted 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The Court or Judge or Justice or Justices in any proceedings relating to any offence, whether punishable summarily or upon indictment, may:  
         
          
          (a) where, after the commencement of a trial in the proceedings, a defendant is acquitted or discharged in relation to the offence concerned, or a direction is given by the Director of Public Prosecutions that no further proceedings be taken, or  
           
          (b) where, on appeal, the conviction of the defendant is quashed and: 
           
            
            (i) the defendant is discharged as to the indictment upon which he or she was convicted, or  
             
            (ii) the information or complaint upon which the defendant was convicted is dismissed,  
            
           
          grant to that defendant a certificate under this Act, specifying the matters referred to in section 3 and relating to those proceedings.  
          
         
        (2) For the avoidance of doubt, a certificate may be granted in accordance with subsection (1) (a) following an acquittal or discharge of a defendant at any time during a trial, whether a hearing on the merits of the proceedings has occurred or not.  
         
        (3) In this section,  
        trial 
        , in relation to proceedings, includes a special hearing conducted under section 19 of the  
        Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
          
        1990 
         and also includes preliminary proceedings that form part of the trial, for example, a voir dire.  
         
         
        3 Form of certificate 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A certificate granted under this Act shall specify that, in the opinion of the Court or Judge or Justice or Justices granting the certificate: 
         
          
          (a) if the prosecution had, before the proceedings were instituted, been in possession of evidence of all the relevant facts, it would not have been reasonable to institute the proceedings, and  
           
          (b) that any act or omission of the defendant that contributed, or might have contributed, to the institution or continuation of the proceedings was reasonable in the circumstances. 
          
         
         
        3A Evidence of further relevant facts may be adduced 
        
       
       
        
        (1) For the purpose of determining whether or not to grant a certificate under section 2 in relation to any proceedings, the reference in section 3(1)(a) to  
        all the relevant facts 
         is a reference to:  
         
          
          (a) the relevant facts established in the proceedings, and 
           
          (b) any relevant facts that the defendant has, on the application for the certificate, established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Justice or Justices, and 
           
          (c) any relevant facts that the prosecutor, or in the absence of the prosecutor, any person authorised to represent the Minister on the application, has established to the satisfaction of the Court or Judge or Justices or Justices that: 
           
            
            (i) relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and 
             
            (ii) were not adduced in the proceedings.  
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    29 “All the relevant facts”, as this phrase is used in s 3(1)(a), are facts relevant to the reasonableness of the institution of the criminal proceedings. That is because, in that section, the “relevant facts” are concerned solely with that issue. Section 3A(1) is a definition section relating to the meaning of “all the relevant facts” in s 3(1). Therefore, the word “relevant” in the phrase “relevant facts” in s 3A(1) must carry the same meaning as that word in s 3(1), namely, facts relevant to the reasonableness of the institution of the criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    30 It is not possible to determine under which of the paragraphs (a) or (b) or (c) of s 3A(1) any of the evidentiary material, accepted by Knox DCJ as relevant facts, fell. This requires explanation. 
     
      
    31 The claimant did not put before this Court any of the evidence that was so before his Honour. While no evidence appears to have been led before the jury, there was undoubtedly evidence before his Honour to which he had regard when he decided the application for a certificate. 
     
      
    32 Ms Adams, counsel for the first respondent (the second respondent having filed a submitting appearance), informed the Court that, in the course of that application, the claimant tendered a large body of evidence. Mr Sweet did not dispute this. 
     
      
    33 In addition, his Honour made reference (at [19]) to the evidence led at the voir dire. Ms Adams informed this Court that the voir dire lasted three days. It is to be inferred from his Honour’s reasons that he had the evidence of the voir dire before him and took it into account. 
     
      
    34 Ms Adams stated that it was common ground at the costs application that the evidence before the judge was properly before him and could be taken into account by him. Mr Sweet, again, did not dispute this. Moreover, the claimant did not contend that any of the evidence to which his Honour had regard did not constitute a relevant fact within the meaning of ss 3 and 3A(1). 
     
      
    35 It follows that this Court must deal with the matter on the basis that the evidence on which his Honour relied amounted to relevant facts within the meaning of ss 3 and 3A(1). That is, even though the Court cannot determine under which paragraph of s 3A(1) each piece of evidence, to which his Honour referred, fell. 
     
      
    36 During the course of argument, the Court noted some potential difficulties that were capable of arising in the circumstances of this case due to the lack of precision in identifying the particular evidence before his Honour and when it came into the possession of the prosecution. This arises out of the words of s 3A(1)(c). On its face, subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of s 3A(1(c) are to be read conjunctively and constitute a qualification or limitation to the meaning of “all the relevant facts”. On a literal meaning of s 3A(1)(c), a fact will only be a relevant fact if it relates to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made and was not adduced in the proceedings. On this basis, evidence that came into the possession of the prosecutor after the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made would not be a relevant fact. Whether this construction should be placed on the section is a matter for argument. 
     
      
    37 Such an argument might have been pertinent had it been established that any of the evidence his Honour took into account was regarded by him as a relevant fact because it fell within s 3A(1)(c) and had it been established that such evidence only came into the possession after the decision to institute proceedings was made. 
     
      
    38 Despite the Court having raised the matter, no point was made of it on the claimant’s behalf. Presumably that is because none of the evidence that the judge took into account was before this Court and it would not be possible on the available material to draw any inference as to when that evidence came into the possession of the prosecution. 
     
      
    39 In Mordaunt at [36], general comments were made as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(f) The hypothetical question is addressed to evidence of all of the relevant facts, whether discovered before arrest or before committal (if any); after committal and before trial; during the trial; or afterwards admitted under section 3A of [the Act]; all of the relevant facts proved, whenever they became known to the prosecution and whether or not in evidence at the trial, must then be considered by the decision maker;  
        Allerton  
        at 559 – 560 
        ; Manley at [9] per Wood CJ  
        at Cl…” 
        
       
      
    40 The issue, however, as to the combined effect of paras (i) and (ii) of s 3A(1)(c) and the limitation that these paragraphs impose on the meaning of “relevant facts” was not argued in Mordaunt or any of the authorities referred to in the above-quoted passage. This issue has not been raised in any other case as far as I am aware. For the reasons I have given, this question does not fall for decision in this case, but the issue remains a real one. 
     
      
    41 The second error asserted on behalf of the claimant was that Knox DCJ failed to find the relevant facts, whether there were any further relevant facts within the meaning of s 3A(1) of the Act and, if so, what those further relevant facts were. 
     
      
    42 Section 3(1) requires the judge firstly to determine “all the relevant facts” and, secondly, the “reasonableness issue” required by section 3(1)(b). 
     
      
    43 I have referred to the lack of precision in the evidence before this Court as to the nature of the evidence that was before His Honour at the time of the costs application. I have pointed out that that evidence must be taken to be evidence of “all the relevant facts” within the meaning of section 3A(1). I have pointed out that Mr Sweet did not submit to the contrary. His basic complaint was that his Honour did not properly have regard to the evidence that was before him. He did not submit that his Honour wrongly took into account material that was not properly before him. 
     
      
    44 The omission on the part of the claimant to put before this Court the evidence on which Knox DCJ relied makes it difficult to determine whether his Honour failed to find the relevant facts including any “further relevant facts”. His Honour made several findings of fact which led him to the conclusion to which he came in dismissing the application for a certificate. These findings are to be taken as findings of “relevant facts” (and the contrary was not suggested.) As the evidence from which these findings were derived is not before this Court, it is not possible to assess whether these findings were properly made and whether other findings should have been made. 
     
      
    45 His Honour ([at 5]) identified the evidence on which the Crown relied involving voice identification, the meaning of terms used in the recorded conversations said to indicate the supply of methylamphetamine and forms of methylamphetamine.  
     
      
    46 His Honour noted that the Crown case was dependent on the inferences drawn from the telephone conversations and the accuracy of their translations. He said ([at 8]) that the conversations “contained the words and phrases on which the Crown based its case that there had been a supply of a prohibited drug”. 
     
      
    47 His Honour found, in effect, that the recorded conversations and, in particular, the terms used in them were capable of supporting a conclusion that the claimant was involved in the supply of either methylamphetamine or amphetamine. His Honour referred to additional statements filed by the Crown during the voir dire that related particularly to question “whether there was a ‘supply’ ” ([at 30]). 
     
      
    48 His Honour also observed (at [31]) that the Crown provided an additional statement that proved that the SIM card, used in the mobile phone the subject of the intercepts, “was the relevant card which was owned and operated by the accused at the time of the relevant transcripts, namely, in August, 2004”. 
     
      
    49 His Honour concluded, as I have said, that on the material which he so identified, the Crown may have been able to sustain the charge had it been allowed to lead the precluded evidence. 
     
      
    50 In the way the claimant presented his case before this Court I am not persuaded that his Honour, in so dealing with the matter, did not comply with the requirements of ss 3 and 3A(1). I would not uphold Mr Sweet’s submissions in this respect. 
     
      
    51 We were informed that the parties had agreed that each should pay its own costs of this application.  
     
      
    52 Accordingly I propose that the application be dismissed.53 BASTEN JA: In July 2007 the applicant stood trial on a charge of supplying a prohibited drug, contrary to State law. At the commencement of the trial, following a voir dire, Knox DCJ ruled that significant evidence sought to be adduced by the prosecution should be excluded. The prosecutor conceded that, without the evidence, he could not establish guilt and accordingly the trial judge directed the jury to acquit, which they did. 
     
      
    54 The applicant then sought a certificate under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) in relation to the proceedings. It was not in doubt that the acquittal engaged the applicant’s right to make the application. However, to obtain a certificate, the applicant needed to persuade the trial judge that the relevant factual premise contained in s 3 of the Act had been established and that the grant of a certificate was, in all the circumstances, an appropriate exercise of his discretion. Knox DCJ declined to grant a certificate. 
     
      
    55 There is no right of appeal from the refusal of such an application. Accordingly, the challenge to his Honour’s decision came by way of an application for relief in the nature of certiorari, pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW). To succeed, it was necessary for the applicant to establish either jurisdictional error on the part of the trial judge or error of law on the face of the record. He did not in terms seek to establish jurisdictional error, a course which would have been difficult in relation to a decision of a judge of superior court, applying the principles set out in Craig v South Australia [1995] HCA 58; 184 CLR 163 at 177. 
     
      
    56 At one point, counsel for the applicant contended for a broader construction of the “record” which might be relied upon to establish error of law, referring to passages in the judgment of this Court in Allerton v Director of Public Prosecutions (1991) 24 NSWLR 550 at 556 (Kirby P, Meagher and Handley JJA), in Ramskogler v Director of Public Prosecutions (1995) 82 A Crim R 128 at 132-134 (Kirby P), and earlier cases referred to in Allerton. That approach did not survive Craig which, subject to the statutory amendments, defines the scope of the record to exclude the reasons given for the decision: at 180-183. 
     
      
    57 At the hearing the applicant based his case upon the proposition that the trial judge had committed an error of law which appeared on the face of the record. It did not appear from the application for the certificate or from the order made, each of which was uncontroversial. It was, however, said to appear from the reasons given by the trial judge which constitute part of the record pursuant to s 69(3) and (4) of the Supreme Court Act. In broad terms, the applicant said that the trial judge had failed properly to apply the terms of the Costs in Criminal Cases Act in the circumstances of his case. Whether that would constitute legal error, unless the erroneous application demonstrated a misunderstanding of the legal requirements, may be doubted. It is therefore convenient to start with an understanding of the exercise required to be undertaken by the Act. 
     
      
       
      Operation of  
      Costs in Criminal Cases Act 
      
    58 As originally enacted, the Act contained two key provisions, ss 2 and 3. Although brief, they were obscure in a number of respects, a fact which gave rise to significant amendments in 1971 (when s 3A was introduced), 1997 and 2001. Some obscurities have been resolved but others have intruded. Accordingly, it is preferable to consider the statutory provisions in their present form, before considering such of the authorities as remain relevant. (The provisions have been set out in full by Ipp JA at [28] above and will only be repeated to the extent convenient for the present discussion.) 
     
      
    59 The first aspect to note is that the power to grant a certificate is conferred by s 2, which sets out the preconditions to a grant including, relevantly for present purposes, acquittal in relation to the offence concerned: s 2(1)(a). Section 3 provides that a certificate granted under s 2 “shall specify” that the judge has an opinion of a particular kind. It is to be inferred that the holding of the relevant opinion constitutes a precondition to the issue of a certificate. 
     
      
    60 It follows from the language of s 3(1) that the precondition does not depend upon the establishment of objective facts, but upon the establishment of an opinion of the relevant judicial officer. The formulation of such an opinion on the part of administrative bodies is not unreviewable, but may depend upon demonstration of a legally erroneous approach to the formation of the opinion, such as that the decision-maker could not reasonably have formed the opinion, has acted capriciously, arbitrarily, or without reference to the statutory criteria: see The King v Connell; Ex parte The Hetton Bellbird Collieries Ltd [1944] HCA 42; 69 CLR 407 at 430-432 (Latham CJ); Buck v Bavone [1976] HCA 24; 135 CLR 110 at 118 (Gibbs J) and Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Eshetu [1999] HCA 21; 197 CLR 611 at [113]-[139] (Gummow J). No lesser test can apply to the formation of an opinion by a judge of a court of record, such as the District Court: District Court Act 1973 (NSW), s 8. 
     
      
    61 The second point to note is that the relevant opinion is based on an assumption that the prosecution did not, before the proceedings were instituted, possess “evidence of all the relevant facts”. The hypothetical question asks whether it would have been reasonable to institute the proceedings if the prosecution had been in possession of such evidence. On one construction, the relevant opinion could not properly be formed where the prosecution had evidence of all the relevant facts but, in the view of the trial judge, acted unreasonably in instituting the proceedings. However, that construction, which would have given rise to anomalous results, was expressly rejected in Allerton at 556-560. 
     
      
    62 The third point is that the phrase “all the relevant facts” is defined by s 3A(1). The first limb, paragraph (a), refers to “the relevant facts established in the proceedings”. The reference to “the proceedings” must be understood as a reference to the criminal proceedings instituted by the prosecution and disposed of in one of the ways identified in s 2(1). There is then a question as to what facts, if any, were “established” in the present proceedings which terminated with a directed acquittal, no evidence having been tendered before the jury. There is, further, a degree of uncertainty as to whether the term “established”, in relation to the proceedings, refers to facts established according to the criminal standard or merely on the balance of probabilities. Because the question of whether to grant a certificate is one for the trial judge, it would seem in practical terms preferable to treat the requirement, as to which the applicant bears the burden of proof, as one of satisfying the trial judge on the balance of probabilities as to the relevant facts. Indeed, because the relevant facts which the prosecution did not possess might well include matters known only to the defendant, which had not been revealed prior to the trial, these would be facts required to be proved even in the criminal proceedings at no higher level than the balance of probabilities, if the defendant bore an onus of proof. 
     
      
    63 The fourth point flows from the fact that paragraphs (b) and (c) provide for the establishment of facts by the defendant and the prosecutor respectively. In relation to paragraph (b), because it does not matter whether or not the prosecutor was in possession of particular facts at the time the proceedings were instituted, the defendant will not need to prove any part of the Crown case in the course of the application. The failure to establish any factual basis for a particular element of the prosecution case will tend to support the application. In practical terms, the defendant is likely to seek to establish other facts, such as the existence of an alibi. 
     
      
    64 The prosecutor will usually be in a different position. In relation to paragraph (c), it is clear that the reference to “relevant facts” is not limited to facts which go to establish the guilt of the defendant. Rather, it includes “facts … that … relate to evidence that was in the possession of the prosecutor at the time that the decision to institute proceedings was made, and … were not adduced in the proceedings”. Facts that relate to evidence may be facts which would tend to support a belief in the veracity of a prosecution witness or which might tend to undermine an alibi. Such matters, which might not be admissible in the criminal proceedings, might nevertheless provide a justification for instituting the proceedings and could therefore constitute “relevant facts” for the purposes of s 3(1).  
     
      
    65 The fifth point, relevant to the present application, is that the definition of “all the relevant facts” in s 3A(1) should not distract attention from the test in s 3(1)(a), which hypothesises that the prosecution was in possession of “evidence” of all such facts. Despite the focus in s 3A(1) on facts which have been or are established, the section can only have a sensible operation if the court hearing the application is required to consider what appropriate judgment the prosecution should have made if it had had the evidence of those facts which was presented to the court. In other words, if the defendant establishes an alibi to the satisfaction of the court on the costs application, that becomes a relevant fact and, for s 3(1) to operate, it must be the evidence presented to the court in support of the alibi which is the evidence to be considered on the hypothetical question. 
     
      
    66 The other curious aspect of the provision is that one might have expected the potential unreasonableness of the decision to institute proceedings to have followed from an absence of evidence of material facts, being facts which it would be necessary to establish to obtain a conviction. Again, s 3(1)(a) appears to assume that the prosecution was in possession of sufficient material evidence to institute the proceedings, but that further evidence which became available at trial might have demonstrated that the decision was not reasonable. 
     
      
    67 It is understandable that in Pavy (1997) 98 A Crim R 396 at 399 the Court of Criminal Appeal (Hunt CJ at CL, Smart and Badgery-Parker JJ) conflated the test in s 3(1)(a) so that the hypothetical question referred to the prosecution being in possession of “all the relevant evidence”, with a temporal element identified by the phrase “as it is now known”. 
     
      
    68 It is also significant that in Pavy the Court granted a costs certificate to a person acquitted of murdering his twelve-week old son by shaking on the basis that the medical evidence did not exclude the reasonable possibility that the child ceased breathing before being shaken and that there was “a complete absence of evidence as to the applicant’s intention at the time he may have inflicted the injuries”: at 400. Their Honours concluded at 401: 
     
      
       
        
        “The situation here is that an examination before the trial of the evidence available to the Crown to support the case ought to have revealed the crucial circumstance that the medical evidence was not capable of excluding the reasonable possibility that the accused’s version was true; and that the evidence was not capable of sustaining an inference of the intention necessary to establish the second count.” 
        
       
       
      Approach of trial judge 
      
    69 His Honour commenced his inquiry by identifying the evidence relied upon by the prosecution: at [4]. The evidence in substance comprised transcripts of telephone conversations, the translation of which was “of crucial importance”: at [6]. However, the original translator’s certificate related to intercepts of conversations which occurred at times other than those relied upon in support of the prosecution. Additional evidence sought to be tendered at trial, but rejected on the voir dire, included a certificate which extended to the relevant conversations: at [13]-[14]. 
     
      
    70 There was also a deficiency in the evidence for the prosecution in relation to the identity of the SIM card in the mobile phone which was the subject of the intercepts. Again, the prosecution had sought to tender evidence, rejected on the voir dire, to overcome this deficiency: at [31]-[32]. His Honour concluded at [41]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not consider it has been established that it was not reasonable for the prosecution to have commenced the proceedings on the basis of the evidence that was in the possession of the Crown. There was material available, which if properly presented, may have been sufficient to sustain the charge.” 
        
       
      
    71 After noting the reason for not admitting the additional material, his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “44. The changes that there had been, and the additional evidence which would have resulted, had the disputed translation evidence been admitted meant that the basis on which the trial had been set down – and opened to the jury – had changed significantly. … 
        
       
       
        
        45. The evidence on which the Crown would have relied had not been tested, although the fact that there was no hearing on the merits is not determinative given the effect of section 2(1)(a) and section 2(3) of the Act and the earlier decision of  
        R v Turner  
        [1980] 1 NSWLR 19. On one view, had the defects in the Crown case been rectified, the accused may have had a case to answer in terms of explaining the words and phrases used on what were serious charges.” 
        
       
       
      The claim for relief by way of judicial review 
      
    72 In order to demonstrate error on the part of the trial judge in considering the application for a certificate, it was necessary to identify the precise matter in which his Honour was said to have erred, which would in turn have required the resolution of some of the issues of construction noted above. That, however, was not the approach embraced by the applicant.  
     
      
    73 One complaint made by the applicant was that the trial judge failed to follow the “two-step” approach, said in Ramskogler at p 135 (Kirby P) to have been required in Treasurer for the State of New South Wales v Wade (unrep, NSWCA, 16 June 1994) by Mahoney JA. According to this approach, the first step was to determine what were “all the relevant facts”; the second and separate step was to decide the “reasonableness issue”. However, failure to approach the matter expressly in those terms does not demonstrate error of law. In Wade, the parties conceded that there was a relevant error of law (at p 3); in Ramskogler, it appeared that the trial judge had acted on the basis that he had an unfettered discretion, without referring in terms to the test provided by s 3(1)(a). Neither case depended upon the failure to adopt a two-step approach. Usually, it will not be possible for a trial judge to determine the reasonableness of the institution of proceedings without identifying the evidence of relevant facts available to the prosecutor. The approach adopted may reveal error, but there is no legal requirement that a particular form of reasoning be adopted, so long as there is an exercise of the statutory jurisdiction conferred on the Court. In any event, no such complaint can be made of the approach of the trial judge in this case. 
     
      
    74 A second complaint was that the trial judge had failed to apply the principles identified in R v Cardona [2002] NSWSC 823 (Hidden J). Cardona was decided without reference to s 3A and without any elucidation of the statutory issues. Hidden J stated at [3]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although reference was made in submissions to material in the possession of the Crown prior to the trial, it is sufficient for present purposes to consider whether it would not have been reasonable for the prosecution to have instituted the proceedings in the light of the evidence as it emerged at the trial.” 
        
       
      
    75 Hidden J continued, apparently understanding the further remarks to be by way of extrapolation: 
     
      
       
        
        “As Hunt J … put it in  
        R v Dunne  
        (unrep, 17 May 1990), I must ‘put myself in the hypothetical place of the prosecution possessed of knowledge of all the facts which have now become apparent’, examining the matter ‘with the knowledge gained from such an omniscient crystal ball’ ….” 
        
       
      
    76 Reference to “an omniscient crystal ball” should be treated as a rhetorical flourish. It does not obviously assist in understanding the statutory language. Further, the reference to “knowledge” must be understood as a reference to “possession of evidence” of all the relevant facts. 
     
      
    77 A third complaint was that error of law could be discerned in the inadequacy of his Honour’s reasons. The concept of inadequate reasons as constituting an error of law was developed in this Court particularly as a ground of appeal from a tribunal, such as the Compensation Court, where appeals lay only with respect to errors of law. Whether such a ground is available as a basis for certiorari is less clear. In Ramskogler, the President held that it was (at 135 and 138) (Sheller JA “substantially” agreeing at 142) and Handley JA accepting the principle but finding there was no relevant contravention, at 141. However, in Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs v Yusuf [2001] HCA 30; 206 CLR 323 the High Court considered the operation of a statutory provision requiring the Refugee Review Tribunal to prepare a written statement, setting out the decision of the Tribunal on the review, the reasons for the decision, the findings on any material questions of fact and the evidence or any other material on which the findings of fact were based: Migration Act 1958 (Cth), s 430(1). In responding to a complaint that the tribunal decision was reviewable because it failed to make and set out findings of material facts, the joint judgment (McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) explained at [69]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not necessary to read s 430 as implying an obligation to  
        make  
        findings in order for it to have sensible work to do. Understanding s 430 as obliging the Tribunal to set out what were its findings on the questions of fact it considered material gives the section important work to do in connection with judicial review of decisions of the Tribunal. It ensures that a person who is dissatisfied with the result at which the Tribunal has arrived can identify with certainty what reasons the Tribunal had for reaching its conclusion and what facts it considered material to that conclusion. Similarly, a court which is asked to review the decision is able to identify the Tribunal’s reasons and the findings it made in reaching that conclusion. The provision entitles a court to infer that any matter not mentioned in the s 430 statement was not considered by the Tribunal to be material. This may reveal some basis for judicial review by the Federal Court under Pt 8 of the Act, or by this Court in proceedings brought under s 75(v) of the Constitution. For example, it may reveal that the Tribunal made some error of law …. It may reveal jurisdictional error. The Tribunal’s identification of what  
        it  
        considered to be the material questions of fact may demonstrate that it took into account some irrelevant consideration or did not take into account some relevant consideration.” 
        
       
      
    78 If the inadequacy of reasons given by an administrative tribunal pursuant to a statutory obligation does not by itself invalidate the decision, but may demonstrate a failure on the part of the tribunal to exercise its function properly, a similar approach should arguably be adopted in relation to the reasons given by a judicial officer. When the reasons were not part of the record, their inadequacy could not constitute error of law on the face of the record; it is arguable that the statutory expansion of the record did not expand the available categories of error. The fact that such a result may have been achieved (without explicit discussion) in the course of decisions of this Court which held (erroneously as became apparent in Craig) that reasons formed part of the record under the general law, does not warrant the conclusion (without full argument) that such an expansion of the availability of certiorari has now taken place as a result of the statutory variation of the general law definition of the record. 
     
      
    79 The resolution of this broader issue is unnecessary in the present case. It became apparent in the course of argument that the applicant relied upon the reasons to make good his claim that the trial judge committed an error of law. The ground relating to the inadequacy of the reasons was not directed to the evaluative judgment as to the reasonableness of the institution of proceedings, but to the first step of identifying the relevant facts. There is no basis for supposing that his Honour did not identify the facts which he considered material and relevant. Accordingly, the reasons were not deficient. To succeed the applicant had to demonstrate legal error in the approach adopted in identifying relevant facts. 
     
      
    80 Ultimately, counsel for the applicant had some difficulty in articulating his complaint in relation to the reasoning in the judgment. He accepted that it was for the applicant to establish that the institution of proceedings would not have been reasonable on the hypothesised basis, but it was the hypothetical basis which gave rise to difficulty. In part, this arose from the difficulty already noted of construing ss 3 and 3A coherently. At the end of the voir dire, when the jury were directed to acquit, no facts had been “established” in the criminal proceedings other than that the applicant was not guilty of the charge in the indictment. Apart from matters going to procedure and potential prejudice, the only finding made by the trial judge in the criminal proceedings was that, without the additional material, the prosecution was “doomed to failure”: at [14]. At one stage, it appeared that counsel was contending that the hopelessness of the prosecution case, so determined, was the relevant fact for the purposes of the costs application.  
     
      
    81 That approach should not be accepted. The cases are replete with statements that the acquittal of an accused is a precondition to an application for a certificate, not a sufficient basis for granting it. As a matter of statutory construction, that follows from the language of s 3(1)(a), which requires the assumption that the prosecution had in its possession “evidence of” all the relevant facts: it clearly does not mean evidence of the final verdict. 
     
      
    82 An alternative approach might have been to contend that his Honour should have, but did not, make findings as to the identity of the person speaking on the intercepts and the accuracy of the translation of the intercepts. Those were critical facts for the purposes of the prosecution and, if they were to be assessed on the basis of the admissible material, his Honour should have found that they were not made out. Once it was established that those facts could not be proved, the unreasonableness of the prosecution could then be appropriately assessed in accordance with the statutory scheme. 
     
      
    83 Although this approach would be somewhat closer to the language of the sections, it would not sufficiently conform to the test in s 3(1)(a) to be accepted. Thus, to take the meaning of the intercepted conversations, one issue for determination was the correct translation of the conversations, partly in Arabic, into English. It was from those conversations that the prosecution sought to draw an inference that the applicant, being a party to the conversations, was involved in supplying a prohibited drug. The facts to which s 3(1)(a) refers must in this connection be the recorded conversations, the identity of the person speaking on the mobile phone and the meaning of the words in Arabic. At the time the prosecution was instituted, the relevant officer no doubt believed that he or she had evidence of each of these material facts. His Honour held that these facts warranted the institution of the proceedings. There is, and can on the present application, be no challenge to that judgment. The only question is whether it reflected the correct approach. 
     
      
    84 For the applicant to succeed in challenging the approach, he had to demonstrate that the trial judge should either have disregarded the material considered on the voir dire (a course which he eschewed) or established that his Honour failed to take into account the fact that, unbeknownst to the prosecution at the time the proceedings were instituted, the evidence was deficient, perhaps that the officer ought reasonably to have realised the deficiency, and that by the time it sought to proceed with the trial, having identified the deficiency, the test of the on-going reasonableness of its conduct should have included an assessment of the possibility that the additional evidence would be rejected. This last course was not expressly eschewed, but neither was it relied upon. In order for the applicant to place reliance upon that approach, it would have been necessary for the case before the trial judge to be presented on that basis. There is no suggestion in the judgment that such a course was proposed. If it had been proposed and not addressed, a quite separate challenge might have been mounted. All that can usefully be said for present purposes is that, on the case presented to this Court, the applicant failed to identify a relevant error on the face of the record. 
     
      
       
      Exercise of discretion 
      
    85 Before concluding, it is convenient to note that a separate basis for resisting relief originally relied upon by the Director was abandoned during the hearing. Counsel for the Director had referred to the final paragraphs of his Honour’s judgment in which he concluded that had he otherwise been satisfied that the power to grant a certificate was enlivened, he would nevertheless have refused to exercise the power on a discretionary basis. 
     
      
    86 Two points may be made in that regard. First, although the Director did not take the point, the reason for discretionary refusal appears to have been that the applicant had stood by during lengthy pre-trial negotiations and attempts to have the charges withdrawn, not relying upon his technical objection to the defective translator’s certificate. That was a factor which might have been considered under s 3(1)(b): if the course taken by the defendant was seen as “reasonable in the circumstances”, it would be difficult to attribute to it a sound basis for refusing to issue the certificate in the exercise of the Court’s undoubted discretion. 
     
      
    87 Secondly, there are difficulties in placing firm reliance upon such a conclusion as demonstrating the inutility of relief where the hypothetical discretionary refusal is based upon an assumption contrary to the conclusion as to the existence of power. One reason for caution is that the counter-factual assumption is often not fully spelled out in relation to the exercise of the discretion. 
     
      
    88 In any event, counsel for the Director, having taken the opportunity to consider the reasoning of McHugh JA (Kirby P and Hope JA agreeing) in King v Goussetis (1986) 5 NSWLR 89 at 94-95 and Wade v Burns [1966] HCA 35; 115 CLR 537 at 555 (Barwick CJ), referred to by McHugh JA, abandoned reliance upon that aspect of his Honour’s reasoning.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Shaun Barry Logan pleaded guilty to two offences: One of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm and a second of assault with intent to rob. These offences were committed some eight months apart. At the time of the first offence, the offender was on two bonds for having assaulted police officers. At the time of the second offence, he was on bail for the first. Both offences were committed when the offender was intoxicated.2 The first offence, the most serious, was committed on 25 February 2007. The offender had been out for the night and had been drinking. He was returning to where he lived when he was confronted by two other men, one of whom ended up being the victim of the offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. His name was Bradley Peniston. Some form of altercation occurred between Mr Peniston and the offender. 3 The offender’s girlfriend was present. As a result of the altercation, she contacted triple-0. At this point, someone produced two knives. The matter was put before me today on the basis that the Crown could not prove that it was the offender who produced the knives and the offender could not prove to the standard required that Mr Peniston had produced the two knives. I was invited by both parties to proceed on the basis that it was entirely neutral; it was not a matter of aggravation that the offender and produced the knives but nor was it a matter of mitigation that he was not. 4 In any case, as I say, someone produced the two knives. They came into possession of the offender. He stabbed Mr Peniston repeatedly. He received a number of significant stab wounds to the left side of his chest and neck. One wound penetrated through to his shoulder. In an attempt to defend himself, he put his hands up and subsequently received knife wounds to his left forearm, hand and fingers. He was on the ground when these injuries were inflicted upon him by the offender. It must have been a ferocious attack. 5 Mr Peniston managed to get to his feet and run away. He was observed by a witness, covered in blood, yelling “help me” as he ran. The offender was not done, however. He ran after Mr Peniston holding a knife in each hand. Mr Peniston was clearly frightened for his life. As he reached an intersection, there was a taxi stopped at a red light. The passenger in the taxi saw Mr Peniston and saw the offender holding two knives. The offender was clearly continuing to act aggressively, yelling to Mr Peniston, “If you want to stab me, bring it on.” 6 Eventually, Mr Peniston collapsed on the front porch of a nearby home, bleeding profusely. Two passers-by assisted him and called an ambulance. He was taken to hospital and treated. He required surgery. He was in an induced coma for two days. He received sixty-four metal staples to his neck, chest and back, and a further sixteen staples to his left arm. He received eleven stitches to his left hand and fingers and five stitches to the top of his head. He also fractured his collarbone. 7 As a result of those injuries, Mr Peniston has suffered significant nerve damage to his neck area and lost all feeling on the left side of his face and earlobe. He requires ongoing therapy on his hand to repair tendons and regain movement and strength. He also reports that he suffers from depression and anxiety, finding it very hard to go places, with a constant of fear of people in public places. The consequences to Mr Peniston are entirely foreseeable, given the ferocity of the attack.8 After Mr Peniston got away, the offender walked back the way he had come, still armed. He threw a knife away, which police later recovered. They also recovered another knife. On speaking with the offender, the police noticed that he was covered with blood but his only injury was a one-centimetre cut to his head. 9 I am prepared to accept that the offender was initially attacked by two men but the offender’s reaction was seriously criminal and seriously violent. The offence was aggravated by the circumstance that he was on a bond for assaulting police officers. The offender was granted bail. 10 If he had not been granted bail, perhaps the second offence would not have occurred because on 1 October 2007, a second victim had to suffer at the hands of the offender. On this occasion, a Mr Adam Parker was sitting outside a convenience store eating a kebab. He had had a bit to drink. He was approached by the offender who had also had a bit to drink and was in the presence of two other men. The offender said to Mr Parker, “Nice watch, and I like those bangles too. I might have those.” He also demanded Mr Parker’s kebab. He then tried to grab Mr Parker’s watch. Mr Parker, not surprisingly, resisted and said, “You're not getting anything off me.” Mr Parker then punched the accused in an effort to get rid of him. In response, the offender put Mr Parker in a headlock. Mr Parker then kicked him in the groin and the offender punched Mr Parker several times. Fortunately, the offender was restrained by the two other men that I have mentioned. He left the scene but was arrested whilst getting a train away from the area. 11 As I mentioned, this offence was committed whilst he was on bail for the first. The offender has spent three days in custody as a result of these offences but has been on bail for most of the time. He entered pleas of guilty to both offences on the day the matters were listed for trial. Accordingly, to reflect the utilitarian value of those pleas, I will reduce the sentences I would otherwise have imposed by ten per cent. 12 The offender is a qualified chef. He is twenty-five years of age and has always seemed to be able to get employment. He was born in Nowra, being the oldest of two siblings. He was raised by his mother until he was eleven years of age, at which time it appears his mother and his half-sibling abandoned him. The offender’s father took him in. It seems that before his mother abandoned him, she subjected the offender to physical abuse which may be due to her alcohol and illegal drug use. The offender has a good relationship with his father, his father’s parents, and his younger sibling. He has, however, not had any contact with his mother for some time. 13 As I mentioned at the outset of these remarks on sentence, the offender was intoxicated at the time of both offences. He commenced drinking at about fifteen and began to binge-drink for periods of up to ten hours at a time. Apparently, he has moderated his alcohol consumption somewhat. Mr Ainsworth frankly tells me that he had a few drinks last night in anticipation of being sentenced today but that is a rare event.14 The question of the offender’s ability to deal with his alcohol consumption is of course related to his prospects of rehabilitation. Given the circumstances that these offences were committed whilst the offender was highly intoxicated, it seems likely that the offender’s consumption of alcohol has played a part in his commission of offences. If he is able to deal with his excessive alcohol consumption, then the chances of him committing further offences are reduced. I cannot say, however, that he has good prospects of rehabilitation nor that he is unlikely to re-offend. Nor am I prepared to find that the offender is remorseful. No evidence was given by the offender and none was called on his behalf. 15 The author of the presentence report notes that: 
     
      
       
      “[I]n spite of the ferocity and apparent shift from victim to aggressor, Mr Logan further indicated that the offences now before the court were committed whilst he was attempting to defend himself and his partner.”  
      
    16 Any suggestion that the offender was in any way defending himself must of course be immediately be rejected, given the nature of the offender’s attack upon Mr Peniston. I repeat, he chased Mr Peniston after having inflicted brutal and ferocious violence upon him. There was no question that these offences were committed whilst the offender was attempting to defend himself. The suggestion to that effect is a significant impediment to me finding that the offender is remorseful. 17 Mr Ainsworth relied on some statistics published by the Judicial Commission. They are, of course, helpful but as the authorities have firmly stated, of limited utility. It is to be noted that the statistics provided for the offence of malicious wounding must be of very limited utility in this case. I can imagine very few offences of this nature where the offender is dealt with for malicious wounding rather than the aggravated form of the offence: malicious wounding with intent. These statistics are, in all likelihood, reflecting much less serious offences. 18 I am satisfied that a full-time custodial sentence is required in the present circumstances. Mr Ainsworth addressed me about the possibility of periodic detention but I am satisfied, particularly in light of the objective gravity of the malicious wounding offence, nothing less than full-time custody would properly reflect what the offender has done.19 There are special circumstances; this will be the offender’s first time in custody and I should also note that there will be an element of accumulation. These offences were committed quite separately and the offender must be separately punished for them. Although, however, of course, the principle of totality applies; the accumulation will therefore be partial.20 There is no suggestion, particularly in relation to the malicious wounding offence, that these offences were planned. Certainly, in relation to the malicious wounding, as I have found, that offence occurred after the offender was initially attacked by two men; over what we just do not know. That is a matter of mitigation. The offender did not go out intending to stab someone that night, however, its value as a matter of mitigation to the offender is limited by the circumstance that the offender’s actions went far beyond any reasonable response to having been attacked by those two men. Although in one sense the offender was provoked by Mr Peniston, that is not a significant matter in mitigation, given what occurred afterwards.21 The offender is sentenced as follows: For the offence of assault with intent to rob, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of six months to commence on 30 June 2008 and a head sentence of ten months. For the offence of inflicting grievous bodily harm, I set a non-parole period of one year to commence on 30 December 2008 and expire on 29 December 2009. There is a balance of term of ten months on that offence, thus the offender is entitled to be released to parole on 29 December 2009 and the overall sentence is one of eighteen months non-parole period with a ten-month period of eligibility for parole.

     Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales 
     
     
      
       
      The claimants invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court to review a decision of the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales. In the alternative, the claimants seek an order pursuant to the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       2001 for an inquiry into the conviction of the claimants at first instance. 
       
       
      HELD: 
       
      Inquiry into conviction 
       
      (Per Spigelman CJ; Hodgson JA and Handley AJA agreeing) 
       
       
      1 An application for an inquiry into conviction cannot be instituted by way of summons in the Court of Appeal. Section 79 of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       2001 empowers the Supreme Court to direct an inquiry. The jurisdiction is to be exercised by the Chief Justice or by an authorised person. [8] [61] [63]  
       
       
      2 The Court has no jurisdiction to make the order sought. [9] [61] [63]

      ( 
      Per Spigelman CJ; Hodgson JA and Handley AJA agreeing 
      ) 
       
       
      3 Following amendments to the privative clause in s 179 of the  
      Industrial Relations Act  
      1996, this Court can review jurisdictional error after the Full Court of the Industrial Court has dealt with any appeal as to an issue of jurisdiction. [21] [61] [63] 
       
       
        
        Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales

      4 The authoritative statement as to circumstances in which such supervisory jurisdiction can be exercised in relation to a court is set out in  
      Craig v South Australia 
       (1995) 184 CLR 163. [22] [61] [63]

      Capacity to comply 
       
      ( 
      Per Spigelman CJ; Hodgson JA and Handley AJA agreeing 
      ) 
       
       
      5 The Industrial Relations Commission has not adopted an interpretation of the  
      Occupational Health and Safety Act 
       1983 that renders the statutory duties imposed by the Act impossible of compliance. No jurisdictional error of law is made out either in the general jurisprudence of the Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales, or in its application to this case. [37] [40] [61] [63] 
       
       
      6 The test of reasonable foreseeability should not be introduced into ss 15(1) and 16(1) of the  
      Occupational Health and Safety Act 
       1983. 
       
       
      7 The defence of honest and reasonable mistake has no relevance to this case. [42]-[43] [61] [63] 
       
       
      8 The claimants have not established any jurisdictional error in the interpretation of s 15(2)(d) and s 15(3) of the  
      Occupational Health and Safety Act 
       1983. [47] [61] [63] 
       
       
      9 The Court has no jurisdiction to review findings of fact challenged by the claimants. [38]-[39] [44] [46] [61] [63] 
       
       
      Corporate Responsibility – the trial judge 
       
      ( 
      Per Spigelman CJ; Hodgson JA and Handley AJA agreeing 
      ) 
       
       
      10 The claimants challenge the finding of the primary judge that the failures of Mr Kirk were therefore the failures of the company. No relevant jurisdictional error is shown. [55] [61] [63] 
       
       
      11 The Court has no jurisdiction to review findings of fact challenged by the claimants. [55] [61] [63] 
       
       
      12 The submission that there was a jurisdictional error by reason of denial of procedural fairness need not be considered, and was in any case a challenge as to factual findings. [56] [61] [63] 
       
       
      Corporate Responsibility – the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission 
       
      ( 
      Per Spigelman CJ; Handley AJA agreeing 
      ) 
       
       
      13 The claimants challenge the failure of the Full Bench to address the question whether the primary judge erred in his finding on corporate responsibility. No relevant jurisdictional error is shown. [59] [61] 
       
       
      ( 
      Per Hodgson JA 
      ) 
       
       
      14 It is arguable that the Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission failed to address this question. However, this was not a jurisdictional error. [62]

     Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: On 30 June 2006 this Court dismissed a summons filed by the claimants, in part on the basis that the claimants had not exercised their right to appeal to the Full Bench of the Industrial Court pursuant to the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1996. The members of this Court also sat as the Court of Criminal Appeal and dismissed an application to that Court. (Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales [2006] NSWCA 172; (2006) 66 NSWLR 151.)  
     
      
    2 Subsequently the claimants sought leave to extend time to appeal to the Full Bench of the Industrial Court. On 15 November 2006 leave to appeal was refused in some respects and granted in one respect. (Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (Inspector Childs) [2006] NSWIRComm 355; (2006) 158 IR 281.) On 8 May 2007 the appeal was dismissed. (Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales [2007] NSWIRComm 86; (2007) 164 IR 146.)  
     
      
    3 The claimants again invoke the supervisory jurisdiction of this Court, seeking orders to quash the first instance decision of the Industrial Relations Commission and/or the two decisions of the Full Bench. No submissions were addressed to the first decision of the Full Bench ie the refusal to extend time to appeal. The substantive issue before this Court is judicial review of the first instance decision in the Industrial Relations Commission, the internal appellate process having been exhausted. 
     
      
    4 In the alternative, the claimants seek an order pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 for an inquiry into the conviction of the claimants at first instance.  
     
      
    5 This alternative submission can be dealt with briefly. 
     
      
    6 In their summons filed in this Court the claimants seek: 
     
      
       
        
        “[A]n order pursuant to s 474D of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 referring to the Court of Criminal Appeal an inquiry into the conviction of the claimants in the said decision.” 
        
       
      
    7 The relevant provisions of the Crimes Act have been repealed and substantively re-enacted as s 78 and s 79 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The claimants have sought to amend their summons accordingly. 
     
      
    8 An application under these provisions cannot to be instituted by way of summons in the Court of Appeal. Section 78 of the Act requires an application to the Supreme Court. After consideration of an application under s 78 the Supreme Court is empowered to “direct” an inquiry under s 79. Section 75 of the Act states that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court is to be exercised by the Chief Justice or by an authorised person.  
     
      
    9 The provisions of the Act clearly envisage an administrative, not a curial process. The relevant power is a power to direct. The power can only be exercised by the Chief Justice personally or by his or her appointee. This Court has no jurisdiction to make the order sought. 
     
      
       
       
      Background Facts 
       
      
    10 Each of the claimants was convicted of an offence under each of s 15 and s 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety Act 1983 (“the OH&S Act”) by a decision of Walton J of the Industrial Commission of New South Wales. (WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2004] NSWIRComm 207; (2004) 135 IR 166.) His Honour subsequently imposed fines upon each claimant with respect to each charge. (WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2005] NSWIRComm 1; (2005) 137 IR 462.) There has never been an appeal from sentence and this Court is not asked to review the sentence, or to appoint an inquiry into sentence.  
     
      
    11 The offences which each claimant was found to have committed constituted a contravention, respectively, of s 15(1) and s 16(1) of the OH&S Act which provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “15(1) Every employer shall ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of all the employer’s employees.” 
        
       
       
        
        “16(1) Every employer shall ensure that persons not in the employer’s employment are not exposed to risks to their health or safety arising from the conduct of the employer’s undertaking while they are at the employer’s place of work.” 
        
       
      
    12 On the relevant day charged, Mr Palmer, the farm manager employed by the corporate claimant who is the owner of the property, died in circumstances set out in this Court’s earlier judgment. The contravention of s 15 found to have occurred by the company claimant related to Mr Palmer and one other employee. The contravention of s 16 by the company claimant related to certain independent contractors who were on the property to construct fencing. 
     
      
    13 The individual claimant was found liable as a director pursuant to s 50 of the OH&S Act which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “50(1) Where a corporation contravenes, whether by act or omission, any provision of this Act or the regulations, each director of the corporation, and each person concerned in the management of the corporation, shall be deemed to have contravened the same provision …” 
        
       
      
    14 Each claimant was entitled to rely, and did unsuccessfully rely, on the express defence under the OH&S Act.  
     
      
    15 In the case of the director, s 50(1) quoted above, goes on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … unless he or she satisfies the court that: 
        
       
       
        
        …  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) he or she was not in position to influence the conduct of the corporation in relation to its contravention of the provision, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) he or she, being in such a position, used all due diligence to prevent the contravention by the corporation.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 In the case of the corporate claimant s 53 of the Act provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “53 It shall be a defence to any proceedings against a person for an offence against this Act or the regulations for the person to prove that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) it was not reasonably practicable for the person to comply with the provisions of this Act or the regulations the breach of which constitute the offence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the commission of the offence was due to causes over which the person had no control and against the happening of which it was impracticable for the person to make provision.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 Walton J’s findings of primary fact that established the basis for a finding of ‘failure to ensure’ are wide ranging: 
     
      
       
        
        “[105] In my view, the evidence demonstrates, beyond reasonable doubt, that Mr Kirk (and therefore the Company, except in the case of (k)): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) had not seen or read the Owner's Manual prior to Mr Palmer's accident; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) did not supervise the daily activities of employees or contractors working on the Farm; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) did not conduct a risk assessment, or request any other person to conduct a risk assessment, regarding the use of the ATV on the Farm; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) did not take any steps to limit or restrict access to the ATV to only those employees and contractors who were suitably qualified and trained to ride the ATV; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) did not ensure that employees or contractors read and understood the Owner’s Manual; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) gave no instructions to any employee or contractor, including Mr Palmer, that conditions for use of the ATV specified in the Owner's Manual must be adhered to; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) gave no instructions to Mr Palmer to instruct employees and contractors only to use the ATV in accordance with the Owner’s Manual; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) gave no particular instructions to any employee or contractor as to how the Owner’s Manual would be applied at the Farm; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) gave no instructions to any employee or contractor that the ATV was not to be used off-road or on sloping terrain (either generally or of a particular gradient); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (j) relied on Mr Palmer to give instruction and training without equipping him with the knowledge or tools to undertake those duties, and without supervising or monitoring his performance of those duties; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (k) approached the creation of a safe system of work differently between two businesses he operated; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (l) had no system in place to assess and determine whether or not employees of, or contractors to, the Company were trained in the use of the ATV, or were using the ATV in a manner which was safe and without risk to health.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 His Honour’s findings of risk and breach were: 
     
      
       
        
        “[151] What, then, was the relevant risk to safety in the present matter? In my view, there was a clear risk, evident from Mr Kirk's own experience and from the express warnings in the Owner's Manual, that the ATV could overturn (or otherwise unbalance) in various circumstances: clearly a situation of potential danger to the health and safety of people at the Company's workplace. In this case, it is only necessary to consider two limited classes of such circumstances. First, off-road driving at the Farm, which, by its very nature, increased the likelihood of many of the precursors to overturning mentioned in the Owner's Manual: excessively steep hills (avoided on one steep hill by a hairpin road specifically built for safety), hidden rocks, bumps or holes, or excessively rough, slippery or loose surfaces. Secondly, towing from the ATV's rack. The existence of these risks required the exercise of a managerial mind to establish a safe system for a vehicle which, by its description and nature, may involve some off-road use or towing. The Act charged the defendants to eliminate these risks to health and safety; the prosecutor has charged that (through failures of systems, information, instruction, training, supervision and risk assessment) they failed to do so.  
        
       
       
        
        [152] The Company's obligation under the Act to establish a system to eliminate the risk of the ATV overturning when driven off-road or when used for towing required it to assess the risks associated with the use of the ATV on the Farm, particularly having regard to the uneven terrain; to restrict access to the ATV to those employees and contractors who were sufficiently qualified and experienced to ride it; to instruct employees and contractors in relation to the safe use of the ATV; to provide information to employees and contractors regarding the safe operation of the ATV, for instance in the form of the Owner's Manual; to warn employees and contractors at least about the potential for the ATV to overturn; to provide suitable training in relation to the use of the ATV; and to supervise the use of the ATV on the Farm. Only two aspects of the evidence contradict (to a limited extent) the bald statement that none of these things were done. Although I have found that the ATV was generally accessible, it is true that Mr Thorn's access was restricted (although this restriction was not explained, and there was no evidence to suggest that it was a decision made on the basis of safety); I have also found that Mr De Save read the Owner's Manual (out of curiosity, having happened upon it); and, I am prepared to accept that Mr Palmer read it. Again, in view of my finding that no employee or contractor was given any instruction to comply with it, and no attempt was made to regulate its use at the Farm, this evidence does not amount to much in the defendants' favour. Nor, as I will discuss, does it excuse liability. 
        
       
       
        
        [153] My findings at paragraph [105], in part based on Mr Kirk's unequivocal evidence that:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the Company did not have a system in place to determine whether or not Mr Palmer was using the ATV in a safe manner; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the Company had never undertaken a risk assessment associated with the use of the ATV on the farm;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the Company had never asked Mr Palmer to conduct a risk assessment in relation to the use of the ATV on the Farm;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the Company had never determined whether Mr Palmer had the necessary skills or training to manage occupational health and safety on the Farm, but nevertheless gave him the responsibility to develop a safe system of work for the operation of the ATV on the Farm; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) Mr Kirk did not take any steps in relation to health and safety on the Farm pertaining to the ATV following his own accident near a dam in which the ATV overturned; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        are sufficient, in my view, (in conjunction with the decision of  
        WorkCover v Fletcher Constructions 
         that an employer cannot discharge its duty by wholesale delegation of safety matters) to find that each of the failures particularised in the charges was established beyond reasonable doubt …” 
        
       
      
    19 Walton J addressed this issue as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[160] … First I will deal with the defendants' submission that there can be no offence in the present case because Mr Palmer’s behaviour leading to the accident was so aberrant and non-sensical that it was not capable of being foreseen and, as such, could not be within the contemplation of s 15.  
        
       
       
        
        [161] This submission falls into the error of focussing on the accident rather than on the risk. As the Court held in  
        O'Sullivan 
        , the distinction must be drawn between a specific risk (the particular actions of an individual in a given context on a given day) and a general class of risk. The general risk was that the failure to provide systems, information, instruction training, supervision and risk assessment could result in the use of the ATV (when driven off-road or when used for towing) in an unsafe manner, creating a situation where it was capable of overturning. The defendants, quite correctly, did not contend that this risk was incapable of being foreseen. Far from being unforeseeable, this risk was explicitly proclaimed in the Owner's Manual. It is not to the point whether the precise circumstances of Mr Palmer's accident (the specific risk) may or may not have been capable of being foreseen. There was a clear risk that Mr Palmer (or any other employee or contractor) could have driven an ""All Terrain Vehicle"" off-road, or towed things from the rack, or done both simultaneously, in any number of circumstances which may have caused the ATV to overturn. Mr Kirk's accident provides a useful example. In any event, the fact that Mr Palmer's actions may be described as careless, mistaken or even negligent does not assist the defendants (especially here, where no action was taken to advert the risk): the authorities have consistently held that an employer's duty extends to the hasty, careless, inadvertent, inattentive or unreasonable employees.” 
        
       
       
      Jurisdictional Error Submissions 
       
      
    20 A number of matters agitated before this Court on the first occasion are not now pursued. These proceedings have, save in certain specific respects on the part of the opponents, proceeded on the basis of the judgment of this Court in the first proceedings.  
     
      
    21 Both parties accept the analysis of this Court to the effect that, following the amendments to the privative clause in s 179 of the Industrial Relations Act 1996 discussed in the earlier judgment, this Court is empowered to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction on the basis of jurisdictional error after the Full Court of the Industrial Court had dealt with any appeal to it. (See Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (2006) 66 NSWLR 151 esp at [31], [36], [52] and [83].) 
     
      
    22 The claimants’ submissions rely on the authoritative statement in the joint judgment of the High Court as to the circumstances in which supervisory jurisdiction can be exercised with respect to a court in Craig v South Australia (1995) 184 CLR 163, which this Court had set out in the first proceedings. (See Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (2006) 66 NSWLR 151 at [37]-[38].)  
     
      
    23 The relevant test, invoked by the claimants, is whether the Industrial Court: 
     
      
    · “misapprehends or disregards the nature or limits of its functions or powers” (Craig supra at 177). 
     
      
    · “misconstrues [the] statute … and thereby misconceives the nature of the function which it is performing or the extent of its powers in the circumstances of the particular case” (Craig supra at 177-178). This being an example of a court falling into jurisdictional error “by doing something which it lacks authority to do” (Craig at 177). 
     
      
    24 The claimants identified three jurisdictional errors by the Industrial Court in written submissions: 
     
      
       
        
        “[42] Firstly it has failed to properly interpret the provisions of s 15 of the OH&S Act in that it has accorded it a strict liability, discounting any concept of foreseeability or reasonable foreseeability let alone any  
        mens rea  
        in relation to the criminal offence. It has interpreted the provision in such a fashion as to make compliance impossible. 
        
       
       
        
        [43] Secondly, it has applied the defence afforded by the legislature in s 53 of the OH&S Act in such a restrictive way that it presents no real defence at all. 
        
       
       
        
        [44] Finally, the Court has so confused the notion of a non delegable corporate duty with the question of who within the corporation may fulfil that non delegable duty as to inflict criminal responsibility without regard to corporate compliance. 
        
       
       
        
        [45] In each of these errors, the Court has so misunderstood its task as to fail to perform the duty reposed in it.” 
        
       
      
    25 In support of the first proposition the written submissions stated, in part: 
     
      
       
        
        “[51] The Industrial Court has expressly held that the duty is breached even when the risk to safety is not reasonably foreseeable  
        Drake Personnel Ltd v Workcover Authority (NSW)  
        (1999) 90 IR 432 at 452. 
        
       
       
        
        [52] In short the Industrial Court has found that there is an absolute duty on the employer created by section 15 of the OH&S Act to prevent any risk to the Health Safety or Welfare at work of its employees. The creation of a risk free environment is of course impossible in many areas of industry … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        [55] … If no coherent consistent restriction is placed on the apparently wide ranging scope of the statutory provision it covers all manner of circumstances over which the employer can have no control. No such restriction has been attempted by the Industrial Court.” 
        
       
      
    26 The claimants submit that s 15(2) suggests a legislative intention to restrict the duty under s 15(1) – specifically the restriction in s 15(2)(d) – to a “place of work under the employer’s control”. The claimants also invoke the reference in s 15(3) to any plant or substance not being “regarded as properly used”, in support of the same proposition: 
     
      
    27 Those subsections state: 
     
      
       
        
        “15(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), an employer contravenes that subsection if the employer fails 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) as regards any place of work under the employer’s control: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) to maintain it in a condition that is safe and without risks to health … 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        15(3) For the purposes of this section, any plant or substance is not to be regarded as properly used by a person where it is used without regard to any relevant information or advice relating to its use which has been made available by the person’s employer.” 
        
       
      
    28 The claimants further submit: 
     
      
       
        
        “[58] Alternatively, the rigor of the statute may be alleviated by focusing attention on whether the risk arises through some positive act or omission of the employer. Again the Industrial Court or its predecessor has resisted any such restriction … The employer has been held responsible for risks created through strikes and through the actions of inherently unstable criminals. 
        
       
       
        
        [59] The absolute statutory duty created by the Act as interpreted by the Industrial Court is incapable of compliance. Such an interpretation offends the rule of law.” 
        
       
      
    29 The claimants noted that there is a reference to “reasonable practicability” as a qualification in the statement of the duty itself in the interstate equivalents of s 15(1) and s 16(1) of the OH&S Act. In New South Wales alone the reference arises by way of a defence in s 53(a). 
     
      
    30 In this regard the claimants submit: 
     
      
       
        
        “[63] … The Industrial Court, even in the more straightened terms of the NSW Act, has discounted any possibility of the defendant relying upon the notion that he acted on an honest and reasonable belief in conducting himself in the challenged fashion. Such an approach pays little regard to established jurisprudence in this area (see for instance  
        Barry Edward McDonald (t/as B.E. McDonald Transport) v Girkaid Pty Ltd & 4 Ors) 
        .” 
        
       
      
    31 The claimants conclude: 
     
      
       
        
        “[101] Can it then be said to be an error within jurisdiction for a Court to so interpret a piece of legislation as to place it outside a rational and civilised criminal code? The Claimants submit not. As Mason J observed in  
        Sankey v Whitlam  
        (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 84: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The distinction between no jurisdiction and jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for an offence unknown to the law is not sufficiently formidable to warrant intervention in one case but not in the other.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [102] The jurisdiction of the Industrial Court is statutory. The  
        Occupational Health and Safety Act  
        only confers jurisdiction on the Court in relation to offences under the Act. The Court below cannot create a new class of offence by misinterpreting the offences created by the statute. To the extent that it misunderstand the nature of the task reposed in it, it will inevitably have fallen into jurisdictional error ( 
        Craig v South Australia  
        (1995) 184 CLR 163 at 177.)” 
        
       
      
    32 In oral submissions, counsel for the claimants asserted that the Industrial Commission: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … has … imposed a duty which is incapable of being met. It has read the statute as imposing upon an employer an obligation to ensure a risk-free environment, which the court in its own jurisprudence acknowledges cannot exist.”  
        
       
       
      
    33 As to the defence in s 53, the claimants made the following submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “[67] … the Court below was unmoved by the practicability of a small farm operation with two part time employees conducting risk assessments and putting in place written procedures in respect presumably to every implement which could be used on the farm. This notwithstanding the familiarity of those at risk with farming operations … Such an approach to the defense, in the respectful submission of the claimant, presents in such a way that the statutory defense is not available at all. If the legislature provided a defense, presumably it was meant to have some utility. The fact that there are less than a handful of cases in the last 10 years where regard has been had to the defense may well point towards the perceived lack of utility of the defense on the interpretation adopted in the Court below.”  
        
       
       
      Capacity to Comply 
       
      
    34 The central thrust of the claimant’s submissions, repeated in a number of ways in oral submissions, was that the obligations under the OH&S Act must be capable of being complied with. To similar effect, the claimants submit that the Commission’s approach deprives the defence in s 53 of any significance. It may be accepted that this was not Parliament’s intention. However, the jurisprudence of the Industrial Court is not based on the denial of this proposition. 
     
      
    35 Walton J set out the relevant jurisprudence in the Industrial Relations Commission (now retitled, relevantly, the “Industrial Court”) which expressly excludes liability for “risks that are impossible to anticipate, unduly remote or speculative”. (See his judgment on liability WorkCover Authority of New South Wales v Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd [2004] NSWIRComm 207; (2004) 135 IR 166 at [130], [136].) His Honour indicated that he was inclined to take a different view and that he would assess such matters in terms of causation (see at [134]-[135]) but concluded that nothing turned on this in the proceedings (at [137]). Nevertheless, the prevailing jurisprudence in the Commission is as stated. 
     
      
    36 Similarly, Walton J identified (at [146]) authority that states that it would not be reasonably practicable to take precautions against a danger which could not have been known or, generally, which could not be reasonably foreseen. 
     
      
    37 The significance of these lines of authority is that it cannot be said that the Commission has, generally or in this case, adopted a position where it enforces obligations impossible of compliance or that no defendant can establish impracticability. In this regard I can detect no jurisdictional error. To apply the terminology of Craig supra at [23] above, the Commission has not misconceived its function, etc. Indeed, if there is an error of law, it is at most an error of interpretation within jurisdiction. 
     
      
    38 However, in substance, the claimants’ submissions, in my opinion, involve an assertion that the Commission, in practice, stretches the concept of risk to such an extent that the exception for “unduly remote or speculative” risks and the defence are deprived of practical content. Similarly, that the concept of what is “reasonably practicable” is extended beyond reasonable grounds. These errors, if any, are based on factual findings. This Court does not have jurisdiction to review an error of that character. 
     
      
    39 Another way in which the claimants expressed this submission was that the Commission proceeds with respect to both a finding of contravention and the application of the defences so that, with the benefit of hindsight, it is always possible to think of something that might have avoided a risk that has materialised. This is also fact finding with respect to both the contravention and the s 53 defence. In my opinion, the thrust of the claimants’ case is to seek judicial review of fact finding. That is not permissible in this Court. 
     
      
    40 The only submission made to the effect that such errors of law, which this Court has no jurisdiction to correct, constitute jurisdictional errors, entitling this Court to intervene, was that “the law ‘was’ not being applied in accordance with the statute”. This does not identify a jurisdictional error. (See Craig supra at 177-178, set out above at [23].) Indeed, counsel for the claimants did not attempt to explain why these alleged errors constituted a misapprehension of the Commission’s functions or powers, etc. 
     
      
       
      Other Submissions 
       
      
    41 The claimants submit that any risk to safety had to be foreseeable. I reject the submission that a test of reasonable foreseeability should be introduced into each statutory obligation. Section 15(1) and s 16(1) are strict liability offences in the sense that a mental element is not part of the offence, whether expressed in terms of intention or negligence. I do not find any assistance in the cases relied upon by the claimants concerning actions in negligence by an employee against an employer.  
     
      
    42 The claimants also referred to the defence of honest and reasonable mistake of fact, which, if applicable could give rise to a jurisdictional issue. (See Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales (2006) 66 NSWLR 151 at [43] referring to R v Badger (1856) 6 EL & BL 138; 119 ER 816.) The significance of this “defence” or ground of exculpation, has recently been reaffirmed. (CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25 at [5]-[8], [35].) This “defence” was not relied upon before Walton J. Reference was made in the submissions before his Honour to the “defence”, but the claimants did not and, on my reading of the decision in the Industrial Relations Commission and on appeal to the Full Bench, could not suggest that the “defence” had anything to do with this case.  
     
      
    43 No fact was ever identified in the Industrial Court or in this Court which could serve to relevantly excuse any, let alone each, of the breaches established. Nor was the Court referred to any evidence about such a fact or of an honest and reasonable belief in it. The most the claimants could point to was that Mr Kirk could not believe that Mr Palmer acted as he did. However, as the extracts from Walton J’s judgment set out at [17]-[19] above indicate, the actual accident did not exhaust the range of failures constituting the contravention. The “defence” of honest and reasonable mistake has nothing to do with this case. 
     
      
    44 The claimants’ submissions concentrated to a substantial degree on the circumstances of the particular accident that occurred. They drew attention to the skill and experience of some of the persons on the farm, including the deceased, and to the extraordinarily foolhardy nature of the actual conduct. I do not find it necessary to consider this factual detail.  
     
      
    45 For present purposes it is sufficient to note that although the particular accident triggered the investigation, the charge and conviction were not confined by it. I have set out above at [19] Walton J’s findings in this respect. The claimants were convicted of creating a risk, not of causing an accident. The identification of the scope and nature of the risks went beyond the actual occurrence. 
     
      
    46 The claimants’ submissions, variously expressed, that the accident that occurred was unforeseeable or that all relevant persons could relevantly be relied upon, because they knew how to drive the vehicles or were not permitted to do so, are misconceived. In any event, they do not establish anything in the nature of a jurisdictional error within the Craig formulation. Indeed, in my opinion, these submissions confirm that the claimants are seeking to appeal from findings of fact. This Court has no such jurisdiction.  
     
      
    47 With respect to the claimants’ reliance on s 15(2)(d) and s 15(3), set out above, there was no attempt to articulate why this alleged error in interpreting the statute was jurisdictional in the Craig sense. In any event, s 15(2) expressly states that it does not limit the generality of s 15(1). It is not clear what are the full implications of the identification by s 15(3) of when “plant is not to be regarded as properly used”. However, the words “properly used” appear in s 15(2)(f)(ii) and it appears to me that that is probably the limit of their application. It has no relevance for this case. 
     
      
       
      Corporate Responsibility 
       
      
    48 The issue upon which the Full Bench gave leave to appeal, and dismissed the appeal, was (Kirk Group Holdings Pty Ltd v WorkCover Authority of New South Wales [2007] NSWIRComm 86; (2007) 164 IR 146 at [5]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Court [ie Walton J] dealt inappropriately with issues of corporate responsibility by failing to determine that the company had in fact fulfilled its duty through Mr Palmer who, rather than Mr Kirk, had been chosen by the company to fulfil the duty.” 
        
       
      
    49 With respect to this issue, the claimants’ written submissions in this Court state: 
     
      
       
        
        “[68] In relation to corporate responsibility, it is clear on the face of the judgment of the Full Court in the proceedings below that there has been a misunderstanding of the concept of corporate responsibility and non delegable duty. The approach may best be expressed by reference to the English case cited by the Court below [50]. The simple point taken by the claimant in the proceedings below was that there was no finding that the company had failed to fulfill its duty. Given that Mr Palmer had been directed by the Company to fulfill the company’s duty, any finding as to the failure of the company to fulfill that duty had to have regard to what Mr Palmer did, not to what Mr Kirk did. This has nothing to do with the ‘corporate mind’. It is a complete acceptance of the non delegable nature of the duty. The question is to what one’s attention must be directed in determining whether the duty has been fulfilled. For instance, if one was to ask whether the Company had filed a taxation return, one would not readily conclude that no return had been filed simply because Mr Kirk had not personally filed such a document. It remains the Company’s responsibility to file the return, but if the accountant files it in accordance with his instructions then the company has fulfilled its statutory duty.” 
        
       
      
    50 In oral submissions, the claimants contended that the company did in fact satisfy the duty through someone other than Mr Kirk, ie Mr Palmer. This was, in substance, a challenge to the finding by Walton J at [105] of his judgment set out at [17] above, that certain failures were occasioned by Mr Kirk “and therefore [by] the company”. The submission is that the company was not in breach if it did take the steps by some person. A finding that Mr Kirk did not take the steps does not establish that no one did so. 
     
      
    51 The claimants submit that Walton J did not address the issue of whether Mr Palmer did any of the matters found to have been required (T 19.15-26). The Full Bench, they further submit, failed to address the correct issue on the appeal by misunderstanding the claimants’ submission to it. 
     
      
    52 The claimants submit in the oral hearing before this Court: 
     
      
       
        
        “If Mr Palmer didn’t do them then we have no defence. What our complaint is, the court never attended on whether Mr Palmer did them or not. There’s no finding that Mr Palmer didn’t do any of this. There’s a finding that Mr Kirk didn’t do it. There’s a finding that Mr Kirk took no steps to ensure that Mr Palmer didn’t do it or did do it. But there’s no finding that Mr Palmer didn’t do it. There was evidence that Mr Palmer did do it. There was evidence that he discriminated in the use that employees have or that people had in their access to the ATV. But with some people he told them that they weren’t to leave the marked tracks. With others he didn’t. Mr McLeod the independent fencing contractor, he has been riding on his evidence motor bikes since primary school and he’s 55. He’s driven ATVs. He was allowed to take the vehicle off road.” 
        
       
      
    53 The most pertinent findings of Walton J in this regard were: 
     
      
       
        
        “[153] … Mr Kirk gave evidence that the Company had placed Mr Palmer ""in charge"" of the health and safety of employees and contractors on the Farm. It may well be that Mr Kirk was not in good health and that he placed enormous trust in his friend and employee, Mr Palmer. However, the duties imposed by ss 15 and 16 of the Act fall squarely on the Company. By purporting to delegate all responsibility for health and safety to Mr Palmer, the Company has neglected those duties. However, the Company's failure does not end there. Having delegated total responsibility, the Company took no steps to ensure that Mr Palmer had the necessary skills to conduct a risk assessment, to provide or arrange training, to instruct others in the safe use of the ATV or to supervise the use of the ATV. Further, the Company took no steps to ensure that Mr Palmer carried out his duties, particularly with respect to health and safety. Consequently, it had no effective control over use of the ATV prohibited or warned against by the Owner's Manual. 
        
       
       
        
        [154] The provision of the safety information contained in the Owner's Manual was fundamental to ensuring the health and safety of employees and contractors. The Company's duties under the Act required it to not only make the Owner's Manual available to all persons who used the ATV on the Farm, but also to actively promulgate the information in the Owner's Manual to ensure that it had been read, understood and applied. In my view, the Owner's Manual presented a clear and practicable means of conveying important safety information about the operation of the ATV. The Company failed entirely to take advantage of that means; indeed, Mr Kirk did not know of the existence of the Owner's Manual prior to Mr Palmer's accident. The Company took no steps to disseminate the information in the Owner's Manual to those who used the ATV on the Farm: it is plain on the evidence that no employee or contractor, other than Mr Palmer, had been given a copy of the Owner's Manual and Mr Palmer received it by dint of taking possession of the ATV, not due to any independent instruction by the Company to ensure that he read it and abided by its safety precepts.” 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “[156] The Company's obligations were not circumscribed by dissemination and promulgation of the Owner's Manual. The Company was required to assess the risks associated with the ATV in the actual conditions applying at the Farm and the manner in which it was used on the Farm. It was required, in my view, not only to give instructions as to the application of the Owner’s Manual at the Farm but to ensure that those instructions were consistent with the topographical and other conditions of the Farm and with the experience and capabilities of those employees who may drive the ATV. This was not done. Even the basic step, which may have been taken, to instruct employees to stay on roads (notwithstanding the labelling of this vehicle as an ""All Terrain Vehicle"" and references in the Owner's Manual to off-road use) was not taken by the Company. The fact that Mr Palmer gave such an instruction to two contractors is not evidence that he had the view that such an approach was generally applicable or that he enforced it as a general rule. In any event, the Company gave no such instruction to Mr Palmer or any other employee or contractor. Employees and contractors used it off-road. Nor were instructions given as to driving the ATV on slopes (of whatever gradient).” 
        
       
       
      and 
       
       
        
        “[158] The provision of training was a simple step available to the Company to protect the health and safety of persons in the workplace. The Owner's Manual specifically stated that ""[t]he risk of an accident is greatly increased if the operator does not know how to operate the ATV properly in different situations and on different types of terrain"" and prescribed a certified training course combined with regular practice to avoid this hazard. However, I have found, as a matter of fact, that none of the Company's employees or contractors were instructed or trained in relation to the use of the ATV beyond an initial demonstration of the basic functions of the vehicle. This was despite evidence of an organisation which offered training courses to ATV operators at the time the Company purchased the ATV, and at the time of Mr Palmer's accident. Importantly, the majority of that available ATV training was conducted at clients' sites, thereby addressing the specific risks likely to be faced by users of an ATV at the place of use. Although the extent and standard of training required by the Act will vary depending upon the nature of the work performed and the associated risks, there is no way that the perfunctory introduction to the ATV provided to employees and contractors (including Mr Palmer) could be said to have fully equipped them to safely perform work (including towing) with the ATV (see  
        Genner Constructions  
        at [58]).” 
        
       
      
    54 His Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[162] Secondly, the defendant's submission that ‘the evidence suggests that all foreseeable risks associated with the use of the ATV were the subject of appropriate risk management’ cannot be sustained in the light of these conclusions and my findings at [105], particularly (c) and (l): that Mr Kirk, and therefore the Company, did not conduct a risk assessment or request any other person to conduct a risk assessment regarding the use of the ATV on the Farm, and had no system in place to assess and determine whether or not employees or contractors of the Company were trained in the use of the ATV, or were using the ATV in a manner which was safe and without risk to health. To speak even more plainly, and noting that the question of reasonable foreseeability does not arise in the assessment of liability, there was clearly a foreseeable risk (spelt out in the Owner's Manual) that the ATV would overturn when driven off-road or when used to tow things and yet nothing was done to ameliorate these risks.” 
        
       
      
    55 No attempt was made to identify how the oversight or finding by Walton J could constitute relevant jurisdictional error. It is all plainly fact finding, which this Court has no jurisdiction to review. 
     
      
    56 Towards the end of oral submissions the claimants made reference to procedural fairness, in the context of challenging some of the findings of fact, particularly the finding that the company failed to ensure that Mr Palmer had the requisite skill to ensure safety. This was not articulated as a separate basis for jurisdictional error on the part of a court, as distinct from a tribunal. Even assuming that such is capable of constituting jurisdictional error on the part of a court, which it is not necessary to consider, it is sufficient to note that this finding was merely one of many identified failings and does not constitute a basis for intervention. 
     
      
    57 With respect to the decision of the Full Bench, the claimants submit that the Full Bench failed to deal with the submission which was based on the absence of any finding that Mr Palmer failed to take the relevant steps. The Court focussed only on whether Mr Kirk was the controlling mind of the company and concluded, incorrectly the claimants submit, that it was unnecessary to deal with their submission. 
     
      
    58 Indeed, the Full Bench said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[65] Walton J made certain findings, especially at [105] and [153], regarding the appellants’ failures to ensure the safety of employees and non-employees. Those findings were not challenged on the appeal except to the extent that it was contended his Honour failed to determine that the corporate appellant had in fact fulfilled its duty through Mr Palmer who, rather than Mr Kirk, had been chosen by the corporate appellant to fulfil the duty and that there were no findings that Mr Palmer, as the controlling mind of the company in respect of the farm operations, committed any breach of the Act. 
        
       
       
        
        [66] We have found there was no error on the part of Walton J in finding that Mr Kirk and not Mr Palmer was the directing mind of the corporate appellant. Accordingly, it is unnecessary to consider the appellants’ contention that Mr Palmer committed no breach.” 
        
       
      
    59 The claimants assert that the failure of the Full Bench to consider the submission was jurisdictional error. I can see no relevant jurisdictional error in accordance with the formulation in Craig set out at [23]. Indeed, no attempt was made to identify how the failure to deal with a specific submission constituted a misconception of its functions, etc. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    60 The summons should be dismissed with costs. 
     
      
    61 HODGSON JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Spigelman CJ and with his reasons. 
     
      
    62 It is arguable that the Full Bench did not address the question whether Walton J erred in failing to consider whether or not it was proved beyond reasonable doubt that the corporate claimant did not, by its employee Mr Palmer, take steps which materially reduced the relevant risks; but I agree with Spigelman CJ that this was not a jurisdictional error. 
     
      
    63 HANDLEY AJA: I agree with Spigelman CJ.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Price J. 3 PRICE J: The applicant Vartan Melikian seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by Sides DCJ (the sentencing Judge) in the District Court at Campbelltown on 2 February 2007. He had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge of knowingly take part in the supply of heroin between 25 and 27 October 2005 and adhered to his plea in the District Court. 
     
      
    4 The offence being contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 is punishable by 15 years imprisonment and/or a fine of 2000 penalty units. 
     
      
    5 A related offence of goods in custody contrary to s 527C(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 namely $350 had been included in a s 166 certificate.  
     
      
    6 The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years consisting of a non-parole period of three years and nine months commencing on 16 February 2006 and expiring on 15 November 2009 and a balance of term of one year and three months expiring on 15 February 2011. 
     
      
    7 The notice of appeal identifies the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when  
         
          
          comparing the sentence imposed upon him with the sentence imposed upon his co-offender, Jennar. 
          
         
        
       
      
     2. The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive.  
     
      
     The offence 
     
      
    8 A statement of facts was tendered without objection and may conveniently be summarised as follows:  
     
      
       
      In October 2005, police intercepted a number of telephone calls between the applicant and others relating to the supply of heroin. The applicant, who was in Newcastle, made arrangements over the telephone with a person known as Bobby to buy 28 grams of heroin for $5,600. The actual purchaser of the heroin was Ryker Jennar. The applicant travelled with Jennar to Sydney where he received the drug from Bobby. He then handed over the drugs to Jennar. Shortly afterwards, the applicant and Jennar were arrested. The drugs were found on Jennar and weighed 27.2 grams, fifteen and a half per cent of which was pure heroin. The street value of the heroin was estimated as being between $6,900 and $12,000. At the time of his arrest, the applicant had $350 in his possession which was part of his reward for his role in the supply. In addition, he was to receive some of the drugs for his own use. 
       
      
    9 The sentencing Judge was satisfied that the applicant in effect was a “facilitator or a conduit” so that the heroin could be purchased from Bobby on behalf of or by Jennar. The applicant was, his Honour found, “actively involved in the offence and not involved in one simple step in the process of supply” and was involved in drug trafficking to a significant degree.  
     
      
    10 The sentencing Judge said (ROS at 7): 
     
      
       
        
        “The quantity of drugs indicates that he was facilitating a wholesale drug deal and accordingly had no way of knowing who the ultimate users would be because he was only involved in the facilitation of the supply from the buyer to the seller at the wholesale level. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court does not accept that his criminality is at the bottom end of the range of offences covered by the particular provision. Drug trafficking is often undertaken using facilitators so that the buyers and the sellers can distance themselves from the illegal drugs in an attempt to avoid detection and being brought to justice. 
        
       
       
        
        The Court is satisfied that his criminality is very much greater than being described at the bottom of the range and that it cannot be described as minor.” 
        
       
      
    11 A twenty five per cent discount was allowed to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty. 
     
      
     Subjective circumstances  
     
      
    12 The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing Judge and a pre-sentence report was tendered. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was born in Iraq on 24 April 1961 and is the youngest of five siblings of Armenian background. His father was arrested in Iraq for political reasons and died shortly after his release from prison from suspected poisoning injested during his imprisonment. The applicant and his siblings escaped to Greece. Their mother stayed behind to sell the family home. Before she could do so, she was detained and the property confiscated. She remained in custody for three years before she was able to join the family in Greece. The applicant had attended school in Iraq until the age of fifteen.  
     
      
    14 The applicant, then 18-years old, his mother, a brother and a sister migrated to Australia in 1979. He was employed by his uncle and worked long hours. It was, the applicant said, his first girlfriend who introduced him to amphetamines. The relationship lasted five years. He started a relationship with another girl who was using cocaine and heroin. He first supplied heroin in 1989 to support his cocaine habit and served a prison sentence for supply. 
     
      
    15 The applicant was married in about 1999 and divorced in 2001. He maintains regular contact with his daughter from the marriage, who is in the care of her maternal grandmother. The applicant formed a new relationship in 2002 and a child of that relationship was born in 2006. 
     
      
    16 The applicant was shot through the right thigh in 1999 during an armed robbery when he was at work. The applicant said he then started using heroin. He was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder for which he ultimately received anti-depressant drugs to assist him to deal with that condition.  
     
      
    17 The applicant testified that he was 46-years old and was determined to change his ways. He knew he was causing great shame to his family and wished to be a better example for his 9-year old daughter. At the time of the offence, the applicant was 44-years old.  
     
      
    18 The author of the pre-sentence report opined that the applicant had a traumatic past which he had not been able to overcome. Instead he appeared to take refuge in the drug sub-culture with a succession of remissions and relapses and likewise expressed good intentions to remain drug free. He had good family support.  
     
      
    19 The sentencing Judge observed that the applicant had prior offences of a similar nature. In March 1992 he was sentenced for using a drug to commit an offence to a minimum term of imprisonment of 12 months with an additional term of four months. For an offence of supply of a prohibited drug sentence was deferred upon his entering into a recognisance to be of good behaviour for three years. Probation and Parole supervision was a condition of the recognisance. Two matters of possession of a prohibited drug were taken into account on a schedule. In September 1992, he was sentenced to a minimum term of imprisonment of two years and six months with an additional term of 10 months for an offence of supply of a prohibited drug. Two offences of possession of a prohibited drug were taken into account on a schedule. In 1996 he was fined for possession of a prohibited weapon. In July 2000 he was placed on a twelve month good behaviour bond for possession of a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    20 In July 2003 he was sentenced to imprisonment for three years and four months with a non-parole period of one year and three months for an offence of supply prohibited drugs on an ongoing basis. Matters taken into account on a Form 1 included supply of a small quantity of a prohibited drug. He was released to parole on 5 December 2003 and the sentence was not due to expire until 5 January 2006. The sentencing Judge noted that at the time of the commission of the offence he was on parole and found that to be an aggravating feature of the present offence.  
     
      
    21 The sentencing Judge found that “in all the circumstances, notwithstanding his evidence about his intentions concerning drugs in the future, it is difficult to be optimistic that he will remain drug free”. His Honour reached the view that if special circumstances were found “the non-parole period would fail to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence”. 
     
      
       
      Dealing with the appeal 
       
      
    22 Ground 1 of the appeal raises the issue of due proportion between the applicant’s sentence and the sentence imposed on Ryker Jennar, his co-offender. Whilst conceding that the different subjective circumstances of the applicant and Jennar required different sentences, Ms Cox for the applicant submitted that the sentence imposed on Jennar was markedly more lenient than those subjective circumstances would justify. She argued that the sentences reveal a marked disparity such that the different sentences imposed do not reflect a due proportion. 
     
      
    23 The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was commensurate with the significant differences in his circumstances at sentence and those of Jennar. This Court would not be satisfied that the sentence imposed upon the applicant could give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    24 Jennar was sentenced by Keleman DCJ on 21 August 2007 to a term of imprisonment of two years and six months consisting of a non-parole period of eighteen months and balance of term of twelve months. He had pleaded guilty to the charge of supplying a prohibited drug, namely, heroin contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. Two offences on a Form 1, namely a charge of possess prohibited drug (0.38 grams of methylamphetamine) and a charge of goods in custody, namely $976.05 were taken into account on sentence.  
     
      
    25 The facts upon which Jennar was sentenced were similar to the facts before the sentencing Judge. The offences on the Form 1 concerned items found on Jennar at the time of his arrest. The maximum penalty for the charge of supply was the same as for the offence of knowingly take part in the supply.  
     
      
    26 Keleman DCJ when sentencing Jennar expressly considered the principle of parity and referred to the terms of the sentence that had been imposed by the sentencing Judge upon the applicant, to the findings made of the applicant’s role in the offence and to his subjective features including his criminal history. Keleman DCJ found beyond reasonable doubt that the criminality in the role played by Jennar was broadly equivalent to that of the applicant and as a result of considerations of parity, Jennar would receive a sentence “that is less than would otherwise have been appropriate”.  
     
      
    27 There were proper grounds available in Jennar’s case for Keleman DCJ to have imposed a sentence upon him which was shorter than the applicant’s sentence.  
     
      
    28 Jennar had no prior criminal history whereas the applicant’s prior offending included two offences of supply of a prohibited drug and one offence of ongoing supply. At the time of the commission of the offence, Jennar was not on conditional liberty whereas the applicant was on parole for a similar offence which was an aggravating feature. Jennar was 20-years old whereas the applicant was 44-years old when the offence was committed. Jennar was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation whereas the sentencing Judge found that it was difficult to be optimistic that the applicant would remain drug free. Keleman DCJ found that Jennar’s plea represented “genuine remorse and contrition” whereas the sentencing Judge was only satisfied that there was “some contrition” indicated by the applicant’s plea and evidence.  
     
      
    29 Jennar’s age, first time in custody and anticipated benefit from an extended period of supervision to overcome his drug addiction were found to be special circumstances. The sentencing Judge did not find special circumstances in the case of the applicant.  
     
      
    30 Ms Cox argued that the applicant had come out somewhat harshly in the assessment by Keleman DCJ that the two offenders had played similar roles. She submitted that the role the applicant played was objectively less serious as it was Jennar who was the purchaser of the drugs and stood to make the real profit out of the transaction.  
     
      
    31 The sentencing Judge appropriately assessed the applicant’s degree of criminality by defining his role and the level of his actual participation in the criminal offending. His Honour found that the applicant was a facilitator so that heroin could be purchased for Jennar and that he was actively involved in the offence. He had not only made arrangements over the telephone for the purchase of the drug but had accompanied Jennar to Sydney where he had received the drug from Bobby and then handed it over to his co-offender. As his Honour observed in the passage I have quoted at paragraph 10 drug trafficking is often undertaken using facilitators so that buyers and sellers can distance themselves from the illegal drugs to escape detection. It is not to the point that the co-offender was the purchaser of the drugs and stood to profit more than the applicant. An important role of an intermediary, such as the applicant, is to satisfy other parties to a drug transaction that they are not the subject of a police undercover operation.  
     
      
    32 It is well recognised that the culpability of those who engage, at any level, in drug supply is significant and that deterrent sentences are necessary: R v Shi [2004] NSWCCA 135. There was no error in the assessment of equivalence in the role of the co-offenders by Keleman DCJ. 
     
      
    33 Ms Cox contended that so far as prospects of rehabilitation are concerned, the difference between the co-offender and the applicant related in effect to their ages. In my view, this submission has no merit. The applicant had exhibited in the past an inability to remain drug free over extended periods of time and at the time of the offence was on parole for a similar offence. The sentencing Judge’s finding that, notwithstanding the applicant’s evidence, it was difficult to be optimistic that he could remain drug free was plainly open to his Honour.  
     
      
    34 The issue of parity is not simply determined in the present case by the different subjective circumstances of the applicant and the co-offender. As was said by Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301: 
     
      
       
        
        “Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.”  
        
       
      
    35 A marked disproportion between the sentences imposed on co-offenders of a degree or a kind which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance is required before appellate intervention. A sentence, which is otherwise appropriate or within the permissible sentencing range, which offends that principle should be reduced: Postiglione at 301; R v Kollas & Mitchell [2002] NSWCCA 491 per Wood CJ at CL at [45]. This Court retains a discretion not to intervene where it is apparent that the sentence under comparison is unjustifiably lenient and that to do so would be to produce a sentence which is totally inappropriate to the objective criminality involved: Kollas & Mitchell at [45]; R v Kairouz [2005] NSWCCA 247 per Wood CJ at CL at [45]. 
     
      
    36 The undiscounted starting point of the applicant’s head sentence is six years and eight months. The undiscounted starting point of Jennar’s sentence is 36 months (round figures). The undiscounted starting point of the applicant’s sentence is 122 per cent (round figures) more than the starting point of his co-offender’s sentence. The differential of three years and eight months does more than adequately reflect, to my mind, the different subjective cases of the co-offenders. Whilst their subjective circumstances necessarily required significantly different sentences, the disproportion is such as gives rise, in my opinion, to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    37 As the applicant came to be sentenced first, the sentencing Judge was not required to consider the issue of parity. The issue of disproportion arises as a consequence of the sentence imposed by Keleman DCJ. Keleman DCJ recognised in his sentencing remarks that as a result of considerations of parity, Jennar was to receive a lesser sentence than otherwise would have been appropriate. It seems to me that whilst Jennar’s sentence might be regarded as being lenient, it is not unjustifiably so. The Crown does not complain about Jennar’s sentence. Notwithstanding that the sentence imposed on the applicant by the sentencing Judge was, in my view, appropriate and within the permissible sentencing range, (a topic which will be considered under Ground 2 of the appeal), this Court should intervene and reduce the applicant’s sentence. I am persuaded that a reasonable person looking at the circumstances of this case would regard the applicant’s grievance as justified: R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251.  
     
      
    38 Ground 1 of the appeal is established.  
     
      
    39 Ground 2 of the appeal is that the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive. In support of that contention, Ms Cox referred to statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission for the offences of both knowingly take part in supply of less than the commercial quantity of heroin and supply of less than the commercial quantity of the same prohibited drug. She submitted that the statistics for the offence of supply demonstrate that the applicant’s sentence was in the top 11 per cent of sentences imposed and the non-parole period fell into the top three per cent of non-parole periods. The statistics for knowingly take part in supply demonstrate, Ms Cox contended, that no person had actually received a sentence of five years. She argued that a relatively small amount of drugs of a low purity was involved and the offence of supply was of a low order in the range of offences under s 25(1).  
     
      
    40 Whilst the statistical material provides useful information about the range of sentences imposed, it must be remembered that the upper limit of the range of sentence is not provided by the Judicial Commission statistical information but by the maximum penalty which in this case is 15 years imprisonment: Thompson v R [2007] NSWCCA 299 per Hislop J at [24]. Moreover, each sentence depends on its own facts.  
     
      
    41 The sentencing Judge was entitled to have regard to the applicant’s record of repeat similar offending in giving more weight to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist: R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242, R v M.A.K R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [51]. Furthermore, the commission of an offence whilst on conditional liberty has long been regarded as a factor of aggravation requiring the passing of a deterrent sentence: see, for example, Regina v Fernando [2002] NSWCCA 28 at [40-42].  
     
      
    42 It is well established that the quantity of the drugs is not the sole or even the principal determinant for sentencing in relation to drug offences. As was pointed out by Wood CJ at CL in Regina v MacDonnell (2002) 128 A Crim R 44 at [33]: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is more important is the role of the offender, and the level of his or her participation in the offence; subject of course to the fact that, in relation to supply offences under State law, there is a gradation of seriousness reflected by an increase in penalty as the quantity of drug involved moves into those levels which answer the descriptions of a commercial quantity, or of a large commercial quantity.” 
        
       
      
    43 The sentencing Judge found that the quantity of drugs indicated that the applicant was facilitating a wholesale drug deal and that his criminality was very much greater than being described at the bottom of the range. These findings were open to his Honour. The quantity of heroin was more than five times the indictable quantity applicable to the prohibited drug and had a street value estimated as being between $6,900 and $12,000. 
     
      
    44 In all the circumstances of this case, I am unable to find that the sentence is manifestly excessive. Ground 2 of the appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    45 It is the sentence imposed upon Jennar which gives rise to the unjustifiable disproportion in this case. The Court, in my view, should form as required by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 an opinion that “some other sentence…is warranted in law and should have been passed” and proceed to re-sentence the applicant so as to provide equal justice to him.  
     
      
    46 In an affidavit sworn 6 June 2008 the applicant affirms that he has completed a self management and recovery training program and remains free of illicit drugs. The pre-sentence report before the sentencing Judge noted that the applicant had good family support. It seems that support has continued whilst he has been in custody.  
     
      
    47 I consider that the unjustifiable disproportion between the sentences may be removed by a reduction in the applicant’s head sentence and by the finding of special circumstances. An extension of the period on parole might assist the applicant to overcome his drug addiction. The proposed reduction in sentence will not produce a result which is inappropriate to the objective and subjective criminality involved in the offence.  
     
      
    48 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal be granted. 
      
     (ii) Quash the sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge. 
     
      
      (iii) Sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of three years to date from 16 February 2006 and expire on 15 February 2009 and a balance of term of one year and six months expiring on 15 August 2010.  
       
       
        
        The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 15 February 2009.

     Judgment 
      
    1 MCCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I will ask Fullerton J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 FULLERTON J: This is an application for leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on the applicant in the District Court on 2 October 2007. On 9 July 2007, he was found guilty of the offence of the supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 after trial. Since the Notice of Intention to Appeal was filed on 27 May 2008 the applicant seeks leave to file the notice out of time. Despite the absence of any evidence to explain the delay the Crown does not oppose leave being granted. In those circumstances I propose that leave be granted.  
     
      
    3 The offence of supply was constituted by the applicant’s possession of 17.8 grams of the drug ecstasy for supply on 2 September 2006 in accordance with the deeming provision in s 29(1) of the Act. At trial the applicant did not contest possession but sought to establish, on the probabilities, that his possession was otherwise than for supply in circumstances where he claimed to have been given the drugs to hold on behalf of another person on condition that he return the drugs to that person at some later but unspecified time. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was found in possession of the drugs (comprised of 64 ecstasy tablets) together with two mobile telephones as he was re-entering a nightclub. He claimed that he was re-entering the nightclub with the intention of returning the drugs to their owner having left a short time earlier because he was feeling unwell. Whilst his account of how he came to be in possession of the drugs was corroborated by two witnesses, in the sense that they saw him being handed the items by another person, it is not clear whether this was inside or outside the nightclub. In either event this was not determinative of the question that presented for the jury’s consideration.  
     
      
    5 Since the jury rejected the applicant’s account, his Honour proceeded to sentence on the basis that the drugs were in the applicant’s possession for the purposes of supply. I note that there was no evidence or any indicia of actual supply. The mobile telephones were relevantly untraceable. Nevertheless I am satisfied that the sentencing judge was entitled to sentence the applicant on the basis that he was a supplier of the drug ecstasy for profit. Whilst his Honour made no express finding about the applicant’s possession of the telephones, the open inference is that they were in his possession to advance or promote his commercial objectives.  
     
      
    6 On sentence the applicant did not resile from the position that he took at trial. He has not resiled from that position to date. 
     
      
    7 For sentencing purposes his Honour regarded the principle of deterrence (both personal and general) as having predominant weight in the sentencing exercise. In addition, he expressed no confidence that the applicant had any prospects of rehabilitation whilst ever he persisted in maintaining his innocence and, that after considering the question of special circumstances, his Honour was not satisfied that they were established.  
     
      
    8 In the result his Honour imposed a term of imprisonment of 2 years and, in accordance with the ratio provided for in s 44(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 his Honour fixed a non-parole period of 18 months with a balance of term of 6 months. Sentence was ordered to commence from the date of conviction.  
     
      
    9 The applicant submits that his Honour’s reasoning exposes both latent and patent errors, although, as is submitted, the identification of what is said to be patent errors are both separately and cumulatively linked to the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: An erroneous finding that it was “difficult to be confident of any prospect of rehabilitation” 
       
      
    10 The applicant did not give evidence on sentence however he gave evidence at his trial that he was aged 32 and, since arriving in Australia four years earlier from Vietnam he had obtained Australian citizenship. He had also secured a position of head chef at a Vietnamese restaurant in Cabramatta. Although he did not give the Probation and Parole officer permission to contact his employer, I note in the proceedings on sentence that the Crown did not put the state of his employment in contest. In addition, the applicant advised the Probation and Parole officer that he had commenced an English as a second language course five months before his arrest. Similarly, it was not in contest that prior to his incarceration the applicant was residing with his wife and children in a house owned by his sister at Green Valley. His mother was also resident with the family. He is one of nine children. It would appear that some of his siblings are resident in Vietnam but three siblings reside in Australia inclusive of his sister who owns the family house. It would appear he was a productive and supportive member of that household and otherwise had strong family support. There is no suggestion that the applicant was himself a user of illicit or prescribed substances. He has no relevant prior criminal record. Not unimportantly, there was no offending of any kind between the date of his arrest on 9 September 2006 and his conviction on 9 July 2007.  
     
      
    11 His Honour recited a summary of the applicant’s pre-offending work history and his filial circumstances but nevertheless found that it would be difficult to be confident of any prospects of rehabilitation where the applicant persisted in refusing to acknowledge any criminal responsibility for his possession of the drugs. Whilst it is true that in those circumstances the applicant was not entitled to any benefit in sentencing terms for remorse or contrition, in my view it does not necessarily follow that he did not qualify to be considered as a person who may have learned a salutary lesson from his offending such that on his release there would not be some measure of confidence that he would resume a law-abiding life and commit himself to financially supporting his wife and children in gainful and lawful employment. 
     
      
    12 In the Crown’s written submissions there is an appropriate concession that the applicant’s continued denial that he committed the offence does not equate to no prospects of rehabilitation. What the Crown does seek to emphasise, and correctly, is that since it is a factor that operates in mitigation of sentence the onus was on the applicant to satisfy his Honour that there were good prospects of rehabilitation as provided for in s 21A(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It would appear on a strict reading of his Honour’s sentencing remarks that he did not reject outright the prospect of the offender’s rehabilitation but rather, that in the circumstances, it was difficult for his Honour to be confident of that fact. It would also appear that his Honour has drawn that conclusion from the pre-sentence report which I note from the transcript of proceedings on sentence was acknowledged to be a brief report by reason of the inability on the part of the Probation and Parole officer to independently verify some of the information provided by the applicant. I note that the applicant provided the officer with his wife’s contact details however she had not returned the telephone calls placed by the Service. There may be any number of reasons why that was so, quite independent of any inference adverse to the applicant.  
     
      
    13 While the applicant’s work history and absence of any criminal history might generally be thought to be positive indicators of the prospects of rehabilitation, I am not satisfied that his Honour failed to give them any weight at all, but rather that in the circumstances he found it difficult to be confident of the prospect of rehabilitation. This was a finding open to him. In those circumstances I am not satisfied that error is disclosed as contended for on this ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Failure to give adequate and/or proper consideration to the applicant’s subjective circumstances 
       
      
    14 This ground of appeal is allied with the previous ground of appeal with the additional complaint that the sentence imposed reflects the fact that his Honour failed to give adequate and/or proper consideration to the applicant’s subjective circumstances, in particular his good work history since migrating to Australia, his family circumstances and the absence of any relevant criminal record, each of which it is submitted were deserving of weight and prominence in the sentencing discretion. It is clear that from the remarks on sentence that his Honour was concerned, and in my view rightly so, to emphasise the importance of deterring those who seek to either make a living from or augment their income by what his Honour described as “the easy money to be garnered from supplying ecstasy”, a drug which his Honour observed was readily available in city and suburban locales. His Honour expressed the view that a “meaningful price” must be paid by convicted drug suppliers in order to meet the community’s indignation at the impunity with which they appear to operate.  
     
      
    15 The issue is not whether his Honour gave undue weight to general or personal deterrence but whether he gave inadequate weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances in the imposition of sentence. It is clear that his Honour did not disregard the subjective circumstances. Rather it appears that his Honour was simply of the view that such circumstances as were established before him did not outweigh the need for the sentence to be appropriately measured against the objective gravity of the applicant’s offence. It is not unusual for an offender’s subjective circumstances to be given less weight in relation to offences of drug supply so as to give prominence to the principle of deterrence. Moreover, having regard to the maximum penalty of 15 years for the supply of prohibited drugs in trafficable quantities, a 2 year sentence is not outside the permissible range: see Ma and Pham v R [2007] NSWCCA 240 per Hulme J at [91]. Counsel on the appeal did not seek to argue to the contrary. Plainly enough it is not to the point that a lesser penalty may have been imposed, the question is whether his Honour’s discretion miscarried such as to result in a sentence that is manifestly excessive or unreasonable or plainly unjust. I am not persuaded that the sentence is of that kind or character.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to find and/or give proper consideration to whether special circumstances were established 
       
      
    16 In his Honour’s reasons for sentence he said “I considered the question of special circumstances and I do not believe that they exist”. His Honour gave no explanation for so finding. For my part, on the evidence, I regard the finding that special circumstances do not exist as manifestly untenable. His Honour’s finding is to be contrasted with a case when circumstances may have been capable of being accepted as special but where, in the discretion of the sentencing judge, no such finding should be made (see R v Phillips [2003] NSWCCA 373 at [16]). In those circumstances this Court may be reluctant to intervene. 
     
      
    17 I am satisfied that the applicant’s absence of any criminal antecedents, an established work history and, importantly, the fact that he did not come to fresh notice between the offence and trial, are such as should properly engender a real confidence in his ability to rebuild his life on release with the assistance of appropriate supervision and intervention. Importantly, in this case there can be no suggestion that those matters have been double-counted by reason of the fact that his Honour appears to have given no particular weight to rehabilitation although as I have found not in a way such as to constitute error (see R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [47]). I am satisfied that the statutory ratio can in this case be varied to result in the imposition of a non-parole period that appropriately reflects the criminality involved in the offence whilst providing for a longer parole period to facilitate this applicant’s readjustment to community life upon his release. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    18 The orders I propose are as follow: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to file the notice of appeal out of time be granted. 
         
         
        2. Leave to appeal be granted. 
         
         
        3. The sentence imposed by the sentencing judge be quashed. 
         
         
        4. In lieu thereof the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 12 months to date from 7 July 2007 and to expire on 10 July 2008 and a balance of term of 12 months to expire on 10 July 2009. 
         
         
        5. In accordance with s 50(1) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         a direction that the applicant be released to parole forthwith. 
        
       
      
    19 MCCLELLAN CJ AT CL: I agree. The court had the benefit of written submissions from Mr Neild of counsel but was further assisted by his ready concession, in the course of oral argument, that the fundamental attack which he sought to pursue was on the non-parole period, rather than the overall sentence. This court is a court burdened by a very heavy workload. It is always of real assistance to this court when counsel exercise their judgment and confine the argument so that we can more readily dispatch the business which we have to attend to. 20 JAMES J: I agree with the judgment of Fullerton J and I agree with the further remarks of the Chief Judge. 21 MCCLELLAN CJ AT CL: Accordingly, the orders of the court are as proposed by Fullerton J.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Upon arraignment, Peter John Coles (the accused) pleaded not guilty to two counts of an indictment charging him respectively that on 5 November 2006 he murdered Janice Eileen Coles and maliciously wounded Gary Dangerfield. An election by the accused and the consent of the prosecutor to trial without jury has been filed. Before arraignment, I determined that there was no need for an inquiry into the fitness of the accused for trial and I published reasons for that determination which may be regarded as incorporated herein. 
     
      
    2 The whole of the trial evidence was put before the Court by the consent tender of documentation. In fact there has been no disputed issue between the Crown and the accused and, as a matter of practicality, it is common ground that the evidence establishes the elements of both offences necessary to be proved by the Crown and further establishes what is necessary to be proved by the accused in order to result in special verdicts of not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
    3 Although the parties are not in contest over any matter, I am obliged to include in this judgment a reference to principles of law which are applied and findings of fact which are made: Criminal Procedure Act 1986, s 133(2); Fleming v The Queen (1998) 197 CLR 250. The obligation does not extend to publishing a judgment in the same form as the transcript of a charge to a jury: R v Winningham, unreported NSWCCA 10 May 1995. 
     
      
    4 I find these facts. The accused is the son of the deceased Janice Coles. For some years she lived in a flat at Dee Why which was shared by her and Gary Dangerfield. They occupied separate bedrooms. The accused was a tenant of the Housing Commission in a flat at Manly but in a violent outburst he extensively damaged it as well as injuring himself, particularly injuring his hands. He was admitted to hospital for treatment to his hands and, no doubt, for observation concerning his mental state. After discharge from hospital he came to reside with his mother and Mr Dangerfield at Dee Why. He stayed for about ten months and in late October 2006 he returned to his flat in Manly. 
     
      
    5 On Saturday 4 November the occupants of the Dee Why flat had retired. Mr Dangerfield had fallen asleep whilst watching television in his bedroom. At about 12.30 am on Sunday he was awakened when Mrs Coles came into his room and told him that she had been stabbed by the accused who had entered the flat. Mr Dangerfield took Mrs Coles to her room and observed her left upper arm had been slashed and was bleeding badly. He went to the kitchen to get a cloth. He noticed a knife which he did not recognize lying on the bench. He returned to the bedroom with a cloth and a mobile phone.  
     
      
    6 While he tended to her wound Mrs Coles tried unsuccessfully to contact the accused’s father. While this attempt was being made the accused entered the room, leaned across Mr Dangerfield and commenced stabbing his mother. Both of them shouted at him to stop but their cries had no effect. The accused was silent and Mr Dangerfield later described his appearance as “sort of like a robot, like he was in a trance, and his eyes looked glazed like he was in a trance”.  
     
      
    7 Mr Dangerfield tried to restrain him physically and in a struggle the accused made a deep cut into Mr Dangerfield’s nose which later required suturing. The accused, after stabbing Mr Dangerfield resumed stabbing his mother and Mr Dangerfield fled to seek help. 
     
      
    8 Janice Coles died as a result of the stab wounds which the accused perpetrated. I deduce from his actions that he intended to kill her. Making that deduction is fortified by what the accused later told police. I am also satisfied that it was the act of the accused which wounded Mr Dangerfield and that this act was accompanied by the requisite intention. 
     
      
    9 I turn to the issue of the accused’s mental illness at the time of these acts. I apply the onus of proof upon him to the standard of probability. Having said that I should record the agreement of counsel that there is a unanimity of psychiatric opinion which, if accepted, establishes that the accused at the time did not, through disease, disorder or disturbance of mind appreciate that his acts were wrong. Given that unanimity of opinion by experts in the field it would, I consider, be perverse to reject it and the stance by counsel is entirely appropriate.  
     
      
    10 After the stabbings the accused made his way back to his own flat where at 3.50 am police attended and arrested him. Later in the morning he was interviewed. He told police that he had taken a knife with him and travelled by bus from Manly to Dee Why. He entered his mother’s flat through the front door which he had found to be unlocked. In substance and in some detail he confirmed the actions which constituted the murder charged in the indictment. He said that he had stabbed his mother because he loved her. However, he said that he had just had “a wrestle” with Gary (Mr Dangerfield) because “he tried to stop me”.  
     
      
    11 As I commented in dealing with the question of fitness for trial of the accused, many of his responses did not appear rational but, in the light of his mental state, it would be futile to seek to gauge his statements against standards of rationality. 
     
      
    12 The accused has a long history of mental illness and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia as long ago as when he was aged 18 years. He is now 38. He has from time to time been admitted for psychiatric care. He has a regime of medication and he claimed to police when they interviewed him that he was taking what he was supposed to. 
     
      
    13 I am unable to determine whether that claim was true. Whatever the truth of this situation I am satisfied that there was a florid episode of the accused’s mental illness that was affecting him at the time of the stabbings. The reason for my reservation about his claim to have kept to his drug regime is derived from a report by Ms Mary Beth Allen, a GP Liaison and Clozapine Coordinator of the Northern Beaches Mental Health Service. She reported that she became involved with the accused and his mother from June 2005. She noted that the accused was “not interested” in being involved with the Mental Health Service and that his mother “supported this”.  
     
      
    14 Ms Allen became aware that the accused was reducing his prescribed Clozapine dose as his mother was attempting to improve his mental health by giving him “Goji” juice with other homeopathic treatments and diet. Ms Allen encountered difficulty in maintaining contact with the accused during the time he was living with his mother at Dee Why. Messages were left and calls not returned. Ms Allen formed the opinion that Mrs Coles believed that fostering her son’s spiritual and physical health through homeopathic treatment was far better than psychiatric treatment including adherence to the prescribed Clozapine dose.  
     
      
    15 A Dr Chan was associated with Ms Allen in attempting to supervise the accused. In September 2006 Dr Chan noted a change in his mental state but numerous attempts to have the accused attend for psychiatric assessment and review were unsuccessful. Some contact was made with Mrs Coles who expressed a lack of understanding as to why psychiatric assessment should take place as she felt her son was “doing fine”.  
     
      
    16 Nevertheless the accused was seen by Dr Chan and in fact he thought there was some improvement, in the sense that his presentations were not considered unusual, after the accused moved to his Manly flat. 
     
      
    17 The Mental Health Service was aware that the accused had a history of self harm and verbal aggression but they perceived no indication that he might harm his mother and why he attacked her remains a mystery buried in the thought processes of the accused’s disordered mind. 
     
      
    18 I have earlier adverted to the unanimity of psychiatric opinion concerning the condition of the accused at the time of the killing and wounding. This unanimity is demonstrable in some extracts from the various reports. Each practitioner is a well known and highly qualified forensic psychiatrist.  
     
      
    19 Dr Bruce Westmore first saw the accused on 19 April 2007 and he reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the time I prepared this report, I could find no obvious logical or rational explanation for his actions towards his mother. He talked about her becoming old and becoming increasingly interested in religion and he said, ‘She had to go’. 
        
       
       
        
        At a very superficial level he appears to have insight and understanding about the wrongness of his actions but his affect was completely incongruous to those verbal statements and that is what I think reflects his abnormal thought processes and ultimately his mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        I am of the view that on the balance of probability Mr Coles was suffering a disease of the mind (a schizophrenic illness) at the time he killed his mother. I believe his illness totally deprived him of his capacity to know or understand at a moral level that he should not have completed the act. I was not able to get from him a history, psychotic or otherwise, to explain why he may have killed his mother and the incongruity of his statements indicating he loved his mother but killed her because she had to go are noted. 
        
       
       
        
        The sudden impulsiveness and apparent unpredictability of the act obviously has prognostic implications regarding his future dangerousness and he will in my view require long term, perhaps indefinite, psychiatric care and supervision. He appears to have a chronic, perhaps treatment resistant, mental illness”. 
        
       
      
    20 Dr Olav Nielssen saw the accused on 31 May 2007. Both he and Dr Westmore saw the accused who was at the time being detained in Long Bay Prison Hospital. Dr Nielssen reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Coles reported hallucinations of voices warning him that he was in danger and that his mother was in some way involved. He has experienced hallucinations of voices during previous acute episodes of mental illness and reported hallucinations in the period after his reception to gaol. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe Mr Coles lethal assault on his mother was the direct result of acute symptoms of the mental illness schizophrenia, which is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. At the time of the assault he was affected by a defect of reason in the form of the persecutory belief that he was in danger and that his mother was somehow involved. Mr Coles capacity for logical thinking was grossly impaired to the extent that he was unable to reason with composure about the consequences of his actions or realise that his actions were morally wrong.” 
        
       
      
    21 Dr Stephen Allnutt saw the accused at the request of the Crown initially on 8 December 2007, and again on 22 May 2008. He noted that the accused had suffered from mental illness for a number of years and, following his second visit, he reported: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, at the material time that the alleged offence occurred, the defendant was suffering from a defect of reason as a consequence of a psychotic mental state active at the material time of the alleged offence. Psychosis is a mental illness that by its very nature is recognisable by the defects in the reasoning process that the disease process produces disabling an individual in his capacity to make rational interpretations of his environment or to be aware that he is in fact having difficulty in making rational interpretations of his environment so that at the material time that the alleged offence occurred, I believe the defendant suffered a defect of reason. 
        
       
       
        
        …. (and) 
        
       
       
        
        However, I am of the view that his disease of the mind did cause a defect of reason of a nature and severity to the extent that he was unable to know the nature and quality of his actions. The material provides strong evidence for a significant disorganisation in his thought processes complicated by delusional beliefs relating to his mother. He describes a belief that he needed to defend himself against her otherwise he was going to die, as well as holding the belief that his mother wanted to die. His description of his beliefs in this regard are difficult to follow which, in my view, are as a consequence of significant impairment in his capacity to reason about matters in regard to his mother at the material time and to reason about matters with regard to his intent to stab his mother at the material time; such that he would have been incapable of reasoning about the matter of wrongfulness with any degree of sense and composure”. 
        
       
      
    22 Had the proceeding been heard in a trial with jury, there is a statutory obligation to inform the jury of the legal and practical consequences of a special verdict and, in reaching my conclusions, I have borne those matters in mind. 
     
      
    23 Having considered the evidence therefore I find a special verdict on each count of the indictment of not guilty by reason of mental illness.  
     
      
    24 I note that no application is made for release from custody pursuant to the power vested by s 39 (2) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    25 Consequently I must order that the accused be detained. The statute provides that such detention should be “in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit” and I invite submissions from counsel as to the terms of the order which, when made, is to be notified to the Mental Health Tribunal by the Registrar of the Court.

      JUDGMENT - Subpoena issued by accused Jamal to New South Wales Crime Commission – Public interest immunity claim – Legitimate forensic purpose 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Two applications have been made involving claims for public interest immunity. They arise in connection with a subpoena issued by Mr Michael Doughty, solicitor, on behalf of one of the accused, Mohammed Omar Jamal. The subpoena is dated 1 April 2008 and is addressed to ""The Proper Officer, New South Wales Crime Commission"". The subpoena is very extensive. It is necessary, however, to set out only paragraphs 12 to 15 of the subpoena. They are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “12. All surveillance logs, records and/or running sheets where the accused's name is recorded for the period 8 July 2004-21 December 2005. 
        
       
       
        
        13. Copies of all warrants issued pursuant to Part 4 of the Listening Devices Act 1984 authorising the use of a listening device against any of the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) Mohammed Omar Jamal, 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield NSW, and/or motor vehicle registration number ULK 830 for the period 1 July 2004-21 December 2005; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) he said Auto King, Chemical Cleaning Solutions, Peter's Hardware, Padstow Station Hardware and Auto Equip for the period 1 August 2005-21 December 2005 and; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) Adam Houda for the period November 2005-December 2005.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        14. Copies of any search warrants issued pursuant to s 11 New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 authorising the search of premises at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield, NSW and/or motor vehicle registration number ULK 830.  
        
       
       
        
        15. Copies of all covert search warrants issued pursuant to Part 3 of the Terrorism (Police Powers) Act 2002 directed at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield, NSW and/or motor vehicle registration number ULK 830 for the period 1 January 2003-22 December 2005.” 
        
       
      
    2 As I have said, there are two public interest immunity claims. It will be necessary to deal with these separately. The first claim, the one which has taken the greater burden of the Court's time, relates to material that is said to have been captured by paragraphs 12 to 15 of the subpoena. Mr Singleton, who appears for the New South Wales Crime Commission, has explained that this somewhat oblique reference to those parts of the subpoena that capture the documents the subject of the first claim for public interest immunity arises because of a need for confidentiality in relation to identifying precisely which paragraph of the subpoena had, in fact, caught the relevant documents.  
     
      
    3 The open claim for immunity in respect of the subject documents is contained in Exhibit “A”, the affidavit of Deputy Commissioner Naguib Kaldas. Mr Kaldas exhibited the relevant documents to his affidavit and these have been admitted on a confidential basis as Exhibit “A1”. The full nature of the public interest immunity claim is detailed in a second affidavit by Mr Kaldas. This has been admitted on a confidential basis as Exhibit “A2”.  
     
      
    4 The second claim for public interest immunity arises in connection with four warrants issued pursuant to s 16 of the Listening Devices Act 1994. These were produced apparently on the basis that they fell within paragraph 13 of Mr Jamal's subpoena. The first two warrants were issued by her Honour Virginia Bell J on 22 March 2005. The remaining two warrants were issued by her Honour on 11 April 2005. The listening devices authorised the installation and use of certain devices in certain premises for various periods of time between 22 March and 1 May 2005. The copy warrants produced, however, have been redacted (or to use a more familiar English word, ""edited"") so as to eliminate the description of the actual listening device in each case, and to conceal the location of the premises where the device in each case was to be installed.  
     
      
    5 The second claim for public interest immunity relates only to the redacted material. There is no objection to the production of the copy warrants. They have been admitted as Exhibit 1. I should add that not only have the four warrants been produced in answer to the subpoena, it is also my understanding that, overall, a considerable body of other information or other documentation has been produced. The public interest immunity claims relate, however, only to the two categories I have identified.  
     
      
    6 I shall now identify the material in support of the second public interest immunity claim. Exhibit “C” is an open affidavit from Carlene York, the Assistant Commissioner of Police (Director, Forensic Services Group). Ms York provides evidence that no conversations were recorded as a result of the installation of the four warrants. For that reason, there is no transcript of any conversations as a result of the installation of the warrants. Public interest immunity has been claimed, however, over the redacted parts of the warrants on the basis that disclosure of the information so edited would reveal confidential police methodology. There is a second confidential affidavit (Exhibit “E”), which gives detailed reasons in support of the public interest immunity claim.  
     
      
    7 In view of the nature of the public interest immunity arguments, Mr Singleton very sensibly provided the Court, through the exhibits process, with the documents in respect of which production is sought to be denied. In some cases of public interest immunity, the very nature of the claim may make it undesirable that the Judge see the documents. There are, however, cases such as the present where it is helpful for the Court to be supplied with the documents in issue prior to the legal arguments taking place. 
     
      
       
      Principles to be applied 
       
      
    8 The claim for public interest immunity is to be determined by reference to well established common law principles. Those principles may be succinctly stated. Production will not be required of documents, although relevant and otherwise admissible, if it would be injurious to the public interest to disclose them: Sankey v Whitlam (1978) 142 CLR 1 at 38 per Gibbs CJ. Put another way, the relevant question is: 
     
      
       
        
        “...would the public interest be best served and least injured...by compelling or by refusing to compel disclosure to the Court of the information and of the documents sought by the subpoena?"" 
        
       
      
    9 (Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 453 per Brennan J.) 
     
      
    10 In both of these cases it was recognised that, when such an issue arises, the Court is required to consider two conflicting aspects of public interest, those being harm done by the production of the documents as against a consideration of the fair and efficient administration of justice: See Alister (at 412) per Gibbs CJ.  
     
      
    11 Public interest immunity is but one form of valid objection to production of documents pursuant to subpoena (Attorney-General v Stuart (1994) 34 NSWLR 667 at 672E; Alister v The Queen 404.) In an appropriate case the Court may take an informal ""peek"" at the documents without their being formally produced. (Conway v Rimmer (1968) AC 910 at 971, 979, 995; Attorney-General v Stuart at 672D. Indeed, in Alister's case, the High Court examined the documents for itself prior to deciding that they should not be produced.) 
     
      
    12 Public interest immunity is a doctrine of substantive law and represents a fundamental immunity (Jacobson v Rogers (1995) 182 CLR 572 at 588-589). It allows for the withholding of documents in a variety of circumstances where disclosure of the documents would harm the public interest. As indicated above, the balancing process requires that the public interest in confidentiality must be weighed against the public interest in disclosure.  
     
      
    13 There are a number of well-recognised categories of public interest immunity. However, the categories of public interest immunity are not closed and must alter from time to time, whether by restriction or by extension as social conditions and social legislation develop. (D v National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (1978) AC 171 at 230); see also Sankey v Whitlam at 39). Categories of public interest immunity include Cabinet documents and other State papers; documents the production of which would hinder or affect proper policing (Young v Quinn (1985) 4 FCR 483 at 494 and 495); documents the production of which would hinder ongoing police investigations (Young v Quinn; Marinovich v DPP & Anor (1987) 14 ALD per Foster J at 315; Beneficial Finance Corporation Limited v Commissioner of the AFP (1991) 52 A Crim R 423 per Wilcox J; Attorney-General v Stuart per Hunt CJ at CL at 680-681; and per Smart J at 690E); and, finally, there may be mentioned as a common category the protection of police informers (Cain v Glass (No 2) (1985) 3 NSWLR 230 at 233-234; Attorney-General v Stuart at 679G; R v Smith (1996) 86 A Crim R 308 at 311-312).  
     
      
    14 There are further categories of public interest beyond those I have set out above. These include aspects of national security, international affairs and interstate relations. They include information about police internal investigations; information obtained generally in confidence, and commercially sensitive information. There is no need for me to list the authorities in support of these and other categories not mentioned in this brief outline.  
     
      
    15 Where, however, a public interest immunity claim is raised in relation to documents called for by a subpoena, it is still necessary for the Court or tribunal hearing the claim to follow the three stage process spoken of in the various authorities to which I have referred. First, there is the ascertainment of the legitimate forensic purpose; secondly, there is the establishment of the claim of immunity; and finally, there is the third step in the process, namely the balancing exercise.  
     
      
    16 The term ""legitimate forensic purpose"", in relation to subpoenas, has two aspects, as Simpson J said in R v Saleam (No 2) (1999) NSWCCA 86 at (11)): 
     
      
       
        
        “Before access is granted, or an order to produce made, the applicant must (i) identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought; and (ii) establish that it is 'on the cards' that the documents will materially assist his case.""  
        
       
      
    17 See also R v Saleam (No 1) (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18(C); Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court v Tastan (1995) 75 A Crim R 498 at 504; Carroll v The Attorney-General (1994) 70 A Crim R 162 at 181-182; Attorney-General v Chidgey (2008) NSWCCA 65 at (64) (68 and 81 to 86).  
     
      
    18 As these authorities show, the onus falls on the subpoenaing party to establish that the subpoena has a legitimate forensic purpose. It is not sufficient to show that the material caught will simply include relevant documents. A statement of the legitimate forensic purpose must be precise and a fishing expedition can ""never be allowed"" (Alister at 414). A fishing expedition will include an endeavour to ascertain whether or not there is an issue that the subpoenaing party may be able to exploit, or to check whether or not some fact or facts exist (Attorney-General v Chidgey at (81 to 86)). In particular, it is not legitimate simply to subpoena documents if all the party is doing is trying to get hold of documents to see whether they may assist him in his case or to see whether he or she has a defence. (See my earlier decision R v Baladjam [No 28] at paras 41 and 60). 
     
      
    19 As to the second aspect of the identification of a legitimate forensic purpose, it is then necessary for the subpoenaing party to persuade the Court that the documents sought will assist in the achievement of that purpose. The expression ""on the cards"" comes from Gibbs CJ in Alister's case. In Attorney-General v Chidgey, the Court disapproved of a number of more recent statements of the test as expounded by individual judges both in New South Wales and elsewhere. The ""on the cards"" test is a relaxation of the test applicable in civil cases. It is a more appropriate test in criminal proceedings because it recognises that an accused person may be on trial for his or her liberty (Alister at 456; R v Saleam (No 1) at 17-18). Normally, where a subpoenaing party cannot establish that a subpoena under challenge was issued for a legitimate forensic purpose and, in criminal proceedings, that it is on the cards the documentation sought will materially assist his or her case, then the subpoena will not be regarded as valid and may be set aside (Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court v Tastan at 508).  
     
      
       
       
       
      Legitimate forensic purpose 
       
      
    20 Neither of the present claims for public interest immunity has attracted an application by Mr Singleton to set aside the subpoena. Nevertheless, both counsels' submissions recognise that it is necessary for Mr Scragg (who appears for Mr Jamal) to establish a legitimate forensic purpose. Mr Scragg's task has been made all the more difficult because he does not know which paragraph of paragraphs 12 to 15 of the subpoena capture the relevant documents. Nor, of course, does he know the nature of the documents.  
     
      
    21 Briefly summarised, Mr Scragg's submissions were these. Paragraph 12 seeks the production of surveillance records where the accused's name is recorded for the period of the conspiracy and up to the time of the accused's arrest. As to the period of the conspiracy, Mr Scragg pointed out that he has been served with a master surveillance summary running for some 499 pages. The surveillance evidence is a significant part of the Crown case and it is to be relied upon by the Crown to show the nature and extent of the association between his client and others of the accused. It is also designed to show his client's association with other persons who are not said to be conspirators, but who have a relevance to the conspiracy.  
     
      
    22 Against that background, Mr Scragg argued that the surveillance records for the period of the conspiracy would be likely to show occasions when his client was not associating with the persons named who were outside of the conspiracy but associated with it. They might also be likely to show an innocent level of association between his client and other of the alleged conspirators, for example, their attending together at purely social or religious events.  
     
      
    23 As to the period between 8 November 2005 and 21 December 2005, Mr Scragg wished to examine surveillance records as part of his client's case that ammunition found at his premises on 9 December 2005 may have been planted there by somebody else. In addition, Mr Scragg said there was a suggestion in the Crown case that his client had ""gone underground"" in the period before his arrest, and the surveillance records would be likely to show that this was not so.  
     
      
    24 Mr Scragg placed particular reliance on a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Taylor (2007) 169 A Crim R at 543.  
     
      
    25 Mr Scragg then addressed paragraph 13 of the subpoena. In relation to this paragraph (and indeed paragraphs 14 and 15) he repeated firstly his principal submission. In relation to the reference to Mr Houda in 13(iii), Mr Scragg said that the request contained in the subpoena had been narrowed, by agreement, down to one day, namely 9 December 2005. This was the day when Mr Houda is alleged to have had a particular conversation with one Detective Moroney. Mr Scragg had been told that there was nothing to produce, but he suggested that a clear purpose had been established for the request made in the subpoena in that regard. In other words, Mr Scragg was saying that he was seeking to find a listening device warrant that may have picked up the conversation between Mr Houda and the detective on 9 December 2005.  
     
      
    26 In relation to paragraph 14 of the subpoena, Mr Scragg sought to have produced any warrants issued under s 11 of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985 authorising the search of his client's premises or motor vehicle. Mr Scragg sought to establish a legitimate forensic purpose by arguing that the production of these warrants might be relevant to issues relating to material of an extremist kind said to have been found at his client's premises or on the computer at his house. Such issues might include how long material of that kind had been inside the premises, and who had access to the premises in the relevant period. These were, counsel submitted, all highly relevant issues in relation to the extremist material and other matters said to have been seized. They were also relevant to the question of the ammunition found on the premises and to the movements of the motor vehicle, particularly in September and October 2005. In other words, Mr Scragg seemed to be suggesting in his argument that the existence of other searches that took place of which his client may have been unaware would be important in the defence case. A similar argument was presented in relation to paragraph 15 of the subpoena.  
     
      
    27 In relation to the redacted material is the four warrants Exhibit 1. Mr Scragg has endeavoured to establish a legitimate forensic purpose so as to justify his being provided with the edited material. Mr Scragg disclaimed any desire to receive any information about the nature of the particular device used in the execution of the warrants. He sought, however, to be given access to the edited address or addresses. As I have noted earlier, Mr Scragg is of course significantly hampered by the fact that he does not know the address or addresses appearing in the warrants, whereas the Court possesses that information. Essentially, Mr Scragg's point was that, if the warrants were directed to his client's premises or to his client's motor vehicle, even if no product ensued, the evidence of the absence of such evidence might be relevant so as to cast an innocent light on his client's activities during the period of the warrants, namely, 22 March to 1 May 2005. Similarly, if the warrants relate to any of the businesses referred to in paragraphs 13(ii) of the subpoena, the absence of product would, for the same reason, be significant.  
     
      
       
      Submissions on behalf of the New South Wales Crime Commission 
       
      
    28 Mr Singleton submitted that, in accordance with the authorities I have referred to earlier, Mr Scragg had failed to demonstrate a legitimate forensic purpose. In reality, Mr Singleton argued, the submission on behalf of Mr Jamal sought to elicit whether or not there were documents in existence, or other information, which might be of assistance to Mr Scragg's client in the conduct of his defence. Such an endeavour, according to Mr Singleton, was classically a fishing expedition. The very width of the period specified, for example, in paragraph 12 (between 8 July 2004 and 21 December 2005) demonstrated that the subpoena, in its present terms, could not be said to be one that addressed a legitimate forensic purpose.  
     
      
    29 Similarly, Mr Singleton argued that the submissions in relation to paragraphs 13, 14 and 15 were tinged with the same poison. It was not appropriate, for example, to subpoena material simply to see who if anybody, may have turned up at a given shop or business over a period of approximately five months. Insofar as Mr Scragg's arguments have focused on search warrants (covert or otherwise) at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield, or in Jamal’s car, Mr Singleton submitted that it could not be suggested that it would be ""on the cards"" that the documents sought would show anything of assistance to the defence case. Search warrants would not show that, for example, a planting of ammunition had occurred at Jamal's home. Nor would such documentation say anything as to whether the accused expressed extremist views at any particular time or held documents that expressed such views. The warrants would not assist the accused in establishing the identity of persons with whom the accused was associating. The Crown case, in any event, is concerned with the accused’s level of association with the co-accused especially on social and religious occasions. The Crown intends to lead all evidence of this kind. 
     
      
    30 Mr Singleton accepted that his client had not sought to set aside the subpoena. Rather, it had produced a body of material pursuant to the relevant paragraphs. Counsel submitted that, notwithstanding that no application had been made to set aside the subpoena, the Court might simply determine that no legitimate forensic purpose had been established and, on that basis, order that production not be made without necessarily having to consider the public interest immunity claim. In other words, Mr Singleton submitted that a favourable finding in his direction in relation to the first step in the process identified by the authorities might itself, without more, lead to orders being made as sought by the Crime Commission. Finally, Mr Singleton submitted that Mr Scragg had not identified any legitimate forensic purpose for being given the redacted address or addresses appearing in the four warrants produced pursuant to paragraph 13 of the subpoena. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
       
      1.  
      Legitimate Forensic Purpose 
       
      
    31 I will deal firstly with the principal claim that has been argued, namely the issue of the production of the documents ""captured by paragraphs 12 to 15 of the subpoena"". Has Mr Scragg established a legitimate forensic purpose? In one sense, this is not an easy issue to resolve. The nature of the Crown case against Mr Jamal is entirely a circumstantial one. The circumstances are very detailed and multi-faceted. I examined some details of the Crown case against Mr Jamal in a bail application decision given in December 2007. I will not repeat the details in this decision. A reading of the bail decision will indicate, I consider, the general nature of the case against Mr Scragg's client. What is Jamal’s ""defence""? The accused, of course, carries no onus, but all I have been able to glean thus far is that the accused will deny that any of his actions, if they be his, were of a terrorist kind. This is a broad assertion and does not convey to me a particularly clear insight into the nature of the defence case.  
     
      
    32 I will mention in this decision but a few of the matters relied on in the Crown case statement concerning Mr Jamal. First, there is the allegation that on 28 September 2005, he and a co-accused, Hasan, attended Auto King, an automotive parts retailer in Punchbowl, and placed orders for sulphuric acid and distilled water. The accused, according to the Crown case, used a false name “Adam”, and provided a mobile telephone number which was connected in a false name. A false reason was given for the purchase. The Crown case is that this phone service was used by Mr Jamal on other occasions. Jamal also provided the shop with a second mobile telephone number, this also being a phone connected in a false name on that very day. (The Crown case is that Jamal attended Auto King on a number of other occasions in the following weeks and inquired about the order that had been placed). To return to 28 September 2005, the Crown case is that on this day Jamal also attended Chemical Cleaning Solutions, a commercial chemical supplier at Campsie, and made inquiries about the purchase of certain chemicals. An order was placed using the second false name mobile telephone service I mentioned earlier. This order was for methylated spirits, hydrochloric acid, citric acid and glycerine. The person placing the order, if it were Jamal, gave a false explanation for wanting to purchase the chemicals, according to the Crown case.  
     
      
    33 Some weeks later, Jamal is alleged to have attended Peter's Hardware at Greenacre. He produced a receipt that had been given to Hasan by an employee of that business on 28 September 2005. Hasan, on that earlier day, had ordered acetone in a false name, and had provided the same false telephone number Jamal had used on that same day. Jamal told the employee at Peter's Hardware that he had come to pick up the order, although it was never collected. Jamal gave a false name and referred to the same false name and telephone number. 
     
      
    34 On 13 October 2005, Jamal and another male, according to the Crown case, attended Auto King to pick up the distilled water and sulphuric acid that had been ordered on 28 September 2005. There was discussion with that employee, and eventually Jamal collected the distilled water from Auto King. It was loaded it into a white station wagon, TUD-473. (Later, in the early morning of 10 November 2005, distilled water containers, consistent with those collected on 28 September 2005, were found in a burnt out car. The Crown case is that this was the vehicle used by Hasan when he attempted to collect orders from a company called Padstow Hardware on 5 November 2005. There were other items found in the car showing a connection between the car and Jamal. A white station wagon TBD 473 was located outside the premises of a co-accused Moustafa Cheikho. Again, there were connections between this vehicle and Jamal.) 
     
      
    35 On 13 October 2005, after the visit to Auto King, the Crown case asserts that Jamal attended Autoquip to collect 200 litres of sulphuric acid although, in the event, it was never collected. On 5 November 2005 Hasan attended Padstow Station Hardware and collected chemicals from the store. He also inquired about sulphuric acid.  
     
      
    36 Searches were conducted at the applicant's premises in November and December 2005. Some of the items seized on one or other of these occasions included a mobile phone handset, including an IMEI number which was identified as 351263009624040. The Crown case is that this handset was used in conjunction with a number of telephones activated in false names. There was also a bum bag containing two boxes of 45 calibre ammunition; one box contained 50 rounds of ammunition, the other box contained 35 rounds of ammunition.  
     
      
    37 There were also located numerous print-outs from various web sites or printed texts from other sources, including an article in which the author sought to disabuse the reader in relation to misconceptions that it would be allowable to hand in Osama Bin Laden; a typewritten text ""Fighting for the cause of Allah (Jihad)""; excerpts from the Qur'an that support Jihad and ""The Islamic Ruling on defending Muslim land under attack"".  
     
      
    38 There was also material found on a computer in the premises. This included material of an instructional nature, including military documents relating to sniper training and weaponry; military documents relating to minefields and other military obstacles; a document entitled ""Appendix D Urban Areas; how to move; how to enter a building; how to use hand grenades; how to use fighting positions"". There was also a document entitled ""Appendix H; field expedient anti-armour devices, contents on how to make expedient devices, eg Molotov cocktails, Eagle fireball; Eagle cocktail and other explosive devices"".  
     
      
    39 The Crown case also relies on the association between Jamal and the other co-accused, and on the nature of the relationship between Jamal and an extremist cleric Benbrika. It also relies on the relationship between the accused and others who are not indicted as conspirators. 
     
      
    40 I have gone to some length to outline some features of the Crown case against Mr Jamal. I have done so simply to highlight the lack of precision in Mr Scragg's description of the legitimate forensic purpose for the material sought in paragraphs 12 to 15 of the subpoena. Paragraph 12 seeks all surveillance records for the entire period of the conspiracy and beyond. There is not the slightest focus on any particular matter in which, for example, a particular defence might arise. Similarly with paragraph 13, the time span for the warrants sought for Jamal's premises and/or motor car, cover a blanket period over the whole of the period of the alleged conspiracy and beyond. There is simply no focus on any particular date, occasion, event or occurrence. Paragraph 13(ii) seeks listening device warrants for five different businesses over a five month period. The documents sought in relation to Mr Houda and Detective Moroney relate, by contrast, to one day only. Finally, it might be observed that the search warrants sought to be produced in paragraphs 14 to 15 cover an extended period without any specificity at all, beyond naming the premises and the motor vehicle.  
     
      
    41 Mr Scragg sought to justify this approach by reliance on three authorities. The first was Taylor's case. In that case the applicant had been charged with offences relating to the manufacture of ecstasy. He had issued subpoenas to the Australian Crime Commission and others, but these were set aside by the trial judge. The subpoena had sought telephone intercept recordings in relation to a particular mobile phone number connected in the applicant's name. The trial judge had held that the subpoena was too broad and that no legitimate forensic purpose had been shown. There was, however, evidence that the Commission had intercepted over 300 calls, which had varying degrees of relevancy to the charges. They were said to have been intercepted in connection with a non-related investigation involving the applicant. The calls had been disclosed to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Crown proposed to rely upon about 110 of these calls. The forensic purpose identified by Mr Taylor's counsel was to contradict a specific pillar of the Crown case. This was that the applicant had been provided with the phone by other persons to be used specifically for the criminal enterprise. Mr Taylor wanted to contradict this by demonstrating, through an examination of all the intercepted calls, that the phone was used for a variety of legitimate purposes. It was also sought to identify exculpatory material in the calls whereby an innocent explanation might be provided for calls, which were otherwise apparently incriminating. This aspect of ""incrimination"" related, in part, to a code said to have been used during the calls for the purpose of the enterprise, but which the applicant would say in his defence bore their ordinary meaning, and had no sinister connotation whatsoever.  
     
      
    42 Hidden J (with whom James and Hislop JJ agreed) said that the trial judge's approach to the question of legitimate forensic purpose had been ""unduly restrictive"". First, it was unlikely that Mr Taylor would have been able to identify with any particularity the calls, which might have assisted his case, but, in any event, it was not incumbent upon him to do so. The nature of the issues raised, that is, whether the phone was used for legitimate purposes or for the purpose of the criminal enterprise, and whether conversations alleged to be incriminating might be explained innocently, were sufficient to warrant the production of all the calls in question. Hidden J referred to a decision of Allan J in State Drug Crime Commission v Chapman (1987) 12 NSWLR 447 where his Honour had made the point that, generally, in respect of phone tap records, it is common experience that it is necessary frequently to go beyond the particular telephone conversation being immediately considered ""in order to get their true flavour"".  
     
      
    43 Mr Scragg focused on this decision, and in particular the reference to Allan J's remarks in Chapman's case. Mr Scragg submitted that it would be necessary to look at all the surveillance records to get ""the true flavour"" of surveillance material relied on by the Crown. It is true that the Crown proposes to rely on a body of surveillance evidence and that this has some impact on the presentation of the case against Jamal. It is, by no means, the major point of the circumstantial case against Jamal. It is however, part of the case. It is also true that part of the surveillance evidence will be to show the association between Mr Jamal and the alleged co-conspirators. It will also (or may also) address his association with other persons. As I understand it, however, the focus of the Crown case paragraphs I have attempted to summarise above do not depend on surveillance of Jamal to any significant degree.  
     
      
    44 Be that as it may, Taylor's case seems to me to involve a very different situation from that which exists in the present proceedings. In that case, there was a precise issue identified, namely whether the telephone was being used by Mr Taylor solely for the purposes of the criminal enterprise. Secondly, there was the issue whether the reference to a code being used could be borne out or substantiated by the telephone calls not produced. Here there is no precise identification of what the accused will say at all about his own actions. Regrettably, I can only make an educated guess about the nature of the case for Mr Jamal, especially in the light of the Crown case features I have identified.  
     
      
    45 The second authority upon which Mr Scragg placed reliance was my own decision in R v Lodhi, 21 February 2006. In that case, a subpoena had been addressed to the authorities seeking warrants pursuant to which product was obtained in a period between May 2003 and April 2004. The warrants identified were those obtained upon information suggesting that they were required to investigate the suspected terrorist activities of Lodhi and one Willie Brigitte. The AFP and ASIO asked to be excused from producing the documents referred to in the subpoenas and argued that Mr Lodhi had not demonstrated a legitimate forensic purpose. The Crown case related to certain actions carried out by Mr Lodhi and, in particular, upon his association with Willie Brigitte, a known terrorist. There was no dispute that physical surveillance evidence existed in relation to both Lodhi and Brigitte. Indeed, portion of it was to be relied upon by the Crown during the trial. The accused's case was that he was not involved in any planning for a terrorist act and he was not a participant in any preparation for a terrorist act. Specifically, his case was that he had no ""illicit connection"" with Brigitte in the context of terrorism. Their association was an innocent one, based on providing hospitality for a stranger who had arrived in this country. I held that a legitimate forensic purpose had been established and I refused to strike out the relevant paragraph of each of the subpoenas.  
     
      
    46 It will be seen that, in Lodhi, the legitimate forensic purpose was the need for the defence to establish that the association between Brigitte and Lodhi was a completely innocent one. It was “on the cards” that, after nearly two years of investigating and collating evidence against both men, there would be, or at least it would be on the cards that there would be, a good deal of surveillance material. The defence wanted to demonstrate that, despite this significant degree of surveillance, very little, if anything, had been detected to show anything of a terrorist nature in the association between the two men.  
     
      
    47 Once again, that seems to me to be a rather different situation than the position argued by Mr Scragg in the present matter.  
     
      
    48 The final case upon which reliance was placed was Saleam (No 1). In that case, Mr Saleam had appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal against convictions for making a false and misleading statement with intent to obtain money, and for having either stolen or received stolen property. The particular issue related to a subpoena Saleam’s lawyers had issued for the purposes of the appeal. It was addressed to the Commissioner of Police and sought the production of every document relating to the investigation and prosecution of the offences with which the appellant and a co-accused had been charged, together with the reports of any investigation into allegations of perjury committed by the principal Crown witness in the committal proceedings and at trial. One of the issues before the Court of Criminal Appeal was whether the subpoena before it was too wide, and whether there was an absence of a legitimate forensic purpose. At 408 Hunt J said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The terms in which the subpoena was expressed was certainly very wide. The documents sought were, however, specified with some (if perhaps insufficient) particularity, in that in effect every document in the possession of the police had to be produced. The subpoena obviously could be complied with, and it was thus not oppressive, if sufficient time were given. It was nevertheless far too widely drawn and upon its face there could have been no legitimate forensic purpose in having produced many of those documents after the trial had taken place (if indeed there would have been any such purpose in having them produced before the trial):  
        Commissioner of Railways v Small  
        (1938) 38 SR (NSW) 564 at 573-575. The time of the Commissioner to complain about the width of the subpoena had, however, passed for he had in fact been able to produce the documents (the documents to which access was specifically objected fell within a clearly identified category, being the reports of the investigation into the allegations of perjury). 
        
       
       
        
        The width of the subpoena certainly on its face cast doubt upon the legitimacy of the forensic purpose for which the production was required. Again, on its face, the subpoena appeared to be no more than yet another manifestation of the currently fashionable employ of achieving, in effect, a one-sided (and impermissible) discovery against the police by having a call made upon such subpoena shortly before the trial.""  
        
       
      
    49 His Honour went on to state the well established test that it was necessary, in order to prevent a mere fishing expedition, for the Court to be satisfied that a legitimate forensic purpose had been demonstrated and that it was on the cards the documents would materially assist the accused in his or her defence.  
     
      
    50 At 409-410 his Honour also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I should, however, stress that nothing which I have said so far should be understood as intending to encourage the issue of subpoenas of this type, either before the trial or any other time. In the vast majority of cases in which they have been issued, the purpose of such subpoenas has been nakedly tactical in nature, in order to frustrate (by means largely irrelevant to the real merits) the speedy disposal of the trial. Trial judges should be vigilant to set aside such subpoenas which are oppressive and in refusing access to the documents produced, unless and until some legitimate forensic purpose is identified expressly.""  
        
       
      
    51 In the end, the Court granted access to the documents which had been produced. Mr Scragg relied upon the fact that access had been granted in that case, even though the call was for “every document relating to the investigation and prosecution of the offences” with which the appellant and his co-accused had been charged. I do not think that Mr Scragg can place very much reliance on Saleam's case. It was a case in which the argument related, despite the width of the subpoena, to a narrow class of documents, which had been produced, along with the whole file, to the Court of Criminal Appeal. It was a case where the principal argument related to access to the limited range of particular documents. The cautionary remarks of Hunt J are, in my opinion, of more value to the present argument than the terms of the order, which was made in the particular circumstances of the appeal.  
     
      
    52 My analysis thus far points fairly clearly to a predisposition to a holding that no legitimate forensic purpose has been established for the production of the documents said to have been captured by paragraphs 12 to 15 of the subpoena.  
     
      
    53 Before making a final decision in that regard, I shall turn to the documents which are the subject of the second claim. Here the issue is a narrow one. Four warrants have been produced and the public interest claim relates, for relevant purposes, only to the redaction of the address or addresses stated in the warrants. Mr Scragg submits that if the redacted addresses relate to his client's home, his client's car or any of the businesses named in paragraph 13(ii), then they may very well be relevant to his client's defence. Obviously, that is correct. The test, of course, is not one of relevance. What has to be done is to identify precisely, having regard to the issues in the trial, the purpose for which the documents are required and whether it is on the cards that the documents are likely to assist the defence case. Once again, I am left with a strong feeling that the real purpose of the call for the production of the redacted material is more in the nature of a fishing expedition than one arising from a genuine evaluation of the issues to be determined at trial. I rather suspect that Mr Scragg may have an optimistic view, not dissimilar to that of Wilkins Micawber in Charles Dickens' David Copperfield, in that he is, if not hourly, at least regularly ""expecting something to turn up"".  
     
      
    54 I think that I have made it fairly clear that I have some very serious reservations about the existence of a legitimate forensic purpose for the production of the documents in claim one and for the redacted material in claim two. I have, however, decided that I should not dispose of the matter on that basis. I will, despite my misgivings and uncertainty, conclude that it is possible that, notwithstanding the width of the subpoena, there may be a legitimate forensic purpose in relation to the documents and edited material. I do this for five reasons: first, Mr Singleton did not seek to set aside the subpoena. A considerable amount of material has been produced. Secondly, it may be that, with a degree of editing and more precision, the subpoena could be brought into a situation where it will throw up more precisely what it is that Mr Scragg hopes to achieve from the calls pursuant to the subpoena. This will, however, only entail a level of delay and postponement which I think is undesirable, especially having regard to the fact that the Court is now in its fifth month of dealing with preliminary applications. Thirdly, it may be that I have done less than justice to Mr Scragg's submissions, and it may be that I have not sufficiently comprehended the way in which he suggests the material would be useful to his client at trial. Fourthly, I suspect, as I said during argument, that Mr Scragg's client might well be left with a sense of grievance were the Court not to undertake an evaluation of the public interest claim and to carry out the balancing act that is thereby required. Because of the sensible way in which this application has been conducted, I know precisely the nature of the documents that have been produced. I know precisely the nature of the redacted material that is the subject of the second claim. But it is fairer, in the rather unusual circumstances of this application, that I should not leave either Mr Scragg or his client believing that there are documents capable of providing some type of assistance, powerful or otherwise, to the defence case, when in fact there may be none.  
     
      
    55 Finally, this is the first contested public interest immunity claim involving State interests. The decision may, I trust, provide guidance as to the approach to be taken in any later claims. (This is not, however, to suggest that an absence of legitimate forensic purpose will enable a subpoena to survive, especially where an application to strike it out has been made). 
     
      
    56 For those reasons, I propose to take the unusual course of simply stating that it may be possible that a legitimate forensic purpose has been established. If that be so, I am also entitled to assume that it is “on the cards” that material of the kind Mr Scragg hopes will turn up, may be or is available. In making these assumptions, I have put to one side my own knowledge as to the contents of the documents and material I have inspected.  
     
      
    57 I turn then to evaluate the public interest immunity claim, and to balance the competing considerations that need to be examined according to the authorities I have gathered together earlier in this decision. 
     
      
       
      2.  
      Public interest immunity/balancing exercise.  
       
      
    58 It will be recalled that the first public interest immunity claim seeks to avoid the production of documents said to have been captured by paragraphs 12 to 15 of the subpoena. It will also be recalled that Mr Singleton, with good reason, sought to avoid indicating which precise paragraph or paragraphs of those under discussion related to the captured material. The precise nature of the public interest immunity claim can be seen from particular paragraphs set out in the confidential affidavit of Naguib Kaldas (Exhibit “A2”). In particular, the nature of the claim emerges from paragraphs 6, 7, 9 and 10-18. Further reasons in support of the claim are to be found in paragraphs 19, 22 and 24. Material to support the observation that there is nothing in the captured material to support the defence case of Mr Jamal is plainly apparent from paragraph 20, and from other material as well.  
     
      
    59 I am satisfied that the claim for public interest immunity has been fully substantiated and that it relates to a well recognised category of public interest immunity. The reasons for the claim have been adequately spelled out and precisely identified. (R v Stig NSWCCA (unreported) 17 October 1996; BC 9604843). In my view, the claim is a strong one and the level of the need to keep the material confidential is very high. 
     
      
    60 This having been determined, it is then necessary to consider afresh the purpose for the issue of the relevant paragraphs of the subpoena. It is also necessary to balance the interests of the accused, and the fair and efficient administration of justice, against the harm that would be done by the production of the documents (Alister (at 412) per Gibbs CJ). In relation to the various matters advanced by Mr Scragg, I did suggest to counsel during argument that it might, as a practical matter, resolve the issue completely if I were to say that I had examined the material and that I was satisfied it simply had no application whatsoever to any of the matters identified by Mr Scragg. Mr Scragg was not entirely satisfied with this suggestion so far as it bore on the factual evaluation of the material captured by the subpoena. Nor, indeed, was he satisfied with the propriety of the legal proposition underlying my suggestion. In the latter regard, Mr Scragg referred me to a passage in Saleam (No 1) where Hunt J, at 409, had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If no public interest immunity or other privilege is claimed (and upheld), and if a legitimate forensic purpose for their production has been demonstrated the Judge should not withhold access to the documents simply on the basis that in his view that purpose would not be satisfied in that particular case because he can see nothing in the documents which will in fact assist the accused in his defence. Provided that a legitimate forensic purpose has been demonstrated, it should be for the accused (or, in appropriate cases, for his legal advisors only) to satisfy himself on that score after his own inspection of the documents.""  
        
       
      
    61 It may well be that Hunt J had in mind the practice in civil proceedings where a Judge had, historically, retained the right to refuse access to the subpoenaing party, until he was satisfied that the proceedings had reached a stage where the documents had become relevant to an issue actually appearing in the trial (see Waind v Hill & National Employers Mutual General Association (1978) 1 NSWLR 372 at 385B-E). In any event, however, Hunt J makes it clear that his comment is confined to a situation where no public interest immunity is either claimed or upheld. It is fair to say, in the present matter, that I have taken more than a ""peek"" at the captured documents, even though they have not been formally produced to the Court. Indeed, I have examined them very carefully. In a criminal trial, where the Judge is invited to inspect documents involving a claim for public interest immunity, it is his duty to give very careful consideration to the likely issues at trial and to determine, after a close inspection, whether there is any matter which may assist the accused. It is only when that has been done that the appropriate balancing exercise can be performed. In this role, as with many others involved in a criminal trial, the obligation on a Judge is to be impartial, even-handed and alert to matters that may prevent an injustice to the accused. The trial judge must take a liberal approach to an examination of the material to ensure that anything that may be of real assistance is brought into the balance.  
     
      
    62 Mr Scragg has done his best under difficult circumstances. I have the documents and he does not. I have the benefit of the confidential material in Exhibit “A2”. Mr Scragg does not. Making every allowance for the matters sought to be relied on by counsel, I can find absolutely nothing in the captured material that would be of the slightest assistance to the accused. In view of the high confidentiality of the reasons underlying the public interest immunity claim, it is my view that I should not record my detailed reasons for this finding, even in confidential form. Of course, if the parties were to insist that some record of reasons be made in this regard, I do not doubt that it could be done. But it is my firm view that the reasons for my conclusion appear immediately and convincingly from the documents themselves and the paragraphs of the confidential affidavit I have identified. Even giving full allowance for the scope of the legitimate forensic purpose identified in a number of ways by Mr Scragg, I consider the documents do not assist the accused in the slightest. They do not touch upon any of the forensic purposes identified by Mr Scragg in his submissions. The balancing exercise in these circumstances must fall heavily and unequivocally on the side of non-production. 
     
      
    63 In those circumstances, I conclude that the documents captured by paragraphs 12 to 15 of the subpoena should not be produced.  
     
      
    64 I turn finally to consider the four redacted warrants which were produced pursuant to paragraph 13 of Mr Jamal's subpoena. It will be recalled that Mr Scragg argued that it was on the cards that the address or addresses in the four warrants might well relate to his client's premises or to his motor vehicle. Alternatively it was on the cards that they might relate to one or more of the businesses referred to in paragraphs 13(ii). Once again, I have had the advantage of examining the un-redacted form of the warrants. Mr Scragg has not. In addition, I have the information contained in the confidential affidavit of Carlene Anne York (Exhibit “E”). This affidavit gives detail as to the ""location information"", namely, the address or addresses appearing in each of the four warrants. The claim against production related to material, that, if it were revealed, would disclose important aspects of police methodology. It is not possible to say more without breaching the confidentiality involved in the affidavit. The particular matters are dealt with in paragraphs 5 to 10. The need to keep the information confidential is at a reasonably high level.  
     
      
    65 Once again, I have given particular attention to the asserted legitimate forensic purpose identified by Mr Scragg in his submissions. This is a case where no product emerged from the use of the listening devices. The sole issue relied on by Mr Scragg went to the ""location information"" redacted from each of the warrants. I have endeavoured to make full allowance for the purposes identified by Mr Scragg in his submissions. I am satisfied that the production of un-redacted material in relation to the address or addresses shown in the warrants would not be of assistance to Mr Jamal's case, or to any of the purposes identified by Mr Scragg.  
     
      
    66 It is true, however, that the existence of the warrants, and the fact that no product exists as a consequence of the warrants might, whatever be the nature of the location information, provide some type of negative assistance to the defence case. I very much doubt that this is so, but, in carrying out the necessary balancing exercise, I will allow for that possibility. In my view, the balance still falls fairly and squarely on the side of not ordering the production of the redacted material.  
     
      
    67 The order I make is that the New South Wales Crime Commission be excused from any obligation to produce to this Court the documents contained in Exhibit “A1”, and that it be further excused from any obligation to produce to this Court the documents contained in Exhibit “C” in un-redacted form.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Michael Barbetta, was committed to this Court on 7 November 2007 for trial on a charge that he did on 11 March 2007 murder the deceased, David Smedley. On 7 December 2007 a trial date was fixed for 7 July 2008. On 2 May 2008 he was arraigned and pleaded guilty. He was remanded to 27 June 2008 for sentence and on that date came before me. 
     
      
    2 The Crown tended a folder of material including a document setting out the facts, a number of photographs and a copy of the recorded interview with the offender by police. Two victim impact statements were read to the Court. The offender gave evidence and some reports were tendered on his behalf. He was then remanded until today for sentence to be imposed. 
     
      
    3 The facts can be briefly stated and are not in dispute. The deceased was aged 65 years and suffered from Parkinson’s disease. The offender later described him to police as a very fragile man. He lived by himself in a unit. On 11 March another resident of the unit block, Kenneth Hodge, found the body of the deceased and contacted police. The deceased was dressed in pyjamas lying on the floor of the lounge room. He had blunt force injuries to his head. There was a bucket near him in which was bloody water and a cloth was located on the deceased’s shoulder. The lounge room appeared to have been ransacked with items broken and scattered about. The bedroom was in a similar state with the contents of drawers and cupboards turned out. One of the walls of the bedroom had been smeared with a tomato. Broken pieces of the deceased’s dentures were scattered around the floor of the bathroom. Police investigators located the fingerprints of the offender in various places throughout the unit. 
     
      
    4 Mr Hodge informed police that he had last seen the deceased at about 8 pm the night before when Mr Hodge left the unit to return to his own residence after he had been drinking with the deceased. He said that the next day he saw the offender walking in the stairwell near the deceased’s unit and had been informed by him of the death of the deceased. He and the offender had gone to the deceased’s unit from where Mr Hodge had called police. 
     
      
    5 Police attended the offender’s residence. The offender told them that he had gone to the deceased’s unit to check on his welfare as his girlfriend and the deceased had been in an altercation the previous evening. Police located in the offender’s shoe a leagues club card in the name of the deceased and a Commonwealth Bank card in the name of an acquaintance of the deceased. The offender told police he had been given these by the deceased a week earlier. 
     
      
    6 The offender was taken to Wollongong Police Station where it was noticed that he had redness and swelling to his knuckles. He told police that these were injuries he sustained while changing a bike chain. The offender was interviewed but denied any involvement in the death of the deceased. Police then released him. 
     
      
    7 An autopsy of the deceased found significant bruising to various parts of his body. He suffered fractures of the hyoid bone, two ribs, the nasal bone and the right maxilla. A set of house keys were located in his throat. The cause of death was the combined effects of blunt force head injury, suffocation and neck compression.  
     
      
    8 On 12 March the offender was walking with an acquaintance, Kenneth Sledge, when the offender told him that he killed “the bastard” because he called his father and grandmother a wog. However he said that the deceased believed the offender was not a wog because he was born here. 
     
      
    9 The police installed a listening device in the offender’s unit and on 17 March overheard a conversation in which the offender said that he had been in the deceased’s unit where he argued with him because the deceased called his parents “wogs”. He said that he had grabbed the deceased by the nose and twisted it. He claimed the deceased was still alive when he left the unit. 
     
      
    10 The offender was then arrested and interviewed by police. Many of the answers he gave are long and rambling. The offender seems to have been obsessed with what he believed to be the deceased’s racial prejudice and the use of the term “wog”. He admitted that he had an argument with the deceased about the use of this term. He said that the deceased called his parents wogs and that caused his blood to boil. He warned the deceased that if he dared call his mother a wog again he would snap his neck. He then left the deceased’s unit. 
     
      
    11 The offender told police that later the deceased came to his unit after midnight and invited him to go with him to his place so they could talk about things. He said that he went with the deceased but he started to talk about wogs again and threw a punch at the offender. The offender threatened the deceased that if he did not stop he would hit him. The deceased did not stop and so he carried out his threat. He twisted his nose and he fell to the floor. He then struck him once and left the unit. He said that the deceased was alive when he left the unit and he had told the deceased that he never wanted to see him again. He said that he later returned to the flat and found the deceased dead. 
     
      
    12 The offender admitted to stealing the credit card from the deceased and ransacking the unit to make it appear that he had been murdered. He initially denied placing the keys in the deceased’s throat but later, after the formal interview had been completed, he admitted to having done this. 
     
      
    13 It is clear that the offender became enraged with the deceased because of what he saw as his racial prejudice and it seems that the offender was particularly sensitive about it. He complains that he was teased by children at school and called a wog. He found other reasons to dislike the deceased because of what he saw as insulting or unfair behaviour directed toward him. I think that there had been a smouldering resentment of the deceased building up in the offender for some time. In evidence before me he accepted that he went to the deceased’s premises having used illegal drugs and intending to have it out with him. Violence was inevitable and the offender killed the deceased in uncontrollable rage. 
     
      
    14 The offender is aged 44. He has a criminal record dating from 1977 for offences of dishonesty and violence. He received short gaol sentences in 1994 and 1995. Since that time he has had little criminal record and nothing of relevance to the sentencing of him for this offence. He has had no convictions since 2001. His criminal record is of little significance in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon him. There is in my view nothing in his early background of any relevance. 
     
      
    15 The offender has seen a psychiatrist, Dr Davies, at various times since 1988 mainly because of his persistent abuse of both legal and illegal drugs. He has been diagnosed as suffering a drug-induced psychosis and at times has been prescribed anti-psychotic medication. It seems that whenever the offender was having difficulties with drug usage or psychotic symptoms he would seek help from Dr Davies. He would be warned to avoid illegal drugs and prescribed more or different anti-psychotic medication. He would sometimes be referred to a mental health team. The offender would often complain to Dr Davies about behaviour of other people such as someone holding a gun to his head, his brother attempting to blackmail him into becoming involved in the drug trade, or the presence of a paedophile in the area. Dr Davies last saw the offender in March 2007 when he appeared to be coping well and the doctor saw no signs of psychosis or drug usage. 
     
      
    16 There are bizarre aspects to some of the answers the offender gave the police who interviewed him about the killing of the deceased. However there is no suggestion that the offender was suffering from any psychotic thoughts or hallucinations at the time of the killing. While in custody he has been receiving anti-psychotic medication and methadone. He has complained of auditory and visual hallucinations. Dr Olav Nielssen prepared two reports on the offender for the purpose of considering whether there was material indicating that the offender might have had a defence of substantial impairment but he found none. He thought that the offender’s behaviour was due in part to his being intoxicated by a combination of benzodiazepines and amphetamine. Dr Nielssen diagnosed the offender as having a severe substance abuse disorder. He notes that the offender has sought drug rehabilitation on a number of occasions but without success. 
     
      
    17 There is also in evidence a report of a psychologist. Tests indicated that the offender has a mild intellectual disability. However Dr Nielssen thought that the offender performed above this level of functioning and suggested that the low scores may have been attributable to the medication that the offender has been taking while in custody. Although there are some unusual aspects of his answers to police, it seems that he is quite capable of complex thoughts and his appearance before me in the witness box did not bear out the psychologist’s findings. In any event whatever mental disability he might suffer seems to have nothing to do either with the commission of the offence or with the sentence that is to be imposed upon him. Mr Haesler SC, who appeared for the offender, accepted that he did not fall into the category of mentally handicapped offender for whom general deterrence is inappropriate. 
     
      
    18 The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period prescribed of imprisonment for 20 years. Although it may be viewed as offensive to the friends or relatives of the deceased, this Court is required to consider where this murder falls in the range of murders that come before the Court in order to determine where it stands in relation to an offence falling within the mid range of seriousness. In determining that issue the Court can have no regard to the loss occasioned by the death of the deceased. The Court cannot try to put a value on individual human lives or what the loss of that life means to loved ones of the deceased or the community in general. That is not the purpose of victim impact statements. Nor is it the purpose of punishment. Under the law all lives are precious and the death of any person is a harm inflicted on the community in general. 
     
      
    19 The Crown has conceded that this is an offence falling below mid range in seriousness. That concession is an appropriate one. However it is not far below that level. It was a violent attack on a fragile man in his own home by a much younger and stronger person. No doubt the use of drugs made the offender more volatile and less inhibited. This is not a case however where the offender knew that the use of drugs made him more violent so that his drug usage is not an aggravating factor. But under the influence of drugs he went to the deceased’s premises to have it out with him and, as I have already noted, violence was inevitably going to occur. Apparently no weapon was used but nonetheless there was a very considerable degree of violence inflicted upon the deceased including an attempt at strangulation. It may be that in his rage he did not form the intention to kill but clearly the offender intended to inflict very serious harm upon the deceased and I see little mitigation in the circumstances of this case arising from a lack of an intent to kill. There was a degree of provocation perceived by the offender by what he viewed as racial taunts directed toward his parents. I have already noted that, although the offender has some history of violence, it was many years ago and the offence should be treated as out of character. 
     
      
    20 The offender pleaded guilty after his committal for trial and after a trial date had been set. It was submitted that he should receive the maximum discount because he pleaded guilty to murder and because the plea was justifiably delayed pending a report from a psychiatrist as to whether he had a defence. I reject that submission. In my opinion the size of the discount does not depend upon the offence to which the offender is pleading guilty. The utilitarian value of a plea does not vary with the seriousness of the offence. A person who pleads guilty to murder is not entitled to any more leniency because of the plea than a person who pleads guilty to shoplifting. Nor in my opinion is the reason for the delay of the plea a relevant matter. If the plea is delayed it is of less utilitarian value than an early plea regardless of the reason for the delay. I understand that in R v Apps [2006] NSWCCA 290 the sentencing judge gave the full discount in a similar situation, but with respect I do not understand that to be a proper approach. Otherwise a person who has a valid reason for not pleading guilty before the day of the trial still gets the full discount. I will discount the sentence by 20 per cent. 
     
      
    21 I accept that the offender is now remorseful. He wrote a letter from the gaol to a person not knowing that it was going to fall into the hands of the prosecutor. In it he expresses his sorrow for what happened. He also gave evidence before me and expressed his remorse. I accept it is genuine although somewhat late in coming. There was little remorse evident in the conversations he had shortly after the killing. 
     
      
    22 It is difficult to make any assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. It will depend upon his attitude to drugs when he is eventually released. He has made numerous attempts in the past that have all failed. But at least he voluntarily sought assistance from Dr Davies and others. Dr Nielssen believes that the offender could gradually withdraw from medication while in custody. He also believes that the offender has insight and is capable of fully addressing his substance abuse. 
     
      
    23 I have already noted that victim impact statements were read to the Court from the deceased’s daughter and his sisters. I am conscious of the effect that the death has had upon them. I understand that it must be particularly painful when the death of a loved one occurs through unjustified and undeserved violence. However, while I can express the Court’s sympathy to the deceased’s family, the law does not allow me to use the effect of the death upon them to increase the sentence that is to be imposed upon the offender. I acknowledge that no sentence the Court can impose will redress their loss or vindicate his death. 
     
      
    24 The offender has been in custody since 17 March last year. Much of that time he has spent on protection apparently because of some assistance he gave to the gaol authorities. By reason of his status he has reduced access to some of the facilities available to other prisoners. It may be that at some stage, after he is sentenced, he will find himself in a prison for protected inmates where he will have the normal gaol facilities and programmes. But it is a matter I take into account although it is not of great significance. I do not believe that whatever intellectual impairment he has or his physical problems mean that he will generally find it harder to cope with prison than any other person of his age and background. 
     
      
    25 I take into account as part of the explanation for the offence that he had used drugs as a result of his abuse disorder and this perhaps made him less inhibited so far as his aggression is concerned. His tendency to psychosis when using drugs may have increased his level of violence. However, I do not believe that this is a case where either general deterrence or specific deterrence is irrelevant. 
     
      
    26 It may be the case that had the offender been sentenced for some less serious offence there might have been reasons to find special circumstances. But it seems to me that the parole period that will result from the statutory relationship will give him adequate time for supervision and assistance and many of the relevant factors I have already taken into account in reducing the overall sentence. The total sentence I would have imposed before discount for the plea of guilty would have been 23 years. 
     
      
    27 The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 13 years 9 months and a balance of term of 4 years 10 months. The sentence is to date from 17 March 2007 and the non-parole period is to expire on 16 December 2020, the date upon which the offender will be eligible to be considered for release to parole. The whole of the sentence expires on 16 October 2025.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 5 May 2008, the Crown presented an indictment charging the offender, Ian David Kennedy, with the murder of Hassan Youssef. The homicide was alleged to have been committed on 29 June 2006. The cause of death was the combined effects of blunt force injuries to the head of the deceased and multiple stab wounds to his upper back. 2 On arraignment the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter. By his plea he acknowledged responsibility for the death of the deceased. The Crown did not accept the plea of guilty to manslaughter in discharge of the indictment and the matter proceeded to trial. It was not in issue that the offender struck the deceased to the head and stabbed him in the back and that, in combination, these injuries resulted in the death of the deceased. The single issue in the trial was whether the Crown could establish that in so doing he had either an intention to kill or an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    3 At trial the Crown did not contest the fact that at the time the fatal wounds were inflicted the offender was heavily intoxicated by the combined effects of drugs and alcohol. The Crown submitted however that notwithstanding the effects of intoxication he had the capacity to form, and did in fact form, the relevant intent to support a conviction for murder.  
     
      
    4 On 16 May 2008, the jury returned a verdict of guilty to manslaughter. The offender’s reduced culpability for the death of the deceased, by reason of the combined effects of drugs and alcohol, is reflected in the jury’s verdict. The maximum penalty for this offence is 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 Having regard to the manner in which the trial was conducted, it was common ground between the parties on sentence that the offender should be sentenced on the basis that his unlawful and dangerous act, constituted by the assault and wounding of the deceased, caused his death in circumstances where, due to a combination of the offender’s level of intoxication and by virtue of pre-existing brain damage, he did not form the intent to kill or cause grievous bodily harm.6 Associate Professor Starmer, a pharmacologist, gave evidence at trial of the likely effects of intoxication upon the offender’s mental and emotional functioning at the time of the offence. There was also uncontradicted evidence from Dr Lowe, a consultant neurologist and opthalmic surgeon, that at the time of the killing the offender suffered from an undiagnosed organic brain disorder. This was said to be the probable outcome of the sustained use of intoxicants over many years, and was also said to have impacted adversely on his capacity to form an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm. Dr Lowe’s evidence was corroborated by psychometric and neuropsychological testing. I will return to consider this evidence for sentencing purposes in due course.  
     
      
    Relevant Facts 7 I am satisfied on the evidence led at trial that both the offender and the deceased were regular users of illegal drugs including cannabis and amphetamine-based drugs and, in the case of the offender, that he had been a regular user of illegal drugs of various kinds for many years. He was 40 years old at the time of the offence.  
     
      
    8 I am also satisfied that both the offender and the deceased consumed alcohol as a component of their polydrug use and abuse on a regular basis. For his part, the offender was also taking methadone to address a longstanding heroin addiction which appears to have been in remission at the relevant time. His use of other illegal drugs and alcohol whilst a participant in a methadone program serves to emphasise the chronic state of his addiction. 
     
      
    The relationship between the deceased and the offender  
     
      
    9 As at 29 June 2006, the deceased was a tenant of a two-bedroom Housing Department unit at 59/314 George Street Waterloo. He was a recipient of social security payments. He was aged 56 years at the time of death. About three months before the date of the offence, the offender took up occupation of a spare bedroom in the deceased’s unit. He was working as a carpet layer at this time, albeit only sporadically as a result of his drug and alcohol addiction. He was also in receipt of social security payments.  
     
      
    10 Aside from occasional and relatively minor domestic issues there was no observed or reported animosity between the deceased and the offender. They were in fact seen amiably enough in each other’s company by a neighbour within hours of the fatal assault. This evidence is not unimportant since it is interposed between the time when the offender left the company of fellow drinkers at a local hotel and purchased and used the drug ice, and when he rejoined them and became embroiled in a fight that led him back to the unit where he had the fatal confrontation with the deceased. 11 The Crown did not posit any motive for the killing. It was common ground that the assault that resulted in the deceased’s death was triggered by a trivial dispute over where the offender’s television should be accommodated in the unit. I am satisfied that his insistence that the television be housed in the offender’s room not only resulted in the offender physically attacking the deceased but that the offender did so in an irrational and wholly unbridled manner. The extent to which his reaction to the deceased’s request, or even his demand of him, is explained by the effects of drugs and alcohol was the subject of extensive analysis by the expert witnesses at trial. 
     
      
    The day of the offence12 I am satisfied that on 29 June 2006, the day the deceased was killed, that both men had consumed alcohol and illegal drugs, although in different quantities and not consistently in one another’s company.  
     
      
    13 By his own admission (as corroborated by witnesses called in the Crown case) the offender started to drink beer at about 6.30 am in a local hotel, a day when social security payments were apparently directly credited to his bank account permitting him access to funds that he was able to expend at will as a recipient of social security. He was, on any view, well affected by alcohol by early afternoon. The offender estimated he had consumed between 10 and 15 schooners of beer. While his account of the amount of alcohol he consumed before the fatal confrontation with the deceased has varied in the history he has supplied to a number of expert witnesses for the purpose of the preparation of reports of various kinds, the fact that he was heavily intoxicated at a time proximate to the likely time of the deceased’s death is corroborated by two independent witnesses.14 According to the offender’s account to police, during the course of the afternoon, and at a time when he was already subject to the effects of alcohol, he returned to the unit where he gave the deceased a small amount of the 100 milligrams of the amphetamine-based drug “ice” he had recently purchased. The offender said he consumed the rest by injection. The toxicology report obtained as part of the autopsy procedure confirmed the presence of alcohol, a high concentration of morphine, cannabis and a range of other pharmaceutical drugs in the deceased’s blood at the time of death. There were also a number of syringes and other drug-taking paraphernalia found by police at the deceased’s unit.  
     
      
    15 Associate Professor Starmer gave evidence of the likely effects of intoxication on the offender by his having consumed a cocktail of alcohol and ice. He explained that alcohol fluidises membranes in the central nervous system and allows a range of hormonal interchanges to occur. Dependent upon the amount of alcohol consumed, the period of time over which it is consumed and the lean body mass of the person, alcohol will be productive of varying degrees of drunkenness. In the case of this offender, Associate Professor Starmer estimated that the concentration of alcohol in his blood at the time of the killing fell within the range of 0.19 and 0.36, depending upon whether he had consumed 10 or 15 schooners of beer and dependent upon his body weight being 70 or 80 kilos. The professor confirmed what is perhaps obvious, namely that aggression and violence are frequently associated with alcohol use and abuse. He also gave evidence as to the effects of crystallised methylamphetamine (“ice”) which he says is a particularly pure and potent form of the drug methylamphetamine. He said that that drug mimics the action of the natural hormones raw adrenaline and dopamine, the latter effecting body movement. He said people using the drug can react more violently to a set of circumstances where, were they completely drug-free, they may not have reacted at all.  
     
      
    16 Associate Professor Starmer spoke of the way in which a person using both drugs and alcohol to excess can build a tolerance to the drugs. It would appear from the amount of alcohol that the offender consumed preceding the assault, namely something in the order of 10 to 15 schooners of beer, and something in the order of 100 milligrams of methylamphetamine, that he had a high tolerance to both drugs. Associate Professor Starmer also confirmed that alcohol is a central nervous system depressant and methylamphetamine is a central nervous system stimulant and that when the two are combined they may interact with each other such that the person may appear less intoxicated by alcohol than the amount of alcohol actually consumed.  
     
      
    The police investigation   
     
      
    17 The investigation into the homicide commenced on 21 July 2006 as a result of Ms Amber Cordez reporting to police that the offender had confided in her the previous day that he had killed the deceased some weeks earlier. At this time the police were unaware of any homicide or possible homicide. There was no report of the deceased as a missing person. (I also note that within what must have been a very short time after the deceased’s death, the offender telephoned a woman in whose company he had been earlier in the day and told her that he had killed a man and needed somebody to talk to. She did not, however, take the call seriously and did not go to the police because in her words she “thought he was talking rubbish” and that he was just trying to attract her attention).  
     
      
    18 On 26 July 2006, 27 days after the death of the deceased, police gained entry to the deceased’s unit. The deceased’s body was located slumped over a chair in one of the bedrooms, wrapped in a doona which was in turn tied with masking tape. 19 On 28 July 2006, the offender was arrested, interviewed and charged with murder. He gave police a detailed account of the events of the day leading up to and including the deceased’s death. The account was however was infected by confusion and some internal contradiction. He also gave a detailed account of his movements thereafter and of his state of disbelief at times of relative sobriety at having killed his friend. He told of his horror at the realisation of what he had done when he returned to the unit over successive weeks and was confronted with the progressively decomposing body of the deceased. He told Dr Allnutt that he did not stay in the unit during this time but slept in a garage at the rear of the units.20 I am satisfied that it was the offender’s compromised capacity to recall with clarity both the events that culminated in the fatal assault and the sequence in which the injuries were inflicted, as distinct from any attempt on his part to conceal what he did or to avoid responsibility for his actions, as the explanation for the inconsistency between his version of events to police on arrest and the results revealed on autopsy (to which I will refer shortly).  
     
      
    21 It is important to emphasise that I am also satisfied that despite the offender’s inability to explain the timing or order of some of the events leading up to and including the assault on the deceased, and despite the incongruities between his account of the how the injuries were inflicted and the forensic evidence, there was no attempt on his part to minimise his actions or to create a scenario where the deceased bore any responsibility for the assault. To the contrary. I consider that the course and content of the interview which extended over many hours demonstrated a concerted effort on his part to give a candid and comprehensive account of his conduct (as he was able to recall it), including the confronting details of his attempts to deal with the deceased’s decomposing body over the course of many weeks, and his ultimate decision to wrap and tie the body to prevent the spillage of body tissue and fluids. I accept that his conduct at the time of the killing, including the way in which he dealt with the body, reflected a disordered state of mind and not a morbid or perverse fascination with the crime or the crime scene. I accept that the offender was genuinely struggling with how to deal with the consequences of his actions. I accept that he was unable to deal in any responsible way with the body of the deceased. He is not to be punished for this since it does not, in the particular circumstances of this case, aggravate the objective criminality constituted by the killing. He told police that he had vague thoughts of trying to get rid of the body somehow but he could not do it. He said that he was just waiting to “get caught”. 
     
      
    22 I am also satisfied that the detail provided by the offender in the record of interview reflected a disarming degree of acceptance of criminal responsibility for the death of the deceased. This, in addition to his preparedness to plead guilty to manslaughter in 2007, and again on the first day of the trial, is entirely consistent with genuine remorse and contrition. I propose to give this appropriate weight in the calculation of sentence together with some additional allowance for the fact that despite having confessed to Ms Cordez that he had killed the deceased (a confession which he delivered in a floridly agitated state), without his full and frank admissions, the police investigation would have been hampered and the case against him not as overwhelming as it proved to be. 
     
      
    The forensic evidence23 Upon autopsy, Dr Duflou, confirmed that the body of the deceased was in a state of advanced decomposition. Despite the obvious limitations that this imposed, extensive fractures to the skull, the cheekbone and the mandible were revealed. Dr Duflou also reported a fracture of the hyoid bone, multiple fractures to ribs and three stab wounds on the deceased’s upper back. The wounds measured approximately 8cm, 5cm and the third slightly less than 5cm. One of the wounds penetrated the deceased’s lung, albeit only slightly. 24 It was Dr Duflou’s opinion that the deceased was killed by a combination of blunt force trauma to the head and stab wounds. He was of the certain view that none of the injuries in isolation would have been fatal.  
     
      
    25 It was also Dr Duflou’s view that the extensive fracturing to the skull, which passed in a single fracture line across the back of the head ending at the left temple, was sustained in an area where the skull had been previously opened surgically and had since healed. He accepted that the surgery to the skull rendered that area of the deceased’s anatomy more vulnerable to trauma. Dr Duflou also gave evidence that the fracturing of the mandible was associated with extensive bruising to the soft tissues of both the face and skull in that region. The fractures to the ribs were in a line.  
     
      
    26 Essentially, in Dr Duflou’s view, the complex of injuries to the skull were likely to have been sustained as a result of a large, heavy, flat and featureless object (like a television) being applied under force to the head. The fracture to the hyoid bone was also likely to have been sustained as a result of direct trauma with a large heavy object as there was no indication of strangulation or a similar mechanism. However, Dr Duflou favoured the probabilities that the head was on a hard surface like the ground at the time the injuries were sustained. He did not regard any of the injuries to the skull or the ribs as having been sustained by the deceased falling. He was firmly of the view that it was unlikely that any of the fractures, or any extension of the fractures, were sustained post-mortem.  
     
      
    27 In short, while he did not regard the injuries as consistent with the deceased being upright and having a television thrown at him, he did regard it as possible for a single blow to the head to have caused the spread of injuries he observed in the region of the head. The rib fractures being on both sides of the body were also consistent with the deceased being on the ground at the time force was applied to the chest region and that this was likely to have been a separate episode of trauma. So far as the stab wounds were concerned, he considered that they were likely to have been applied with moderate force. He noted that the knife did not penetrate the bony structure of the back to any extent.  
     
      
    28 Although the offender claims deficits in his memory of the night, he claimed to remember that at one stage he picked up the television and threw it at the deceased and that the deceased fell to the ground. The offender said that the deceased then got up and that it was only then that he lunged at him with a knife and stabbed him.29 The scientific officers who attended the unit located many areas of blood staining throughout the living area and in the bedroom where the deceased’s body was found. They also located the knife used to inflict the stab wounds and the damaged television set. This evidence, whilst serving to locate in general terms the site of the stabbing and the assault with the television, did not advance the Crown case at trial as to the order in which the injuries were inflicted or the precise mechanism and the degree of force that was used. 
     
      
    30 I am satisfied that the offender’s account of the attack is unreliable and unacceptable since it is in large measure inconsistent with the forensic evidence. While I do not consider that he has deliberately set out to deceive police or minimise his responsibility for the deceased’s death, the fact remains that the spread and severity of the injuries that were revealed on autopsy, and the spread and pattern of blood in the unit, were consistent with a brutal and unprovoked attack. I accept however that the objective gravity of the offence is diminished by the fact that there was no entrenched animosity between the two men and that the fatality is largely, if not wholly, due to the offender’s state of intoxication and his diminished ability to control an outburst of aggression, as distinct from his conduct being the result of deliberation. The jury verdict is consistent with that view. The fact that within a very short time of arriving at the unit where the confrontation with the deceased erupted into violence, the offender was involved in another physical altercation with a man he was drinking with fortifies my conclusion that the offender was exhibiting recognised hallmarks of alcohol-fuelled aggression, likely to have been exacerbated by his having injected ice. 
     
      
    The expert evidence  
     
      
    31 Associate Professor Reid, who gave evidence at trial, is a professor of neuropsychology at the Prince of Wales Medical Research Unit. He performed a neuropsychological assessment of the offender. Importantly, he was provided with a PET scan of the offender’s brain prepared by Dr Lowe, a neurologist, and interpreted by a specialist radiologist, Dr Choong. The scan confirmed organic brain damage. He was also provided with a copy of a report from Associate Professor Starmer, to whom I have already made reference, and the results of psychometric testing undertaken by Mr Diamond. Additionally, he was provided with reports from two psychiatrists, Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore.  
     
      
    32 The purpose of the neuropsychological assessment was to examine the offender’s cognitive function in order to determine whether he suffered from any impairment of the brain consistent with the neurologist’s findings of brain damage. Associate Professor Reid came to the view that the offender was a man of average intellectual ability and that, despite the organic brain damage, there was no significant impairment of his intellectual functions. The specific deficits revealed on neuropsychological assessment were in the areas of memory and cognition. It was the professor’s view that the abnormalities were permanent when the offender’s current functioning was compared with his pre-morbid intellectual ability. While Associate Professor Reid was unable to find any objective evidence of poor impulse control, he noted that the offender’s descent into serious drug and alcohol abuse from an early age was, from a behavioural perspective as distinct from the test data, at least partly explained by volitional defects. 
     
      
    33 Dr Lowe, a consultant neurologist, considered the results of the testing undertaken by Mr Diamond and Associate Professor Reid and regarded the test results as consistent with the abnormalities in the brain revealed on the PET scan. In Dr Lowe’s view, the abnormalities were related to impulse control. He described this as the degree to which inhibition and disinhibition co-relate. He regarded the likely behavioural display reflected in the offender’s conduct on the day of the killing as not uncommon in a person after 20 years of alcohol and drug abuse. He regarded the organic brain damage and the associated tendency to disinhibition as likely to be accentuated by the effects of alcohol and other drugs. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…if you have an underlying basis of that you just have to add alcohol and drugs on top of that and that would obviously trigger or accentuate any underlying change..” 
        
       
      
    34 Dr Lowe was also of the view that in a state of disinhibition, a person’s capacity to appreciate and rationalise surrounding events is compromised. He offered the opinion that this was a dominant factor in the circumstances leading up to, and immediately proximate to, the death of the deceased. 
     
      
    35 Dr Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist, was called by the Crown at trial. He was provided with Dr Lowe’s report and a report by Dr Westmore, a colleague. Dr Allnutt was of the view that the offender’s drug-taking prior to, and at the time of the offence, would likely impact on his mood and was likely to mask anxiety and depressive symptoms, although in Dr Allnutt’s view these symptoms were relatively mild. 
     
      
    36 For sentencing purposes, the importance of Dr Allnutt’s evidence is that in his view alcohol was the most significant factor that was operating on the offender at the relevant time. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “... alcohol is a very well known disinhibitor, a well known disinhibitor. It’s well known to reduce people’s capacity to control their behaviour. It is correlated with increased risk of aggressive behaviour and there is also a risk of blackouts when intoxicated.” 
        
       
      
    37 Dr Allnutt did not regard the multiplicity of injuries of the deceased as indicating anything as to the offender’s state of mind at the relevant time. He deferred to Dr Lowe’s expertise with respect to the diagnosis of brain damage and accepted that the effects of intoxication were likely to exacerbate any of the cognitive problems that may present from that condition. He also agreed that, in the given circumstances, the underlying brain disorder could further act as a disinhibitor. He confirmed the content of Dr Westmore’s report to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “As a psychiatrist, however, I can state that individuals who suffer brain damage, individuals who were affected by drugs and alcohol and individuals who are highly aroused may all experience alteration in their levels of intent when they act in certain ways. Mr Kennedy was affected by all those factors, I believe, at the time of the homicide.” 
        
       
      
    38 In short, in Dr Allnutt’s view, the most significant factor in the offender’s behaviour at the time of the homicide was intoxication. 
     
      
    An assessment of the offender’s mental state and degree of intoxication for sentencing purposes  
     
      
    39 Given the precipitating history of sustained polydrug abuse over many years, the significant quantities of alcohol and ice the offender consumed on the day of the offence and the expert evidence to which I have just referred, I can come to no other conclusion but that the offender assaulted and killed the deceased in an altered mental state which impacted upon his judgment and capacity to control his impulses and to a lesser degree his cognitive capacity by reason of brain damage. 40 In R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255, Spigelman CJ reviewed the authorities bearing upon the interrelation between impaired mental capacity and criminal responsibility. In this connection he cited the observation of Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 at [254]:-  
     
      
       
        
        “… the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is less in control of his or her cognitive faculties or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which, although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility, does justify special consideration upon sentencing.” 
        
       
      
    41 In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [187], the Court of Criminal Appeal stated,  
     
      
       
        
        “Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said ‘objectively’ to affect the ‘seriousness’ of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation … mental state (for example intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, insofar as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected … such facts can be classified as circumstances of the offence and not merely circumstances of the offender that might go to the appropriate level of punishment …” 
         
        
       
      
    42 In the present case, however, there is a confluence of drug and alcohol addiction and related brain damage which, in my view, is not productive of the same considerations as those to which his Honour the Chief Justice refers. That is not to say that the offender’s brain damage is rendered irrelevant. Dr Lowe’s evidence is supportive of there having been some degree of causality between the underlying condition and the loss of self control. That said, I am satisfied that the overwhelming explanation for the assault was the offender’s self-induced intoxication.  
     
      
    43 In summary, while the offender’s intoxication is relevant to an assessment of the extent to which his actions were the product of deliberation (and in this case I am satisfied that there was no premeditation of any kind) his drug and alcohol use over an extended period of years, to the extent that it culminated in such a loss of control as to result in the loss of life, is not such as should elevate considerations of leniency above those which dictate the imposition of a sentence that reflects appropriate measures of punishment and retribution. An unbroken line of authority in this Court when sentences for manslaughter or murder are imposed or under review emphasises that the taking of human life is regarded by judges, as it is by the community, as a matter that calls for salutary judgment and denunciation.  
     
      
    44 It is also well recognised that while reference to decisions where sentences for manslaughter have been imposed assists in providing a frame of reference, much depends upon the particular features of each case (R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; 160 A Crim R 1 at [189]-[190]). Given the acknowledged difficulty of establishing a sentencing pattern, comparisons between cases where the legal and factual basis for the manslaughter are similar are likely to be the most useful. 
     
      
    45 I have been assisted in that regard by a schedule of cases prepared by Mr Siva, counsel who appeared at trial and on sentence, with a brief summary of the facts and the salient features of each offender. It is not necessary to refer to them all save as to say that the case of R v Hamshere [2005] NSWSC 1319 has similarities to the present case. A matter of important distinction however is the fact that in Hamshere the fatality was the result of a single stab wound delivered in the course of a drunken fight between friends that escalated out of control whereas, in the present case, I am satisfied that the attack was unprovoked and involved sustained and separate acts of violence in circumstances where it would appear that the deceased was relatively defenceless. In addition, Hamshere pleaded guilty at the first opportunity (a plea that was obviously accepted by the Crown) and received a 25 per cent discount. Those differences aside, the sentence imposed in that case – namely a non-parole period of 3 years against a term of 5 years – in the context of a range of sentences extending upwards from that point does provide some frame of reference for the imposition of sentence in the present case. Criminal record 
     
      
    46 The offender is a 42 year old man. His criminal record showed a number of property offences commencing in 1979 when he was about 13 years of age, a period shortly after his parents separated. No offending was recorded between the periods of 1989 to 1993 and 1997 to 2002. Since 2002, the offender has been convicted of minor drug offences, a malicious damage offence and a shoplifting offence. The only prior offence involving violence was that of an assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 1996 which resulted in him being sentenced to a community service order. The offender has only served one period of custody being 6 months imprisonment which commenced on 25 September 1996. 
     
      
    47 In the circumstances, while he is not entitled to be sentenced as a person of prior good character, I do not regard the criminal record as a matter aggravating the sentence to be imposed.  
     
      
       
       
      
    Subjective circumstances  
     
      
    48 The offender was born in England and came to Australia with his family when he was five years old. His parents separated shortly thereafter. In a report furnished by Mr Andrew House, a Drug and Alcohol officer with the Department of Corrective Services, the offender reported that his early years were unstable and confusing. This is corroborated by the evidence of his mother who details domestic violence and disruption of the family unit as a result of an abusive partner. The offender commenced drinking alcohol and using drugs when he was 12. At 26 he progressed to heroin with which he has had an ongoing battle with over many years.  
     
      
    49 The offender has apparently used both drugs and alcohol as some form of escape from the realities of his emotional life. Mr House observed that it is common amongst people who suffer from alcoholism and other drug addictions that the effects of the drug create the illusion that the addict has discovered his true self. 50 It is of some concern to me that the offender was first seen by the Alcohol and Other Drug Services at Long Bay as recently as 26 May 2008 for the purposes of the preparation of a report. I am however encouraged by the fact that he has self-referred to the services since that time and has expressed an awareness of the extent of his addiction and its devastating consequences and a willingness and a desire to be drug-free. Mr House notes that the offender has made several attempts to address his addiction in the past by attending Odyssey House and William Booth House, although it would appear that his attempts at remaining drug-free were relatively short-lived. Although he informed Mr House that his self-esteem and self-worth improved when he was drug-free he was unable to sustain his abstinence. He said he was at a loss to explain his relapse. Mr House observed that where a person suffers from poor self-esteem and self-worth success is often difficult to cope with and, in the result, that sustained recovery is less likely to be achieved within the first few attempts and that relapse itself appears to be part of the recovery process.  
     
      
    51 Mr House was of the view that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Kennedy would benefit from continued intervention and an opportunity to engage in further counselling and groups to increase his awareness and take responsibility for himself and attempt to rehabilitate himself with the help of the competent and dedicated staff within Corrective Services. It is my recommendation that Mr Kennedy continue AOD counselling whilst incarcerated and attend the Ngara Nura pre-release program when that time comes and when released that he continue his treatment and transition into the community through Glebe House as well as follow the direction of Community Offender Services.”  
        
       
      
    52 I should also note that whilst the offender has lived independently of his family since he was 16, he has the support and love of his mother and his sister and since his incarceration has had regular jail visits with them. His mother gave evidence before me and confirmed the content of her letter to me where she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…since he has stopped using drugs and alcohol we have witnessed Ian becoming a loving son and brother again who realises that when you commit a crime like this the whole family serves the sentence. At the end of his jail sentence his family will be here for him.”  
        
       
      
    53 I can only hope that the offender honours the support that his family has given him over the last two years and that he appreciates the extent to which he will not only harm himself but his family should he relapse into drug and alcohol dependence and the lifestyle that that entails. Mitigating factors 
     
      
    54 Mr Siva submitted that there are a number of mitigating factors arising under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which count in favour of the offender with regards to sentence. I am satisfied with regards to s 21A(3)(g) that this offender is unlikely to re-offend. Despite a dissolute life over the last two decades, a way of life that is explained largely by reason of his vulnerability to drugs and the social dislocation that that entails, I am satisfied that the uncontrolled violence that is reflected in this offence was out of character. While the pressures of the trial have themselves (and understandably) been productive of stress and some deflection from a future focus I am prepared to proceed to sentence on the basis that the offender is in the process of gaining a new and encouraging insight into his particular vulnerability to any resumption of drug and alcohol use on his release, having been confronted with the objective evidence of his irreversible brain damage causally connected to sustained drug and alcohol abuse over many years.  
     
      
    55 I am also invited to view the offender’s experience of custody as a remand prisoner for two years as a watershed in terms of his commitment to abstinence when at his liberty. This is said to be evidenced by his determination to lessen his reliance on methadone prior to his release in acknowledgment of the struggle he has had in the past to stay clear of other drugs even while subject to a methadone program. With some qualified confidence I proceed to sentence on the basis that his prospects for rehabilitation are good as provided for in s 21A(3)(h) of the Act. 
     
      
    Special circumstances 56 Applying the relevant principles to which I have earlier observed, I consider that the statutory ratio under s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act should be varied to give appropriate account to the need for the offender to receive ongoing treatment for his drug and alcohol addiction on his eventual release and to the community’s interest in his commitment to participating actively in programs designed to achieve that objective. In varying the statutory ratio I also take into account the need for the offender to adjust his future behaviour and his aspirations for a legitimate working life to the knowledge that he has permanent brain damage as a result of his drug and alcohol abuse, and that support from community-based services under the supervision and guidance of the Probation and Parole Service when he is released to parole will likely be more productive of a successful adjustment and transition than an extended period in custody (see R v Pitt [2005] NSWCCA 304). Orders 
     
      
       
      1. I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of 4 years commencing on 28 July 2006 as the date of arrest and the commencement of pre-trial custody and expiring on 27 July 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 27 July 2012. 
       
       
      2. The earliest date upon which the offender is eligible to be released to parole is 27 July 2010.

    JUDGMENT 1. Power comes in many shapes and sizes. The easily recognised powerful can be among senior politicians, senior administrators, business giants and the mega rich. One decision made by the powerful can impact upon many lives for better or for worse. Power can also be exercised among the more humble. Physical power based upon strength that comes with gender; power springing from strength of mind and will, can impact upon a single life colliding with that exercise of power for better or worse.2. Power can be exercised benevolently, authoritarianly or even ruthlessly without attracting the intervention of the criminal law. On the other hand, power used illegally or for an illegal purpose is another matter.3. Much, if not most, sexual offending depends upon abuse of power and balance by the more powerful against the weaker. Invariably the abuse of power centres upon the power of the stronger being used to achieve an illegal purpose: in this case, sexual connection with a complainant without her consent.4. John Rad, on three occasions, on 6 February 2007, had what the Crimes Act defines as sexual intercourse without the consent of Yuan Yaun Xing without her consent and in circumstances where he knew she was not consenting.5. Each of these acts was achieved by a criminal abuse of his power to do what he willed in circumstances where he knew she was not consenting. There can be no doubt he knew such acts were illegal.6. A jury having followed the evidence has found him guilty of each offence charged against him.7. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these three offences before the court committed by this offender harming this victim in his community - R v Gladue (1999) 1SCR 688 [80].8. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender - subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender.9. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, the standard non-parole period, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality, backup charges or other charges brought from the Local Court to be finalised in this Court, the length of the non-parole period, and finally of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment that is to be imposed.10. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. (See R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.)Facts11. The accused’s case was based upon the sexual encounter of 6 February being the third occasion he and the complainant had had sexual experiences with each other. 12. The first occasion was said to be at the home of the offender’s friend, Sam in the Parramatta region. The second at the home of the complainant’s sister, Maggie. This third rendezvous was at his flat.13. Shortly after arrival, she emerged from the bathroom in a delicate sleeping top and bottom. On this occasion, she was the one aggressively pursuing her sexual desires in the lounge room. It was at his insistence that they adjourned to the bedroom lest a flatmate arrive during their sexual activities in the lounge room.14. The complainant was on a student’s visa. The Crown case was that she had no family in Australia. The prosecution case relied exclusively upon the complainant’s evidence. Her account differed significantly from the accused’s. 15. She first met the accused at a Town Hall bus stop while waiting for a Five Dock bus. He approached and began to talk to her. He persisted during that conversation in seeking her mobile phone number. It was a conversation lasting some ten to fifteen minutes. Not wanting to appear rude, she ended up giving him her mobile phone number. He claimed to be from France and had been to Shanghai. The significance of that was, of course, that the complainant was Chinese.16. From time to time she received phone calls from the accused. Indeed the first was shortly after she climbed aboard the bus to Five Dock. She answered some calls, others she did not. 17. There was a second encounter between them on 2 February at a Town Hall bus stop. Again at his request she supplied her mobile number to him. He sought explanations as to why she was not answering his calls and why she was not prepared to see him. She agreed to see him.18. The following day she sent a text message. The day following that she received a phone call from the accused. Arrangements were made to meet in Parramatta. On 6 February, the complainant sent a text message confirming.19. Ultimately she arrived at Parramatta and they met at a coffee shop. From there they went to the car park, drove to an Albion pub in Parramatta, had a drink or two there and then moved on to his place.20. The basis upon which they moved was that he had a view from his flat to the city and Harbour Bridge. They were to stay there for ten minutes and then go on to a restaurant for dinner. He claimed an appointment at nine o’clock and would have to drop her home before that time.21. They drove to the apartment. It was on the fourteenth floor of the building he lived in. She made her way to the sofa. Drinks were prepared and a video put on. He came close to her and said, “You’re a nice girl, I like you,” and kissed her. She pushed him away and said, “No, I don’t want this.” They continued to talk for a bit. He began to touch her legs near the knee. She removed his hand and moved away from him but still on the sofa. He stood in front of her, bent down and kissed her very quickly. It was a strong kiss lasting a little longer than the first. Again she pushed him saying, “I don’t want.”22. He returned to the sofa and told her he liked her. He asked her whether she had a boyfriend. She replied, “No, I don’t and I don’t want boyfriend.”23. A few minutes passed. He came and hugged her. He asked her to return the hug but she did not. She crossed her hands on her chest. 24. He picked her up and carried her to his bedroom. At this point she became scared and said, “No, let me down, let me down.” He continued to the bedroom, placed her on the double bed, got on top of her, bent at the knees with his legs apart on the bed. He held her hands on each side of and above her head. She tried unsuccessfully to sit up. She continued to say, “No, no, stop it.” all of which, of course, were messages from her to him indicating an absence of consent.25. He released her hands and began to touch her body. He undid her skirt and touched her vaginal area. He began outside her underpants and within a few minutes placed his hand inside her underpants. He touched her vaginal area and began rubbing it, initially outside the vagina but shortly he placed his finger inside, moving his finger for perhaps a minute.26. That conduct constitutes the first count in the indictment.27. She pushed him and screamed aloud. He moved his hand from her vaginal area and held her neck. He placed the other hand over her mouth to stop her screaming. She was fearful. She thought she might be killed. He said, “Don’t scream. Don’t worry, no sex.”28. Again he commenced to touch the vaginal area. She asked if she could go to the toilet, she felt tummy pain. She said she wanted to go to the toilet and repeated that a few times. He became angry and aggressive, raised an open hand above his head. She became frightened. He used his knee to press her legs apart and at some point took off her underpants. She continued to ask to be allowed to go to the toilet. She was slapped on the right side of the face, feeling immediate pain. 29. He then removed her T-shirt, her bra, and began to kiss and touch her chest, breast and the vagina with his hand, both inside and outside the vagina. He used his fingers when touching her inside the vagina. 30. That conduct constitutes the second charge on the indictment.31. That conduct did not last for long. She was pushing him. Her body language was clearly conveying to him that she was not consenting. He had raised his hand about three or four times to frighten her. I am satisfied each time he raised his hand he was demonstrating that he knew she was not consenting and that he desired that she submit.32. He said to her, “You are so sexy, I want to fuck you.” He left the bed, undressed himself, went into the bathroom, retrieved a towel which he put on the bed saying, “I don’t want to make the bed dirty.” He placed her on the towel by rolling her onto it. He reached for a condom from the bedside table. He touched his penis, by which I understand the complainant to mean he was masturbating, and asked her to touch it. She did not want to but did because he was aggressive and angry. She was fearful he would fight her and perhaps kill her.33. The offender opened the condom, placed it upon his penis. She was lying face-up, he was on top of her and placed his penis into her vagina. She screamed but not as loudly as she had earlier done because she didn’t want his hand on her neck. The accused had his penis in her vagina for some five to ten minutes, upon her estimate, before he ejaculated into the condom.34. That conduct is constituted in the third count in the indictment.35. He got off the bed. He said to her, “You are so stupid. You are so stupid.” He said that a few times. He said to her, “You don’t know anything. I won’t drop you home. Stupid.”36. He then, with some tissues, asked her to wipe her vaginal area. She went to the bathroom, she dressed herself. He used tissues to clean himself up but remained naked. She emerged from the bathroom and he told her how to get out of the building and make her way to the train station.37. The jury, by its verdict, makes plain it rejected the accused’s account entirely. That leaves only the complainant’s account and I act upon it content with her evidence as constituting the proper findings of fact in this matter.38. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, prior to 6 February 2007, there had never been any sexual contact between the complainant and the offender. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt on 6 February 2007, he was the aggressor, and in pursuit of that role, administered the violence the complainant gave evidence of.39. I am satisfied the accused well knew the complainant was rejecting his advances and voicing her objection both through her words and body language as she has described in her evidence.40. I am satisfied his humiliation of her continued beyond the sexual assault to the cruel and dismissive remarks upon completion of his acts. These remarks are consistent with an absence of contrition, an insight into his then freshly offending conduct. Objective Criminality41. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of an offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with the criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences is to be evaluated. 42. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. Indeed, it is crucial for a determination of whether an offence falls within the mid-range and attracts, thereby, the standard non-parole period.43. A useful starting point in the assessment of objective criminality in sexual assault cases is to remind the Court of part of a judgment of Mahoney JA: 
     
      
      “As I have indicated, every offence of this kind is a serious offence, but those whose duty it is to deal with crimes of this kind and to sentence those who commit them know that though each case is inherently serious, some are more serious than others. In some cases, the degree of violence, hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation and otherwise are much greater than are involved [in other cases]. It is to be understood that in sentencing it is appropriate - indeed in most cases it is necessary - that the sentencing judge form and record his assessment of where, on the relevant scale of seriousness, the particular offence lies.” ( 
      R v Gebrail 
       unreported NSWCCA 18/Nov (1994)). 
       
      
    44. In 1993, the then Chief Justice, Chief Justice Gleeson, made the point that non-consensual intercourse is an extreme form of violence and one which the community expects courts to take very seriously. (R v Hartikainen unreported NSWCCA 8 June 1993).45. Even if no additional violence is administered other than the intercourse (R v Pay (1999) NSWCCA 40 [7]) unwanted, forced intrusion into the privacy, indeed intimacy of a complainant’s body and psyche against her will by use of physical power and callous disregard for her wishes or feelings, marks the essence of the criminality of these offences.46. While there are three episodes described as sexual intercourse, the most serious of the three is the penile-vaginal penetration of the complainant. I am satisfied the accused lured the complainant to his apartment with a view to having penile-vaginal intercourse with her. His conduct immediately upon their arrival of preparing drinks and putting on a video are inconsistent with an intent that the two would stay at the premises longer than a mere ten minutes. However, I cannot be satisfied he formed any criminal intent until she declined to return her hugging of him.47. His picking her up and refusal to put her down can only be consistent with an intent to have his way with her whether she consented or not. Once she began to say no, his criminal intent hardened to having sex with her accepting that she would not be consenting.48. He did not spend much time seeking to persuade her. Four times she had refused his advances. Thereafter he used his superior physical power, her isolation from all the world save him, and ultimately a level of significant physical violence or threatened violence to achieve his sexual satisfaction.49. The Crown puts this offence as above the mid-range of seriousness. The defence argue it falls just short. This issue is important for it will determine whether this offence attracts a standard non-parole period.50. The trigger for the requirement to impose a standard non-parole period is the determination that the offence is in “the middle of the range of objective seriousness” for the particular offence. (R v Dean (2006) NSWCCA 341 at [76] per Grove J at 76, Bell J agreeing).51. Section 54A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (the Act) defines the standard non-parole period as representing the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the table. The jurisprudence establishes that the middle point is the mid-range of seriousness after trial. (R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168).52. What matters need to be assessed to determine whether this offence falls within the mid-range of seriousness?  
     
      
      “The multiplicity of purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Act ( 
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
      ) quoted above do not suggest a narrow perspective as to the range of facts and matters that are to be regarded as ‘objective’ facts and matters which may affect the judgment involving the - in assessing the ‘seriousness’. 
       
       
      It is too narrow a perspective to confine attention to the physical acts of the offender and their effects as those acts or effects should be observed by a bystander. The inquiry which we consider to have been intended is one that would take into account the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct and those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender ...  
      Way 
       at [85] ... 
       
       
      In an assessment of the objective seriousness of the subject offence, it seems to us that attention must accordingly be given to factors mentioned above. Some of these relevant factors will be elements of the offence itself, others will fall within the list of aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(2) and (3) of the Act so far as they relate to purely objective considerations ... 
       
       
      Prior to the enactment of legislation of the kind which is to be seen in Division 1A of Part 4, it was probably not necessary for any strict line to be drawn between matters which related to the offence and to the offender respectively, since the focus was placed upon the question of setting a sentence that reflected the overall criminal culpability involved. 
       
       
      The position has now changed in relation to sentencing with respect to offences for which standard non-parole periods have been set insofar as there needs to be an examination of the level of objective  
      seriousness 
       involved in the offence in which considerations that do not have a nexus with its commission are to be placed to one side. 
       
       
      Before parting from this aspect of the Division, we observe that we do not consider that a mid-range offence should be regarded as one that is necessarily ‘typical’ of those that are charged under the relevant provision, nor do we consider that the mid-range for the offence should be assumed to occupy a relatively narrow band within the continuum between the least serious instance and the worst category of cases [ 
      Way 
       ante at [98]-[100]] ...” 
       
      
    53. To the extent if it be the case that Tobias JA with whom Grove J and Bell J, as she then was, agreed, said something to the contrary in R v Dean, I prefer the approach of the court in Way which focused specifically on the application of s 21A and s 54B. That task required close attention to the interpretation of the provisions of s 54A and s 54B. I make this observation because the Crown, as I recall, sought to rely upon Dean. 
     
      
      “It is important to note that in s 21A factors are not confined to those that are specifically identified in s 21A(2) and (3) and that s 54B(3) is not to be read down as restricting consideration to those factors. This arises from the fact that s 21A(1) specifically requires the court to take into account in addition to the aggravating and mitigating factors referred to in those subsections: 
       
       
       ‘(c) Any other objective or subjective factor that affects the  
      relative seriousness 
       of the offence’ (emphasis added), 
      
    and from the fact that it goes on to say: 
     
      
      The matters referred to in this subsection are in addition to any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or rule of law’.” 
       
      
    54. Identification of matters that fall within the mid-range of seriousness can be confined to matters, which are directly or causally related to its commission and effect. R v AJP (2004) NSWCCA 434 (a decision of the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal) also deals with assessing objective criminality. I draw from that case the following propositions. 
     
      
      That the fact that an offence is an isolated incident is not irrelevant to its evaluation for purposes of assessing whether it is in the mid-range.  
      Where an offence is defined in the statute to include several categories of conduct, the heinousness of the conduct in a particular case depends not upon the statute defining the offence or the particular category of conduct, but upon the facts of the case of which the nature of intercourse will be but one factor that will determine the seriousness of the offence. 
      While penile-vaginal penetration may well be more serious than forced fellatio, it does not mean that fellatio must necessary fall below the mid-point of seriousness. 
      Section 21A matters of aggravation will be matters that may lift a matter to or beyond the mid-point of seriousness. 
      Other matters that may impact upon objective seriousness include how the offence took place; the span of time over which an offence occurred; the degree of force or coercion applied to the complainant; the use of threats before or after the criminal intercourse to ensure compliance with demands made and/or subsequent silence; the level of physical and other harm done to the complainant. 
      
    55. Of the three offences, I repeat the most serious is the penile-vaginal intercourse. I am satisfied neither count 1 nor count 2 falls in the mid-range of seriousness, nor in assessing the mid-range of seriousness of count 3 do I apply the principle of totality. 56. Count 3 must be assessed standing alone. That, however, is not to say that consideration of its subjective [sic; read “objective] criminality ignores the background events including the commission of the two earlier offences as precursory action leading towards the penile-vaginal intercourse.57. The objective circumstances of this offence including taking advantage of the complainant when she was isolated, persisting in his sexual advances in circumstances where he had been rejected and the complainant subsequently had made manifest her fear by screaming.58. He relied on his physical force on four occasions to demonstrate his power over her and his determination to have penile-vaginal intercourse. These included carrying her to the bedroom, holding her hands above her head whilst she was on the bed, placing one hand on her throat and the other on her mouth when she was screaming, and the right side of her face was slapped.59. There were a number of threats made by him of applying force when he raised his hand as though to slap.60. He denied her the opportunity to attend the toilet despite her repeated requests so to do. He undressed her. He persisted in penile-vaginal intercourse notwithstanding she had not consented to and had been humiliated by his digital penetration of her. He also required her to touch his penis prior to penetration.61. His purpose in pursuing the penile-vaginal intercourse was his own sexual gratification.62. I have considered whether the evidence discloses that his sexual gratification was stimulated or heightened by the aggression he demonstrated towards her. The evidence, however, points to him finding the complainant an attractive lady and desiring her upon that basis.63. In addition to the actual physical violence, there were also threats of physical violence, which I just mentioned. These occurred on a number of occasions when he raised his hand as though to strike the complainant but did not do so as she submitted to him.64. The Crown sought to argue there was pre-planning. While there was persistent pursuit of the complainant from when the accused first saw her at the Town Hall bus stop, there is nothing in the evidence which points towards forced sexual intercourse without consent as being ever in his mind prior to his lifting her from the couch. His criminal conduct appears to begin shortly after this exchange between them. 
     
      
      Accused: “I like you. Do you have a boyfriend?” or words to similar that effect. 
      
     
     
      
      Complainant: “No, I don’t have and  
      I don’t want boyfriend 
      .” 
       
      
    65. It may be the accused regarded this as a rejection of his advances. If not, her folding of her arms across her chest when he asked her to hug her back must surely have been a message of rejection to him.66. I do not need to decide what prompted the change in attitude, but the evidence does point towards the offence being opportunistic in circumstances where the accused’s advances for consensual connection were being repulsed. It was, at some point whilst the complainant was still on the sofa, that the accused determined to have penile intercourse with her even though she had indicated no interest.67. It should also be noted he wore a condom. I am satisfied his decision to wear a condom was based upon his own desire for safety, perhaps a desire to be spared the consequences of fatherhood, and as a step in avoiding detection. Nonetheless the consequences of so doing were that it relieved the complainant to some extent worrying about sexually transmitted diseases, pregnancy, and spared her the humiliation of receiving his sperm into her womb.68. Although there was physical violence and aggression, it did not descend into bondage, sadomasochism or some fetish capable of further aggravating the complainant’s humiliation, pain and distress. Nor was there what might be described as gratuitous violence.69. Physical injury occasioned would appear to have been limited to pain, a bruising around the neck and perhaps some marks on the cheek.70. No threats were administered before or after the sexual episode, if one regards the sexual episode as beginning on the bed. There does not appear to be any long-term physical injury arising to the complainant. 71. The span of time over which this offence occupied can properly be measured in minutes rather than any other currency.72. It is possible to have sexual intercourse without consent without the administration of violence over and above the (violence of non-consensual) penetration of the complainant. The level of additional bodily force over and above the act of penetration in rape cases varies considerably.73. I am satisfied that violence at the upper end of the spectrum would be caught by s 21A(2)(b) as a matter of aggravation. I am also satisfied that gratuitous violence would also constitute a s 21A(2)(b) aggravation. My concern is whether violence being administered to accomplish the element of submission or compliance in the absence of consent constitutes an aggravating feature picked up by s 21A(2).74. The level of additional violence, whilst reprehensible, in this case was targeted by the accused to achieving the complainant’s compliance to his having sexual intercourse without her consent. It is closely aligned to an essential element of the offence.75. While there is greater violence in some other cases, the violence in this case really impacts upon the criminality associated with the essential element rather than a discrete aggravating feature of the offence. The measure of the criminality of the essential element of the offence of having intercourse without consent is the level of violence he administered to achieve that end. It is not as though the violence has not aggravated the offence. It is a question of the mechanism by which the violence comes to be measured as part of the objective seriousness. In my view, it is part of the element in this case.76. The victim was an adult female student. While it is acknowledged she was isolated when sexually assaulted, she does not otherwise present as a vulnerable victim. There is no suggestion that the accused sought to take advantage of her by plying her with alcohol or drugs. While the injury and emotional impact were significant, sexual assault offences of this kind are inherently damaging to body, emotion and psyche. 77. To her credit, the complainant seemed relatively composed after the event. She had the presence of mind to take the registration number of the offender’s vehicle, make her way to Parramatta station, call her older sister in China, listen to and take her advice.78. On its objective circumstances, I come to a view that the offence is one that falls within the mid-range of seriousness. Accepting that the concept of mid-range of seriousness is not a pinpoint but a range or a band, this offence falls within the lower half of that band.Victim Impact Statement79. I have received a victim impact statement. The material contained in the victim impact statement is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that opinions are expressed in the statement, I recognise they are not the opinions of a qualified expert.80. The victim impact statement, coming as it does from the primary victim, may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offences and their effects upon her. I indicate I do accept it as reliable.81. The function of statements such as this one is, firstly, to give to the victims the opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of an offender. Secondly, to enable the sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly, the victim impact statement contributes to an offender at least hearing at firsthand and perhaps gaining an insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon his victim. Finally, a victim impact statement ensures the Court has a continuing consciousness of the impact violent crime has upon those ordinary men and women who are its victims. As such, the victim impact statement plays a very important part in the administration of criminal justice.82. This statement is dated 28 April 2008. The complainant says: 
     
      
      “I suffered sexual assault on 6 February 2007. This resulted in some psychological problems. It also affected my life seriously. Since the assault I generally don’t feel safe around men. I have been very upset about what occurred and this has affected me in the way I view men. I feel scared when I am with a man. 
       
       
      I have had feelings of suicide from time to time because I trusted people including Anthony (John Rad) but after the incident I have a very low level of trust now. 
       
       
      I had nightmares a few weeks after the incident. I was always sleepless in the midnight and thinking about what had happened. Not enough sleeping affected my studying and work. 
       
       
      I was unable to concentrate on my studying after the incident. I didn’t fail any subject in the previous two years studying. I was a credit student. But after the incident I failed one subject so I have to study five subjects in this semester otherwise I can’t graduate in two years. It makes me take more study pressure. 
       
       
      I couldn’t do my part-time job after the incident about one or two months. I had to quit. It is hard for me to share this incident with my parents and friends. I had to deal with my feelings on my own. I was [in] depression for a long time. Since this incident happened I think - I almost think of it every day in one year.” 
      
    Subjective Factors83. I now turn to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offences, but I am also sentencing this offender for them. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or who stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of these offences by this man or some reason why more or less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Background, Family, Relationships84. John Rad, born in April of 1967, is the youngest of nine children. His parents separated when he was aged two. His early life was lived in Iran. His father, after the separation, moved to France. His mother remarried when he was aged six or so.85. The family he lived in was caring and close. The family was Kurdish living in the mountains and plateau regions of north western Iran. 86. Members of the family were outspoken and found themselves in conflict with authorities because of their political views.87. The family has now dispersed to some extent. Two siblings reside in Sweden, six remain in Iran and the offender is in Australia. His stepfather and mother have both passed away, his mother passing last year.88. Rad, then a member of the Communist party, found himself incarcerated aged twenty-one for three years on account of his political views and activities.89. Shortly after his release at the age of twenty-four he married. The year was 1992. A son was born to this union.90. Early in the marriage in 1994 he, his wife and then one year old child, escaped to Turkey. They were seeking refugee status. His wife and son were separated from him and failed to make, as I understand it, the United Nations’ compound. They were returned to Turkey. The accused, however, secured refugee status and arrived in Sydney in 1994 as a political refugee.91. His wife has since divorced him. The son is now aged sixteen or seventeen. The offender has sought to assist the son flee Iran with a view to joining the father in Australia but thus far without success. 92. In 2003 he married a Chinese lady. That relationship had finished some six months before his offending conduct.93. A consequence of this conviction is a review of his suitability to continue by the Department of Immigration as a sponsor for his son to migrate to Australia.Education, Skills, Employment94. Rad finished high school in Iran reaching Higher School Certificate equivalency. He then completed first year of an accounting course. 95. In Australia, he initially found employment in pastry cooking, subsequently in a bakery. More recently, as I understand it, at the time of the offence, as a food process worker with Crafty Chef. He has worked there full-time since March of 2003 on an annual salary of about $34,000.96. I am satisfied since his arrival in Australia the offender has held regular employment in semi-skilled positions. He is presently dabbling in courses offered in custody, but thus far does not appear to have committed to any. That may be because to date he has been a remand prisoner.General Health97. John Rad presents as so far as one can tell from appearances, a fit forty year old, slim, wiry built man in general good health.Mental Health Issues98. In evidence he claimed he was depressed but has not been taking any medication. No doubt his custodial situation, his impediments in being able to sponsor his son and his son’s welfare are all matters contributing to his feeling down.99. There is no professional assessment before me. I note also he has no relatives in Australia. He claims no-one is visiting him in custody. I accept he must feel isolated from the outside world.Psychosexual Profile100. After interviewing him, Forensic Psychological Services assessment comments that the accused spent significant time grooming the victim, then applied significant force to obtain compliance and engaged in abusive and demeaning language towards the victim. 101. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender’s conduct prior to the complainant’s rejection of him was conduct of malicious intent. On one view it may well be described as grooming in the sense that he was seeking a relationship with her, but I reject the proposition that it was grooming for the purposes of having sexual intercourse without consent.102. His last partner had been Chinese. He had been parted from her for some six months, although there may have been some intermittent contact in that time.103. His initial approach towards the complainant in his unit was consistent with seeking consensual sex. Even immediately after the rejection, he persisted with ardour rather than aggression. When it was even more clear that his ardour was unwelcome, his conduct changed to the criminal.104. There is no doubt his language thereafter became abusive and demeaning, even after the intercourse had finished. One cannot rule out that language and attitude occurs because of his frustration, sense of impotence and anger at being rejected.105. I am inclined to regard his interest in the complainant as genuine. He called her a couple of days later to apologise. I do not rule out that that apology was seeking to mend fences. On the other hand, one cannot rule out that the accused was also attempting, or perhaps simply attempting, to manipulate the complainant, because by the time the apology was made, she had complained to the police, their investigation was on foot, a fact likely to have been well known by the offender.106. Accepting as I must the jury verdict, the offender’s continual denials of sexual assault must be regarded as evidence of denying criminality and lacking insight into the antisocial character of his behaviour.107. The offender’s position is, “I have no problem, I am not sick.” Even on a view most favourable to the accused, he did have a genuine rather than predatory interest in the complainant. His conduct towards her was callous, uncaring, egocentric lust, devaluating the importance of the relationship in sexual connection and demeaning of the role of women in sex and generally.108. On this basis I am satisfied there is a need for treatment. I intend to recommend he be considered for acceptance into the CUBIT sex offenders programme. He indicates in evidence a present willingness to attend, even though he claims he does not need the treatment.Custody109. He was arrested at Sydney Airport on 25 July 2007 and has been in custody since that time. He was arrested on his return from Canada. The offender has been in custody in Canada. That custody in Canada may have related to his status in Canada.110. His flight from Australia was relied upon by the prosecution as consciousness of guilt. Had he not fled Australia on that basis, his custody in Canada would not have occurred. I am prepared to regard there being a sufficient nexus between his custody and his offending conduct to take it into account when setting the sentence.111. His evidence was that he had been in custody for some three months in Canada. I have been informed and am prepared to accept that police in Australia were notified on 28 May 2007, that is, two months prior to his arrest in Sydney, that he had arrived in Canada and was, I think, being detained. But on any view, he was detained at the time of his arrival.112. I am intending to backdate the sentences I give to 28 May 2007 on that basis.113. Without gaol visits, his custody will isolate him from the outside world much more than would happen if he had a network of family and friends in Sydney.114. Aged forty, he is also well over the median age of offenders, another feature that may contribute to him being isolated somewhat whilst he is in custody.115. During his time in custody, he has been employed at CSI Textiles as head sweeper. Character and Criminal History116. This offender is a divorced person with a good employment ethic. His early adult life saw him in political conflict with an authoritarian regime. In the course of fleeing the regime he lost his first wife and son to the regime. Without family or other support in Australia, he made his way. He has sought for some time now to reunite with his son. 117. He has been before the Local Courts on four occasions and should have been before the Local Court on five in relation to driving offences and possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit.118. For the prohibited weapon charge he was fined $200. 119. There are no offences of a kind suggesting any longstanding problem with violence or sexual issues.120. I regard his record as one entitling him to some leniency. I do not regard his periods of incarceration in Iran as disenabling him to claim good character.121. The totality of his criminality that has thus far been dealt with has been covered by fines amounting in total to $2,000. 122. There are still two outstanding matters, one of which will be finalised today and another for which he has been convicted but not yet finalised - that is, convicted and a s 25(2) warrant to issue - both of those relating to driving whilst disqualified.123. For the purposes of sentencing for this offence, I regard him as generally a person of good character. Attitude to the Offence124. This is a matter I dealt with in part under the heading Psychosexual Issues. Whatever purpose the accused pursued through the initial apology, events have now superseded it. The account he gave in evidence was false and unfair to the complainant. He is not to be punished for running his trial, but issues raised in his defence are appropriate matters to have regard to when assessing his attitude to the offence.Rehabilitation Prospects125. I would assess the offender’s rehabilitation prospects as relatively positive. 
     
     He has remained crime-free, at least of offences of violence and drugs, for nearly forty years but for the Local Court matters that I have referred to. 
     In particular, there is no history of violence or sex offences. 
     He has a strong work ethic and employment skills in semi-skilled areas. 
     He has used his time in custody sensibly and has started to focus on post-release life choices. 
     He has expressed willingness to attend the CUBIT programme. 
     Although his family is not in Australia, he looks to them for support. 
     Good physical health, an absence of drug and alcohol issues and some focus on post-release life. 
    126. Negative factors are also to be considered. There are two significant negative factors: his unwillingness to confront publicly his criminal offending and his lack of social network in Australia.127. Hopefully the proposed treatment programme will address the first of these negative factors.Standard Non-Parole128. Is this a case calling for the standard non-parole period? I have already assessed the objective criminality as placing his offence in the lower half of the band of cases falling within the mid-range of seriousness.129. Subsections (2) and (3) of s 54B provide limited scope for a judge to set a parole period other than a standard non-parole period for an offence falling within the mid-range of seriousness.130. The reasons for which it may set a shorter than standard non-parole period are to be found in only s 21A of the Act (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1989).131. The impact of s 21A(3) upon a standard non-parole period was demonstrated in Way’s case: 
     
      
      “Although there is nothing in Division 1A of Part 4 that expressly says so, the standard non-parole periods in the Table must also be taken as having been intended for a middle-range case where the offender was convicted  
      after trial 
      . This follows from the fact that factor (k) being one of the mitigating factors specified in s 21A(3) which is to be taken into account as a matter which might justify departure from the standard non-parole is ‘a plea of guilty’ by the offender (as provided by s 22A). A plea of not guilty can never be an aggravating factor.” 
       
       
      
    132. I am not suggesting other mitigating factors found in s 21A would necessarily carry as much value as a plea of guilty. All I seek to do is to note the impact s 21A(3)(k) had in Way’s case.133. On the material before me, favourable findings have been made which can be expressed in terms of s 21A(3): 
     
      
      “(b) The offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity. 
       
       
      (e) The offender does not have any record (or any significant record) of previous convictions. 
       
       
      (f) The offender was a person of good character. 
       
       
      (g) The offender is unlikely to re-offend. 
       
      
    134. My prediction as to the likelihood of the offender re-offending was expressed more cautiously than s 21A(3)(g) phrases it. His rehabilitation prospects are promising. Predicting future offending is notoriously unreliable, nonetheless it seems to me he is capable of coming within (g).135. Is the offender a person of good character? True there are convictions, some of them relating to disqualified driving and two of them within days of this offence. But for the purposes of this offence, in my view he can nonetheless be regarded as a person of good character at the time of his offending. While other minds may differ, at least in the early part of driving offences there would be many people who the community would regard as people of good character who would be scarred with driving convictions, even driving whilst disqualified.136. Factors (b) and (e) express precisely findings made by me with particular reliance upon these two and having also given weight to (f) and (g) I have determined that this is an offence where a shorter non-parole period can be set, even though it falls within the mid-range of seriousness. 
     
      
      “... it is clear that the legislative policy in introducing Division 1A so far as that can be discerned from the legislation itself was not to create a straightjacket for judges, since s 54B(2) does permit reference to be made to a range of circumstances that would justify departure from the standard non-parole period. If reference to the second reading speech were necessary for that conclusion, it may be noted that the Attorney General specifically observed that the amendments were not introduced as a form of mandatory sentencing but were rather intended to provide ‘further guidance and structure to judicial discretion’” ...  
      Way 
       para 59. 
       
      
    137. Having determined that a shorter non-parole period is appropriate, I still must bear in mind the very existence of Division 1A of Part 4 requires me to regard the standard non-parole period as a bench mark. Indeed, in this case, it must be a point of reference because the non-parole period that I am setting is to be shorter than the otherwise prescribed standard non-parole period of seven years.Setting the Sentence138. In modern Australian society there is a very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by Federal and State Parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by Parliaments is to deter those tempted to breach the provisions of the laws. Parliament does that by prescribing maximum penalties for those engaged in conduct prohibited by the criminal law. In a moment I will refer to the maximum penalty for these offences.139. Consequently when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires a sentencing judge to keep in mind the general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind the maximum penalties available and their deterrent purpose when passing sentence.140. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to the offender who, but for such deterrence, would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being punished.141. Finally, there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to the offender with a view to reminding him not to and persuading him not to re-offend.142. The maximum penalty for these offences is one of fourteen years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of seven years. Concurrent Sentences143. There are three counts requiring sentence. All counts relate to the same incident occurring in the accused’s flat. There would have been moments between each of them. The entire period of offending would be measured in minutes, as I said, rather than any other currency.144. In these circumstances, it is appropriate that all sentences be concurrent. However, the sentence for the penile-vaginal intercourse, count 3, will be required to reflect the totality of criminality assessed in this criminal offending.145. When the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective matters are taken into account, I have determined that an overall sentence of eight years is appropriate. 146. I have determined that there are special circumstances to be found: 
     
      
       
       It is the offender’s first time in custody. 
       For reasons I have given, incarceration will be more isolating for him than for other prisoners, thereby making his imprisonment more arduous. 
       It is likely his capacity to advance his son’s prospects of fleeing Iran and migrating to Australia while he remains with prisoner status will be impeded. That will also make his custody more arduous. 
       His willingness to undertake the CUBIT programme is likely to be enhanced with prospects of an earlier than later release date. That is to say, if his release is not automatic - as indeed it will not be in this case - he will seek, hopefully, to persuade the Parole Board of his fitness to be released by early completion of the CUBIT programme. 
       
      
    147. In the circumstances, I have determined upon a non-parole period of five years.148. Would you stand up please Mr Rad? Mr Rad, for the offence - these are all in the same term but the first two relate to the digital penetration. 149. On 6 February 2007 at Parramatta, you had sexual intercourse with Yuan Yaun Xing without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse. For that offence you are convicted and you are sentenced to a fixed term of three years imprisonment to date from 25 May 2007 and to expire on 24 May 2010.150. Likewise for the offence in the same terms, you are convicted and sentenced to a fixed term of three years to date from 25 May 2007.151. For the third offence, which is the vaginal-penile intercourse offence that you committed, namely, you did have sexual intercourse with Yuan Yaun Xing without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting to that sexual intercourse, you are convicted. For that offence I set a non-parole period of five years to commence on 25 May 2007 and to expire on 24 May 2012.152. I set an additional term of three years to expire on 24 May 2015.Would you sit down please? I want you to understand what I have just done. Effectively you have a non-parole period of five years dating from 25 May when I have assumed you were arrested by the Canadian Immigration authorities, and your earliest release date is 24 May 2010 (as said). You will have to make an application to the Parole Board. You will have to convince the Parole Board that you are suitable to be released. One of the factors they will take into account is the likelihood that you will re-offend. To convince them that you would not re-offend, my advice to you - and that is all I can give you - is that you would do the CUBIT programme and present them with that evidence of completing the programme.153. For the offence of driving whilst disqualified on 6 February, pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, I am entitled to sentence you, and I shall sentence you to a period of three months imprisonment to date from today, 11 July 2008, and to expire on 10 October 2008.154. Any other matter, Madam Crown?DALEO: Your Honour did say to the offender his earliest release date was 24 May 2010. I think that was a slip of the tongue, your Honour meant 2012, the five year standard non-parole period.HIS HONOUR: All right. I disqualify you from holding any licence under the Motor Traffic Acts for a period of two years cumulative upon any disqualification period you are currently serving.

    JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: During the course of preparing these remarks on the sentence I came across a set of agreed facts in respect of a robbery. I was concerned that there appeared to be an absence of anything putting that matter before me. It was attached to part of exhibit 3. My memory of exhibit 3 was simply that it was the one document relating to the standover of a prostitute on Canterbury Road. Consequently I requested my associate this morning to ring Mr Robinson who obviously referred the matter onto the present Crown who appears. In respect to what the significance of that documentation and whether it was a charge and if so what was the mechanism by which it came before the court, the current Mr Crown advised my associate that it simply was an exhibit giving background information in respect of the accused.INTRODUCTION2 On 29 May 2007 Mohamad Charrouf pleaded not guilty to two charges upon an indictment. The first alleges an assault on one Sharon Attard between 8 and 12 August 2005. The second charge alleged that on 23 August 2005 he entered the dwelling house of Anwar El Abbas in Riverwood with intent to commit a serious indictable offence, namely intimidation of another person with the intention of causing that person to fear physical harm.3 The connection between these two charges is Sharon Attard who was, at the relevant time, the partner of Anwar El Abbas. She would, from time to time, stay at the El Abbas unit with her three year old daughter. Indeed, on 23 August she was one of the persons present, as was her daughter. She witnessed the arrival of Mohamad Charrouf. The jury acquitted on the first count but convicted on the second. 4 It falls now to me to sentence this Offender in respect of the second count. It therefore falls to me to resolve a number of competing tension as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this Court committed by this Offender intimidating this victim in this community. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the Offender, that is his subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires the sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating then to both the offence and the Offender. The Offender’s rehabilitation prospects will need to be assessed even though looking through a glass darkly, particularly so in this case, as he is serving a lengthy period of custody.5 Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, whether special circumstances are to be found, totality and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment to be imposed. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have, as its primary focus, the protection of the community will also need to be determined.FACTS.6 The Crown case alleged El Abbas, Sharon Attard and her three year old daughter were present in his unit with a neighbour. Sometime between 9.30 and 10am there was a knock on the door interrupting the breakfast that the three adults were sharing in the lounge room. Attard opened the door and the Offender walked into the lounge room. He sought to speak to El Abbas in private. El Abbas had invited him to sit on the lounge. The Offender insisted they speak in private. El Abbas took the Offender to one of the bedrooms. It was the bedroom of the three year old child.7 On the Crown case the Offender, once in the bedroom, asked, “Do you have any money on you?” El Abbas replied, “I don’t have enough money to buy cigarettes”. The Offender then said, “We want your unit, we want to use it”. El Abbas said, “No”. The Offender said words to the effect of, “I don’t care we want the unit, we’ll use it anyhow, we’ll take it anyhow”. El Abbas replied, “You can’t do that, I’ve got a three year old living here.” The Offender said, “I don’t give a fuck”. 8 This conversation was interrupted by a scream coming from the lounge room at about this point. El Abbas ran from the room into the lounge room. The scream had come from his partner. He saw two unknown males running from the lounge room out through the front door. El Abbas turned to the Offender saying “What, you set this up”. That conversation continued for sometime down the stairs, El Abbas and the Offender chased after the intruders.9 During the conversation the Offender swore on his mother and his family, on the Koran, that he had nothing to do with it. El Abbas believed him. The Crown case was these intruders had nothing to do with the Offender. El Abbas and the Offender gave chase to the men without success.10 Two mobile phones had been taken. The Offender made a call that apparently resulted in one of the mobile phones ultimately being returned.11 The Accused gave evidence before the jury. His case was that he knew El Abbas, had met him previously a couple of times but was not good friends with him. On 23 August he went to the El Abbas unit, was admitted to the unit by Attard; had asked her, “Can I come in please I want to talk to Anwar”. El Abbas, who was eating breakfast, stood up. He still had the knife and fork in his hand. The Offender said “Put them down”. El Abbas complied. The Offender noticed the three year old and a male who he did not know. He took El Abbas into one of the bedrooms and said to him, “Can you please stop selling to my brother, please”. El Abbas replied “Who is your brother”. The Offender said, “Kaloud”. Kaloud is the Offender’s older brother by some three years. El Abbas agreed to stop selling to Kaloud. Then he told the Offender, “Not to come here anymore”. It was at this point that someone ran into the house and their conversation was interrupted.12 Thereafter there was little difference in the account given by the Offender and El Abbas. In this case the jury decision was really confined to the content of the conversation in the child’s bedroom. Notwithstanding the Accused’s evidence the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the following: 
     
      
      A. It rejected the Offender’s version of the conversation. Indeed they refused to accept that there was any reasonable possibility the Offender said the words he claimed as his own; 
       
       
      B. The conversation given by El Abbas was both accurate and honest; and 
       
       
      C. It, together with other factors, was indicative of an intent to intimidate El Abbas with the intention of causing him to fear physical or mental harm.  
      
    I am obviously bound by their verdict.OBJECTIVE CRIMINALITY13 For the purposes of this case the essence of the offence of intimidation relied upon by the Crown is to force a person into or to deter him from some action by inducing fear of physical or mental harm. 14 In this case the ultimate purpose of the intimidation was to overawe El Abbas’s will to resist the Accused’s intention of using El Abbas’s unit.15 Clearly there are varying means or methods of intimidation. For example, the use of physical force, the use of numbers, the use of weapons, the use of threats, the use of conduct such as malicious damage to property and the like, the capturing of some person. The nature of the method used to advance the fear or strength of will, necessarily must be an important measure of criminality associated with this offence.16 Another measure of criminality must be the nature of the objectives sought and the measure of harm to a person or the community in the event that objective should be accomplished. At one end of the scale would be bullying that caused a child to hand over his lunch to another. At the other end would be the use of weapons and/or crimes against others to force an act of treason from another. Between these two extremes would lie many varying degrees of intimidation. 17 A third measure of the criminality would be the degree of success the Offender had in achieving his intention of causing a person to fear physical or mental harm. 18 A fourth measure of Criminality concerns the element of aggravation, that is, the presence of more than one person present. It constitutes an element of offence. That fact of its own does not aggravate criminality. But when there are special features in respect of those present then there may be criminality related to this element that becomes a feature of aggravation. For example, if the intimidatory acts were done before a group of children, that clearly would be more criminal than the same intimidatory acts done before a group of soldiers.19 As against those criteria the following observations can be made. The method of intimidation by this Offender, as applied, is best described as menace. No weapon or physical act or threat was made against El Abbas or any other person of importance to him. No specific threat was directed towards anyone. It would appear on this criteria this offence would be towards the lower end of criminality. In this case the ultimate objective of the intimidation appears to be some unfettered access to El Abbas’s premises. Because of the interruption to the demands being made by the accused it is unclear on what basis the Offender sought the unfettered access to the unit. Was it on a basis that El Abbas was to move out permanently and sign over the lease? Was it on the basis that there would be one short term interruption or was it on something in between? All of this is a matter of speculation.20 Indeed El Abbas, when asked in cross-examination as to the nature of the demand, said “Probably to hang out, probably to - I don’t know anything” (second day, p 50 ln 49).21 Its trite law that matters of aggravation need to be proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, no doubt because of the interruption, the full purpose of the intimidation is unclear on the evidence.22 The third measure of criminality is the degree of success the Offender had in achieving his intention. It is to be remembered his intentions are really, in a sense twofold. Firstly, to accomplish the intimidation and secondly, that the intent of the intimidation is to cause that person to fear physical or mental harm [for some specific purpose].23 The intimidation exercise was, as I say, interrupted. The two men chased the intruders together. Further, there is no evidence suggesting any fear was engendered in El Abbas and certainly no fear of physical or mental harm.24 Thus, although the jury was satisfied beyond doubt of the Offender’s intention, there is no evidence that that intention of causing fear was achieved. On this occasion the entry was by consent. The acts constituting the intimidation were done in private. There is no suggestion the child or female or guest present were alarmed or disturbed or distressed by the presence of the Accused.25 By contrast and tendered for contextual background in respect of the Offender's antecedents were facts of another intimidation involving this Offender. In that case the Offender was in company. He demanded payment from a prostitute of $200. In the absence of payment he sought to ban her from Canterbury Road. He and his accomplice each exposed a handgun. The accomplice issued this threat “Do you want me to finish her or do you want to?” At the time of saying this the accomplice was pointing his weapon in the prostitutes direction. 26 Clearly, on the measure I have proposed, that act of intimidation was far more serious.27 As to the fourth measure of criminality, the presence of persons present, that is the aggravating feature of the offence, it seems to me that because none of the persons present understood an act of intimidation was occurring and do not appear to have been in danger or alarmed, while the act of aggravation must stand, it does not add further to the criminality as suggested by that fourth measure.28 In those circumstances this is not an offence that falls at or above the midrange or the mid point of seriousness but rather one towards the lower categories of seriousness.SUBJECTIVE MATTERS29 I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. As I said earlier not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but I am also sentencing this Offender for it. Each Offender coming before the Court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to an Offender may offer to the Court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by this Offender, or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Personal circumsatances, family background and relationships. 30 Charrouf was born in May 1983 with a twin brother. He is now twenty-four years old. He has an older brother, Kaloud, who has also been in trouble with the police and prison. Indeed, my understanding is he may currently be in prison.31 Charrouf’s parents divorced some eleven years ago. Both, however, are still relatively supportive of him. All children resided with the mother on separation. The father is a car spray painter. The father’s religious beliefs saw him disapprove of Charrouf attending dance parties. For his disobedience he would be physically disciplined by his father. In his early years Charrouf was not interested in pursuing his father’s religion but more recently that has changed. Both parents are strict Muslims. The Offender continues to maintain telephone contact with both.32 Charrouf lived, during his childhood, in Department of Housing accommodation in Riverwood until aged sixteen. His associates and peer groups in this period were involved in crime and substance abuse. The Offender left home at sixteen living in hotels selling drugs to support his own drug addiction. His family moved to Padstow. Charrouf returned to the family home but maintained his contacts with his Riverwood criminal associates. He realised when he went to prison he had lost contact with his Lebanese culture and Muslim faith. Since incarceration he has been praying regularly and now is more committed to Islam.Education, skills and employment 33 Charrouf attended Punchbowl Primary School. He had problems with poor concentration, inattention and difficulties with peers. Dr Jacqueline Barrett, a clinical psychologist, has assessed him as having extremely low intellectual ability (IQ equals 56). Whether those involved with his early education had this information is unclear. He was placed in special classes said to be due to behavioural problems. He received individual tutoring in reading, writing and maths yet would be sent home for discipline problems. He moved on to Narwee High School where his educational difficulties continued. He frequently fought with peers, would suddenly “snap” for no reason. In Year 8 he was expelled. He had begun truanting in Year 7 up to two to three days weekly. He left school in Year 9, attended TAFE in panel beating but absenteeism saw him expelled from that course. However, he did complete eighteen months of a two year welding, boiler making course. He has worked intermittently in both welding and panel beating. His main legitimate income stream was the Newstart allowance, although there was a period when he handed over the entire allowance to ease his mother’s financial strains as he had an undisclosed source of income.General health34 Charrouf’s physical health appears to be good. Dr Allnut, a forensic psychiatrist, who reviewed him for the defence checked all the vital signs and it would seem there were no real problems.Mental health issues35 Dr Allnut considered, but rejected, a diagnosis of bipolar effective disorder in favour of a diagnosis of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. 36 Dr Barrett accepted an earlier diagnosis made when the Offender was aged six of attention deficit with hyperactivity disorder. There may be little differences between those diagnoses. Dr Barrett has assessed Charrouf as functioning in the extremely low intellectual range. Her observation was he had an extremely poor fund of general knowledge related to problems of inattention, culture, language and limited school attendance. His limited general knowledge, she says;  
     
      
       
      “Will effect his learning ability, long term memory and verbal concept formation and ability for verbal abstract thinking. His reduced fund of general knowledge will mean he will struggle with verbal tasks that depend on acquired knowledge and being able to verbally conceptualise and express himself.” 
      
    She places him in the 0.2 percentile on the intellectual scale or range. She makes this point; 
     
      
      “Furthermore, his limited cognitive functioning means that he has a limited ability to see the consequences of his actions or to problem solve and find alternate ways of responding to situations particularly if these are novel or stressful situations”. 
      
    Drugs and alcohol37 This Offender has an extensive history of abusing illicit substances. His interest in illicit substances began at about age fifteen with cannabis. He was smoking two cones three times daily but within a year increased to five to six cones three times daily. At nineteen he claimed to be smoking two sticks, equivalent to 2 grams of cannabis, on a daily basis with his friends. That level of cannabis use is described by Dr Barrett as severe, indicating substance dependence.38 On occasions, when abusing cannabis, Charrouf would hear voices and become paranoid about police, parents and friends finding out about his substance abuse. Occasionally he would experience some grandiosity.39 Other substances were also abused. At fifteen he was using ecstasy and cocaine when partying. At sixteen he was smoking heroin because associates encouraged him. That drug, however, only attracted him for about a month and he has not used heroin since. At twenty he was using crystal methamphetamine having a weekly consumption of half a gram. His last abuse of illicit substances was on the day of his incarceration. He does not use inhalants or benzodiazepines. His abuse of alcohol is virtually nil because he does not like it. His last drink, prior to incarceration was on New Year’s Eve. 40 He is not the only drug abuser in his family. Both his older brother and twin also heavily abuse cannabis and other substances. To his credit he did an eight week drug and alcohol counselling course at the age of twenty but ultimately it had little effect, ultimately, in curbing his drug abuse.Character and antecedents41 Charrouf is a twenty-four year old single male. He appears to have strong ties with his family who are supportive of him although I note that his two older brothers are both drug abusers. His associates of choice appear to be the criminal milieu. 42 His criminal history commences in Sutherland Children’s Court in June 2001. He was before that court for an offence of robbery in company. In July of the same year there was another robbery in company which was dealt with later by the Sutherland Children’s Court. In fact there were another two. I note that he was to have drug and alcohol counselling and anger management counselling back then. In fact there is three of them.43 There are driving offences, goods in custody offences and fraudulent appropriation offences. He pleaded to stalk/intimidate with intent to cause physical or mental harm for which he was imprisoned for two and a half years. Robbery in company for which he was imprisoned for four years. Maliciously wound for which he was imprisoned for four years. There is an intimidate police officer in the execution of his duty before the Burwood Local Court.44 So the record is a substantial one with heavy crimes. Particularly noted in the record are crimes similar in character to the one that I am dealing with.45 His current sentence dates from 13 June 2006. The non parole period expires on 12 December 2010. That is an effective non parole period of four and a half years. His balance of term is eighteen months making an overall sentence that he is serving of six years. Those figures may be the result of composite sentences but that is the overall effect of them.Attitude to offence46 Charrouf pleaded not guilty. His case is he approached a drug dealer demanding the drug dealer stop supplying heroin to his older brother. There is no suggestion of contrition, nor of any insight into the contradictions inherent in this defence. That is, a younger brother in a Muslim family making demands on behalf of the older brother without that older brother’s knowledge in circumstances where all three brothers are all poly drug abusers. SETTING THE SENTENCE. A question of deterrence.47 Given Dr Barrett’s assessment of the intellectual capacity of this Offender he does not present as a suitable vehicle for general deterrence. I do, however, believe that his concrete thinking is capable of comprehending imprisonment as something he would wish to avoid in future. For that reason, imprisonment has some value as a personal deterrent and I have acted on that basis.TOTALITY48 In setting this sentence I am conscious it falls to be served subsequent to a sentence of six years in which an eighteen month balance of term was imposed. Given the Offender’s intellectual deficits he will need a substantial period on parole. Hopefully the length of the period on parole, coupled with knowledge that he would be returned to prison if he breached that parole, will provide some personal deterrences for him. 49 The sentence about to be imposed needs to pay homage to both totality and the need for an eighteen month balance of term. That can only be achieved by way of finding special circumstances. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years. Am I right on that Mr Low?HIS HONOUR: Would you stand up please Mr Charrouf. Mr Charrouf you are convicted of the offence that you, on 23 August 2005 at Riverwood, knowing that persons were in the place where the offence was committed, entered Anwar El Abbas’s dwelling house which you found at Roosevelt Avenue, Riverwood with an intention to commit a serious indictable offence, namely to intimidate another person with the intention of causing that other person to fear physical or mental harm. That other person was El Abbas. 50 For that offence I sentence you to a six month non parole period to date from 12 December 2010 and to expire on 11 June 2011 and I set an eighteen month balance of term. It is implicit in that that I found special circumstances. That term will expire on 11 December 2012. The effect of what I have done is to add six months to your non parole period and kept the eighteen month additional term as we used to call it.HIS HONOUR: I order the offender’s release on the offence that I am dealing with on 11 June 2011, pursuant to s 51 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I require or order that a condition of his parole be that he accepts supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and accept counselling in respect of alcohol, drugs and anger management. The Offender may be returned to custody.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 11 September 2006 by Boulton ADCJ following his conviction (after trial by judge alone) of a single count of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of not less than the large commercial quantity of prohibited plants (cannabis) contrary to s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. He has not appealed against the conviction. 
     
      
    3 By s 33 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  the conviction exposed the applicant to a maximum custodial penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. Boulton ADCJ sentenced the applicant to a total term of imprisonment for 8 years made up of a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 2 years, commencing 4 July 2006. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 In February 2003 a marijuana plantation was discovered on a property in Medowie. 3,831 cannabis plants were under cultivation, with a sophisticated irrigation system, machinery, fertiliser, living quarters and accommodation. It was described by the sentencing judge as “an organised, well-planned operation engaged in for commercial profit.” Evidence was given that the street value of the plants approximated eight million dollars. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was arrested and charged with being knowingly involved in the cultivation on 19 March 2003. Three other men were also arrested and charged – a man to whom I will refer as GB, another man identified in the Remarks on Sentence only as “Pasquale”, and Joseph Lucisano. Only Lucisano stood trial with the applicant. GB pleaded guilty and gave evidence in the trial. Pasquale absconded and, as far as can be ascertained, has never been brought to trial. 
     
      
    6 Having heard all the evidence in the trial, the sentencing judge was well placed to make an assessment of the relative involvement of the two accused. He found that the applicant was a “principal” in the enterprise; Lucisano “an aider pursuant to s 27 of [the Drug Misuse and Trafficking] Act.” His role was “much less” than that of the applicant or GB. He found that Lucisano visited the site four or five times in his own vehicle, bringing fertiliser on at least one occasion, cannabis seedlings on another; and was present when other relevant activities were being carried on. His Honour regarded this last as indicative of Lucisano’s knowledge of the magnitude of the operation.  
     
      
    7 His Honour found that the applicant recruited GB and gave him his instructions and that there was no evidence that the applicant and Pasquale received instructions from anybody else.  
     
      
    8 There is no challenge to any of these findings of fact. 
     
      
    9 GB was sentenced by Dodd DCJ to a total term of 2 years’ imprisonment, which was suspended. He had served 7 ½ months in pre-sentence custody and was allowed a sixty percent discount for the combined effect of his plea of guilty and the assistance he rendered to authorities in the prosecution of the applicant and Lucisano. 
     
      
    10 Boulton DCJ sentenced Lucisano to imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 6 months. Since parity of sentences is one of the grounds of the application it will be necessary to say some more about Lucisano, his role in the enterprise, and his subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    11 In respect of the applicant his Honour observed that, even after conviction, he continued to deny his involvement in the offence and found that this did not “bode well” for prospects of future rehabilitation. Although, in respect of Lucisano, he found that he was unlikely to re-offend, he did not make any parallel finding in relation to the applicant. This constitutes another ground of the application. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    12 The applicant was born in Italy in 1967 and was 36 years of age at the time of the offence. He had what, at first sight, appears to be a lengthy criminal history, but, on examination, this proves to have been largely comprised of traffic offences, of which there are many (but several of them sufficiently serious to have resulted in the imposition of custodial sentences); and there are also some offences associated with possession and/or use of drugs, three of which date back to 1990 and 1991, and one to 1995.  
     
      
    13 A pre-sentence report recounted a long history of drug use on the part of the applicant. He began smoking cannabis at 19 years of age and his use escalated rapidly. In about 1998 (when he would have been about 31 years of age) the applicant began using methylamphetamine intravenously; he was said to have been using it daily at the time of the offence. In 2004 he attempted a rehabilitation programme but discharged himself after a few weeks. 
     
      
    14 Although he has been in an “on again off again” relationship since about 2001, at the time of the offence and up to his incarceration he was living with his parents and two younger brothers. His father is very ill, having suffered three strokes, and also suffers from dementia. The applicant’s mother is the primary carer for his father but until his incarceration, relied upon the applicant for assistance. The family relationship is supportive. His partner also is supportive, although concerned about his need to address drug issues. 
     
      
    15 I have already mentioned the salient findings of fact made in respect of the applicant by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    16 The grounds of the application are specified as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) His Honour erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the principle of parity. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) His Honour erred in failing to find that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) His Honour erred in failing to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) His Honour erred in taking into consideration the applicant’s prior criminal convictions. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The sentence was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    17 It is convenient to deal first with those grounds that can be disposed of quickly.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Failure to find that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend; 
       
       
      Ground 3: Failure to find that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
       
      
    18 These grounds can be dealt with together. I have already set out the finding made about rehabilitation. This was based upon the applicant’s continued denial of his involvement. His Honour made no separate reference to the likelihood of re-offending – I perceive little, if any, difference between the two concepts. 
     
      
    19 In referring to the pre-sentence report, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This report makes mention of your lengthy period of illicit drug use commencing with cannabis and then proceeding to methylamphetamine. You have apparently been given an opportunity to address this problem, but have not to date done so. The report emphasises that continued failure to do so will very likely involve you with further contact with the law.” 
        
       
      
    20 The precise terms of the pre-sentence report were: 
     
      
       
        
        “Despite a short period in residential rehabilitation, Mr Licastro has completed no other intervention and will require to do so to avoid further contact with the law.” 
        
       
      
    21 On behalf of the applicant it was submitted that his Honour overstated and misinterpreted the effect of that passage in the pre-sentence report. It was argued that the author of the pre-sentence report did not regard further offending as “an inevitable outcome should the applicant fail to avail himself of intervention”, although that was said to be the gloss placed upon the report by his Honour. I do not accept that this is so. “Very likely” is far removed from “inevitable”; in my opinion, given the applicant’s history of drug use, and his failure to complete a rehabilitation programme, together with the caution expressed by the author of the pre-sentence report, (also, no doubt, based upon significant experience), it was not wrong for the judge to conclude that failure by the applicant to deal with his drug problem was “very likely” to result in his further offending. 
     
      
    22 Reliance was also placed on behalf of the applicant on his short term involvement in the rehabilitation programme as evidence of his willingness to pursue rehabilitation. In my opinion, that evidence points in precisely the opposite direction. The applicant’s sole involvement with any rehabilitation programme ended after only a few weeks with his discharging himself. There is nothing in this that would justify a finding that he was willing to pursue rehabilitation, or likely to succeed in it. 
     
      
    23 In my opinion, it would not have been open, on the evidence, for his Honour to make any supportable finding that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend. All the evidence pointed to the opposite conclusion. 
     
      
    24 I would reject these grounds of the application.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: Prior criminal convictions 
       
      
    25 This ground arises out of passages in the Remarks on Sentence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Much of your criminal history concerns traffic matters. You have several instances of driving whilst disqualified which have resulted in short terms of imprisonment or home detention, along with what appear to be some minor drug offences in New South Wales and Queensland in the very early 1990’s … while your earlier drug convictions were minor and approximately 15 years ago, your traffic history since has been quite serious and your disregard for the law.” 
        
       
      
    26 On the basis of these passages it was submitted that to regard a history of traffic offences as indicative of a “disregard for the law” was erroneous and resulted in undue weight being given to those offences. The submission went on to assert that the error resulted in the imposition of a fresh penalty for the applicant’s past offences. This latter is seriously to overstate what his Honour said. All his Honour said was that the long (and continuing) history of traffic convictions indicated a disregard for the law. Analysis of the traffic convictions shows no less than six offences of driving whilst disqualified from holding a licence, and three of driving whilst his licence was cancelled. These are no mere “traffic” offences; they amply demonstrate a disregard for the law. There can be no quarrel with the proposition stated by his Honour. There is no indication that the traffic convictions were taken into account as an aggravating factor. It is therefore unnecessary to consider yet again the effect of s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which has been the subject of much discussion in this Court: see, for example, R v Blair [2005] NSWCCA 78; 152 A Crim R 462. 
     
      
    27 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Parity 
       
      
    28 There is, plainly, a marked – even vast – discrepancy between the sentence imposed upon the applicant and that imposed upon Lucisano. In written submissions filed on behalf of the applicant it was put that the applicant received a non-parole period ten times greater than did Lucisano; in fact, the divergence is even greater. The applicant’s non-parole period of 72 months is 12 times that of the non-parole period to be served by Lucisano.  
     
      
    29 The question is whether the difference in circumstances justified or permitted that very significant discrepancy. 
     
      
    30 The most important aspect is, of course, the difference in the participation of the two men in the enterprise. His Honour regarded the applicant as a principal – his remarks concerning the absence of any evidence that he and Pasquale received instructions from any other quarter indicate that he regarded them as the true entrepreneurs. The evidence established that the applicant was actively involved in the work necessary for the cultivation and on occasions slept overnight on the property. He recruited at least one other participant, GB. 
     
      
    31 By contrast, Lucisano was a “worker”, who was shown to have visited the property on four or five occasions and to have acted on instructions. There appears to have been no evidence of the anticipated distribution of the financial rewards. 
     
      
    32 The subjective cases also distinguish between the two. His Honour made an express finding in respect of Lucisano that he was unlikely to re-offend. Lucisano was 56 years of age at the time of the offence, 59 at sentencing. He had no prior criminal convictions or contact with the law; he had a stable work history, although by the time of his apprehension, he was in receipt of a disability pension, for undisclosed reasons. 
     
      
    33 I find it unnecessary to restate the principles upon which parity of sentence requires equality of treatment in sentencing. Equality of sentencing, of course, depends primarily upon there being equality in offending, as well as equality in subjective circumstances. There is here no such equality (in either respect). 
     
      
    34 The criminal justice system is assiduous to pursue those who stand to gain the most from drug offending. While recognising that those who labour, usually for small reward, facilitate the enterprise and must therefore be punished accordingly, it also recognises that it is the entrepreneurs who warrant the greater wrath of the criminal law. The applicant can gain no comfort from the principles of parity in sentencing; it was necessary that he be punished as the entrepreneur he was found to be. 
     
      
    35 In oral argument reliance was placed upon the decision of the Court in R v McKenna [2007] NSWCCA 113. There the disparity in sentence was held to be “irrational”. In this case, there is a perfectly rational explanation for the disparity. There is nothing in McKenna that assists the applicant. The exposition of the principles concerning parity of sentencing demonstrates that parity here was hardly an issue. That is because of the significantly different positions of the two offenders. 
     
      
    36 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: Manifestly excessive 
       
      
    37 The only arguments advanced against this ground of appeal drew upon the propositions already put in respect of the grounds with which I have dealt. I find no basis for asserting that the sentence was manifestly excessive. I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    38 The orders I propose are that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    39 HIDDEN J: I must say that the ground of disparity of sentence has troubled me. The disparity is certainly marked. However, for the reasons Simpson J has articulated, it cannot be said to be outside the bounds of the legitimate exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. 
     
      
    40 I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J and with her Honour’s reasons.

    1 JAMES J: I agree with Hall J 
     
      
    2 HOEBEN J: I agree with Hall J and the order he proposes. 
     
      
    3 HALL J: The applicant pleaded guilty on 30 April 2007 at Parramatta District Court to one count of aggravated assault with intent to rob contrary to s.95(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. The circumstance of aggravation was the use of corporal violence upon the victim. The offence occurred on 17 May 2006 at 9.20 pm. 
     
      
    4 On 15 June 2007, the applicant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 18 months to commence on 21 July 2007 and to expire on 20 January 2009 with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 20 July 2010. 
     
      
    5 The sentencing judge, pursuant to s.32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 took into account an offence of failing to disclose the identity of other persons in his vehicle contrary to s.16(2) of the Law Enforcement (Power and Responsibilities) Act 2002. 
     
      
    6 On 12 February 2008, the applicant, by notice dated 12 February 2008, sought leave to appeal against the sentence imposed on him. The only ground of appeal proposed to be relied upon was in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge erred in concluding that a sentence of two years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months was manifestly inadequate and, in doing so, improperly constrained the exercise of his sentencing discretion.” 
        
       
       
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    7 The sentencing judge noted that the offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment. A statement of agreed facts (Exhibit A3) was tendered at the sentencing hearing (paragraphs 2, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14 and 26, however, were not agreed). 
     
      
    8 A hearing was conducted on the evidence to resolve the matters in dispute. The applicant gave evidence, as did the victim and his partner. In its written submissions, the Crown summarised the facts set out in the remarks on sentence and there was no issue as to its accuracy. I, accordingly, reproduce the summary set out in those submissions:- 
     
      
       
        
        “6. In May 2006, the victim and his partner Debra Wickham advertised eight Staffordshire terrier puppies for sale in the Trading Post at $600 per dog. 
        
       
       
        
        7. On 17 May 2006, 
          
        at approximately 9.20 pm, the victim and Ms Wickham received a phone call from the applicant who stated that he had earlier contacted the victim’s brother regarding the purchase of a puppy. The applicant was unknown to the victim and Ms Wickham. During the telephone call, arrangements were made to meet at the Shell Service Station located at Raw Square, Strathfield a short time later. At approximately 9.30 pm, the victim and Ms Wickham attended the Shell Service Station. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The applicant arrived in a car a short time later, in the company of another male and female. The female remained in the car. The other male, who remains unknown, approached the victim and Ms Wickham. The applicant asked to see the puppies. Mr Gerakis showed the applicant and the other male two puppies. The applicant stated: ‘I’ll take the male one. He has bigger paws’. The applicant asked how much the dogs cost. He was advised the price by the victim. A dispute arose over whether the price was negotiable. 
        
       
       
        
        9. During the dispute, the applicant placed his right hand into a fist and punched the victim directly in the mouth area. The punch was of sufficient force to split Mr Gerakis’ lip and he felt immediate pain (see photos exhibit A4). 
        
       
       
        
        10. A knife was visible in the front jacket pocket of the applicant at all times throughout the confrontation. The victim fought with the applicant and the applicant retreated to the waiting car with the other male and they left the scene. 
        
       
       
        
        11. Police arrived shortly afterwards. Police were later able to identify the applicant through the use of telephone records. On 11 July 2006, police conducted a photographic identification process with the victim and the victim identified the applicant, out of an array of 20 photographs, as being the man who assaulted him on 17 May 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        12. At 4.00 pm on 21 September 2006, police attended the home address of the applicant and arrested him. The applicant was conveyed to Hurstville Police Station where he participated in an electronically recorded interview with police. 
        
       
       
        
        13. The applicant initially denied contacting anyone through the Trading Post to purchase a puppy. He denied attending Shell Service Station at Strathfield. He also indicated that someone could have used his telephone when questioned in relation to the telephone records. 
        
       
       
        
        14. The applicant then made a number of admissions to the police. The applicant admitted that he had punched the victim after a dispute about the price of the puppy. He agreed that the injury caused to Mr Gerakis was as a result of the punch he landed on him. The applicant refused to supply police with the identity of the other two people in his car (this was the offence taken into account on the Form 1). 
        
       
       
        
        15. The sentencing judge found that the applicant only formed the intent to rob the victim when the altercation commenced (ROS 17.9). His Honour also found that the presence of the knife caused him to infer that there was some limited planning but that the offence was largely impulsive (ROS 18.2).” 
        
       
      
    9 The applicant’s date of birth is 5 August 1987. He was, accordingly, 18 years of age at the date of the offence and 19 years of age at the date of the sentencing hearing. 
     
      
    10 The remarks on sentence record the following findings:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I therefore do not accept that the offender motioned to remove a wallet from the victim, that the offender grabbed the victim by the back of the head and pulled him forward, that he produced a silver bladed double edged knife from his front jumper pocket and attempted to stab the victim by thrusting the knife forward, that the blade of the knife was caught in the victim’s jumper and did not penetrate the victim’s torso ara  
        [sic] 
        , that the blade was about 20 centimetres in length, that the offender said to Mr Gerakis, ‘If you know what’s good for you, let go of the pup’ and the offender then returned the knife to his front jacket pocket. 
        
       
       
        
        I accept only what Mr Gerakis said in his original statement, as he conceded in cross-examination, which was that a knife, the length of which he did not specify, was visible in the front jacket pocket of the offender at all times during their confrontation. That version of events, as opposed to that advanced by the Crown, which it must prove beyond reasonable doubt, makes a considerable difference to the approach I have taken to sentencing in this case, needless to say, in that it, together with the other undisputed facts as set out above, places this offence objectively below the mid-range of offences of its type in my view, though not at or near the bottom of that range. 
        
       
       
        
        Exhibit A, the Crown bundle, also contains two photographs of what looks like a fat lip sustained by Mr Gerakis in the assault, and they amply establish that he was the victim of a reasonably hard punch by the offender in that area, and I have taken that fact into account on sentencing.” 
        
       
      
    11 The sentencing judge noted that the applicant’s criminal history (recorded in Exhibit A) revealed that an offence of stalk/intimidate with intent to cause fear of mental or physical harm committed on 28 August 2005 was taken into account on a Form 1 on sentencing on 28 March 2007 in relation to other offences. On that date, the applicant was sentenced at the Parramatta District Court for an offence committed on 23 December 2005 of being an accessory after the fact to maliciously wound a person. He had earlier been charged with an offence of being an accessory after the fact to malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. The offence was not proceeded with, the Crown accepting the alternative plea of being an accessory after the fact to maliciously wound a person. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was sentenced for the abovementioned offences to a term of imprisonment of 18 months with a non-parole period of 10 months commencing on 22 September 2006 and expiring on 21 July 2007. The applicant was released subject to supervision, to undertake treatment and/or counselling in relation to drugs and alcohol and anger management. 
     
      
    13 The applicant’s history in a report by Mr Terry Smith, clinical psychologist (Exhibit 1 on the sentencing hearing), recorded that six months after receiving the suspended sentence, his cocaine dependency markedly increased. 
     
      
    14 The sentencing judge also noted that the applicant had been convicted in Sutherland Local Court on 16 February 2007 for offences of possession of a prohibited drug resulting in a term of imprisonment of three months, disposal of property being the proceeds of theft, being a serious indictable offence (imprisonment for one month), supply of a prohibited drug (two counts) resulting in a term of imprisonment for two concurrent terms of imprisonment of 16 months with a non-parole period of 10 months. The non-parole period was to expire on 21 July 2007. The sentencing judge observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no doubt that the offender’s prior criminal antecedents entitle him to no particular degree of leniency, to say the least, although his age does to a degree, because the authorities establish that questions of rehabilitation enter into sentencing young offenders to a greater degree than would normally be the case.” 
        
       
      
    15 The sentencing judge had regard to a pre-sentence report dated 14 June 2007 (Exhibit C) and to the report of Mr Smith dated 11 June 2007. He noted that there was no suggestion in the latter report of any psychological condition contributing to the applicant’s offending such as to attract leniency. 
     
      
    16 The applicant pleaded guilty on the first day the proceedings were listed for trial. He had earlier indicated that he would enter a plea of guilty if reference to any knife was removed from the statement of facts. 
     
      
    17 The applicant was given a 20% reduction for his plea of guilty, the starting point for the sentence imposed being three years and nine months. 
     
      
    18 The applicant was on bail for the offence of intimidation when he committed the offence the subject of this appeal. 
     
      
       
      Applicant’s submissions 
       
      
    19 Ms Francis of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the applicant, in her written submissions recorded the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1.3 A disputed facts hearing was resolved largely in favour of the applicant inasmuch as the sentencing judge was not satisfied that the applicant produced a knife during the altercation. His Honour commented that he was unimpressed with the victim’s demeanour. 
        
       
       
        
        1.4 The sentencing judge did not find that the offence was premeditated and he was satisfied it was an impulsive act in the context of an argument. 
        
       
       
        
        1.5 His Honour stated during the proceedings on sentence that he felt that a head sentence of two years with a non-parole period of 12 months was appropriate (T 15/06/07, p.21, line 44 to 46, and later p.22, line 51 to 57). In response to this indication, the Crown suggested that his Honour would fall into appellable error if he imposed such a sentence (T 15/06/07, p.26, line 13). 
        
       
       
        
        1.6 His Honour acceded to this submission, which was made without reference to any relevant authority, and he stated in the remarks on sentence (ROS) at p.19.3:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘After reflection during the morning adjournment and on consideration of what was said in Mason and Tuncbilek, the two authorities given to me by the Crown, and of the figures appearing in the statistics, the latter to a lesser degree, I considered that I would fall into appealable error by imposing such a sentence, as indeed was the Crown’s submissions before the morning adjournment. After anxious reconsideration, and some regret at having made an indication in relation to sentence which I later formed the view was inadequate, I have decided that a total sentence of three years, divided into a non-parole period of 18 months and a parole period of 18 months is appropriate, dating from the date of expiry of the current non-parole periods, namely 21 July 2007, as the Crown submits it should.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        1.7 The reference in the above passage to two cases was a reference to R v Daniel Mason [2000] NSWCCA 207 and R v Tuncbilek [2004] NSWCCA 139. Neither of these cases supported the proposition that a sentence of two years comprising a non-parole period of 12 months was manifestly inadequate in the unusual circumstances of this case. It has been repeatedly observed by this Court that reference to statistics, which say nothing about the facts of a case, does not establish that a particular sentence is outside of a legitimate exercise of discretion. In acceding to the mere assertion of the Crown that two years with a non-parole of 12 months was legally erroneous, his Honour has fallen into error. 
        
       
       
        
        1.8 His Honour allowed a 20% discount for the plea of guilty, the starting point thereby being three years and nine months imprisonment. The applicant asked that the sentencing judge take into account one offence on a form one of Passenger Not disclose Driver/Passenger when being sentenced for the principal offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground One. The sentencing judge erred in concluding that a sentence of two years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 12 months was manifestly inadequate and in so doing improperly constrained the exercise of his sentencing discretion.” 
        
       
      
    20 Ms Francis emphasised the applicant’s age at the date of the offence and that his past criminal history was “recent” and relevantly contained only two entries before the commission of the subject offence – accessory after the fact to malicious wounding and the offence of intimidation taken into account on a Form 1. She acknowledged there were offences after the subject offence but noted that they were of a different nature. 
     
      
    21 Ms Francis also referred to the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That the sentence imposed was cumulative to the 10 month sentence being served at the time of the sentencing hearing. 
       
       
      (2) The applicant’s expressed remorse both in this evidence and to the psychologist. 
       
      
    22 Reference was also made in the submissions on behalf of the applicant to the applicant having left school at Year 10, the completion by him of a panel beating course, a history of mild hyperactivity disorder, the bad influence of others leading to a short period of cocaine use and the lack of assistance to help him in drug rehabilitation before committing the subject offence. 
     
      
    23 Mr Francis acknowledged that an aggravating feature of the offence was that the subject offence was committed whilst the applicant was on bail, but reliance was placed upon the impulsive nature of the offence as found by the sentencing judge. Reference was made to the following observations in the remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “This brings me to the appropriate length of the offender’s sentence. I accept, as the Crown submitted, that there are aggravating features here consisting of the present offence occurring at a time when the offender was on conditional liberty, he having been on bail in respect of the matters for which he was subsequently sentenced as set out in his criminal antecedents, that there was a very limited degree of planning involved in the present offence, and that there is a record of prior offences relevant only to the issue of individual deterrence rather than as an aggravating feature of the offence itself, in accordance with authority. That is to say prior offending is only relevant on the issue of deterrence of this particular offender, and I accept that it is so here to a small degree, in view of the relatively limited nature of the prior record, although I note it consists of offences similar to the present one.” 
        
       
      
    24 It was contended for the applicant that the trial judge had been in error in stating that a sentence of two years was “effectively outside of an available range or in other words manifestly inadequate”: see paragraph 1.6 of the appellant’s submissions set out in paragraph [19] of this judgment. It was submitted that this statement amounted to an erroneous constraint upon his Honour’s discretion. A sentence of two years, it was contended, was not outside the reasonable range. It was also contended, “This is particularly so when considering the application of the principle [of] totality in respect of which his Honour was silent” (paragraph 4.1 of the applicant’s written submissions). 
     
      
    25 Ms Francis placed reliance upon what was said to be an analogous error referred to by Rothman J (with whom James and Harrison JJ agreed) in relation to Kutchera v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 121 at [42] to [44]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “42. To describe, as did his Honour, the suspension of the custodial sentence imposed as being ‘an erroneous exercise of my sentencing discretion’ and as ‘outside a proper exercise of sentencing discretion’ is to treat a suspended sentence in his case as outside the range available. As I have made clear, it was not outside the range, as the Crown conceded.  
        
       
       
        
        43. To preclude consideration of an available outcome is an error of law. To treat a suspended sentence as an unavailable result, when it is within range, is an error capable of being remedied on appeal. His Honour has erred in treating the suspension of the sentence as out of range.  
        
       
       
        
        44. The above should not be taken as a counsel of perfection. This Court is not unmindful of the pressures on District Court judges and it is not appropriate to comb through remarks on sentence or judgments, especially those delivered ex tempore, looking for infelicitous expressions. However, there is a fundamental difference of approach between a determination, in the circumstances of a particular case, not to suspend even though it is within range and the determination of a sentence on the basis that, after ‘carefully considering’ submissions, a suspended sentence would be ‘outside a proper exercise’ or an ‘erroneous exercise’ of the discretion available. I find error and I am required to deal with the provisions of s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW).” 
        
       
       
      The Crown’s submissions 
       
      
    26 The Crown succinctly set out its submissions in relation to the proposed ground of appeal in paragraphs 21 to 27, which I reproduce below:- 
     
      
       
        
        “21. During the submissions by the applicant’s then counsel at the proceedings on sentence, the sentencing judge indicated that he was ‘thinking of a non-parole period of a year dated from today’s date’ and ‘a parole period … of a year’ (POS, t.p.21, lines 45 – 51). The solicitor appearing on behalf of the Crown responded by submitted that such a sentence would be ‘appealable error, that’s too low’ (POS, t.p.21, lines 53 – 54). The sentencing judge was later assisted by relevant case law, Judicial Commission statistics and oral submissions on the question of objective seriousness (POS 24. line 48 – POS 28, line 45). 
        
       
       
        
        22. Although the offence of aggravated assault with intent to rob contrary to s.95(2)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 is not expressly referred to in the guideline decision in  
        Regina v Henry 
         (1999) 46 NSWLR 34  
        [sic] 
        , the maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment is the same and it has been held that the decision in  
        Henry 
         is still of assistance with dealing with robbery offences which carry the same maximum penalty of 20 years:  
        R v Murchie 
         (1999) 108 A Crim R 482 at [20];  
        R v Stanley 
         [2003] NSWCCA 233 at [13]-[14]. The sentencing judge was referred to the decision of  
        R v Tuncbilek 
         [2004] NSWCCA 139 at [19] and [20] in this regard (see ROS 16.2). 
        
       
       
        
        23. The sentencing judge’s attention was also drawn to the decision in  
        Regina v Daniel Mason 
         [2000] NSWCCA 207, dealing with the relevant sentencing principles for this offence generally (ROS 16.2), and also to the Judicial Commission statistics for this offence (ROS 12.9 – 13.3). 
        
       
       
        
        24. Having had the opportunity to consider the matter further the sentencing judge apologized to the applicant for giving an early indication as to the possible sentence and informed him that he was of the view that that early indication was ‘manifestly inadequate’ (POS, t.p.27, lines 3 – 11). 
        
       
       
        
        25. In forming the view that the appropriate sentence was a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 18 months the sentencing judge had regard to the relevant extrinsic aids to assist him in the exercise of sentencing the applicant. To do so was an appropriate exercise of his sentence discretion. As the Court observed in  
        R v Way 
         (2004) NSWLR 168 at [122] in the context of using standard non-parole periods as a reference point:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘In this approach the standard non-parole period can properly take its place as a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost, along with the other extrinsic aids such as authorities, statistics, guideline judgments and the specified maximum penalty, as are applicable and relevant. In particular, it can have a direct relevant as a reference point to be compared with the sentence which is provisionally reached after an assessment ahs been made of the relative seriousness of the subject offence, and of the various aggravating and mitigating factors, as well as any other subjective factor that may be present, including in particular the fact, if it be the case, that the applicant entered a plea of guilty.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        26. Consistent with this approach the sentencing judge provisionally reached a sentence and then having had regard to extrinsic aids such as the relevant case law, guideline judgment in  
        Henry 
         and the Judicial Commission statistics, formed a view that a higher sentence should be imposed. 
        
       
       
        
        27. It is not contended on behalf of the applicant that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge is manifestly excessive. Rather, it is contended that his Honour erred in not imposing the sentence he had provisionally indicated he would imposed before he had regard to the extrinsic aids referred to above.” 
        
       
      
    27 The Crown, in oral submissions, did not dispute the point that the offence, involving aggravated assault with intent to rob under s.95, was in the low range of offences but submitted it was not at the bottom of the range.  
     
      
    28 The Crown, in this respect, referred to the fact that the offence was aggravated by the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence and that the sentencing judge was justified in taking the view that his prior criminal antecedents entitled him to no particular degree of leniency. It was noted that the sentencing judge determined that there had been a limited amount of planning involved in the offence. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    29 The submissions on sentence before the sentencing judge commenced on 15 June 2007. At an early point, the Crown provided him with a copy of the judgment of this Court in Regina v Tuncbilek [2004] NSWCCA 139. Reference was made to this Court’s observations in that case in paragraph [20] to the fact that the Henry guideline (Regina v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346) may provide a reference point for judges sentencing robbery offenders who fall outside the guideline. 
     
      
    30 Later and during submissions (at t.21), the sentencing judge said that he was thinking of a non-parole period of 12 months dating from 15 June 2007 following upon which the Crown Prosecutor observed that such a sentence would be appellable error and would be “too low” and referred again to the “guideline judgment”, the objective seriousness and to the subjective factors. 
     
      
    31 The sentencing judge then continued to receive submissions, principally on behalf of the applicant with the Crown later making some further brief submissions on the issue of the knife and the Henry guideline “which is a four or five year head sentence (t.25). 
     
      
    32 The sentencing judge then responded by saying a period of that length was not appropriate for an offence “that falls short of actual robbery” (t.25). 
     
      
    33 The Crown referred to the sentencing statistics which indicated 52% of offenders received a sentence of between 38 and 48 months and repeated what had been said earlier, namely, that a sentence on the basis of a non-parole period of 12 months with a 12 months parole period “would be appellable error” (t.26). The Crown, again, referred to the sentencing statistics and restated the matters that were said to put the applicant “in a category of greater seriousness than most offenders who are his age …” (t.26). 
     
      
    34 There was then a short adjournment. When the hearing resumed, the sentencing judge made the statement set out in paragraph 1.6 of the written submissions for the applicant (see paragraph [19] of this judgment) indicating that he had revised his assessment. Importantly, he then referred to the sentencing statistics and to the judgment in Tuncbilek (supra) and to the judgment of the Court in Regina Mason [2000] NSWCCA 207 indicating that those judgments were of significance to the determination of the sentence – more so than the statistics which he said only provided “a very broad indication as to the parameters of sentencing” but nonetheless indicated that they were of some assistance. 
     
      
    35 I do not consider that the passage in the remarks on sentence criticised in the applicant’s written submissions reveals error as argued for the applicant. A close examination of the transcript and the remarks on sentence establishes the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) When the sentencing judge made the comment  
      “… I’m thinking of a non-parole period of a year dated from today’s date …” 
      , he had not reached a firm conclusion. 
       
       
      (2) At the time of that comment, he had not given consideration, as the Crown submitted, to either the sentencing statistics or the full import of the judgments in  
      Mason 
       (supra) or  
      Tuncbilek  
      (supra). 
       
       
      (3) It was following upon consideration of those matters that the sentencing judge considered he would fall into error if he imposed a sentence as he earlier had been  
      “thinking” 
       of doing. That was no more than saying that such a sentence would, following consideration, be wrong in the sense that it would not be an appropriate or sufficient reflection of the seriousness of the offence. 
       
      
    36 In the circumstances, it was open to the sentencing judge to revise his earlier evaluation or assessment which was expressed in provisional or tentative terms. I do not consider that his Honour went as far as was argued, namely, “erroneously limiting the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion” (t.1). 
     
      
    37 It is not correct to say that the Crown Prosecutor’s statement to the effect that a non-parole period of 12 months would give rise to appellable error was a statement made without reference to authority. The guideline judgment in Henry (supra) was a relevant reference point as stated in Tuncbilek (supra) at [20]. The Crown Prosecutor was entitled to rely upon those authorities in making the submission. 
     
      
    38 I do not see, in the particular circumstances, that the sentencing judge’s observation that a sentence involving a non-parole period of 12 months with a 12 months parole period would involve appellable error gives rise to the same point made in Kutchera (supra) at 42. 
     
      
    39 The remarks on sentence as to what his Honour ultimately considered was the appropriate sentence was the culmination of a process of assessment. It was not, in my opinion, driven by some notion or concept that two years was not a sentencing option that was available. The sentencing judge’s observation that he would fall into appellable error by imposing the sentence he had earlier mentioned on a provisional basis occurred, it is true, shortly after the Crown submission to that effect. However, the sentence ultimately determined was clearly the product of a careful reconsideration of his earlier indication in light of relevant case law and sentencing statistics that had been brought to his attention. The sentence could not, in those circumstances, be considered to have been affected by some self-imposed constraint on the sentencing discretion as was submitted for the applicant. 
     
      
    40 I, accordingly, am of the opinion that there is no substance to the proposed ground of appeal. I consider that the sentence imposed appropriately took into account the seriousness of the offence and the relevant mitigating factors. 
     
      
    41 Accordingly, the orders I propose are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
       
       
      (2) Appeal dismissed.

    1 HIS HONOUR: There are before the Court a number of applications to exclude evidence. These applications are brought on behalf of Omar Jamal. 
     
      
       
      First Issue 
       
      
    2 The first issue relates to three questions and answers (Q86-Q88 inclusive) in a record of interview between Detective Sergeant Moroney and Jamal conducted on 21 December 2005. They are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. 86 And you mentioned you work in computers, what type of work in relation to computers do you do? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Technician. 
        
       
       
       
        
        Q. 87 Technician? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yeah, I'm not like qualified or anything but I just know a bit about computers. 
        
       
       
       
        
        Q. 88 And is that just through your own self education? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yep.” 
        
       
      
    3 The Crown has submitted that Mr Jamal's interest and expertise in relation to computers is a matter that is generally relevant in relation to certain aspects of the Crown case. On reflection, Mr Scragg conceded that this may be so, but asked that the particular issue be left for further negotiation between the Crown and himself. I agreed to this course, so there is no need for me to take the matter further at this stage.  
     
      
       
      Second Issue 
       
      
    4 Mr Scragg wishes to exclude evidence of answers given to questions 39 and 40 on page 4 of the record of interview between Detective Senior Constable Liddiard and Omar Jamal conducted on 8 November 2005 (Exhibit “A”). The questions and answers are in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. 39 All right. I'm now going to explain what an identification parade is, for your information, and we would line you up with a number of people of similar appearance to yourself and we would have a witness see if they can identify you in relation to that incident. You don't have to participate in an identification parade as any evidence obtained in that identification parade may be later used in Court, do you understand that? 
        
       
       
        
        A. Yes, well, I don't, don't want to accept. 
        
       
       
       
        
        Q. 40 You don't want to take part in an identification parade? 
        
       
       
        
        A. I don't want to take part at all.” 
        
       
      
    5 In its submissions, the Crown indicated that, since there would be a general attack on the reliability of the identification evidence to be tendered by the Crown, it wished to place before the jury, either by tendering the two questions and answers from Exhibit “A”, or by way of an agreed fact, that Jamal had been invited to participate in a lineup but, in accordance with his entitlement to do so, had declined to participate.  
     
      
    6 Mr Scragg sought to oppose any mention of Jamal’s participation in a line-up. In particular, he opposed the jury being told that his client had declined to take part in an identification parade. (Later, Ms Yehia, on behalf of her client Hasan, indicated that she also supported Mr Scragg's position, insofar as her client had been involved in identification procedures). 
     
      
    7 Mr Scragg tendered Exhibit 1. This was the statement of Detective Sergeant Nicholas Read. It demonstrated that, at about 12.20pm on 8 November 2007, DS Read spoke to the solicitor for the eight accused in custody at that time. This was a reference to Mr Adam Houda. The statement indicates that Detective Sergeant Read was informed by Mr Houda that the latter intended to advise all of the accused to refuse participation in any identification parade or parades.  
     
      
    8 Mr Scragg made three points. First, he indicated that there would be no suggestion made by him before the jury that the police procedure was in any way flawed by a failure to have or hold an identification parade relating to his client. Secondly, Mr Scragg argued that any mention of the relevant conversation would carry with it a criticism of his client or, at least, convey an inference unfavourable to his client. 
     
      
    9 Mr Scragg suggested that a similar situation might arise in relation to his client's refusal to participate in a record of interview. Although Mr Scragg, in this regard, suggested that a direction to the jury that his client was entitled to exercise his right to silence would be appropriate, he opposed the inclusion of any evidence to indicate that his client had declined to take part in an identification parade. 
     
      
    10 Thirdly, Mr Scragg disputed the Crown's assertion that evidence of this kind was frequently placed before juries.  
     
      
    11 None of the parties, during oral submissions, referred me to any authorities on the point. As I said during argument, the point is a small but important one. Before resolving the issue, I would like to make a preliminary point. The Court has now been engaged on an intensive series of pre-trial applications for approximately five months. I should record that, generally speaking, I have found the diligence of counsel, both Crown and defence, of considerable assistance in relation to deciding a number of difficult questions. In the main, submissions have been thorough and well researched. The Court has been provided with authorities where they have been likely to assist the Court in coming to a decision. I have very much appreciated that assistance. 
     
      
    12 In this particular matter, by way of contrast, I have had to research the point for myself after the conclusion of oral submissions. Where the Court does not have the full assistance of counsel in this way, errors can be made and matters of importance can be decided without the assistance of relevant authority. My remarks here are directed to both the Crown and the defence. I would exhort the parties to maintain the highly professional standards that have been evident to date. I would urge counsel to research any point in issue prior to submissions, and to provide the Court with those authorities if they may be of assistance.  
     
      
    13 I return to the point at issue. There is a body of authority on the point. In my view, that authority favours the Crown position in relation to the present dispute.  
     
      
    14 In McCarthy & Ryan (1993) 71 A Crim R 395 at 404 the Ndew South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal addressed a trial judge's decision to admit into evidence the fact that the accused had declined to participate in an identification parade. Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Wood and Smart JJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The next complaint in relation to evidence was the admission of the fact that McCarthy had declined to participate in an identification parade. The evidence was clearly admissible, to enable the Crown to explain why evidence which the jury may well have expected to be led was not being led: CF  
        Claridge 
         (unreported) Court of Criminal Appeal NSW, 15 May 1992, pages 12-13. The practice of holding identification parades is well known within the community. The Crown was not obliged to wait for McCarthy to raise some issue about such a parade before it was entitled to explain its absence. Otherwise, if an accused remained silent and nothing is said about it, the jury may well draw an inference adverse to the Crown: CF  
        Reeves 
         (1992) 29 NSWLR 109 at 115. When such evidence is given, however, the Judge should give a direction, as soon as the evidence is given, and, if necessary, again in the summing-up - to make it clear to the jury that the accused had a fundamental right to decline to participate in an identification parade and that his exercise of that right must not lead to any conclusion by them that he is guilty.” 
        
       
      
    15 More recently, the same subject arose in the Court of Appeal in Victoria. This appears from the joint judgment of Charles and Nettle JJA (with whom Hansen AJA agreed). The case is reported as R v Andrew Timothy Davies (2005) 11 VR 314; (2005) 153 A Crim R 217. The joint judgment endorsed the approach of Hunt CJ at CL, as reflected both in Reeves and in McCarthy & Ryan. 
     
      
    16 In relation to the passage I have extracted from the latter decision, the Victorian Court of Appeal said (at 12): 
     
      
       
        
        “With respect we agree. Accordingly we consider that the learned trial judge was right to rule as he did. We add that his Honour's clear directions to the jury left no doubt that the evidence of refusal to participate in an identification parade did not suggest and was not to be interpreted as suggestive of guilt.” 
        
       
      
    17 In relation to the allied question as to whether the jury should be told that an accused had been invited to participate in a record of interview, I would refer to two of my own decisions in R v Ronen (unreported) 12 August and 10 November 2004. These decisions placed particular reliance on the remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in Reeves' case.  
     
      
    18 There are three reasons why the principles referred to in the above cases dictate a conclusion that the relevant evidence should be placed before the jury in the present matter. First, there is the general matter adverted to by Hunt CJ at CL. This is the proposition that juries will well know that an identification parade is commonly held where there is an issue about the identification of an accused person. Consequently, they may well speculate about whether such an identification parade was held in a particular matter and, without clarification they may be prepared to draw the inference, adversely to the Crown, that there has been ineffective or sloppy police procedure involved in a particular trial. 
     
      
    19 Secondly, this may occur even when there is no precise mention of the absence of an identification parade by either Crown or defence in their arguments before the jury. Mr Scragg, of course, has made it clear that he will not make any such critical submission before the jury. But, as I have said, the thought may well occur to the jury in any event. The Crown is entitled to avoid such speculative criticism and this can best be done by allowing the tender of the evidence (or by an agreed statement), provided that the appropriate direction is immediately given to the jury to reinforce the accused's absolute entitlement to decline to participate, and to reinforce that no adverse inference in that regard should be drawn against the accused.  
     
      
    20 Thirdly, there is the undoubted fact that in this trial there will be a number of issues relating to the identification not only of Mr Jamal, but also perhaps of other accused, and indeed other persons. There will necessarily be different critical aspects of each identification process as and when they might arise. The situation of the array of photographs shown to an overseas witness which resulted in the identification of Moustafa Cheikho is a good example. 
     
      
    21 In a trial where there are likely to be a number of different issues involving the alleged identification of a number of people, it seems to me to be particularly appropriate that the jury should be told whether or not an identification parade was offered and whether it was declined. Provided the appropriate direction, as dictated by Petty v The Queen (1991) 173 CLR 95 is given, I do not consider that the matters of concern to Mr Scragg will legitimately arise.  
     
      
       
      Third issue 
       
      
    22 On 8 December 2005 Detectives Moroney and Liddiard attended Jamal's residence without notice to him or his solicitor. There then occurred a relatively lengthy conversation between Mr Moroney and the accused in connection with the investigation. It appears (although this has not been fully argued before me on both sides) that the conversation, if pressed, would be likely to be excluded as evidence obtained improperly or illegally (s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995). 
     
      
    23 In this regard, Mr Scragg has pointed to obligations placed on police officers by ss 23F and 23G of the Crimes Act (Cth) 1914. In certain circumstances, a person under interrogation is entitled to be cautioned before questioning, and entitled to be informed of his rights to communicate with a friend, relative and legal practitioner.  
     
      
    24 Mr Scragg argued that, were the conversation to be pressed by the Crown, they ought be ruled inadmissible under s 138 of the Evidence Act. Mr Scragg argued that the motive for Detective Moroney's approach on 8 December appeared to be to give the accused an opportunity to turn Crown evidence and, in that regard, to strengthen the Crown case against the other co-accused. 
     
      
    25 Counsel made reference to Exhibit 2, a document obtained pursuant to discovery. The note comes from the notebook of Detective Joseph and discusses the contents of a meeting between the detectives on 7 December 2005 at 4.30pm. The note refers to a proposal to ""rattle the cage"" by making an approach to Mr Jamal. Mr Scragg says it is open to infer that the approach made on 8 December 2005, and the ensuing conversation, were evidence of the detectives ""rattling the cage"".  
     
      
    26 The Crown does not seek to lead the contents of the conversation at trial. All the Crown seeks to lead is that the police attended at Jamal's premises on 8 December 2005, and that they spoke to him in connection to the investigation of the present matter. 
     
      
    27 The relevance of those facts, according to the Crown submission, is that they are to be viewed against the background of the attendance by the police on the following day with a warrant for Jamal's arrest. Against the background of the events of both 8 and 9 December 2005, the Crown will argue that the subsequent actions of Jamal were consistent with his acting to flee and avoid apprehension. In other words, the Crown will rely on his conduct between 9 December 2005 and the date of his ultimate arrest on 20 December 2005 as conduct showing consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    28 There is no need for me to detail all the evidence that relates to the alleged flight. It includes, however, evidence that Jamal had changed his appearance and, in particular, that he was clean shaven. It also relates to a number of the items which were found in his possession when he was arrested on 20 December. For example, he was found with clothes, toiletries, sleeping bag and the like.  
     
      
    29 It is fair to say there was a relatively heated debate between the Crown and Mr Scragg as to whether the limited facts should be admitted. Mr Scragg accused the Crown of wanting to use the fact of an illegally obtained conversation (even though it was not relying on its content) to act as a launch pad or springboard for the arguments about consciousness of guilt. Secondly, Mr Scragg adverted to the problems that might confront his client if he wanted to give evidence explaining his absence from his home between 9 and 20 December 2005. It might necessarily involve him in referring to the prohibited conversations.  
     
      
    30 I accept that there is a delicate but genuine point of distinction involved in this particular dispute between the parties. I suggested two possible compromises during the course of argument. Ultimately, I considered that the Crown would be entitled to lead evidence that the police attended Mr Jamal's home on 9 December 2005 and that the attendance was in connection with the investigation. It seemed to me that the Crown would be entitled to use those limited facts as some type of springboard for the material it relied upon to support an assertion of conduct evidencing consciousness of guilt. It would not involve any mention of the conversation at all. I should add that there will be a live issue at trial as to whether Mr Jamal's conduct, if it may be so described, evidenced consciousness of guilt in the sense contended for by the Crown.  
     
      
    31 The second compromise suggestion I made was somewhat more expansive but was still quite limited. This was a suggestion that the parties might agree that the police attended Jamal's home on 9 December 2005 in connection with the investigation, and that Jamal became aware of that fact. The latter fact seems to me to be quite neutral. 
     
      
    32 Upon reflection, I consider that the second of these two suggestions might be the one that would be more acceptable to the defence. I say this because it should remove any speculation as to how it was that Jamal knew of the visit by the police on the day in question. 
     
      
    33 The problem with the first suggestion is that it leaves it up in the air completely as to whether Jamal was or was not aware of the police visit. This may, in turn, albeit quite unintentionally, lead to the need for or emergence of some evidence as to the existence of a conversation between he and the police on that day. That, in turn, might raise a query in the jury’s mind as to what was said. 
     
      
    34 In all the circumstances, however, I would be prepared to allow either suggested compromise to be implemented by the Crown at trial. If, however, Mr Scragg decides that the second suggestion is less suitable to his client's interest, then I will confine the Crown to the first and more limited suggestion. 
     
      
       
      Fourth issue 
       
      
    35 The final issue relates to a paragraph occurring in the transcript of the search warrant conversations relating to the execution of a warrant on 8 November 2005 at 15 Punchbowl Road, Belfield.  
     
      
    36 In that transcript, Jamal says: 
     
      
       
        
        “For one thousand four hundred years the Koran has never ever been changed. 'Til this day it's proven by even Christian scholars that it has never been changed. All the other books have been changed except this book. If you do not believe you see where you're gonna end up. Allah is gonna put youse into a fire. Well Allah heats the most disgraceful fire that can ever be and youse, well Allah, youse are gonna regret every single thing that youse ever did from the day youse were born. Remember that. Fourteen hundred years, never been changed, and if you don't believe in it you'll see what's gonna happen to you. Allah is gonna take care of you. Allah curses youse all. Allah curses youse and your children and your wife. Allah curse all of youse. May Allah put a disease in your body. All your bodies. May Allah put a very great disease in there so youse can just rot slowly. May Allah put a very big disease. May Allah curse youse, your children and your wives...A great disease in your body and your family doesn't ever help youse. Keep it there...” 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Scragg submits that the passage should not be led at trial. He argued that nothing in it was relevant to the trial. All the passage will do, he argued is generate a degree of prejudice against his client. 
     
      
    38 Mr Scragg also referred to the circumstances in which the statement was made by his client, namely that Jamal’s house had been invaded at 3am, and that his family were being detained and that he was concerned for them. He himself was handcuffed. Mr Scragg submitted that, in those circumstances, the statements could not be seen as an extremist point of view in the context of the present trial.  
     
      
    39 The Crown argued that Jamal's statement was highly relevant on the issues in the trial, especially his discussion about his religion in the context of destroying or harming those that disagree with it.  
     
      
    40 In my view, the conversation is relevant to the issues in the trial. I allow that Mr Jamal would have been upset and angry at the circumstances in which he and his family were placed. The passage, however, was delivered in a very calm manner and, indeed, in a very intent manner. It was not an explosion of anger such as overtook Moustafa Cheikho in relation to an outburst I excluded from trial in an earlier series of rulings. It is its very deliberateness that sets it apart from the Moustafa Cheikho example.  
     
      
    41 It is, in my opinion, capable of being seen as the expression of an ""extremist"" point of view. On the other hand, it may be explained, as I have no doubt Mr Scragg will endeavour to do, as simply a reaction from a man finding himself in very unpleasant and distressing circumstances. Those different perspectives of the statement highlight that, in the ultimate, the weight to be attached to the evidence will be a matter for the jury. In my view, however, it passes the threshold for the broad test of relevance contained in s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    42 There may be a subsequent application involving, as I understand it, a general defence argument about the use of the word ""extremist"" in the trial. I have not heard that argument and I would not wish to foreclose any appropriate discussion about the use of the expression at trial. The remarks, however, of Robert F Kennedy, dealing with political extremism, are not entirely inappropriate to the present discussion. The late Senator Kennedy is reputed to have said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is objectionable, what is dangerous about extremists, is not that they are extreme, but that they are intolerant...the evil is not what they say about their cause, but what they say about their opponents.” 
        
       
      
    43 In any event, I consider that the passage is relevant and I do not think it should be excluded under s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    44 In view of the fact that a number of these rulings will require some further discussion between the Crown and Mr Scragg, I will simply make an order dismissing the motion. If any further arguments are necessary, they can be ventilated separately and at a later stage.

      JUDGMENT 
        
       
       
      1. This is a ruling about three pieces of evidence. The leading of those pieces of evidence raises questions under section 293 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
       and under section 137 of the  
      Evidence Act 1995 
      . In other words, they raise questions as to whether I ought to allow evidence concerning the sexual experience or otherwise of the complainant and a question as to whether such evidence must be refused to be admitted because its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfairness to the accused. 
       
       
      2. The three pieces of evidence are these. The first is contained in a record of interview given by the accused in this case. He is facing a charge of sexual assault without consent contrary to section 61I of the  
      Crimes Act 1900 
      . The events are alleged to have occurred between the complainant and the accused who had not met before the evening, but who had spent the evening together with others, drinking alcohol. In his record of interview, the accused said that the complainant, shortly before the sexual encounter which he says was consensual, complained to him about her own sexual relationship with her partner. That evidence is to be led by the prosecution when it, in due course, tenders the record of interview. 
       
       
      3. The second piece of evidence has already been led. They were answers in response to questions put by defence counsel to the complainant. In those questions, defence counsel put to the complainant the account given by his client in the record of interview about what he claimed she told him concerning her sexual relationship with her partner. 
       
       
      4. The third piece of evidence is yet to be led and has prompted the ruling being given at this time and these reasons being given now. The trial advocate is about to re-examine the complainant. The complainant, in response to defence counsel’s questions alleging that she had complained to the accused about her sexual relationship with her partner, denied that she made any such complaints. The trial advocate wishes to ask the complainant in re-examination about the nature of the complainant’s relationship with her partner. The trial advocate anticipates that the complainant will respond that it was a normal healthy sexual relationship and had none of the features which the accused claimed, in his record of interview, that the complainant complained to him about. 
       
       
      5. The ruling which I must give about the first piece of evidence concerns s293 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      . The evidence contained in the record of interview of assertions made by the accused is evidence that discloses or implies that the complainant had sexual experience. Such evidence is therefore rendered inadmissible by s293(3) of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      . However, s293(4) provides that subsection (3) does not apply if the evidence to be led is of the complainant’s sexual experience taken part in by the complainant about the time of the commission of the alleged offence and is of events which are alleged to form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged offence was committed.  
       
       
      6. I am satisfied that the evidence, being assertions by the accused of complaints made by the complainant about her sexual relationship with her partner, was evidence of sexual experience at about the time of the commission of the alleged offence. The complainant was at the time living with her partner. Her partner was, at the time of the alleged offence, overseas. The evidence comprises in my opinion events which form part of a connected set of circumstances in which the alleged assault was committed. The events are the claimed assertions by the complainant, a short time before the sexual encounter, of difficulties in her sexual relationship with her partner. I am therefore satisfied that s293(4)(a) applies, which has the consequence that the evidence in the form of the record of interview is not rendered inadmissible by s293(3). 
       
       
      7. The second piece of evidence comprises the answers given by the complainant when she was cross-examined this morning by defence counsel. I should add this in relation to the second piece of evidence. A separate question arose as to whether defence counsel ought to be allowed to ask those questions. Section 293(5) prohibits a witness being asked to give evidence that is inadmissible under subsection (2) or subsection (3) or evidence which may be admissible under subsection (4), unless I had decided that it would be admissible. I allowed the questions because the subject matter of the evidence was not inadmissible under subsection (3) for the reasons which I have just given and I indicated yesterday that I would permit the questions. In my opinion the questions were permissible and the evidence permissible for the same reasons that the first piece of evidence was admissible.  
       
       
      8. Finally I turn to the third piece of evidence which are the answers which the Trial Advocate expects to receive from the complainant in re-examination, raising questions of the complainant’s relationship with her partner.  
       
       
      9. Before turning to the third piece of evidence I should add in respect of the second piece of evidence that I permitted defence counsel to ask the questions which he did because I was satisfied of the matters contained in s 293(6). It had been implied in the case of the prosecution that the complainant had sexual experience of a specific nature, namely a sexual relationship with her partner. That was raised both by the prospect that the record of interview was to be tendered by the prosecution and also by reference, in evidence-in-chief by the complainant, of the nature of the living arrangements with her partner at that time, which included the joint occupancy of a bed. In my opinion the accused in this case would be unfairly prejudiced if defence counsel was not able to cross-examine on his behalf, by putting to the complainant the matters which were raised in the record of interview by the accused. Indeed it would have been unfair to the complainant had that evidence been admitted as part of the prosecution case without the opportunity for her to comment on it. The cross-examination was, in accordance with subs (6), limited to the conversation which the accused alleged he had with the complainant about her sexual relationship with her partner. 
       
       
      10. I should also add in relation to both the first and second pieces of evidence that I am satisfied that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any distress, humiliation or embarrassment that the complainant might suffer as a result of its admission. As to the evidence concerning the claims in the record of interview, the probative value is high because those claims go to the likelihood of the complainant giving consent to the sexual encounter, which both parties agree occurred. The giving of the evidence I expect did involve distress and humiliation as well as embarrassment to the complainant but the probative value was high and in my opinion, as I have said, outweighed the impact on the complainant. 
       
       
      11. I now turn to the third piece of evidence to be led by the Trial Advocate, if I permit it, in re-examination. In fact a number of issues arise in relation to that evidence, the first is whether it breaches s 293 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
      . Because defence counsel was permitted to cross-examine the complainant on the allegations contained in the record of interview, the re examination on the same topic falls within s293(4)(f). I will return to the question of the probative value after addressing the second issue which is the relevance of the evidence.  
       
       
      12. Relevance is dealt with in the  
      Evidence Act 
       under s 55. The Trial Advocate argues that one of the facts in issue in these proceedings is whether or not the complainant gave her consent to the sexual encounter which, as I said, both parties agree occurred. That is, I accept, clearly a fact in issue. The cross-examination which I permitted on claimed assertions about the complainant’s sexual relationship with her partner went to the likelihood of that consent being forthcoming. The relevance of the questions which the Trial Advocate now wishes to ask is to the likelihood of the complainant having made those assertions to the accused. Although the relevance of the asserted complaints is the fact that they were said rather than whether or not they were true, in my opinion evidence from the complainant that they are or were at the relevant time untrue, is relevant to the likelihood of her having made those assertions. I appreciate that the claimed assertions do not depend for their relevance on being true: it could well be argued that the words were said falsely in order for the complainant to encourage the accused into a sexual encounter. But in my opinion, evidence of a healthy sexual relationship without the asserted problems is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the complainant making those assertions to the accused on that evening. There are other factors which are relevant to the assessment of that likelihood but, in my opinion, the truth of the claimed assertions is one such factor. I therefore regard them as relevant. 
       
       
      13. The probative value, returning to s 293(4), is in my opinion high because it touches upon an essential issue in this case, namely whether or not consent was forthcoming from the complainant. I expect that the distress, humiliation and embarrassment occasioned to the complainant will be lower than that occasioned by being cross-examined on the topic and I am therefore comfortably satisfied that the probative value of the anticipated evidence will outweigh such distress, humiliation and embarrassment. I therefore regard the proposed questions by the Trial Advocate as not inadmissible, nor the proposed or anticipated answers as inadmissible. 
       
       
      14. Finally, defence counsel argues that the questions should be prohibited because they breach s 137 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . He argues that I must refuse to admit this evidence because its probative value would be outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to his client. The unfair prejudice he argues is that the truth or otherwise of the relationship between the complainant and her partner is collateral to the primary question, that is whether she made those assertions or not. There is some force to that point. The truth of the assertion is, as I said in relation to my reasons concerning the relevance, one of the factors which could assist in assessing the probability of the words being said by the complainant. The evidence is collateral in the sense that, as I have said, what is in issue is whether the words were said, not the actual relationship between the complainant and her partner, but in my opinion as I have already said, the truth or otherwise of the assertions is relevant to the likelihood of whether they were said. The probative value, as I have already determined, is high. Provided the answers are limited, as I expect they will be, to relatively short evidence concerning a healthy sexual relationship between the complainant and her partner not attended by any of the difficulties asserted by the accused, then I do not regard the answers as straying too far into what defence counsel terms collateral territory. I do not see any danger of unfair prejudice to the accused which would be occasioned by the questions and answers which the Trial Advocate proposes to ask and to elicit, and therefore I rule those questions and answers as admissible.

      JUDGMENT – Application for adjournment of trial date 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: As would have been apparent from the remarks I made in exchange with Senior Counsel for the accused, I am singularly unimpressed by the basis upon which it is suggested that the accused cannot be ready for trial until Monday 25 August. At a previous mention hearing it was apparently suggested that the accused could be ready at least a couple of weeks earlier than that, but that position seems to have altered.  
     
      
    2 The comment by leading counsel for the Crown that the affidavit filed today of Hugh Robert Scott represents no more than a trawling through of material which must have been well known to those advising Mr Wilkie, is clearly correct. The problem is however that if I force the accused to a trial earlier than he claims to be ready for, then that only adds to the possibility of an ultimate complaint about mistrial.  
     
      
    3 I have said what I said. I regard this application as bordering upon the edge of failing to be even bona fide. Nevertheless, in order to avoid the problems which may follow forcing this unwilling group of legal advisors and their client to commence the trial, I propose to fix the trial to start on Monday 25 August. Unless something quite extraordinary happens, the parties can expect that it will proceed on that date, and at considerable expense to the community in general there will have to be a large jury panel summonsed for that day. Those who have responsibilities to the court as well as to their clients may bear that in mind.

     Wayne Denis Sultan v Regina 
     
     
      
       
      The appellant was convicted of one of 17 counts, with which he had been charged of using a false instrument contrary to s 300(2) of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900. The Crown case was that he had participated in a fraudulent loan scheme in which he purported to act for a man pretending to be the owner of real property which was to be the security the subject of a mortgage upon which funds would be advanced by a third party. With respect to the count of which he was convicted, the trial judge found that the appellant knew that this person was not the true owner and therefore that the documents were fraudulent. Implicitly, his Honour also found that the appellant’s participation in the transaction amounted to “use” of the fraudulent mortgage instrument. 
       
       
      The appellant appeals his conviction and sentence.

      2 “Use” in s 300(2) of the

      1900 involves the idea of actual deployment by the person charged or by his or her agent or fellow participant in a joint enterprise. It is not enough that the person charged is merely present when the instrument is “used” by another person. [35]–[36], [42], [47], [48].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The appellant stood trial on 17 counts for offences under s 300(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Each count alleged that he had used a false instrument, knowing it to be a false instrument, with intent to induce a named solicitor to accept the said false instrument as genuine and thereby to act to the prejudice of certain identified persons. The 17 counts related to nine separate loans in a total amount of $5,140,000. On the Crown case the appellant, acting in the capacity of a mortgage broker, received over $400,000 by way of fees with respect to the nine loans. 
     
      
    2 The Crown case was that the appellant was one of the persons involved in a fraudulent loan scheme involving the registration of fraudulent caveats, transfers and mortgages over properties on behalf of investors in order to secure what appeared to be loans to various property owners. The scheme involved money lending on short term at extremely high rates of interest secured over property. The perpetrators induced investors to lend money to persons falsely said to be borrowers, using the alleged borrowers’ actual property as security for the investment. 
     
      
    3 Various documents, including mortgages which were deployed, purported to be signed on behalf of or by the owner of property. The signatures appeared to be those of either Manus Michael Friel or Kevin Patrick Friel. In fact the signatures were forged by Michael English, one of the participants in the scheme.  
     
      
    4 The trial was heard by Toner DCJ sitting without a jury. At the end of the prosecution case the accused sought a directed verdict and his Honour acceded to the submission with respect to Counts 1 to 14, which related to loans identified in the proceedings as Loan 1 to Loan 7. Counts 16 and 17 related to Loan 9. In his final judgment Toner DCJ acquitted the appellant on these counts. However, he convicted the appellant on Count 15 which related to Loan 8. The appellant appeals from this conviction. 
     
      
    5 His Honour imposed a sentence on Count 15 of imprisonment for a non-parole period of 1 year and 5 months commencing on 3 May 2007 with a balance of term of 1 year and 9 months to commence on 3 October 2008 and to expire on 2 July 2010. The appellant appeals from this sentence. I note that he has served a considerable proportion of his sentence. 
     
      
    6 The judgment entering the conviction was handed down by Toner DCJ on 3 May 2007. The appellant was sentenced on 20 July 2007. I note that the Notice of Appeal was filed in the Court of Criminal Appeal on 8 February 2008. The appellant, who is a former solicitor, represented himself at trial. He was, however, represented at the sentence hearing. No doubt the issue of legal representation may explain the delay in instituting and prosecuting an appeal. 
     
      
    7 The count upon which the appellant was convicted was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Count 15: On or about 6 March 2002, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, did use a false instrument, to wit, a Mortgage reference 8427278T for Folio Identifier 61/B/4247, over property situated at 634-636 Old South Head Road Rose Bay, which Wayne Denis Sultan knew to be false, with the intention of inducing Brian Dean Alcorn to accept the said false instrument as genuine and because of that acceptance, to settle the loan to the prejudice of the owner of the property Manus Michael Friel.” 
        
       
      
    8 Loan 8 which was the subject of Count 15 comprised four documents: a mortgage which is the instrument the subject of the charge, a deed of loan, an acknowledgement of legal advice by the proposed borrower and a direction to pay. Each is dated 6 March 2002 and each bears the signature of “M M Friel”. It was never in dispute that Michael English signed the name “M M Friel”. 
     
      
    9 On the evidence it was the appellant who instituted the loan by introducing lenders to the group. The appellant, on his Honour’s findings, informed the solicitor who acted in all of these arrangements on behalf of the lender that the borrower would be Manus Friel.  
     
      
    10 The solicitor who acted on behalf of the lender met with a number of persons including the appellant and a person introduced to him as Manus Friel on 6 March 2002. The documents were executed that morning, relevantly by Mr English purporting to be Mr Friel in the boardroom of the solicitor’s law firm. A number of matters which arose during the course of that morning will be referred to below. The transaction was settled at the offices of the solicitor for the lender later that day. The documents signed on that day by Mr English, in the name of Mr Friel, were given numbers in the proceedings as document 180 (the mortgage), 181 (the deed of loan), 182 (the acknowledgement of legal advice) and 183 (the direction to pay). 
     
      
    11 His Honour set out evidence with respect to the events of the day which he appeared to accept and summarised the following findings of primary fact as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1 Michael English signed documents 180, 181, 182 and 183. 
        
       
       
        
        2 Brian Dean Alcorn signed as a witness to those signatures on documents 180 and 181. 
        
       
       
        
        3 The name signed by English was MM Friel and was a forgery. 
        
       
       
        
        4 The documents and in particular document 180 were used to affect [sic] settlement of loan eight. 
        
       
       
        
        5 Brian Dean Alcorn met Michael English on 6/3/02 and believed he was Manus Friel. 
        
       
       
        
        6 The accused was present when Michael English was introduced to Brian Dean Alcorn as Manus Friel. 
        
       
       
        
        7 I reject the submission that the accused was in someway [sic] entitled to believe that Michael English was also known as Manus Friel. 
        
       
       
        
        8 I reject the submission that Michael English was in some way entitled to hold himself out as Manus Friel and to sign the name of Manus Friel as though he was Manus Friel. 
        
       
       
        
        9 Michael English was not Manus Friel and was not known as Manus Friel.” 
        
       
      
    12 His Honour identified the critical issue to be whether or not the appellant had the relevant intention and concluded that he did. In this context his Honour noted that the accused had a motive, namely that he would receive sums of money with respect to any loan transactions which were implemented. 
     
      
    13 His Honour also made the following finding: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … it was the accused who instigated the transaction, nominated the borrower, said that Mr Alcorn was to act for Mr Friel as the borrower and nominated the property which was to be the security for the transaction. Each of those propositions is reflected in the documentation, being documents 180 to 183 of exhibit A. 
        
       
       
        
        … The accused was not a bystander, he was clearly a participant.” 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour went on to find: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the accused knew that Michael English was not Manus Friel when he was represented as such to Brian Dean Alcorn. He knew the purpose for this deception was to induce Mr Alcorn to accept the Manus Friel signature on document 180 … was genuine and thus the instrument as genuine and he knew that Alcorn’s acceptance of it as genuine would cause him to effect settlement of the loan and that it would be to the prejudice of the true owner of the affected property, namely Manus Michael Friel. 
        
       
       
        
        In knowing these things, I conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that he had that knowledge and intended to induce Brian Alcorn to accept the documents as genuine and to settle the loan to the prejudice of Manus Michael Friel.” 
        
       
       
      Appeal Ground 1 
       
      
    15 The first ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial judge’s findings that ‘knowledge and intent’ are wrong, and contrary to the weight of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    16 I have set out above his Honour’s findings of primary fact. The appellant does not challenge findings 1, 2, 3, 5 and 9 and accepts that finding 6 was open. He also accepts that findings 7 and 8 were open but notes that they are simply the rejection of suggestions which were made in the course of cross-examination by the appellant. The appellant did not give evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    17 In submissions the appellant accepted that evidence at the trial about the appellant’s participation in loans 1 to 6, which were prior in time to the loan the subject of Count 15, could be relied upon in certain respects. However, counsel for the appellant submitted that the highest the evidence could go was that the appellant knew that Mr English was passing himself off under another name. This he submitted was not sufficient for the finding of intent for the offence charged. 
     
      
    18 The submissions for the appellant did not directly address his Honour’s findings on the issue of knowledge and intent which I have quoted above and which I summarise as follows: 
     
      
    · He knew that Michael English was not Manus Friel. 
     
      
    · He knew the purpose of the deception was to induce Mr Alcorn to accept the Manus Friel signature on the mortgage as genuine. 
     
      
    · He knew that Alcorn’s acceptance of the signature as genuine would cause him to effect settlement of the loan. 
     
      
    · He knew that that settlement would be to the prejudice of the true owner of the affected property. 
     
      
    · He intended to induce Brian Alcorn to accept the documents as genuine and to settle the loan to the prejudice of the owner. 
     
      
    19 His Honour set out the evidence upon which he based his conclusions. This included, most relevantly: 
     
      
    · The appellant knew Michael English by name and met him on a number of occasions. 
     
      
    · On the way to Sydney from Brisbane by airplane another participant who was sitting next to the appellant heard a third participant say to Michael English, both of whom were sitting in the row behind, “Now remember you’re Manus today” and after this the accused said to him words to the effect: “Don’t worry about that”. 
     
      
    · The accused was present when Mr English was introduced to Mr Alcorn under the name of Manus Friel. 
     
      
    20 There was evidence, subsequently withdrawn, that the accused was present when Mr English signed the documents in the name of Manus Friel. Eventually that witness accepted that he could not remember precisely who was in the room at that time although the accused had arrived with the other persons from Brisbane and had been present at some time during the relevant period.  
     
      
    21 Michael English gave evidence that the accused was beside him when he produced a false driver’s licence containing his photograph but the name of Manus Friel, being a photocopy of a purported Queensland licence that he gave to Mr Alcorn for purposes of identification. Furthermore, Michael English gave evidence to the effect that when he actually signed the documents the appellant was “beside me”. 
     
      
    22 However, his Honour made no finding of primary fact to the effect that the appellant was present when Mr English signed the documents in the name of Manus Friel. Nor does any such finding play a role in the finding on the issue of knowledge and intent set out at par [14] and summarised at par [18] above. It may, however, be implicit in his Honour’s findings. A key distinction between the counts on which the appellant was found not guilty and the count under appeal is that the appellant was not even present on the other occasions. Nevertheless there is no express finding. 
     
      
    23 The only criticism that is made of any aspect of his Honour’s reasons in this respect appears in the submissions on Ground 3 – the unsafe and unsatisfactory ground. It was there submitted that intent can only be inferred if knowledge is established and knowledge cannot be established here. The appellant referred to the fact that English, in the appellant’s presence, showed another participant a driver’s licence in the name of Manus Friel. There is no evidence that the appellant actually saw this licence, but it was suggested that, if he did, this may have suggested that Friel was a pseudonym regularly used by English. 
     
      
    24 It was submitted that if more than one inference is reasonably open on the facts, then the inference most favourable to the accused must be drawn. There is no such principle in the criminal law. The driver’s licence was one amongst numerous pertinent circumstantial facts. There may be an inference that the appellant knew that the licence was in the other name. However, this is no basis for an inference that the appellant may have believed that Friel was a pseudonym used by English. It was open to the trial judge to conclude that the only rational inference to be drawn from the whole of the evidence was the one his Honour did draw. 
     
      
    25 Ground 1, expressed as it is in terms of being against the weight of the evidence, should be rejected. There was ample evidence for each of the findings of primary fact that his Honour made, for the inferences he drew and for the findings with respect to knowledge and intent. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    26 The second ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “2 The learned trial judge’s findings about ‘use’ are wrong, and contrary to the weight of the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    27 In this regard the appellant drew attention to his Honour’s finding of fact 4 which to repeat is: 
     
      
       
        
        “4 The documents and in particular document 180 were used to affect [sic] settlement of loan 8.” 
        
       
      
    28 The appellant submits that his Honour does not explain his finding in terms of who used the document, and in what circumstances it was used and why it was used.  
     
      
    29 In this respect I find it to be of some significance that his Honour made no express finding that it was the appellant who “used” the instrument. The Crown has also had some difficulty in formulating precisely how it was said that it was the appellant who “used” the instrument. 
     
      
    30 The appellant submitted that the offender had no control over the document and without control there was no “use” with the meaning of the section. I do not believe that “control” is the relevant test. 
     
      
    31 Section 300(2) appears in Pt 5 Div 2 of the Crimes Act entitled False Instruments. Division 1 is entitled Forgery and Div 3 is entitled False and Misleading Information. Various verbs are deployed in the Part which identify the conduct made criminal by respective sections, including “uttering” (ss 251, 260, 265, 271, 291), defined in terms “uttered, offered, disposed of or put off” (s 250). 
     
      
    32 Section 300 provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(1) A person who makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or she, or another person, will use it to induce another person: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) to accept the instrument as genuine, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to that other person’s, or to another person’s, prejudice,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        is liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) A person who uses an instrument which is, and which the person knows to be, false, with the intention of inducing another person:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) to accept the instrument as genuine, and 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to that other person’s, or to another person’s, prejudice,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.” 
        
       
      
    33 Furthermore “instrument” is defined in s 299(1): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “(a) any document, whether of a formal or informal character, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a card by means of which property or credit can be obtained, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) a disc, tape, sound track or other device on or in which information is recorded or stored by mechanical, electronic or other means.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 The Crown case was not based on an allegation of a joint criminal enterprise. It was not part of the Crown case that if Mr English or any of the participants “used” the false document, that would constitute “use” by the appellant. As I have noted above, there is no finding that the appellant was present in the room when the signature was affixed. However, even if he were present, that would not establish “use” by him unless the “use” by others could be attributed to him. That was not the Crown case. 
     
      
    35 The verb “to use” is protean and takes its meaning from its context. It is a transitive verb. The specified object is “instrument” which is defined in terms of a physical thing capable of containing information or writing or its equivalent. There is, in my opinion, no “use” within the meaning of s 300(2) unless there is a direct link between the conduct of the accused and the deployment of the instrument for a purpose. 
     
      
    36 In my opinion, in s 300(2) “use” involves the idea of actual deployment by the person charged or by his or her agent, or fellow participant in a joint enterprise. It is not enough that the person charged is merely present when the instrument is “used” by another person. Presence could support an accessorial charge, but not a charge of “use”. 
     
      
    37 The position is the same as that which this Court determined to be the case with respect to a charge of “uttering” as defined in s 250 of the Crimes Act, ie “uttered, offered, disposed of, or put off”. In R v Lyons [1984] 2 NSWLR 476 at 482, Street CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In order to found a conviction, it must be possible to identify some actual dealing with the document in this State which can be ascribed to the appellant either directly or through a person or agent acting for him.” 
        
       
      
    38 Accordingly, the handing over of false documents in Victoria to representatives of the company intended to be deceived did not constitute “uttering” in New South Wales when the representatives returned to Sydney and presented the documents to the company.39 In Lyons, Street CJ went on to refer to “physical handling” of the document. That was a reference to the facts of that case and I do not understand his Honour to suggest that physical contact was an essential aspect of use. An “actual dealing” with a document can occur without “physical handling”. 40 To similar effect is the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Bailey v United States 516 US 137 (1995). The offence involved “‘use’ of a firearm” (at 144). The Court concluded that the prosecution must prove “active employment of the firearm” (at 143). Accordingly, an accused who had a gun in his pocket, but did not deploy it or even refer to it, could not be convicted of “use”.  
     
      
    41 Also to similar effect are the observations of the Supreme Court of Canada which, also in the context of use of a firearm, approved a formulation that there must be an “actual carrying into action, operation or effect” (R v Steele [2007] 3 SCR 3 at [29]). 
     
      
    42 The idea of “actual dealing” (Lyons) or “active employment” (Bailey) or “actual carrying into effect” (Steele) is the sense in which “use” is to be understood in s 300(2).  
     
      
    43 On his Honour’s findings of fact, the appellant did not “actually deal” with or “actually employ” or “actually carry into effect” the false instrument unless it could be held that the person or persons who did so was his agent. There was no such finding. Nor was any such person alleged to be a part of a joint criminal enterprise with the appellant. 
     
      
    44 Ground 2 should be upheld. 
     
      
       
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    45 It is unnecessary to deal with Ground 3. 
     
      
    46 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Appeal allowed. 
        
       
       
        
        2 Quash the conviction. 
        
       
       
        
        3 Direct a verdict of acquittal.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing Ahmad Aboucham. Mr Aboucham has pleaded guilty to the crime of break and enter and commit serious indictable offence. That is an offence against s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment.2. The offence occurred on 26 October 2006 but Mr Aboucham was not arrested for the offence until 12 November 2007.3. When he committed this offence, Mr Aboucham was on parole for another offence of breaking, entering and stealing. In addition, he was on bail for other offences that he had been charged with. Mr Aboucham has been refused bail since his arrest on 12 November 2007, although when he was arrested he was at that time serving a sentence for another offence which is due to expire on 12 September 2008. 4. Briefly, this is what happened in this case. I will just interrupt my remarks, there is no Form 1 here, is there?COTTON: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: No.Between about 10 in the morning and 2 in the afternoon of 26 October 2006, Mr Aboucham decided to break into a house in Myall Street, Belmore. He broke into a side gate and broke a window at the back of the house. He injured himself in doing that. The house was unoccupied. From the house Mr Aboucham stole a number of items of property including a Sony play station and games calculator and radio, a mobile phone, a watch and coins as well as a key ring. When the owner of the house returned, he phoned the police. Because the offender had left some blood, that enabled police to perform a DNA test. A DNA test was undertaken in March 2007 which indicated that the blood matched that of Mr Aboucham.5. Over six months later, police attended Mr Aboucham - who was then serving, as I said, a sentence for another offence - and charged him with this offence. 6. Mr Aboucham has a very bad criminal record for just this kind of offence. He was born on 29 December 1976 and he is now aged thirty-one. Since he turned eighteen in 1994, Mr Aboucham has committed a number of offences of breaking and entering and stealing for which he has received various kinds of sentences from a recognisance through a suspended sentence to gaol terms. Mr Aboucham is a persistent offender so far as this kind of crime is concerned. One of the most significant sentences was imposed by this court on 19 September 2003 when he was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. That non-parole period concluded on 3 January 2006, hence it was only eight months or so later that he was committing this particular offence.7. It goes without saying that such a criminal record does not assist Mr Aboucham. More significantly than that, it is one that I take into account under s 21A(2)(d) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The previous convictions are for similar crimes as those which I am sentencing him for and indicate a need for me to give particular emphasis to deterring Mr Aboucham from committing these kinds of offences again.8. There was tendered by Ms Cotton, who appears for Mr Aboucham, a forensic psychologist’s report prepared by Alex Edgar. It is a recent report dated 7 June 2008. It notes that Mr Aboucham commenced using illegal drugs when he was fourteen years of age. He graduated to heroin, using it intravenously when he became eighteen. He made efforts at abstaining from heroin which were partly successful but ultimately unsuccessful. As Mr Edgar said, it would appear that his illicit drug use has remained extensive and problematic until recently. Past intervention has resulted in limited effect. Mr Edgar expressed the opinion that a more strict and monitored rehabilitation program was needed. He has been engaged on and off in the Methadone Program and has indeed, as indicated by his criminal record, had the benefit of experience in the New South Wales Drug Court.9. Mr Aboucham lost his father when he, Mr Aboucham, was aged eight years old. Mr Edgar thought that his drug use had affected his mental health functioning with a possible drug related schizophrenia, with associated paranoia. Mr Edgar concluded that Mr Aboucham has an entrenched dependence and significant life management skills deficits. He needs primarily to engage in a rehabilitation program to assist with continued abstinence from drugs. Mr Edgar considered management within the community. He thought that if Mr Aboucham received a custodial sentence, consideration could be given to giving him access to rehabilitation programs. He thought that Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre at Parklea provided such an intervention.10. I take Mr Aboucham’s drug addiction into account at this stage not to excuse the offending behaviour but as a factor which indicates a limited degree of planning and the fact that his offending behaviour was obviously driven by that addiction. 11. Ms Cotton realistically acknowledges that a custodial sentence is inevitable. I agree: with Mr Aboucham’s criminal record there is no other choice for me than to send him to gaol. However, Ms Cotton recommended consideration be given to Mr Aboucham’s eligibility for a Drug Court Program. 12. I propose to sentence Mr Aboucham to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years. I am going to backdate that sentence to 12 November 2007 when he was arrested. I am conscious of the fact that that is exactly the same sentence as he received previously. Normally, one would expect the sentence to increase because of the significance of deterring him. However, I take into account the fact that there was a delay between the date of the offence and his arrest, more significantly the delay was between the date of the determination that he was the culprit which occurred in March 2007 and his arrest in November 2007. I take into account that the items stolen were not of very significant value, however aggravating his offending behaviour is the fact that he was on conditional liberty; a court had given him permission to be at large, in fact more than one court. HIS HONOUR: Now having indicated that, I will just ask you Ms Cotton and Ms Fitzpatrick, do I make findings or recommendations under the Drug Court Act or not? Or is it just something which follows?COTTON: Your Honour, can make a referral.HIS HONOUR: Under section--COTTON: Five.FITZPATRICK: I’m not sure what the section the referral is under but--HIS HONOUR: Section 6 is it?FITZPATRICK: No, I don't think section 6, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: No, no.FITZPATRICK: We were looking at section 5A before.HIS HONOUR: Yes, that’s eligibility. So you’re asking me to, Ms Cotton, in some way connecting with the Drug Court Program but I need to be told how I go about doing that. Is it section 6(2). COTTON: 18(b) I think your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Say that again?COTTON: 18(b), courts to refer eligible convicted offenders to Drug Court.HIS HONOUR: Yes?COTTON: And subsection (2) duty of the court to which a section applies--HIS HONOUR: Sorry, 18?COTTON: 18(b).HIS HONOUR: I’ll have a look at the section.13. In my opinion there are grounds on which the Drug Court might find Mr Aboucham could be an eligible convicted offender. And I refer Mr Aboucham to the Drug Court to determine whether he should be subject of a compulsory drug treatment order. HIS HONOUR: Is that - or - any other orders? That’s right, yeah. Any other orders? Now four years, I do not make a parole order, so it is not three years. So I have sentenced him and I have made a referral. Any other things that I need to do? I need to specify the dates of the sentence. All right.14. Mr Aboucham I am sentencing you to four years imprisonment, to date from 12 November 2007 and to expire on 11 November 2011. I specify a non-parole period of three years to commence on 12 November 2007 and to expire on 11 November 2010. The first date, earliest date, on which it appears to me on information available to me that you are eligible to be considered for release by the Parole Authority will be 11 November 2010. 15. Pursuant to section 18B(2) of the Drug Court Act 1998, I am of the opinion that there are grounds on which the Drug Court might find you to be an eligible convicted offender and I refer you to the Drug Court to determine whether you should be the subject of a compulsory drug treatment order. Any other formalities?FITZPATRICK: I think that’s it your Honour. Your Honour has convicted the offender?16. And I convict you of the offence of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence contrary to s 112(1) of the Crimes Act 1900.FITZPATRICK: It may be my oversight but your Honour took into to account his plea of guilty?HIS HONOUR: I did, yes.FITZPATRICK: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I must say I did not record it.17. I should record that I took into account the fact that Mr Aboucham has pleaded guilty to this offence in fixing the sentence that I did. It would have been higher still, had he not pleaded guilty. Mr Aboucham, the sentence that I had in mind, or as appropriate, is probably something like five or six years but because you pleaded guilty in good time and cooperated, I have reduced that to four years. Do you understand that? That is about twenty-five percent of because you have pleaded guilty. Anything else? FITZPATRICK: No.18. Mr Aboucham, I have got to explain this to you now. I have given you a four year gaol sentence. It starts when you were charged or arrested on 12 November 07, so your four years expires on 11 November 2011. Do you understand that? You’ve got three years minimum non-parole period. That started on 12 November 2007 and that finishes on 11 November 2010. So on 11 November 2010, you have become eligible to be considered for parole. I do not order your parole, the Parole Authority does that. They look at you and work out whether you are going to get parole or not. The earliest time that they can do that is in November 2010, on the 11th. Do you understand? It seems to me on Ms Cotton’s submissions that you might benefit from the Drug Court, Compulsory Drug Court [as said]. So I have made a referral to the Drug Court to see whether they might fit you in to their compulsory program where you go to Parklea and do good work there. I’ve been out to have a look at it. If you are eligible and if they do take you on, it might be a place which can help you, do you understand? There are other people who are affected by drugs there and they’re all doing their best to rehabilitate themselves. Do you understand? Okay. Is there anything else?FITZPATRICK: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Aboucham can be taken down.

    JUDGMENTAn application pursuant to S.90 Evidence Act 1995 to exclude evidence of admissions.1. Darren Michael Kemp (the Accused) has been charged with four counts arising out of the robbery in company of a security guard of two Westpac Bank automatic teller machines (ATMs) containing nearly $680,000 of Westpac’s money. The robbery occurred at the Homebush Bay Showground during the 2005 Easter Show.2. The theft of the ATM’s occurred on 15th March 2005. Twenty-three months later, on 19th February 2007 the accused was arrested by Dt David Willey on the direction of Dt Sgt Peter Smith. Both officers were members of Strike Force Piccadilly, formed in August 2005 to investigate a spate of thefts of ATMs via means of ram-raids, towings off mountings and other smash and grab type activities. Dt Smith and his team were in charged with investigating the Easter Show ATM thefts as one of several designated investigations falling within Strike Force Piccadilly.3. Shortly after his arrest the accused was housed in a designated cell (cell No. 3). A listening device recorded conversations he had with two undercover police officers (Sean and James). During the course of these conversations the accused, on the Crown case admitted to substantial involvement in the heist of the ATMs. The Crown seeks to tender the recordings of those conversations. The accused objects saying that the circumstances in which the admissions were made, now make it unfair to him to use the evidence thereby obtained (s90 Evidence Act 1995).The Circumstances in which the Admissions were made4. As early as 5th August 2005 police had information contained in a record of interview with one Tim Kennedy putting the accused as a member of the group that stole the ATMs. In October 2006 Strike Force Piccadilly received a copy of this interview. In 2006 on three occasions, the first being 26 October, officers of Strike Force Piccadilly spoke to Kennedy at Junee Correctional Centre. On 29th November 2006, apparently after Kennedy had been released, a 3- page statement was taken from him effectively adopting the contents of the earlier record of interview. Kennedy, before going into custody, had boarded at the accused’s residence. The accused lived in Housing Commission accommodation at Leichhardt. After Kennedy’s release from custody there was heightened interest by police in the accused’s movements and conversations. Police hoped the release of Kennedy would excite some chatter from the accused and his camp. 5. Thus listening device authorization obtained on 16th February was not the first occasion listening devices had been authorized for and used against the accused. Police concede their previous covert surveillance of the accused and monitoring of his conversations advanced their investigation not one jot. The evidence is silent on whether Kennedy, once released returned to the accused’s residence or company.6. Dt Sgt Smith’s evidence is that he believed once he had Kennedy’s adoption of the interview that he had sufficient evidence to charge the accused. He had what Dt Smith described as “hearsay evidence”… of “a direct admission by the accused.” Dt Smith was confident the claimed admission would become evidence. So I take it that on the prosecution case, Kennedy was reporting what the accused said to him, or within his hearing. However, I understand the Crown is not calling Tim Kennedy. Neither the evidence on the voir dire, nor either side has sought to explain the absence of Kennedy from the trial. Neither side has sought to tender Kennedy’s ROI or his statement adopting the ROI. I do not know what the purpose was of the police interview with Kennedy, nor the circumstances in which he volunteered information about the accused. I do not know whether Kennedy is the man the accused refers to in his conversations with the undercover operatives (see later). Thus, in all the circumstances it becomes very difficult to assess what impact Kennedy’s claimed capacity to give evidence of a direct admission by the accused means. Nor can I gauge what would have been reasonable for Dt Smith to draw from Kennedy’s potential contribution to the prosecution case when he (Smith) was assessing the strength of the prosecution case for purposes of assessing whether he had sufficient evidence to charge the accused. That would depend upon the contents of the admission’s capacity to put the accused at the crime scene participating in the crime. While, as matters stand, I cannot be satisfied Kennedy’s potential evidence would have amounted to evidence of an accomplice, his credibility was on any view a matter that was well open to attack. He had criminal convictions. It is unclear from the evidence whether he also had motive to fabricate. I have concluded Dt Sgt Smith was aware that Kennedy’s admission did not come without baggage attached to it.7. Other potential prosecution evidence relied upon by Dt Sgt Smith included evidence from the security guard who was said to have been robbed. There is certainly evidence he was present during the commission of the theft and restrained by two of four offenders. His evidence is the men were speaking to each other in a foreign language. Two of them spoke to him in English. He was unable to say whether either spoke English with a foreign accent. He ruled out Asian and Arabic languages. All wore balaclavas covering their heads and faces save for a small area including eyes and nose. He determined the driver of a forklift (used to lift a container housing both ATMs) was about 20. My understanding of his evidence is that was based upon the portion of the face visible to him. His evidence was all four offenders wore florescent orange vests. These vests did up at the front. He was unable to give further detail of the vests. From the Crown’s viewpoint he presented as a witness, weak as to detail and as to capacity to give clear evidence of the detail he was able to recall. There was no application by the Crown to cross-examine him pursuant to s.38 of the Evidence Act. Therefore I have assumed the prosecution is content that all matters of relevance contained in his statement are before the Court. If so, from the point of view of Dt Smith, the security officer’s statement was not a statement that incriminated the accused. Indeed, the defence will be relying on his evidence to exculpate the accused. 8. There was evidence from a plainclothes constable linking the accused with Tim Kennedy’s car in January 2005 – that is about 2 months before the theft of the ATMs. She saw the accused access from the boot of that car a florescent orange vest similar to those frequently used by men and women working on outdoor and building sites. The accused told her the vest was Kennedy’s. Nonetheless that amounted to some circumstantial evidence linking the accused to a vest that may have been similar to a vest worn by one of the offenders. This, however, could hardly be described as a strong strand of circumstantial evidence. Dt Smith no doubt realized as much when considering his case against the accused at the time he made his decision to arrest.9. Subsequent to the accused’s arrest a search was done of his residence. Among items found were orange florescent vests with silver stripes. These vests do up at the front, thereby having two features in common with the vests described by the security officer. Of course Dt Smith did not make his decision to arrest the accused upon items of evidence yet to be discovered.10. Prior to the arrest, police also obtained evidence from two men unconnected with the robbery. One, Thompson, had sold a boat and trailer to the accused for $2,000. The other, Baissari, had sold a second hand blue Commodore to the accused for $9,000. On the voir dire, the date of either purchase is unclear, but I have assumed it is sufficiently proximate to the robbery to support a prosecution claim of unexplained wealth. It may be (although is not clear in the voir dire evidence) that information of these purchases originated from Kennedy. If so, the purchases may also corroborate the evidence of Kennedy – assuming he gave evidence of prior knowledge of the purchases. Of course, if it is unexplained wealth, it is a very modest wealth by comparison with the sum of money said to have been taken. No doubt Dt Smith was also aware of the problems associated with this piece of circumstantial evidence.11. My assessment of the evidence existing at the time Dt Sgt Smith made his decision to arrest, is that at law it would be sufficient to justify an arrest. That is to say, there was sufficient evidence to ground a suspicion that the accused was one of the four men at Homebush Bay participating in the theft of the ATMs. However, in the absence of Kennedy (always a possibility with “give-ups”) as a witness at trial, a verdict by direction must have been considered a distinct possibility; failing that a Prassad direction would otherwise have been inevitable. Further, Dt Sgt Smith well knew once the accused was arrested police investigators were allowed a four hour period in which to question him. Given the accused’s prior history with the police, it was unlikely the accused would do himself any harm in a formal interview conducted by police. I am satisfied Dt Sgt Smith did not anticipate any formal record of interview he conducted with the accused would in any way strengthen the prosecution case. Further, Dt Sgt Smith must have considered the real possibility the accused would not participate in any interview at all. I am comforted in these findings by recalling that Dt Sgt Smith allowed himself only half an hour for an E.R.I.S.P. 12. The accused’s arrest was planned before 12th February 2007. On that date officers from Piccadilly had surveilled the accused at the rear car park to Fords Pharmacy at 247 Kings St. They had observed him enter the Pharmacy and leave. They knew he was a regular at the Pharmacy, for he was on a methadone maintenance program. Ford Pharmacy was his collection point. Shortly after the shop opened was his preferred collection time. He collected twice weekly. Monday mornings were one of his collection days. The accused had been the subject of surveillance over some months – whether continuously or otherwise I know not. No doubt one of the fruits of this surveillance, together with police intelligence, was this particular aspect of the accused’s weekly habits. Although there was no urgency for the arrest of the accused at some point the 19th February was settled on.13. On 16th February officers of Piccadilly approached Justice Simpson seeking authorization for a listening device. The warrant was sought so that two undercover operatives using assumed names would be able “to record or listen to the private conversations of NSW Police undercover operative using the assumed name ‘Sean’, NSW Police undercover operative using the assumed name ‘James’, Darren Kemp and any other person or persons participating in such conversations in cell three (or another cell that may be occupied by Darren Kemp at short notice…) at Newtown Police Station, ….” The warrant would survive, if needed, until 9th March.14. I note Her Honour does not appear to have been informed of the circumstances in which Darren Kemp would come to be in a cell at Newtown Police station at short notice. I do not regard the terms of the warrant as some judicial imprimatur for the course of action followed by Dt Smith and the undercover police operatives. 15. A few days prior to the accused’s arrest, Dt Sgt Smith briefed two undercover operatives. By the time they entered the cell they had been briefed about the accused demeanour and personality, particularly his trait of speaking about himself and his criminal activities, as well as general other activities.16. On the 18th February the listening device was installed into Cell 3 at the Newtown Police Station by police technicians. Dt Sgt Smith who ultimately charged the accused, had no intention of seeking a formal interview with the accused until some period after what he called covert surveillance had occurred, by which I understand him to mean until the undercover officers had had an opportunity to interact with the accused.The Accused is arrested17. At 6:30am on 19th February 2007 Dt Sgt Smith conducted a briefing session with the arresting police. By 8:30am police were in position. By 9:00am surveillance police were reporting in that the accused was on his way. By 9:15a.m. the accused’s arrest had been effected. By 9:42am he had arrived at Newtown Police Station and been conveyed to the custody area.18. Dt Willey, the arresting officer was well aware the accused was to be placed in a cell with undercover operatives. He knew that was one of the purposes of the arrest. He also believed the accused would be charged with the offences he was suspected of committing at Homebush Bay on 15th March 2005. 19. At the time of his arrest police involved with Strike Force Piccadilly knew he was on a methadone maintenance program. They knew he was aged 45, and was walking with a limp.20. At 9:46am the accused name was entered into the COPS computer at Newtown Police Station as a detained person. The entry of his name and date of birth into the computer system triggered other information within the storage system of the computer databases. His C.N.I. and M.I.N. were automatically displayed on the computer screen. I am satisfied he supplied other information on this first computer screen form, including his wife’s name, his Housing Commission address, and his home telephone number. At 9:47am the accused was placed in the dock. At 9:48am the Caution and Summary of Part 9 of Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (LEPRA) was read to him and a copy given to him.21. I note some important matters were raised in the LEPRA Part 9 summary. 
     
      
      While in police custody you do not have to say or do anything but anything that you say or you may do may be used in evidence; 
      The police will help you to contact a lawyer of your choice if you want legal advice or to ask that a person come to where you are; 
      The police will help you to contact a friend, a relative, a guardian or someone else so you can tell them where you are or ask them to come to where you are; 
      The police cannot ask you to say or do anything while waiting for your lawyer, friend, relative, guardian or other person to come to where you are. 
      The police do not have to wait for more than two hours for someone to come. If the police think someone’s safety is at risk they do not have to wait for two hours. There are other circumstances when the police do not have to contact or wait for someone to come. 
      The police will keep a record of what they do with you while you are in their custody. You can look at this record provided it is reasonable to let you do so. The police will give you a copy of this record when you are released or taken before a justice, magistrate or court. 
      
    22. The time entered on the Part 9 summary given to the accused is 10:53am. The Custody Officer, Leading Senior Constable Brett McKenna accepts this time is wrong. He claims it was entered by mistake, and that he really meant 9:48. There is a second entry 10:55am, representing he says, the time at which he signed the document. Frankly, I have difficulty accepting his explanation. He explains the error by claiming the clock in the custody area was incorrect. But for the computer-generated entry of 9:48am on the Custody Management Record, I would reject his explanation out of hand. As Custody Manger he would be conscious of the time the Local Court started working. 10:53 would be an hour after the Local Court was in action. 9:48am was 12 minutes before the usual starting hour for most courts. He would have been busy preparing prisoners for the 9:30am call-over (assuming there was one) or for the 10:00am mentions (assuming that was yet to come). 23. I have examined his records in respect of this accused, his then detainee, carefully. Frankly they are best classified as seriously inadequate, and as I understand the requirements to be, fall far short of the requirements imposed upon him and his staff. They are virtually useless in determining the movements of the accused within the Newtown Police Station Custody area from 9:51am.24. At 9:50am a brief assessment is commenced of the accused including a visual assessment. He was also asked about his medication at 9:50am. At 9:51am the brief assessment is completed. Each of these times referred to thus far is computer generated when the relevant computer screen form is engaged. For that reason I accept the LEPRA Part 9 Summary was read, otherwise complied with and the enquiries referred above to were made.25. The first detainee inspection/assessment record made of him is at 11:28am. It is said the frequency of inspections is 30 minutes, but the times recorded do not bear that out. Firstly he had been in custody at Newtown Police Station since 9:42am. The next observation made of him is at 12:18pm and the next after that 14:40pm. On those occasions he is recorded as being in the Dock. At 18:29pm the next observation places him in an unidentified cell. On the other hand the movement record for the whole of the accused’s time in custody at Newtown Police Station only records two moves: 9:47am the dock; and 21:12pm when Cell 3 is entered as the New Location. One could be forgiven for interpreting the records that he remained in the dock until at least after 2:40pm when he was removed to a cell, perhaps then being moved from that cell to Cell 3 at shortly after 9:00pm.The Accused’s Account.26. The accused complains that he was roughly handled during his arrest, by being thrown against an industrial bin and being pushed up against a roller door. Dt Willey is a tall, physically very impressive man. He was accompanied by another thick-set officer. Two other officers arrived moments after the formal arrest had been effected. The accused is short in stature, overweight, and on the day of arrest wearing a surgical stocking because of blood clots in his leg. He was suffering the after affects of a mild stroke. I have no doubt he was handled firmly when handcuffed. But when he arrives at the police station he describes himself as chatting to the Custody Officer who he knew. Had he been unnecessarily manhandled as he said, it is likely he would have been less gregarious and more complaining. In the course of speaking to undercover operative Sean, he said they “got him between a big industrial bin and a roller door. They were trying to make me face the roller door while I was waiting on a car, so I went fuckin livewire and started struggling with em. Not standing against the fucken wall.” I do not regard that account given by the accused on the day of his arrest as consistent with his claim to be thrown against the bin and pushed up against the roller door.27. The accused claimed he had told the arresting officer he had not been to the Easter show for 15 years. Although that evidence was not supported by either officer at the arrest, I do not rule it out. Within an hour and a half, the accused was telling the undercover operative Sean that was what he said at his arrest. It is certainly not beyond the accused as he presented in court. Neither arresting officer made his statement until a couple of months later. It is unlikely either remembered that detail.28. The accused claims that once in the Custody Area he was taken to the dock. McKenna, was called into an office, emerged after a short time and told the offender he was expecting a prison truck with prisoners on board from Silverwater and that he’d have to just put me in the cell for a couple of minutes while he processed and sorted them out. The accused’s case was he was not given his LEPRA rights. However, in the course of his discussion with Sean, the accused concedes he was asked for his home phone number, who was his next of kin. 29. For reasons I gave earlier I am satisfied he was properly entered into the computer custodial records, read and advised of his LEPRA rights, and shortly thereafter moved to Cell 3. The record shows that within 9 minutes of his arrival such a move was possible. I note, for example, that he tells undercover operative Sean that he was the “only person out in the docks, and [he] should have been left there and charged or whatever they were gonna do.” I do not reject his account that it was shortly after he arrived that he found himself in the cells with one undercover police operative. What I do reject, however, is his claim that that event occurred prior to his being advised of his rights, and the limitations placed upon his rights.30. The accused claimed that he was concerned for his personal safety during the time he was in his cells. As I understand it, this was the accused’s first period of incarceration in some years. I accept that he may well have been concerned for his safety. He was 45, in abominable physical condition. He was well aware of his own physical limitations. For a while there was one, and subsequently two apparent prisoners sharing the cell with him. The first had expressed, because of a desire to sleep, a wish to keep the cell to himself – which, so far as the accused was concerned, had been ignored. His descriptions of a prisoner’s mood suddenly changing, or resentments being formed for reasons of refusing to engage, - or indeed engaging too much – with the other prisoner or prisoners are well known. Many prisoners have difficulty with anger management. Paranoid thinking disables many others. Some prisoners have problems with both. I have no doubt this accused from prior custodial experience has a life experience of this that puts him on his guard. I do not regard his heightened sense of awareness as being caused by the undercover operatives (acting as undercover operatives), but simply by the presence of two apparent prisoners he didn’t know or trust being in the cell with him. 31. During his conversations with the undercover operative Sean, the accused took the role of a wronged accused, who police were trying “to fit up” with something that “happened a couple of years ago”, namely stealing ATMs from the Easter Show. He told police he hadn’t been to the Easter show for 15 years. Undercover operative Sean initially appeared to accept him at his word. Thereafter follows conversation as Sean explains what circumstance brought him to the cells. The accused appears to give Sean the benefit of his own (the accused’s) experience as to what is likely to follow through the day and the investigation Sean is likely to have. In the course of telling Sean of the need to watch the police, the accused concedes that there were a couple of things in his own wallet that he was a little concerned about. 32. Sean doesn’t pursue the accused’s concern. The conversation shortly shifts to the accused family, and their situations. There is further conversation about how the accused handled himself in various custodial situations. Some 12 pages into the interview, Sean asks: 
     
      
      Q: You reckon someone’s give you up? 
      
    33. Thereafter the accused claims “someone’s told lies” and seeks to put the blame on the daughter’s ex-fiance. He does express concern about being considered for being “knowingly concerned” or “knowing something”. The conversation wanders, and Sean brings it back to whether the accused’s “daughter’s ex could have told lies to get the heat off him?” The accused says: “Well he, he, he has tried.”34. This conversation is interrupted by the intrusion of the second undercover operative, James, into the scene. The two undercover operatives role play belonging to a group prepared to be involved in unlawful activities, using a truck waiting to be loaded with contraband of some kind. A conversation ensues between the two, with the odd comment added by the accused. At one point James is waxing philosophical and says: 
     
      
       
      …it’s no one’s fault, I mean it was an earn and that was it, you know that's all. It went fuckin bad. Can’t win em all can ya?”  
       
      
    to which the accused replies: No, no. Got me for fucking stealin ATMs from the fuckin Easter Show.35. James is quite happy to focus on the accused’s account. In describing the police who arrested him the accused comments that “these demons [meaning police] look like old-school demons like task force or homicide you know.” (Of course, he was correct.) James asks: “What did you kill some cunt while you were doin it? 
     
      
      Accused: No, no, no, no but a guy that was involved, he is in at the moment for a homicide see. 
      
    36. The accused thereafter speculates whether that person was motivated to deal with police, because he is facing a murder charge while paroled on an [unrelated] attempted ATM theft. The accused explained that a special task force had been established because of the sums of money contained in ATM’s. James postulates,  
     
      
      “But they don’t have much money in them do they ATMs. I’ve often wondered why blokes do em.”  
      
    37. The accused responds that a full size one would hold $240, 000. Sean chips in “Bullshit”. The accused’s response is I took two. Thereafter he gives detail, which if accepted would establish that he had a very good knowledge of the circumstances in which the two ATMs were taken from Homebush Bay. During submissions I described the accused as taking on the role of a raconteur. It stuck me he was very willing to tell the undercover operatives about the circumstances of the theft of the two ATMs and his role in it. 38. The interaction between the undercover operatives and the accused ends when Dt Smith arrives to remove the accused from Cell 3 for the purposes of conducting an E.R.I.S.P. between himself and the accused.. The transcripts of the conversations between the accused and undercover police have been tendered in the voir dire. The only reference to time on each transcript is 9:35a.m. and the duration of each particular track. The 9:35am time cannot be the time at which the interaction began. I regard it as probably being the time the listening device was activated. The accused was not at the police station until 9:42am.39. The accused did participate in an ERISP. It has not been tendered before me. The parties agree it commenced at 12:29pm. I am satisfied the accused was removed from Cell 3 shortly before 12:29pm. I am satisfied the accused was placed in Cell 3 around 10:00am, probably a few minutes before that time. Dt Smith gives evidence to this effect. I do not know how long the accused was in Cell 3 when the apparently sleeping prisoner chose to offer the accused a mattress. However once that event occurred his first CD track runs 1 hr and 12 minutes. Track two is 15 minutes. Those two tracks seem consecutive. At that point undercover operative Sean is removed from Cell 3. Thus far 1hour and 27 minutes have been consumed with the interaction. Then follows 10 un-timed pages (pages 14-24 UCO James) of transcript recording conversations between undercover operative James and the accused before undercover operative Sean returns. I have guesstimated approximately 20 minutes for this un-timed conversation. I base the guesstimate on the 15minutes for an 8 page transcript for Track 2. There is then a further 27 minutes of interaction. Sean’s second CD ends with the arrival of Dt Smith. Thus, doing the best I can, I guesstimate the time of the entire interaction between accused and undercover police is close to 2¼ hours. During this time the accused was continuously in Cell 3. 40. That being so, I am at a loss to understand Con. Steven Marsh’s claimed inspection of the accused in the dock at 11:28am. Indeed, when Const Singh collects Sean from Cell 3 he is asked the time. He gives it as 11:30. Other evidence establishes conclusively that either side of 11:28 the accused was in Cell 3. If evidence over and above the transcripts of the taped conversations is needed, one need look no further that Dt Smiths’s evidence that the accused went directly from the cells with him to the interview room at about 12:30pm.41. The charging process commenced at 13:28, some 4hours and 13 minutes after his arrest. It was not completed until 15:20 some 5 hours and 5 minutes after his arrest.Findings from the evidence42. On any view, the accused was being held in breach of s. 114 (3) of the LEPRA from 13:15 until taken before an authorized officer at 15:20. Thereafter he was bail refused until granted bail the following day. This is not a complaint raised by the defence. In relation to the matter presently to be determined, nothing much turns of this. 43. Given the now known deception being practiced on the accused during the early part of his time in custody, one cannot help but wonder whether the inapt record keeping is really something more sinister than inaptness. However, making such a finding is not necessary. Frankly, on the evidence I could not make it with the requisite degree of certainty. That does not mean the issue is unimportant for reasons extending beyond this judgment. I intend to forward this judgment and Voir Dire Exhibit 7 to the Police Integrity Commission for its consideration.44. But, what the evidence does establish is that the Custody Officer, knowing undercover operatives were seeking to finesse admissions from the accused failed to keep accurate records of his movements when it was his duty so to do. This failure to keep proper records, however motivated or caused, is sufficient on its own to constitute a circumstance to be taken into account. The failure to keep proper records inhibits the accused’s capacity to cross-examine as to his movements whilst in custody and the time of them in circumstances where a system has been established precisely for that purpose. During the time between his entry into the dock and his ultimate charging (the latter commenced at 13:28pm) several important movements and other events had taken place.45. However, the first record of his being away from the dock is documented at 18:29pm. There is nothing in the records capable of corroborating his account, should it have been important, of being in Cell 3 shortly after his arrival in the dock. Nor is he capable of relying upon the records to account for his movement from Cell 3. The first record of him being in Cell 3 puts the time at 9:12pm almost half a day after he actually was taken there. In other words, he is unable to establish from the records that he spent any time in Cell 3 before that time and/or the duration of time he was with the two undercover police operatives.46. Well before the accused’s arrest, Dt Sgt Smith recognised this was a case that could well do with strengthening up. That can be the only explanation for the decision to use undercover operatives after arrest.47. In fairness Dt Sgt Smith did not disavow such a proposition. Indeed, it seems he is prepared to acknowledge he was astute to the need. I raised with him his awareness that there are a number of means by which a person may be charged with an offence. When asked by me what prompted him to use the arrest option, Dt Sgt Smith answered: 
     
      
       
      Numerous reasons, one of them being obviously to try and further – to gain further evidence in relation to the listening device in the cell and obviously taking other things into account, the further commission of offences, things like that. 
       
       
      Q: I don’t understand that last bit? 
       
      A: Well by arresting the accused and trying to keep him behind bars it may go some what to reducing the incidence of further – similar offences that the accused may commit while at liberty. … 
       
       
      Q: …[H]e was taken to court I think the next day or the day after? 
      
    A. The next day. 
     
      
       
      Q. Was this fear of further offending raised at court on the bail hearing? 
       
      A. No it wasn’t for a particular reason. 
       
      
    48. Neither counsel sought to explore the particular reason for the likelihood of similar offences not being raised at the bail hearing. While not relevant to the matter at hand, other than establishing the ease with which the accused secured bail, I record the accused was granted bail conditional upon an acceptable person depositing $300 and the accused himself agreeing to forfeit $300 in the event of a breach of bail. 49. I am satisfied Dt Sgt Smith’s primary purpose in arresting the accused was to create a situation whereby the accused would be exposed to two undercover police whilst in police custody managed by police, and with all facilities provided by police. Dt Smith held some hope, if not confidence, that given those circumstances (the accused’s arrest for this particular crime, his noted personality traits as disclosed in other covert surveillance) advantage could be taken of police custody by using facilities of the police station, to obtain a venue, a listening device and his undercover police to focus the accused’s conversation upon the circumstances of the robbery. I am satisfied the two undercover operatives pursued their involvement with the accused at the direction of Dt Sgt Smith for the purpose of achieving, if possible, an outcome consistent with Dt Sgt Smith’s hoped for outcome. 50. Of the four hours allocated for investigation, Dt Sgt Smith chose to devote a majority of it to the interaction between undercover police operatives and the accused. It was Dt Sgt Smith’s intention and understanding that the accused would remain in Cell 3 until and only when he directed the accused be removed from the cell. Having allocated so much time for this purpose he was caught short of the four hours permitted for investigation purpose by s. 115 (2) LEPRA.51. I am satisfied the accused was not pressured by either of the undercover police officers. He was, of course unaware of their true identity as police officers. Each was, of course engaged in police work. Each was, through questioning and comments designed to evoke a response, seeking to increase police knowledge about the ATM thefts at the Easter Show in 2005. Because the accused was unaware of their identity, he spoke to them voluntarily, and it would appear, without much reserve.52. The defence case is the accused was posturing while speaking to the undercover police. His detailed knowledge, although appearing well informed, is hearsay. The Crown case is the accused was reliable in the account he gave to the undercover police. The only available evidence to compare the accused’s account to is the evidence of the security guard. As I have said, his evidence appeared to favour the accused, that is, appears inconsistent with significant portions of the accused’s account. I have already noted, my impression of the security guard was that he was a weak witness. I also noted he was not cross-examined by the prosecution on portions of his evidence that did not favour the prosecution. Nonetheless the detail provided by the accused to the undercover police smacks of reliability. It possessed the quality of an observant eyewitness. For example: 
     
      
      (a) …after I put it (container housing the two ATMs) on the truck, I've just pulled the fuckin forklift back and left it with the forks up. 
       
        
          
        
       
      (b) “well the arse of the forklift come off the ground” [when loaded with the container] 
      
     
     
      
      (c) “when we ripped 'em (the ATMs) out, like a couple of cables and fuckin put 'em on the truck, the big sign Westpac was still lit up, 'cos it was on its own power. So, it’s goin over the [Ryde?] Bridge and you see like Westpac on it.” 
      
    53. Ultimately, should these conversations proceed to the jury, it would be a matter for it whether these revelations made by the accused constituted true and accurate admissions. My task is confined to assessing the reliability of the evidence the prosecution seeks to provide the jury to satisfy myself that in the event it was admitted, the evidence is capable of satisfying a jury the accused made true and accurate admissions of his complicity in the theft of the ATMs. I am satisfied the evidence reaches such a level of reliability. I am satisfied the jury could prefer, beyond reasonable doubt, his account to that given by the security officer.Did the arrest of the accused constitute an improper arrest?54. Dt Sgt Smith’s mandate to arrest without warrant is covered primarily by s 99 LEPRA. It is set out below:  
     
      
      99 Power of police officer to arrest without warrant 
      
     (1) A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person if:  (a) the person is in the act of committing an offence under any Act or statutory instrument, or  (b) the person has just committed any such offence, or  (c) the person has committed a serious indictable offence for which the person has not been tried.  (2) A police officer may, without a warrant, arrest a person if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has committed an offence under any Act or statutory instrument.  (3) A police officer must not arrest a person for the purpose of taking proceedings for an offence against the person unless the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that it is necessary to arrest the person to achieve one or more of the following purposes:  (a) to ensure the appearance of the person before a court in respect of the offence,  (b) to prevent a repetition or continuation of the offence or the commission of another offence,  (c) to prevent the concealment, loss or destruction of evidence relating to the offence,  (d) to prevent harassment of, or interference with, a person who may be required to give evidence in proceedings in respect of the offence,  (e) to prevent the fabrication of evidence in respect of the offence,  (f) to preserve the safety or welfare of the person.  (4) A police officer who arrests a person under this section must, as soon as is reasonably practicable, take the person, and any property found on the person, before an authorized officer to be dealt with according to law. 55. On its face it appears the arrest may have been permissible pursuant to s. 99 (2), or to s99 (1) (c) assuming Dt Sgt Smith had such knowledge, or honestly and reasonably held such a belief. However the power of arrest pursuant to s99 (1)(c) and (2) is circumscribed by s,99 (3) when it is for the purpose of taking proceedings against a person. Dt Willey, who made the arrest, believed that was certainly one of the purposes. Dt Sgt Smith who ordered the arrest says his ultimate intention was the accused, once finished with the undercover operatives, was to be formally interviewed and charged. I am satisfied the subsidiary purpose in arresting the accused was to have him charged with the offences he has now been arraigned upon. 56. Assuming 99 (3) applies even when only the subsidiary purpose of the arrest is charging the person, then the arrest of the person should seek to achieve at least one of a number of designated purposes. On the evidence before me, I am not convinced Dt Sgt Smith genuinely believed the accused would be unlikely to appear (he was granted bail the following day); would be likely to commit an offence (not raised at the bail hearing); would be likely to conceal, lose or destroy evidence already available to police or at all (subject of course to the accused right to silence); to harass or interface with a potential witness; or was likely to fabricate evidence if not arrested. If Dt Sgt Smith’s belief of the accused’s involvement is correct, the likelihood, from Dt Smith’s perspective, of a risk of fabricating evidence would increase during any interview with the accused. Nor was the arrest necessary to preserve the safety or welfare of the accused. Again, if there was any risk to the safety and welfare of the accused, given his health conditions it could only have been exacerbated by his arrest. I can find no purpose required to be achieved by s.99 (3) was genuinely entertained by Dt Sgt Smith. Nor can I find any such purpose was achieved by the accused’s arrest.57. I find any arrest for the purpose of initiating criminal proceedings against the accused was unjustified in the circumstances of this case.Did the primary purpose of the arrest justify the arrest?58. As I earlier remarked the primary purpose of the arrest was to detain the accused at a venue controlled by police for the purpose of placing two undercover operatives in a cell with the accused in circumstances where his mind would be focused upon the circumstances of the theft of two ATMs at the Easter Show. I turn now to consider whether an arrest in those circumstances was justified.59. A useful starting point is to review some clear statements on the common law. 
     
      
      A person is not to be imprisoned otherwise than upon the authority of a justice or a court except to the extent reasonably necessary to bring him before the justice to be dealt with according to law. That as we conceive it, is one of the foundations of the common law.

      The right to personal liberty is, as Fullagar J. described it, “the most elementary and important of all common law rights”. Personal liberty was held by Blackstone to be an absolute right vested in the individual by the immutable laws of nature and had never been abridged by the laws of England “without sufficient cause”. He warned: 
       
        
        Of great importance to the public is the preservation of this personal liberty: for if once it were left in the power of any, the highest, magistrate to imprison arbitrarily whomever he or his officers thought proper … there would soon be an end of all other rights and immunities. 
        
       
        
       
      That warning has been recently echoed. In  
      Cleland v The Queen 
      , Deane J said 
       
        
        It is of critical importance to the existence and protection of personal liberty under the law that the restraints which the law imposes on police powers of arrest and detention be scrupulously observed. 
        
       
       
      The right to personal liberty cannot be impaired or taken away without lawful authority and then only to the extent and for the time which the law prescribes…

      But suspicion that a person has committed a crime cannot justify an arrest except for a purpose, which that suspicion justifies; and arrest and imprisonment cannot be justified merely for the purpose of asking questions. When a police officer suspect that a crime has been committed there is no reason why he should not, and every reason why he should ask questions of any person who seems likely to be able to give any information on the subject, whether he suspects him of having committed it or not, for the purpose of discovering whether his suspicions are well founded, and if so, who is the perpetrator, but he has no authority to arrest or confine any person for the purpose of asking him questions. No person is entitled to impose any physical restraint upon another except as authorized by law. This rule applies as much to police officers as to any one else, although the law allows them somewhat greater powers in this respect than it allows to other citizens. Where the imposition of physical restraint is authorized by law it may be imposed only for the purpose for which it is authorized. Thus such restraint may be lawful to prevent a breach of the peace so long as it ceases as soon as its necessity ceases. It may be imposed in the course of arresting and bring before a magistrate a person for whose arrest a warrant has issued; and it may be imposed by a police officer in the course of arresting and bringing before a magistrate a person for whose arrest no warrant has issued, but whom the officer, with reasonable cause suspects of having committed a crime or an offence punishable whether by indictment or summarily under any Act. This authority existed with respect to felonies at common law. It was extended to other offences by statute [Crimes Act 1900]…. But the statute, like the common law, authorizes him only to take the person so arrested before a justice to be dealt with according to law, and to do so without unreasonable delay and by the most reasonably direct rout. Any detention which is reasonably necessary until a magistrate can be obtained is of course lawful, but detention which extends beyond this cannot be justified under the common law or statutory power. Thus it has been held that if in the course of an arrest which is otherwise for a lawful purpose, the arresting constable takes the arrested person to some place to which it would not be reasonable and proper to take him in the course of bringing him before a magistrate, for the purpose of searching him there, the detention in that place and the search are unauthorized and therefore actionable.

    60. The common law, of course has been modified by statute. When introducing the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Bill , the then Attorney General (Mr Debus) in the second reading speech said the following: 
     
      
      The Government is pleased to introduce the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Bill. The bill represents the outcome of the consolidation process envisaged by the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service to help strike a proper balance between the need for effective law enforcement and the protection of individual rights…. 
       
       
      I turn now to powers relating to arrest. Part 8 of the bill substantially re-enacts arrest provisions of the Crimes Act 1900 and codifies the common law. The provisions of part 8 reflect that arrest is a measure that is to be exercised only when necessary. An arrest should only be used as a last resort as it is the strongest measure that may be taken to secure an accused person’s attendance at court. Clause 99, for example clarifies that a police officer should not make an arrest unless it achieves the specified purposes, such as preventing the continuance of the offence. Failure to comply with this clause would not, of itself, invalidate the charge. Clauses 107 and 108 make it clear that nothing in the part affects the power of a police officer to exercise the discretion to commence proceedings for an offence other than by arresting the person, for example, by way of caution or summons or another alternative to arrest. Arrest is a measure of last resort. That part clarifies that police have the power to discontinue arrest at any time. 
       
       
      The application of the safeguards contained in part 15 of the bill represents the classification of the common law requirement that persons must be told of the real reason for their arrest and a clarification of the additional requirements that officers must provide their name, place of duty and a warning. Hansard 17th September 2002 p. 4846. 
      
    61. Below are the relevant provisions of Part 9 of the LEPRA.Part 9 – Investigation and Questioninga) 109 Objects of Part b) The objects of this Part are:

       (b) to authorise the detention of a person who is under arrest for such a period despite any requirement imposed by law to bring the person before a Magistrate or other authorized officer or court without delay or within a specified period, and 
        
        (c) to provide for the rights of a person so detained.  
       
      
    c) 111 Persons to whom Part applies  
     
      
       
        
        (1) This Part applies to a person, including a person under the age of 18 years, who is under arrest by a police officer for an offence. It is immaterial whether the offence concerned was committed before or after the commencement of this Part or within or outside the State.  
         
         
        (2) This Part does not apply to a person who is detained under Part 16.  
        
       
      
    d) 113 Effect of Part on other powers and duties  (1) Existing powers relating to arrest and other matters This Part does not:  (a) confer any power to arrest a person, or to detain a person who has not been lawfully arrested, or  (b) prevent a police officer from asking or causing a person to do a particular thing that the police officer is authorised by law to ask or cause the person to do (for example, the power to require a person to submit to a breath analysis under Division 3 of Part 2 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999, or (c) independently confer power to carry out an investigative procedure.  
     
      
       
      (2) Certain evidentiary matters and rights not affected. Nothing in this Part affects:  
      
     (a) the operation of:  (i) the following provisions of the Evidence Act 1995:  section 84 (Exclusion of admissions influenced by violence and certain other conduct)  section 85 (Criminal proceedings: reliability of admissions by defendants)  section 90 (Discretion to exclude admissions)  section 138 (Exclusion of improperly or illegally obtained evidence)  section 139 (Cautioning of persons), or  (ii) any other provision of that Act, or   (b) any law that permits or requires a person to be present at the questioning of another person who is under arrest (for example, the presence of a parent at the questioning by a police officer of the parent’s child), or  (c) the right of a person to refuse to participate in any questioning of the person or any other investigative procedure unless the person is required by law to do so, or  (d) the right of a person to leave police custody if the person is not under arrest, or  (e) the rights of a person under the Bail Act 1978. e) 114 Detention after arrest for purposes of investigation  (1) A police officer may in accordance with this section detain a person, who is under arrest, for the investigation period provided for by section 115.   (2) A police officer may so detain a person for the purpose of investigating whether the person committed the offence for which the person is arrested.   (3) If, while a person is so detained, the police officer forms a reasonable suspicion as to the person’s involvement in the commission of any other offence, the police officer may also investigate the person’s involvement in that other offence during the investigation period for the arrest. It is immaterial whether that other offence was committed before or after the commencement of this Part or within or outside the State.  (4) The person must be:  (a) released (whether unconditionally or on bail) within the investigation period, or  (b) brought before an authorized officer or court within that period, or, if it is not practicable to do so within that period, as soon as practicable after the end of that period.  (5) A requirement in another Part of this Act, the Bail Act 1978 or any other relevant law that a person who is under arrest be taken before a Magistrate or other authorized officer or court, without delay, or within a specified period, is affected by this Part only to the extent that the extension of the period within which the person is to be brought before such a Magistrate or officer or court is authorised by this Part.  (6) If a person is arrested more than once within any period of 48 hours, the investigation period for each arrest, other than the first, is reduced by so much of any earlier investigation period or periods as occurred within that 48 hour period.   (7) The investigation period for an arrest (the ""earlier arrest"") is not to reduce the investigation period for a later arrest if the later arrest relates to an offence that the person is suspected of having committed after the person was released, or taken before a Magistrate or other authorised officer or court, in respect of the earlier arrest.  
     
      
      115 Investigation period  
       
      
     (1) The investigation period is a period that begins when the person is arrested and ends at a time that is reasonable having regard to all the circumstances, but does not exceed the maximum investigation period.  (2) The maximum investigation period is 4 hours or such longer period as the maximum investigation period may be extended to by a detention warrant. f) Division 3 – Safeguards relating to persons in custody for questioningg) 122 Custody manager to caution, and give summary of Part to, detained person   
     
      
      (1) As soon as practicable after a person who is detained under this Part (a ""detained person"") comes into custody at a police station or other place of detention, the custody manager for the person must orally and in writing:  
      
     (a) caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence, and  (b) give the person a summary of the provisions of this Part that is to include reference to the fact that the maximum investigation period may be extended beyond 4 hours by application made to an authorized officer and that the person, or the person’s legal representative, may make representations to the authorized officer about the application.  (2) The giving of a caution does not affect a requirement of any law that a person answer questions put by, or do things required by, a police officer.  (3) After being given the information referred to in subsection (1) orally and in writing, the person is to be requested to sign an acknowledgment that the information has been so given. 62. The intent of parliament was to codify the common law insofar as the power of arrest is concerned (Second Reading Speech ante). There has been no sanction by Parliament of any diminution of a person’s right to personal liberty cherished by Fullagar J. There is nothing in the provisions of the LEPRA or the Second Reading speech of the then Attorney General which justifies the use of arrest for any purpose other than to bring the person before a justice or otherwise authorized person to be dealt with according to the law (Williams v The Queen ante per Wilson and Dawson JJ). The capacity to detain for any purpose after arrest is enlivened only once the arrest has been accomplished (s.114 (1)). 63. Arrest is still a remedy of last resort (Williams v The Queen ante per Mason and Brennan JJ) (S. 99 LEPRA). Section 114 (1) does not provide any basis for arrest (Bales v Parmeter (ante). Proper arrest is a condition precedent without which s 114 (1) cannot be activated. Absent a lawful arrest access to the investigation period is unavailable. Nor can an arrest be formulated for any purpose other than what the law permits. Clearly the common law would not sanction the use of an arrest for purposes conceived and pursued by Dt Sgt Smith. Nor is there authority in the common law once a person is arrested to restrain his liberty for the purpose of placing him in a cell with undercover police. As Chief Justice Jordan said: “No person is entitled to impose any physical restrain upon another except as authorized by law.” So far as I am aware the placing of an accused in a designated cell with two undercover operatives charged with engaging him, and tasked with seeing if admissions can be finessed from him is not authorized by law as a basis for arrest. 64. Nor, it seems to me, is it authorized by s 114 (2) LEPRA or any other section. “[T]he purpose of investigating” found in s114 (2) relates to enquiries being done after arrest by the arresting officer or those acting at his direction. An investigation amounts to a search, inquiry or examination of particulars. It is an examination to obtain the true facts to make an inquiry. When the allowance of 4 hours was made for investigation time, what was contemplated was the formal questioning of a suspect, and time preparatory for conducting a record of interview. There was a real issue as to whether police were permitted by the common law, having arrested a suspect, to have time out for the purpose of questioning before placing the accused before an authorized person for charge and bail. It was never a voiced contemplation that there should be “time out” for undercover operatives to pose as arrested detainees.65. What occurred in the cells with this accused was a fishing expedition that may, or may not have been successful. It can hardly masquerade as an investigation. When LEPRA was drafted conduct of the kind that is the subject of this voir dire was unknown after arrest and before charging. None of the government, the Royal Commission, or the Courts in this country, so far as my enquiries are concerned, has dealt with conduct of this kind at this particular time in the criminal trial process. There was no law enacted to redress or support it. Understanding the terms of LEPRA are codifying the common law, there is nothing in s 114 (2) which supports the pursuit of this conduct.66. Dt Smith’s primary purpose in arresting the accused did not justify his arrest. It follows from my findings in respect of his arrest that the accused was treated unfairly. Although an arrest may be carried out not in accordance with LEPRA, any charge resulting from that arrest nonetheless survives. However, s.113 provides that evidentiary matters and right are not affected.67. The defence seeks relief pursuant to s.90 Evidence Act 1995. It provides: 
     
      
      In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission or refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact if: 
       
       
        
        (a) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b)  
        having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence. 
        
       
      
    68. The Crown argues, if I find an impropriety I would exercise my discretion pursuant to s.138 of the Evidence Act. While there is clearly scope for an overlapping of the work done by the two sections, there are also differences to be observed in their application. S138 applies to civil and criminal proceedings. It applies to the tender of a wide range of evidentiary matters. It seeks to deal with impropriety and unlawful conduct by a wide range of people and in a wide range of situations. On the other hand s. 90 is more targeted. It is directed only to admissions, and only admissions adduced by the prosecution. It applies only in criminal proceedings. It is targeted particularly at ensuring propriety among law enforcement officers. Not surprisingly given the different scope of each section there are different policy considerations. Improper conduct that may survive if tested against s.138 (3) may not survive – assuming it related to an admission in criminal proceedings, against the test of s.90 (b).69. The relief sought is a discretionary matter. Obviously I am dealing with admissions said to have been made by the accused, and sought to be adduced by the prosecution in criminal proceedings. The issue for me is “having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, is it unfair to the defendant to use the evidence in the trial.” It is no secret to the parties that this has been a difficult decision for the Court. The question for me is not whether the accused was treated unfairly; it is whether the reception of the admissions would be unfair to him (Cleland v The Queen (1982) 151 CLR 1 at p. 18 per Deane J.70. I have found the admissions were voluntarily made. I have found they qualify as having the requisite degree of reliability to go before a jury. The Part 9 caution, although not usually so applied or understood, is capable of covering a situation where undercover operatives are or may be in a cell. Authorities such as Tofilau v R 238 ALR 650 and Em v R 239 ALR 204 stand for the acceptance into evidence of admissions made in such circumstances.71. On the other hand, in my experience this is an extraordinary case. The only authority I have been able to locate from my experience and research touching upon any covert dealings with a detainee in custody pending charging is a Canadian decision R v Broyles [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595. Even that case has significant differences. 72. There is helpful obiter to be found in R v Mullah [2005] NSWSC 358 (11 February 2005) in a judgment of Wood CJ at CL: 
     
      
     114. The difference in the position of an accused who is involved in [covert surveillance] conversations in the course of the commission of a crime, and that of an accused post arrest, while not conclusive, also has, in my view some significance. A particular concern exists in relation to post arrest trickery or subterfuge that is designed to derogate from the fundamental right of silence, and from the privilege against self-incrimination. Somewhat different considerations apply, in my view, in relation to investigations occurring before arrest, and which are an almost inevitable feature of the kind of controlled operations, which are now permitted by statute, in response to the decision in  
     Ridgeway v The Queen 
     . (reference omitted).  
      
    73. For reasons given I regard the arrest of the accused as an unfair deprivation of his liberty. Such an unfairness is no small matter. The unfairness impinges into the consideration of circumstances in which the admissions were made. It was an extreme step taken by police in placing the accused into an environment that was owned, managed, and dominated by them, for an unfair purpose.74. For reasons I have given I regard the custody records maintained by the police as an impropriety that becomes a circumstance to be taken into account on the question of fairness to the accused. For reasons I have given above I regard them as a circumstance contributing to the unfairness of allowing the admissions into evidence.75. I am satisfied planned trickery and deception were used by investigating police because of a belief that the accused would not reveal anything incriminating within the normal interview structure. In doing so they were seeking to avoid, or more accurately void his right to silence. I note the remarks of Brennan CJ in Swaffield “There is a public interest in ensuring that the police do not adopt tactics that are designed simply to avoid the limitations on their inquisitorial functions that the courts regard as appropriate in a free society. (R v Swaffield 72 ALJR 339.)76. I have already noted when reviewing the detail of this case that from a prosecution perspective, but for the admissions made by the accused, it is a markedly weak case. The admissions are, because of their scope, detail and reliability self-incriminatory evidence of a high order. Self- incriminatory evidence obtained in the way in which this incriminatory evidence was obtained would render this trial unfair because its admission would strike at one of the fundamental tenets of a fair trial, the right to silence. That the admissions may persuade a jury beyond reasonable doubt is not to point. The unfairness in the trial would be excusing by the trial judge the voiding of the right to silence by trickery and deceit. If the impugned evidence is the only evidence tending to incriminate the accused, the fact that the conviction of the accused depends on self-incriminatory evidence will increase the unfairness of the trial. ( R v Broyles [1991] 3 SCR 595 citing with approval R v Collins [1987] 1 SCR 265 and R v Herbert [1990] 2 SCR 151).77. In all the circumstances I am persuaded that having regard to the circumstances in which the admissions sought to be relied upon by the Crown were made by the accused, it would be unfair to him to use them in evidence against him. The tender of the evidence of the recordings made by the undercover police in Cell 3 at the Newtown Police Station on 19 February 2005 is rejected.

      JUDGMENT 
      
     
     
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Linda Jane Walicki (the accused) has been indicted upon three counts charging, respectively, the murder of Michael Walicki (her father), the murder of Kathryn Walicki (one of her sisters) and wounding with intent to murder Susan Walicki (her mother). Upon her election and with the consent of the prosecutor, the trial has been heard without a jury. To each count she has pleaded not guilty. The entirety of the evidence has been received by the consent tender of documents. The Crown is represented by a Deputy Senior Crown Prosecutor and the accused is represented by Senior Counsel. There is no contest between the parties and it is the submission of both counsel that the appropriate verdict on all counts should be not guilty by reason of mental illness. As will appear and for the reasons following, I accept that submission. 
     
      
    2 The evidence includes an agreed statement of facts which is extracted from the statements and reports which accompany it. Whilst there are some differences in the recollection of detail and the recounting of observations by various witnesses, the differences are insignificant. I accept the expression of facts and the content of documentation. Nothing will be gained by recitation of all this material and it will suffice to summarize my findings concerning the basic facts and circumstances of the offences and the mental state of the accused at the relevant time. 
     
      
    3 The accused is the third born child of the six children of her parents. As at 5 July 2007 she resided in premises which had been the family home for some 25 years. It was a substantial two storey brick residence. Over a long period before that date the accused had manifested signs of perceptible mental disturbance and her parents had sought treatment for her. I shall return to relate some of this history but it is convenient to focus on the charges by noting events commencing from the evening of 4 July. 
     
      
    4 In the early part of that evening the accused was having what family members described as panic attacks and was turning “towards aggression”. She appeared unwilling to eat and her mother fed her. She oscillated between requesting to be taken to hospital and then proclaiming that she was not sick. At about 8 pm she left the house and her father, sister Kathryn and brother Peter followed and accompanied her. She simply walked up and down the street in which the residence was located.  
     
      
    5 Whilst walking she spoke “a lot of weird stuff”. She pointed to a spot on the ground and said that they had to stay there and hold hands for 30 minutes. A suggestion that she sit down on a bench was met with a response that it was not safe. She expressed a conviction that someone was behind a fence waiting to “get us”. Quite unreferenced to any discussion she commenced to make enquiries about the workings of guns. Her father responded in order to try and divert her attention. She was reluctant to return to the house because “people were going to come and steal her and kill us all”.  
     
      
    6 Eventually she was persuaded to go inside and she was later observed to be violently striking the keyboard of her computer.  
     
      
    7 Sometime after midnight she came into Peter’s bedroom, wakened him and demanded to know the password for his email account. His failure to respond immediately was met with an outburst of uncharacteristically vulgar language. The parents came to the scene but the accused again tried to leave the house but was restrained and relieved of keys which she had obtained. She continued screaming and uttering obscenities. 
     
      
    8 The accused’s mother persuaded her to take some medication (Valium) and after this she appeared to calm down but she did not seem to sleep.  
     
      
    9 After daylight on the morning of 5 July, her mother fed her some scrambled eggs and reminded her that she had an appointment to see a psychiatrist Dr Lucire. The accused said that she couldn’t go but she was coaxed into entering the car. On the journey she asked to go home but, accompanied by both her parents, they arrived at a car park adjacent to the doctor’s office. The accused expressed fear that there was a bomb in the car park but she accompanied her mother to a toilet which was on the way to the office. As Susan Walicki went to enter a cubicle the accused commenced to beat her with her fists. A bystander came to her aid and, alerted by the commotion, Michael Walicki attended and took custody of the accused. 
     
      
    10 Mrs Walicki fetched Dr Lucire who came down and took the accused, who refused to mount an escalator, to a nearby coffee shop. Dr Lucire told the parents that she could not make a diagnosis without a consultation in her rooms and she advised that the accused be taken home and to return to see her in the following week. 
     
      
    11 I interpolate that there was tendered a copy of a notification to the New South Wales Medical Board signed by Drs Furst and Guiffrida, psychiatrists at Justice Health, concerning Dr Lucire’s assessment and treatment of the accused. The evidence does not include any response by Dr Lucire. It does include a letter authored by Dr Lucire dated 4 November 2006 addressed to “The Magistrate” in which she expresses opinion about increasing depression, psychosis and akathisia as a result of side effects of drugs which were then being administered to the accused at Banks House, a psychiatric unit attached to Bankstown-Lidcombe Hospital. The letter claims that a particular drug was “unlawfully given” and that the accused was psychotic, had a religious mania which could be schizophrenic and “will not recover” on the medication which was then being administered. There was a hearing by a visiting magistrate with a view to a community treatment order pursuant to mental health legislation but it is an agreed fact that the letter from Dr Lucire was not put before the magistrate. I refer to this matter to observe that I am not in a position to resolve the obvious underlying dispute which can be identified from the notification by Justice Health and Dr Lucire’s letter, nor is it necessary for me so to do in order to reach verdicts on the indictment.  
     
      
    12 I return to the narrative of facts. The accused and her parents arrived home after her mother had gone to see their local GP, who in turn had contacted Dr Lucire who indicated that she was happy to see the accused in the future on a twice weekly basis. After the return home Susan Walicki felt a need to get out of the house and she went outside to mow the lawn and Kathryn, her daughter, came to assist. The accused and her father remained inside. 
     
      
    13 I am satisfied to the necessary standard that whilst in the house the accused armed herself with a long bladed knife and with requisite intent inflicted multiple stab wounds on her father and that he died as a result thereof. The accused then came out of the house and, in a regression to the language of childhood, said “Mummy, Mummy, something bad has happened but I don’t know what it is, can you come in and have a look”. Susan Walicki entered the house and saw her husband lying on the floor in a pool of blood. As she bent over him the accused made a frenzied attack, stabbing her mother in the back with the knife. I am satisfied that the multiple stabbings then inflicted were woundings and were accompanied by the intent as charged in the third count of the indictment.  
     
      
    14 Susan Walicki, although severely injured, managed to evade the accused by making her way through a back door and she went to Kathryn who had resumed the lawnmowing. The accused came out of the house and started to chase Kathryn who ran inside. The accused followed her. I am satisfied that whilst inside the house, the accused with the same intent inflicted multiple stab wounds upon Kathryn who died as a result of those wounds. 
     
      
    15 The remaining issue is the mental responsibility of the accused for these acts at the time of the killings and the wounding. It casts considerable light upon the issue to consider the conduct of the accused as observed immediately thereafter.  
     
      
    16 A next door neighbour, a Mr Galloway, had come to assist Susan Walicki who was lying on the ground. Whilst he was so doing the accused simply walked from the house carrying the knife. She looked at Mr Galloway who thought that she appeared calm and she walked away. Later he noticed her still carrying the knife and she walked past the driveway to his house. He noticed her approach a white Mazda sedan and get into the front seat. Obviously, he then turned his attention to trying to assist the critically injured Susan Walicki. 
     
      
    17 The Mazda sedan was being driven by Mr Borg, another resident of the street. The accused had signalled him to stop which he did. She spoke to him through the passenger window. She said, “Are you here to pick me up?” And he replied, “Do you need a lift?” She said, “Are you here to take me?” And he said, “I don’t think so”. But she got into the passenger seat of his car. He noticed blood on her clothing and on her arm. He asked her, “Where are we going?” And she replied, “Aren’t you the person taking me to Croatia?” He said, “Oh, I don’t think so” and she responded, “You mustn’t be the person I’m waiting for”. She then got out of the car. 
     
      
    18 This exchange and the remarks of the accused are self evidently bizarre and they are even more so with the inexplicable reference to Croatia. The evidence is that the accused’s father was Australian born but of Polish descent and her mother comes from several generations of Australian born ancestors. Whilst the conduct and words of the accused cannot be judged by rational standards there is no clue as to why she would consider that she would be going to Croatia. 
     
      
    19 Shortly afterwards the accused again entered Mr Borg’s car. She declined his enquiry as to whether she would like to go to hospital but in answer to his further query she said that it would be good to go to the police station. Before they could set off, she again alighted from the car. At this time Mr Borg saw a police vehicle arrive and he approached it and reported what had happened to the officers. 
     
      
    20 After the accused left Mr Borg’s car she ran to another vehicle which was being driven by Mrs McCubben, another resident of the street. Mrs McCubben locked her car preventing entry by the accused who then walked on down the street. She was stopped by Constable Sheldrick who drew his pistol and ordered her to lie on the ground. She complied and was placed under arrest. 
     
      
    21 As other police were arriving, the accused was making intermittent remarks. She referred to having “butchered” her family. She exhibited some confusion about the number of victims. Later the accused was taken by ambulance officers to Liverpool Hospital. As she had been arrested, she was escorted by Constable Beltrami. He took a note of conversations which the accused had with Ambulance Officer Mannion. The text of the exchanges offers compelling examples of the accused’s irrationality. The initial notes read: (M refers to Ambulance Officer Mannion and A to the accused): 
     
      
       
        
        “M Why did you go to Rozelle for? 
        
       
       
        
         A Because I was pregnant. 
        
       
       
        
         M How old is the baby? 
        
       
       
        
         A She’s dead. 
        
       
       
        
         A Where the fuck am I? 
        
       
       
        
         M You’re at the hospital. 
        
       
       
        
         A I don’t want to be at the fucking hospital. 
        
       
       
        
         M Who did this to your hands? 
        
       
       
        
         A This bitch Danny did them. 
        
       
       
        
         M Do you know Danny? 
        
       
       
        
         A She’s a whore. I know her face she’s fourteen.” 
        
       
      
    22 The accused has never been pregnant and the evidence does not identify “Danny”. The constable noted further conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        “M How did these cuts happen to your hand? 
        
       
       
        
        A Because I was rapped (sic) today. I just want a fucking knife. I want more killing. 
        
       
       
        
        A short time later the accused said: 
        
       
       
        
        A I’ve been at Kogarah before for fucking too many people. 
        
       
       
        
        M What suburb do you live in? 
        
       
       
        
        A Marrickville. 
        
       
       
        
        M What street? 
        
       
       
        
        A Fucksville. 
        
       
       
        
        Short time later the accused said: 
        
       
       
        
        A More I need more. The fucking knife, the fucking knife. In the front door.” 
        
       
      
    23 Constable Meekin who had arrived at the scene with Constable Beltrami followed the ambulance to the hospital. After they arrived there, he saw the accused with Ambulance Officer Hume and a triage nurse. I extract from the agreed statement of facts a description of what Constable Meekin saw: 
     
      
       
        
        “He observed that the accused became anxious and started to yell and scream: 
        
       
       
        
        ‘A I hate religion, fuck, fuck, fuck. My name is Joy I want to go back to Marrickville. My name is Joy and I live in Marrickville. 
        
       
       
        
        A Today is Sunday. My pain is not that bad I should be able to go home. 
        
       
       
        
        A do you know what would be scary; the end of the world, a good place to go would be with all the murderers and rapists’. 
        
       
       
        
        Following these statements by the accused she then started to scream and laugh. After several minutes she appeared to become angry and said ‘I want to die, die, die, die, die, die I want her to die the bitch; I want the bitch to die. My mans a bastard, its disgusting, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.’ 
        
       
       
        
        Following this outburst the accused then started to kick and scream and shake uncontrollably. The accused was restrained by hospital staff and then sedated.” 
        
       
      
    24 As I have mentioned, the evidence of family members is that the use of crude language was not part of the accused’s ordinary behaviour.  
     
      
    25 That an incipient mental illness was becoming florid was detectable for some time before the events of 4 and 5 July 2007. Among other signs and symptoms the accused was considered by a number of people, both family members and friends, as having developed a religious mania. She was known to be approaching people with unacceptable zealotry. She had, over a period of time moved between a number of sects of Christianity, her final association being with a Pentecostal ministry called “Hope Central”, which was part of the Assemblies of God. To them she attempted to make very large donations but on being apprised of relevant circumstances the church refunded the money. 
     
      
    26 It is not necessary to elaborate on these aspects nor upon the accused’s encounters whilst employed as an apprentice chef. Neither is it necessary to discuss a failed relationship which the accused had with a young man nor with those with whom she shared accommodation when living away from home (at one time she shared a house with her sister and another) save to say that it was a common experience for all these people to observe that there was “something wrong” with the accused. 
     
      
    27 She had returned to the family home in about August 2006. It was after this return that her mother became aware that she harboured a thought that she was possessed by an evil spirit. The accused sought to “talk about Jesus all the time” and she went on long walks at strange hours, calling in and speaking to people about Him. Her behaviour was of such concern that on 24 October 2006 Susan Walicki approached the police and as a consequence of her call the accused was taken to be assessed at Banks House. She was diagnosed as schizophrenic and on 1 November 2006 a visiting magistrate ordered that she be detained for 14 days. On 15 November the accused again appeared before the visiting magistrate and the evidence includes a “Form 20” under the Mental Health Act 1990. This pro forma indicates by a series of ticks the findings of the magistrate that the accused was then on the balance or (sic) probabilities suffering from a mental illness characterised by (a) delusions; (b) hallucinations; (d) severe disturbance of mood and (e) sustained or repeated irrational behaviour indicating the presence of any one or more of the symptoms (including (a) (b) and (d) as stated).  
     
      
    28 The further finding was indicated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Owing to that illness and the continuing condition of the person and the likely effects of any likely deterioration in that condition, I further find that there are reasonable grounds for believing that, care treatment or control of the person is necessary: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) for the person’s own protection from serious harm.” 
        
       
      
    29 However, further in the document under the heading “Final Orders” it is recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find the patient not to be a mentally ill person under the  
        Mental Health Act 
         1990 for the following reasons no active characteristics of the illness present and no longer likely to harm herself”.  
        
       
       
      Immediate discharge was ordered. 
       
      
    30 At about this time, concern about the mental health of the accused had led to the arrangements for her to be seen by Dr Lucire. The evidence includes some oblique references to an association of Michael Walicki with the cult of Scientology and its apparent reluctance to recognize any benefit which might flow from the practice of psychiatry. Despite these references it appears that it was Michael Walicki who sought out Dr Lucire who was a qualified and practising psychiatrist. There are also references to his beliefs in the maintenance of health by particular diets and the acquisition for his daughter of some non-psychiatric medicines. There is nothing which demonstrates that any act or omission by Michael Walicki in the pursuit of his asserted beliefs was of any causative consequence to the mental condition of the accused at the time of the acts of killing and wounding. 
     
      
    31 As I mentioned at the outset, counsel have expressed themselves to be “ad idem”, the Crown Prosecutor candidly stating, “the fact is that she’s not guilty by reason of mental illness”. In response to my enquiry about the McNaughten test, whether the accused did not know the nature and quality of her acts or whether she did not appreciate that they were wrong he indicated, “both”.  
     
      
    32 The assessment by counsel of the unanimous thrust of psychiatric opinion as focussed upon the events of 5 July was plainly correct. I extract some significant passages from the opinions.  
     
      
    33 Dr Furst, earlier mentioned, is a consultant forensic psychiatrist retained by Justice Health. His report of 3 October 2007 was specifically prepared in relation to an upcoming bail hearing but he was advantaged by having participated in the care of the accused from 11 July 2007 only a few days after the central events. His report included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Walicki’s psychotic illness appears to have developed over the last two years ago, and which has continued to the present date. Her illness has been characterised by paranoid delusions, religious delusions, and delusions of reference, auditory hallucinations, and marked disturbance of mood and affect. It is highly likely that she killed her father and younger sister and stabbed her mother in response to her delusional beliefs that she was going to be killed, that her family were involved in this, and that they had to die with her. In my opinion she has the defence of mental illness open to her and is very likely to become a forensic patient requiring ongoing rehabilitation and a gradual reintegration into society. 
        
       
       
        
        Although there has been substantial improvement in her condition over the past 12 weeks, she continues to present with acute signs of illness, including a belief that she will be tortured and killed, that a catastrophic event will take place in September, and a recent episode of self-harm; which was an attempt to avoid these perceived outcomes. 
        
       
       
        
        Clearly, Ms Walicki remains at high risk of suicide and high risk of violence.” 
        
       
      
    34 Dr Olav Nielssen was retained by the accused’s solicitors and saw her on 30 August 2007 and 17 October 2007. His report of 28 October 2007 identified source documents made available to him. In particular he had access to treatment notes by Dr Lucire which he stated had been obtained pursuant to a search warrant. The date of first consultation by Dr Lucire which he records as 14 November 2007 is clearly a typing error and should read 14 November 2006. 
     
      
    35 He expressed a diagnosis of schizophrenia and an opinion in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The diagnosis of schizophrenia is made on the basis of a history of at least two years’ decline in social performance associated with the advent of abnormal behaviour and bizarre beliefs that are typical of acute schizophrenia. The documents show that Ms Walicki experienced hallucinations of voices she took to be the voice of God for at least six months prior to her admission to Bankstown Hospital in October 2006. She was treated with a potent antipsychotic medication for the two weeks she spent in hospital, but had only minimal treatment in the form of tiny doses of chlorpromazine in the period between her discharge and her arrest. 
        
       
       
        
        The notes made by Ms Walicki’s treating psychiatrist Dr Lucire, on 3.7.07 indicate that she was acutely mentally ill at that time. The accounts of her behaviour around the time of her arrest and in the period immediately after her arrest confirm that she was acutely mentally ill when she stabbed her father and younger sister to death and seriously wounded her mother. 
        
       
       
        
        I believe Ms Walicki has the defence of mental illness open to her, as she was acutely mentally ill at the time of the stabbings. She was in the acute phase of the chronic mental illness, schizophrenia, which is recognised in law to be a disease of the mind. She had the defect of reason that the messages she was receiving were from God that led to the delusional belief that she and her family were in acute danger. At the time of the stabbings she was unable to reason with sense or composure about the consequences of her actions because of the gross disturbance of logical thinking and emotional regulation arising from her severe mental illness.” 
        
       
      
    36 Dr Bruce Westmore saw the accused on 1 February 2008 at the request of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. He tendered a provisional diagnosis of schizophrenic illness and an alternative of schizo-affective disorder. He stated that the course of her illness would eventually determine definitive diagnosis. His opinion was expressed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Walicki is a twenty six year old woman who appears to have developed her first acute psychotic episode in 2006. She had auditory perceptual disturbances, religious delusional beliefs and a severe behavioural disturbance characterised by ‘manic’ type symptoms. She was admitted to Banks House from 24 October until 15 October (sic -November) 2006. Diagnosed with schizophrenia she was treated with antipsychotic medication. 
        
       
       
        
        An attempt was made to place her on a community treatment order but that was apparently resisted by a private psychiatrist. Her treatment in the community continued with the assistance of a general practitioner and the private psychiatrist. Her father/?family may have resisted her being treated with medication because of her father’s beliefs in Scientology and the treating psychiatrist appears to have been of the view that her psychotic symptoms were the result of medication she had been prescribed. 
        
       
       
        
        Unfortunately, she appears to have been ineffectually treated or under treated and as a result her psychotic illness persisted. In the context of her psychosis she attacked family members, killing her father a younger sister. 
        
       
       
        
        In her history to me she stated that at the time of the homicides she was fearful in her mood, she had disturbances of her biological functions and she was hearing voices telling her that she should harm herself and that she had to die. When asked specifically did she remember what she was thinking at the time of the homicides she said, ‘I was thinking I was hearing voices say, kill your family and I was thinking, yeah, I have to do that’. Tragically she acted on those auditory perceptual disturbances and two family members died as a result. 
        
       
       
        
        Since being appropriately treated Ms Walicki’s mental illness has shown some positive response and is moving towards remission. 
        
       
       
        
        She is fit to be tried at this time and she would be able to raise the defence of mental illness in relation to the charges of murder she currently faces. She was suffering from a disease of the mind (an acute psychotic illness, probably schizophrenia) at the time the homicides occurred. She was acting on auditory hallucinations and probably delusional beliefs in relation to herself and the deceased. Her illness would have totally deprived her of the capacity to know that she ought not to do the act in relation to her father and younger sister. She was suffering from a defect of reasoning as a result of her mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        She requires continuing psychiatric care and most importantly, she needs to remain on medication under proper medical supervision.” 
        
       
      
    37 Both Dr Nielssen and Dr Westmore are well known forensic psychiatrists of high repute. 
     
      
    38 Given the evidence and these opinions, I am abundantly satisfied that it is established on the balance of probabilities that the accused was mentally ill at the time of the killings and the wounding, being afflicted by a defect of reason from a disease of the mind which prevented her from appreciating the nature and quality of her acts and that they were wrong. 
     
      
    39 I therefore find special verdicts of not guilty by reason of mental illness on each count of the indictment.  
     
      
    40 Pursuant to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, I order that Linda Jane Walicki be detained at the Bunya Unit, Cumberland Hospital and thereafter in accordance with the directions of the Mental Health Review Tribunal until released by due process of law. 
     
      
    41 I direct the Registrar of the Court to forward to the Mental Health Review Tribunal a copy of this judgment, a transcript of the proceedings and the trial evidence.

   JUDGMENT1. This is an appeal by Sung Goo Jun against a sentence imposed upon him by a magistrate at the Burwood Local Court on 17 April 2008. Mr Jun had pleaded guilty to driving whilst under the influence of alcohol. The specific offence was driving with a middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol. That was against s 9.3A of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. 2. The offence occurred on 27 March 2008. The learned magistrate at Burwood fined Mr Jun $950 and disqualified him for six months from driving, dating from the date of the offence 27 March 2008. I note that the standard automatic disqualification for this offence is twelve months. It may be reduced at the discretion of the sentencing judicial officer to six months but no less than that period. Mr Jun received the benefit of such a reduction.3. What happened in this case is set out in the facts sheets which is part of exhibit A. Mr Jun was pulled over for a random breath test after going through an amber light late. Police observed that he smelt strongly of alcohol, that his eyes were bloodshot, that his speech was slurred, that he was vague in his responses to questioning and that he was unsteady on his feet. Police formed the opinion that he was well affected by alcohol. This opinion was confirmed when his reading was ascertained. He had 0.125 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. That falls within the middle range of these offences. It is not lower than middle range which commences at .08 and is about halfway between the low and the high range. 4. Mr Seo who appears for Mr Jun asks me to exercise my discretion under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He relies upon 10(3)(a), referring to his client’s character. There is indeed documentary evidence from two people indicating that he is honest, reliable and an extremely capable businessman and dedicated family man. He has also attended eight sessions of a traffic offender intervention program. Mr Jun does not have a criminal record but has two entries on a traffic record report of exceeding speed and disobeying emergency stop sign. 5. I take into account Mr Seo’s submission that the entries on that report showing that warning letters were sent points to an error in this respect, the offences in respect of which the warning letters were sent - or at least the majority of them - were not committed by Mr Jun but by his employee. I also accept that Mr Jun has had his driver’s licence since 1999 and has an otherwise clear record here and in Western Australia. 6. However I am not satisfied that I ought to exercise my discretion under s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Such a decision should be exceptional. I am not satisfied that any of the factors referred to in s 10(3) has been made out to a sufficient degree to warrant such an order. I also take into account the seriousness of this offence. It was, as I said, a mid range PCA offence and the reading itself was in the middle of that range. Mr Jun was driving his car when his potential ability to control it was obviously affected. The findings or observations made by the police are consistent with, in my opinion, a reduced capacity to control adequately his car or to respond to any emergency which presented itself. Parliament has made it clear that offences of drink driving ought to be accompanied by punishment. In fact Mr Jun received the minimum period of disqualification. He benefited from the exercise of the discretion by the magistrate, the automatic period of disqualification is twelve months but he had that time halved. It has also been backdated to the time of the offence. 7. In my opinion the appeal ought not to succeed and I am going to dismiss the appeal. 8. The formal orders which I make are these. In accordance with s 20(2)(c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 I dismiss the appeal. Mr Jun I’m sorry, you have lost your case. It was a significant reading and what the police saw about your condition at that time was not a good thing. It is important that people don’t drink and drive and I regard the disqualification as appropriate.

   DECISION : 
   1. The Accused, Craig James Grant, is unfit to be tried for the offences of the murder of Jasmine Bell on 30 July 2007 and the attempted murder of Andrew O’Grady on 30 July 2007.2. In accordance with s.14 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, the Accused is to be referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal.3. Pursuant to s.14(b)(iii) of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, the Accused is remanded in custody pending the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s.16 of that Act.4. It is recommended that the attention of the Accused’s treating psychiatrist within Justice Health be drawn to the recommendation of Dr Olav Nielssen, supported by Dr Samson Roberts, that the Accused be referred to the psychiatric ward of Long Bay Hospital for a trial of Clozapine treatment.5. The reports of Dr Olav Nielssen concerning the Accused dated 27 November 2007, 22 January 2008 and 29 April 2008 and the report of Samson Roberts dated 16 June 2008 are to be placed in a sealed envelope addressed to the Treating Psychiatrist, Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre, Silverwater and that envelope accompany the Accused when he is returned to his former custody as a result of the orders made.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 28 July 2008, I conducted an inquiry under the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 as to whether the Accused, Craig James Grant, is unfit to be tried for the offences of murder and attempted murder. 
     
      
    2 The Accused has been arraigned in this Court upon an indictment alleging that, on 30 July 2007, at Fairfield he did murder Jasmine Bell and that on and at the same date and place he did attempt to wound with intent to murder Andrew O’Grady.  
     
      
    3 At the conclusion of the hearing on 28 July 2008, having considered the evidence and submissions of the parties, I announced my finding that the Accused was unfit to be tried and made consequential orders and an associated recommendation. This judgment contains my reasons for making those orders and the recommendation.  
     
      
       
      Evidence Adduced in the Inquiry 
       
      
    4 By consent, the Crown tendered a number of documents in the inquiry including the indictment, Crown case statement, statement of Mr O’Grady dated 30 July 2007, transcript of the ERISP interview with the Accused on 30 July 2007 together with reports of Dr Olav Nielssen dated 27 November 2007, 22 January 2008 and 29 April 2008 and a report of Dr Samson Roberts dated 16 June 2008. Dr Nielssen examined the Accused at the request of the Accused’s solicitor and Dr Roberts did so on behalf of the Crown. No oral evidence was adduced in the inquiry. 
     
      
    5 Both Dr Nielssen and Dr Roberts expressed the opinion that the Accused was unfit to be tried. Both the Crown and Mr Ierace SC, for the Accused, submitted that a finding that the Accused was unfit to be tried ought be made. It remains, of course, for the Court to determine, on the balance of probabilities, whether the Accused is unfit to be tried and, as part of that determination, to record the principles of law applied and the findings of fact on which the Court has relied: s.11(2) Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990.  
     
      
    6 In circumstances where the evidence points in one direction and both the Crown and the Accused submit that a finding of unfitness to be tried ought be made, my reasons for reaching such a conclusion may be stated relatively briefly.  
     
      
       
      Relevant Legal Principles 
       
      
    7 Section 12(3) Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 provides that the onus of proof of the question of a person's unfitness to be tried for an offence does not rest on any particular party to the proceedings in respect of the offence. The proceedings are by way of inquiry which is not to be conducted in an adversary manner: s12(2). 
     
      
    8 The sole question to be determined is whether I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the accused is unfit  to be tried for the alleged offences of murder and attempted murder: s.6.  
     
      
    9 This issue falls to be determined by application of the Presser test. That test emerges from the decision of Smith J in R v Presser (1958) VR 45 at 48. This is the test concerning fitness to be tried to be applied in an inquiry of this type: R v Rivkin (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at 294-295 [279]-[286]. 
     
      
    10 In Subramaniam v The Queen (2004) 211 ALR 1; [2004] HCA 51, Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ, in a joint judgment, summarised the Presser test in the following way at 5 [9] (footnote 2):  
     
      
       
        
        “In his reasons, Smith J suggested that before a trial could proceed without unfairness or injustice an accused should meet certain 'minimum standards'. Such minimum standards include the ability to understand the offence with which the accused has been charged, the nature of the proceedings, and the effect of any evidence given against the accused. Additionally, his Honour said that an accused should possess sufficient capacity to be able to decide whether he or she will rely upon a defence, and, if so, be in a position to communicate, either to the court or counsel, the facts necessary for the defence.” 
        
       
       
      It is the  
      Presser 
       test, summarised in that way, which I apply in this case.  
       
       
      The Crown Case Against the Accused 
       
      
    11 It is the Crown case that, in May 2007, the deceased, Jasmine Bell, and her partner, Andrew O’Grady, moved into a guesthouse in Harris Street, Fairfield. Also living in the guesthouse was the Accused. 
     
      
    12 At around 11.30 am on 30 July 2007, Mr O’Grady woke to a knock at the door of their room. He sat up and saw Ms Bell (who was pregnant) standing in the doorway and the Accused trying to push his way into the room. He heard the deceased say “Go away Andrew is asleep”. Mr O’Grady then said “What are you doing, get the fuck out” to which the Accused replied “What cunt?”. 
     
      
    13 The Accused then produced a knife and moved further inside the room. The knife was approximately 27 centimetres long with a single flat blade. The deceased saw the knife and screamed and tried to move backwards into the room. The Accused said to Mr O’Grady “Say sorry cunt”, to which he replied “Sorry”. The Accused then said “What are you sorry for, what are you sorry for?” and Mr O’Grady replied “I’m sorry for being rude”. At this stage, the Accused was holding the knife out towards both the deceased and Mr O’Grady. The deceased then tried to get around the Accused to get out of the room. As she did this, the Accused lunged forward and stabbed the deceased in the chest. The Accused then swung the knife towards Mr O’Grady who moved backwards to avoid being stabbed. The Accused again made a stabbing motion towards Mr O’Grady’s stomach. Mr O’Grady then grabbed the knife and both men struggled over the knife until the blade snapped off in Mr O’Grady’s hands. Mr O’Grady then chased the Accused outside the room with the knife blade. 
     
      
    14 Once outside, Mr O’Grady saw the deceased lying on the ground not far from the front door of their room. The Accused ran passed the deceased, out the front yard and jumped the gate running up Harris Street towards Fairfield Railway Station. Emergency assistance was sought for the deceased. However, the treatment was to no avail and she was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. The deceased died from a stab wound to the chest which pierced her lung and then entered the aorta and pulmonary artery. Mr O’Grady suffered five superficial cuts to his left hand. In addition, he suffered a superficial puncture wound to the left side of the upper chest.  
     
      
    15 At about 12.30 pm on 30 July 2007, the Accused presented himself to Fairfield Police Shop Front and was conveyed to Cabramatta Police Station where he participated in an ERISP in the presence of his uncle. It is fair to observe that the ERISP, which formed part of the evidence at the present inquiry, revealed a significant level of thought disorder in the Accused shortly after the offences.  
     
      
       
      The Medical Evidence Concerning the Accused 
       
      
    16 The Accused was born in 1979 and was 28 years of age at the time of the tragic events of 30 July 2007. 
     
      
    17 The Accused has a long history of admissions to psychiatric hospitals and a history of substance abuse.  
     
      
    18 Dr Nielssen examined the Accused for the first time on 28 September 2007. He observed that it was not possible to obtain a complete history from the Accused “as it soon became clear that he was still affected by a communication disorder arising from his severe chronic mental illness that had either failed to respond to the treatment he had received in gaol or was resistant to treatment with antipsychotic medication”.  
     
      
    19 Dr Nielssen observed that the Accused’s answers in the ERISP revealed disorganisation in a way that was consistent with the pattern of his communication on interview. There were elements of delusional and persecutory beliefs. Dr Nielssen diagnosed the Accused as suffering from chronic treatment resistant schizophrenia and substance abuse disorder (in remission). In his report of 27 November 2007, Dr Nielssen concluded (page 7): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Mr Grant’s communication was so disorganised at the time of the recent assessment that I believe he would be unable to follow any proceedings in a meaningful way or give reliable instructions. However, he has only recently resumed treatment with antipsychotic medication after a long period without medication and he may eventually respond to treatment to the extent that he will become fit for trial. I would be happy to review Mr Grant again after a period of consistent treatment and also to review any medical records of his treatment in the community and since his arrest."" 
        
       
      
    20 Dr Nielssen examined the Accused again on 7 December 2007 and provided a further report dated 22 January 2008. The Accused was receiving treatment with a relatively high dose of the antipsychotic medication, Olanzapine (Zyprexa) 30 mg per day. Dr Nielssen observed that the second interview confirmed his opinion that the Accused had a chronic schizophrenic illness which was “relatively treatment resistant in the sense that he has persisting delusional beliefs despite four months treatment with high doses of antipsychotic medication” (page 2). In his report of 22 January 2008, Dr Nielssen was of the view that the Accused was fit to be tried (pages 2-3): 
     
      
       
        
        “As of 7.12.07 Mr Grant was assessed to be fit to enter a plea and fit for trial. He was more coherent in his communication, demonstrated a reasonable understanding of the nature of the proceedings and was assessed to be able to follow the proceedings in a general sense and give reliable instructions to his legal representatives. In particular, he recognised that he had a mental illness, even if he was unable to recognise the symptoms of his illness, and did not object to his illness being raised in his defence. 
        
       
       
        
        He should remain fit for trial provided he continue to receive treatment with an adequate dose of antipsychotic medication in the period leading up to the trial.” 
        
       
      
    21 Dr Nielssen interviewed the Accused again on 17 April 2008, leading to his report of 29 April 2008.  
     
      
    22 Dr Nielssen recounted that his report of 22 January 2008 had concluded that the Accused was “on balance fit for trial, as he was able to give an account of the events that could be understood and it seemed clear that he intended to plead not guilty on the grounds of mental illness”. Dr Nielssen continued (page 1): 
     
      
       
        
        “Of concern at that time was that he was still affected by a fairly severe form of communication disorder that would affect his ability to give evidence on his own behalf and that he was also continuing to experience symptoms of mental illness despite three months treatment. However, he was assessed to be ‘fit enough’ to give his account of what happened to psychiatrists assessing him for court and to enter a plea.” 
        
       
      
    23 At interview on 17 April 2008, however, Dr Nielssen noted that it soon emerged that the Accused’s “mental state had not continued to improve despite consistent treatment with higher doses of medication and that he was affected by active symptoms of a chronic mental illness”. The Accused was taking the high dose of 40 mg of Olanzapine per day in combination with regular injections of long-acting antipsychotic medication. Dr Nielssen observed that the Accused had not taken the atypical antipsychotic medication, Clozapine, that is usually reserved for treatment-resistant patients, nor had the Accused discussed taking Clozapine with his treating doctor. 
     
      
    24 Dr Nielssen concluded (page 2): 
     
      
       
        
        “After the most recent interview I am now of the opinion that Mr Grant is unfit to plead and is unfit for trial. His mental state has not continued to improve and if anything is worse than it was at the time of the interview in November. He expressed fixed delusional beliefs about the victim and the events surrounding the offence and appeared to be distracted by active auditory hallucinations during the interview. He initially said that he was willing to enter a plea of not guilty due to mental illness, but was unable to say how he was mentally ill and later contradicted himself by saying that he wanted to plead guilty to get a fixed term.  
        
       
       
        
        Hence I now believe Mr Grant is unfit for trial, as his interpretation of events is likely to be affected by ongoing auditory hallucinations and fixed and evolving delusional beliefs, and he would be unable to give reliable instructions whilst affected by acute symptoms of treatment resistant schizophrenia. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Grant may become fit for trial within 12 months if he responds to treatment with the atypical antipsychotic medication clozapine. About thirty percent of treatment resistant patients have a significant response to clozapine treatment and Mr Grant should be referred to the psychiatric ward of Long Bay Hospital for a trial of this treatment.” 
        
       
      
    25 Dr Samson Roberts examined the Accused on behalf of the Crown at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre, Silverwater on 5 June 2008. Following a detailed account of the Accused’s psychiatric, substance-use and medical history and family and developmental history, Dr Roberts turned to an assessment of the Accused’s fitness to stand trial. Dr Roberts provided a diagnosis of schizophrenia (paranoid type), psychostimulant abuse (in sustained full remission) and cannabis abuse in a controlled environment. Dr Roberts concluded his report in the following way (pages 15-16): 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Grant is a 29 year old man who provides an unclear account of himself so affected by delusional content that it is not possible to determine with certainty which aspect of his account is reflective of reality. It is evident that Mr Grant has a history of psychiatric illness which has led to hospitalisations in the past. Based on his account, his treatment has been characterised by a need for involuntarily  
        [sic]  
        treatment both in hospital and in the community. His psychiatric condition has been compromised by non compliance with medication and illicit substance use. During his incarceration he has been under the care of psychiatric services.  
        
       
       
        
        Despite being in receipt of supervised psychiatric treatment, Mr Grant continues to exhibit symptoms of his illness. If his account of the pharmacological treatment prescribed to him is an accurate reflection of fact, his condition is being treated aggressively. Based on the contents of Dr Nielssen’s reports, it is apparent that despite a protracted period of supervised treatment, Mr Grant’s symptoms have not improved over time. 
        
       
       
        
        In considering Mr Grant’s fitness to stand trial, it is apparent that he has an understanding, albeit imperfect, of those issues outlined in  
        Presser 
        . The nature and severity of his illness however is such that delusional material continues to intrude upon his understanding of issues relating to the offences for which he is before the Court. Additionally, his conduct is demonstrated by the self-inflicted burn aimed at removing a tattoo, indicates that his psychiatric condition continues to impact upon his day to day life. It is therefore expected that his psychiatric illness will adversely impact upon his ability to follow Court proceedings and will intrude upon instructions given to his solicitor. Although he expresses a superficial understanding of the plea of Not Guilty by reason of mental illness and has expressed a desire to enter such a plea, he stated the perception that he will receive a fixed term of incarceration indicating limited understanding of the ramifications of such a plea. 
        
       
       
        
        In conclusion, it is my opinion that in the absence of improvement in Mr Grant’s mental state, he will remain unfit to enter a plea and unfit to stand trial.” 
        
       
      
    26 The Crown confirmed that documents produced on subpoena indicated that the Accused was receiving medication in dosages referred to in the medical reports. 
     
      
    27 Dr Roberts agreed with Dr Nielssen’s recommendation concerning a trial of Clozapine treatment (page 16): 
     
      
       
        
        “I concur with Dr Olav Nielssen’s opinion with respect to the recommendation that a trial of Clozapine be instituted. Given the lengthy period that Mr Grant has remained unwell despite consistent treatment, it is expected that in the absence of a response to Clozapine, he will remain unwell for the foreseeable future and therefore is expected to be unfit to stand trial for in excess of a further twelve months.” 
        
       
       
      Determination 
       
      
    28 The sole question to be determined is whether the Accused is presently unfit to be tried. 
     
      
    29 The Presser test sets out the minimum requirement for an Accused to stand trial. It is apparent that the Accused has a long history of mental illness. The reports of Dr Nielssen disclosed some improvement in the later months of 2007 before deterioration in the Accused’s mental state in April 2008, despite administration of strong antipsychotic medication. Examination by Dr Roberts in June 2008 revealed significant concerns about the Accused’s mental state despite ongoing treatment with antipsychotic medication.  
     
      
    30 Both Dr Nielssen and Dr Roberts have reached the same conclusion, by application of the Presser test, that the Accused is unfit to be tried.  
     
      
    31 Having regard to the evidence, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the Accused is unfit to be tried. It is apparent that the Accused’s ongoing auditory hallucinations and his fixed and evolving delusional beliefs intrude upon his understanding of the trial process and restrict his capacity to communicate effectively the facts necessary for his defence. 
     
      
    32 Having reached such a conclusion at this inquiry, the criminal proceedings against the Accused must not be continued, and I am required to refer the Accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal: s.14(a) Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. It will be for that Tribunal to determine, as soon as practicable, whether, on the balance of probabilities, the Accused will, during the period of 12 months after the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried for the offences: s.16(1) Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. Depending upon the Tribunal’s determination, s.17 or s.19 of the Act may have application to the Accused.  
     
      
    33 It is appropriate to make an order under s.14(b)(iii) of the Act remanding the Accused in custody until the determination of the Tribunal under s.16 has been given effect to. 
     
      
    34 I was asked by the Crown and Senior Counsel for the Accused to make the recommendation advanced by Dr Nielssen, and supported by Dr Roberts, concerning a trial of Clozapine treatment for the Accused. In the circumstances of the case, I am satisfied that such a recommendation is appropriate and I will make it, although it will be a matter for the Accused’s treating psychiatrist within Justice Health to determine what treatment is appropriate for the Accused. To permit a proper assessment of the recommendation of Dr Nielssen, supported by Dr Roberts, it is appropriate that the Accused’s treating psychiatrist be provided with a copy of the three reports of Dr Nielssen together with the report of Dr Roberts. 
     
      
    35 It was for these reasons that I made the following orders and recommendation at the conclusion of the hearing on 28 July 2008: 
     
      
       
      (a) I find that the Accused, Craig James Grant, is unfit to be tried for the offences of the murder of Jasmine Bell on 30 July 2007 and the attempted murder of Andrew O’Grady on 30 July 2007. 
       
       
      (b) In accordance with s.14 of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 
      , I refer the Accused to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. 
       
       
      (c) Pursuant to s.14(b)(iii) of that Act, I remand the Accused in custody pending the determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal under s.16 of that Act. 
       
       
      (d) I recommend that the attention of the Accused’s treating psychiatrist within Justice Health be drawn to the recommendation of Dr Olav Nielssen, supported by Dr Samson Roberts, that the Accused be referred to the psychiatric ward of Long Bay Hospital for a trial of Clozapine treatment. 
       
       
      (e) I direct that the reports of Dr Olav Nielssen concerning the Accused dated 27 November 2007, 22 January 2008 and 29 April 2008 and the report of Samson Roberts dated 16 June 2008 be placed in a sealed envelope addressed to the Treating Psychiatrist, Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre, Silverwater and that the envelope accompany the Accused when he is returned to his former custody as a result of the orders made today.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing David Houssein. Mr Houssein has pleaded guilty to two crimes. Both are against s 35 of the Crimes Act 1900. Each of them is a crime of malicious wounding. Each of them carries a maximum of seven years imprisonment. 2. The offences occurred on 24 June 2007 and Mr Houssein was committed for trial on 30 November 2007 from Burwood Local Court. He pleaded guilty on 26 May 2008, the day listed for his trial. 3. Briefly, this is what happened which resulted in Mr Houssein being charged. He was friends with the two victims, I think they were brothers were they--LEE: That’s correct your Honour.HIS HONOUR: --who were brothers. He visited them at their home on Sunday 24 June 2007. Some cannabis was purchased. The three men, the accused and two brothers then returned to Mr Houssein’s own unit in Liverpool Road, Croydon. Mr Houssein’s mother was present in the unit at the time. An argument developed over cannabis which was being shared amongst the men. 4. I accept the offender’s account that the argument involved some threatening behaviour towards his mother, including quite abusive language. Mr Houssein’s response to the disagreement and the threatening behaviour towards his mother was to obtain a knife. It had a twelve inch blade. One of the brothers was trying to protect the other brother from being attacked by Mr Houssein. I should add that Mr Houssein’s mother, Mrs Houssein, left the unit either just before or more likely just after the knife was produced. 5. Despite the efforts of one brother, Mr Houssein managed to stab the other brother in the right side of his abdomen. This was despite pleas to leave the men alone. The fighting continued. As the brothers were trying to leave the unit, Mr Houssein stabbed one of them again, the one he stabbed before. This time it was on the right elbow. Mr Houssein said to the men: 
     
      
      “ 
      Youse cunts aren’t leaving for sure. Stop, that’s it, stop. Youse are both dead, stop.” 
        
      
    It is noted in the agreed facts that that assertion was denied by the offender. 6. Mr Houssein then stabbed the other brother in the right bicep. Both brothers managed to unlock the door and get out of the unit. One of them however slipped on wet steps. Mr Houssein followed both men. He again stabbed the brother whom he had first stabbed. This time it was the inside of the right leg in the groin area. When that victim stood up Mr Houssein stabbed him yet again, this time in the left calf. 7. Both men then escaped. Both men needed ambulance and hospital treatment. One of the men received three stitches to his bicep and had abrasions on both hands. The other man, the first victim received lacerations to the right upper abdomen, left lower abdomen, left in the upper thigh, left calf, right thigh and right base of the scrotum. This caused rectal and urethral lacerations.8. Needless to say, the attacks were very serious. They were somewhat reduced in their seriousness by the element of provocation, but that element lasted a relatively short time and the seriousness of the assaults is not diminished very much. Mr Houssein was vicious and persistent in his successful attempts to use the knife to stab both men. His behaviour is appropriately described in the terms of the offence as malicious wounding.9. Mr Houssein has a criminal record. It notes that he is now thirty-seven. His criminal record reveals offences which are mostly for dishonesty. There is one common assault. He was sentenced to imprisonment for twelve months by a Local Court for one dishonesty offence but successfully appealed to this court. He spent over six months of his sentence in custody for that offence, but that was not because his appeal was successful and is not to be regarded as time spent under sentence. He was bail refused pending his appeal and as Mr Wetmore who appears for him says, it was in the nature of a remand. He was also sentenced to a month imprisonment by the Local Court at Wagga but that sentence was concurrent with the time spent in custody on remand.10. I have a pre-sentence report to which I will return. But first, I note exhibits tendered by Mr Wetmore. There is a report by a clinical psychologist, Terry Smith dated 9 July 2008. It notes his personality and background including the impact of the death of his father at a young age. He is not considered to be suffering from any mental illness or developmental disability at the time of his offending, but was considered to have a highly anxious character. At times his condition crossed the threshold into mental health deficit. The psychologist regarded the prognosis as positive. 11. I have reports from Dr Quinton Cameron, Mr Houssein’s general medical practitioner, who notes that he has been troubled with anxiety and depression for the ten years that he is being treated by Dr Cameron. Dr Cameron noted Mr Houssein’s major role in looking after his - Mr Houssein’s - mother. Dr Cameron said that he is his mother’s carer and does everything for her. The pharmacist confirms that.12. I heard evidence from witnesses on 25 July last. Mr Wetmore called his client who told me that he has been caring for his mother for some eight years. She has significant disabilities. He sees her three times a day and helps her with cleaning, washing, cooking and general rehabilitation.13. Mr Wetmore called Mr Houssein’s mother. She said she could manage at the weekend if he was sentenced to periodic detention. She said that she has other children: she has four children in all. One son lives at Canada Bay. Mrs Houssein lives not far from Canada Bay. Another son lives in Sydney but Mrs Houssein described him as a couple of hours away. And there is a daughter who lives in Drummoyne whom Mrs Houssein does not have contact with. She has two sisters who live in London.14. Mr Wetmore called the brother who lives in Canada Bay. He himself has a partner who has a significant disability, together with a six-year-old daughter. He would not be in a position to look after his mother.15. The main issues in this care are twofold. They both impact upon whether the sentence I impose on Mr Houssein should be fulltime custody or not. 16. The first is the question of the hardship which would be caused to his mother if he was to receive a fulltime sentence. I am not satisfied that the level of hardship which is required to a third party in order to have a favourable impact on a sentence has been demonstrated in this case. Whether one agrees with the policy reflected in the authorities or not, the authorities are clear that the level of hardship to persons related to an offender caused by an offender going into prison has to be very high before it can be taken into account as a mitigating factor. It almost has to be inhuman or merciless before it can be given any weight. As the courts have said, it is of course a usual unfortunate result of offending behaviour that it has a damaging impact upon members of the offender’s family. That will be so in this case. Because of the attack which he launched upon these two men, Mr Houssein has put himself at risk of a fulltime gaol sentence. That would be the result of his own behaviour. It will cause some significant inconvenience and hardship to his mother. However, I am not satisfied -as I said - that that level of hardship is such that I should not sentence him to fulltime imprisonment. There are other members of the family who maybe available in certain circumstances to assist Mrs Houssein. I did not hear any evidence about other persons who maybe in a position to assist so I assumed the only source would be the family.17. The second issue is whether I should impose a sentence of periodic detention. Mr Wetmore’s argument was that this was a suitable case for periodic detention. There were two difficulties with that submission. One is that it appeared arguable - because of the time which Mr Houssein spent in custody on the previous matter pending his appeal - that he may not be eligible as a result of s 65A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. That provides that an offender who has previously served imprisonment for more than six months by way of fulltime detention in relation to anyone sentence of imprisonment is not eligible. 18. However, Mr Wetmore argued, and Mr Lee who appears for the prosecution agreed, that the circumstances of Mr Houssein’s custody were, as I have mentioned earlier, in the nature of remand. Because his sentence was set aside by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the time which he spent in custody pending that appeal is probably to be seen as custody being the result of his refusal of bail. It is not the kind of custody to which in my opinion s 65A applies.19. Mr Wetmore’s second problem with a periodic detention order is more serious. Section 66 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that such an order may not be made unless I am satisfied amongst other things that the offender is a suitable person to serve the sentence by way of periodic detention. I need to be satisfied of certain other matters but that is obviously one significant one. Tendered in these proceedings was a pre-sentence report prepared by a Probation and Parole officer Mr Peter Hannagan dated 16 July 2008. Mr Hannagan expressed the opinion in that report, confirmed in evidence before me today that Mr Houssein is unsuitable for a periodic detention order. He listed three reasons in the report: the fact that Mr Houssein was the sole carer for his mother, his unresolved mental issues and drug issues. 20. I, too, regard Mr Houssein as unsuitable for a periodic detention order. I place some weight on Mr Hannagan’s assessment. He is a Probation and Parole officer whose experience would include an understanding of the operation of the periodic detention facility. His assessment of unsuitability, I give some weight to. In particular one of the issues, what Mr Hannagan described as unresolved drug issues, was of some significance. Mr Hannagan ascertained from a third party that Mr Houssein was still taking marijuana and spending about forty dollars a week at the time that he interviewed him, which was earlier this month. I regard, on that basis alone, Mr Hannagan’s assessment as soundly based. Accordingly, I am not satisfied that Mr Houssein is a suitable person in respect of whom I can make a periodic detention order. 21. This is a case where in my opinion I am satisfied, having considered the possible alternatives that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. That is mainly because of the serious nature of the crime. 22. I propose to sentence Mr Houssein to two sentences of twenty-two months imprisonment, each with a non-parole period of fifteen months. I had in mind originally a sentence of between two years and two and a half years, around twenty-seven months. I have allowed a discount of some fifteen per cent for Mr Houssein’s plea of guilty so that reduces the sentence for each of the two offences to twenty-two months.23. I am satisfied that special circumstances exist to warrant adjusting the ratio between the non-parole period and the parole period. Those special circumstances include the obvious need for Mr Houssein to be supported in resolution of his drug use.24. I propose to partially accumulate the sentences by one month. I propose to backdate one of the sentences by one month, to give a modest acknowledgement to Mr Wetmore’s argument that the time spent pending the appeal in the previous matter was - as he described - dead time because of the ultimate success of the appeal. However, I accept Mr Lee’s submission that the weight given to such a factor should be negligible. It is arguably, as he said, irrelevant. Would you stand up Mr Houssein?25. For maliciously wounding Skender Kurtesi, I set a non-parole period of one year and three months to date from 30 June 2008 and to expire on 29 September 2009. The balance of the term is seven months to commence on 30 September 2009 and to expire on 29 October 2010. I am satisfied that there are special circumstances to justify the balance of the term exceeding one-third of the non-parole period. That should be 29 April 2010, the expiry of the balance of the term.26. In respect of the malicious wounding of Nerduvan Kurtesi, I set a non-parole period for the sentence of one year and three months to commence today, 30 July 2008 and to expire on 29 October 2009. The balance of the term is to be seven months commencing on 30 October 2009 and to expire on 29 May 2010. 27. I make an order under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act directing your release on parole on 29 October 2009.Have a seat Mr Houssein. Now Mr Wetmore and Mr Lee, are there any other formal orders I need make? I think probably fixing conditions of parole I need to do, but are there any other formal orders I need to attend to?WETMORE: I don’t think so your Honour.LEE: No your Honour.28. The following are the conditions of your parole: that you be of good behaviour, that you subject yourself to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and accept any of their reasonable recommendations or directions. Now Mr Houssein, if you’d stand up. I need to explain the sentence to you.29. For each of the knifing offences, I have given you twenty-two months imprisonment. One of them I have backdated by a month, the other one starts today. So your sentence for the first one commenced a month ago, 30 June 2008 and that twenty-two months will expire on 29 April 2010. The other twenty-two months starts today and therefore finishes on 29 May 2010. For each of those you have a non-parole period that you must spend in gaol of fifteen months. One of them started a month ago, the other one starts today, 30 July 08 and finishes in fifteen months’ time, 29 October 2009. OFFENDER: May I ask a question sir?HIS HONOUR: Yes.OFFENDER: On 20 October 2009, do I have to go for a parole or is it automatic parole?HIS HONOUR: It’s automatic.OFFENDER: Thank you sir.HIS HONOUR: All right. So it is 29 October 2009--OFFENDER: Yes.HIS HONOUR: --and you will be released upon that day because I have ordered it, you don’t have to go to the Parole Board. But I have fixed conditions of your parole that you’ve got to be of good behaviour, you understand what that means, you’ve had a bond before and I put you under the supervision of the Probation Service. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes sir.HIS HONOUR: All right. Anything else gentlemen?LEE: No your Honour.WETMORE: Not from me, thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Thank you for your help. Do you want a moment with your client at all?OFFENDER: Let me please explain ..(not transcribable).. HIS HONOUR: Pardon?OFFENDER: ..(not transcribable).. HIS HONOUR: Is your mother in court Mr Houssein?OFFENDER: Yeah, she’s just there sir.WETMORE: His brother is here too.HIS HONOUR: In the front, all right. Stay in court but you may see your mother and your brother, but I want you to stay in the courtroom before you go.OFFENDER: Yeah sure I’ll go and hug her--HIS HONOUR: Just go down and see them. Stay in the courtroom.LEE: May I be excused your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes thanks for your help Mr Lee. You are excused thanks Mr Wetmore.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing two young men for crimes under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Each of them has pleaded guilty to knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug, namely MDMA, commonly referred to as Ecstasy. Each of them, as I said, has pleaded guilty and I convict each of them of that offence, the offences against s 25 (1) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The offence carries a maximum of fifteen years imprisonment. 2. One young man, Matthew John Corby, pleaded guilty on 20 March 2008 at his arraignment before the Parramatta District Court. His offence was committed on 1 February 2007 and he was arrested two weeks later on 15 February. 3. The other offender, Mr Grant Durrington, pleaded guilty on 4 February 2008 at committal at Parramatta Local Court. He committed his offence on 11 January 2007 and was arrested at the same time as Mr Corby on 15 February 2007. 4. It is, firstly, important to note the circumstances of each offence. They were both very similar and they need only be referred to in short detail. 5. Mr Corby’s crime was committed on 1 February 2007. It was committed with a man named Daniel Chippendore. Mr Corby drove Mr Chippendore to a car park. Mr Corby was informed on the way that Mr Chippendore wanted to go to the car park in order to supply Ecstasy tablets by a previous arrangement. Those tablets were not in Mr Chippendore’s possession. He obtained them once he got to the car park from somebody else. Once they got to the car park, Mr Corby remained in the car ready to assist and at some point afterwards drove Mr Chippendore back home. 6. The circumstances of Mr Durrington’s offence were very similar. As I said, he committed his offence on 11 January 2007. Once again Mr Chippendore was involved as well as a young person named “C”. Mr Durrington owned a car. He picked up the young person and later picked up Mr Chippendore, then drove them to the same car park. The car park was opposite a particular tavern where Mr Chippendore was, it seems, actively supplying Ecstasy tablets. Once again, on the way to the car park Mr Durrington knew that the young person and Chippendore were going to sell Ecstasy tablets in the tavern. After the supply occurred the young men left and were then arrested by the police. Mr Durrington admitted that he had a fair idea that Mr Chippendore was going to sell drugs. In fact, he admitted that he knew that he was going to deal in drugs. 7. Mr Corby turned twenty this year, having been born on 15 March 1988. He has no record of any criminal convictions. Mr Durrington is also twenty years old, having been born on 5 May 1988 and also has no criminal convictions. 8. There is some personal material about each of them. Both of them have been interviewed by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service and pre-sentence reports have been prepared. 9. Mr Corby is recorded as having accepted responsibility for his part in the offence and showed regret. However, the probation officer noted that he seemed to lack any real insight into general community expectations in relation to such illegal activity. The probation officer thought it unlikely that he would require or benefit from supervision by the Service because there were no factors related to the offence which could be addressed.10. Mr Durrington was said to be a naive young man who may have been unable to recognise the manipulation of his co-offenders. He has ceased all his previous associations with those people. He comes from a strong and supportive family network as well as a supportive relationship with his partner. The Service thought he would be suitable for a low level of intervention by way of supervision. 11. A report has been tendered in respect of Mr Corby by a psychologist, Steve Henkelman, dated 10 July 2008. It diagnosed a post-traumatic stress disorder arising from a particular event in the past and also expressed the opinion that his symptoms were consistent with depression. It noted his supportive relationships with his family and his partner.12. Mr Strickland S.C., who appears for Mr Durrington, submits that the appropriate sentence for his client is a bond under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. He says that the offences are at the low end of the scale, in fact, at the bottom end; that there was no financial gain; and that there were a number of mitigating factors attending the offence and no aggravating factors. The mitigating factors included no significant harm, no planning, no criminal antecedents, good character, an unlikelihood of re-offending, rehabilitation, remorse, and an early plea. 13. Mr Strickland says the personal circumstances of his client have changed since the offence on 11 January 2007. He now has a good relationship with a steady girlfriend and is taking no drugs at all and has no association with those with whom he was committing the offence. He is about to obtain a trade certificate and has good character references. He says that a s 9 bond is appropriate because two offenders who were involved in similar activity, a Mr Fox and a Mr John, also received a good behaviour bond. One important distinction between this case and those cases, which needs to be observed, is that both those offenders were charged with concealing a serious indictable offence. That is not so serious an offence as the offence that these two are charged with. Mr Strickland argued that the factual circumstances were not dissimilar and there is some force in that argument. 14. Mr Mazurkiewicz, who appeared for Mr Corby, adopted Mr Strickland’s submissions so far as the mitigating features were concerned and the absence of aggravating features. He drew my attention to the statistics and made the same submission so far as the cases of Fox and John were concerned. He pointed to the fact that his client’s grandparents were present in court and supportive.15. Miss Swift, who appears for the Prosecution, noted the pleas of guilty but also noted that they had committed a serious offence. Each one involved some fifty tablets. However, she acknowledged that there was no suggestion that either had actual possession of the drugs. Their role was to assist. Nor she said was there any evidence that either of them had been involved in substantial trafficking or trafficking to any degree which would have attracted the principles applied by this court following the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Clark. She also acknowledged, fairly, that the objective seriousness of each offence was very low. She acknowledged that Mr Fox was in a very similar position and the circumstances were almost the same. Very fairly, she acknowledged that the appropriate way of determining this case was somewhere between a s 9 bond and a s 12 bond.16. I have determined to accept the submissions of Mr Strickland and Mr Mazurkiewicz and I regard the appropriate sentences in these cases as bonds under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I do so with some hesitation because I do regard the offences as serious. They are each breaches of the law of this State which carry a maximum of fifteen years imprisonment. Both young men were knowingly involved in the supply of a drug which, in inexperienced hands, could be regarded as very dangerous.17. Mr Corby, if you would stand up. Mr Corby, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment, I make an order directing you to enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of three years. The good behaviour bond is subject to these conditions:1. That you must remain of good behaviour;2. That you must appear before the court if called upon to do so;3. That you must notify the court of any change of your residential address. 
     
      
      Thank you, you can sit down. 
      
    18. Mr Durrington, instead of imposing a sentence of imprisonment upon you, I make an order directing you to enter into a good behaviour bond for three years. The term of your bond is subject to these conditions: 1. That you must appear before the court if called upon to do so; 
     
      2. That you must, during the term of the bond, be of good behaviour; 
     3. That you must notify the court of any change of your residential address; and, in your case, 4. That you subject yourself to the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and accept their reasonable directions and recommendations so far as the issues of alcohol use and peer interactions and associates are concerned. You can have a seat. I will explain those sentences in a moment.Mr Brown, first, are there any other orders or formalities that I need to attend to before explaining?BROWN: No, your Honour, except that they’re s 9 bonds, I take it.HIS HONOUR: They are. Mr Mazurkiewicz?MR MAZURKIEWICZ: No.HIS HONOUR: And Mr Blunt?BLUNT: No, your Honour.19. Gentlemen, Mr Durrington and Mr Corby, you have both been involved in very serious offending. Because of the legal representation which you have had, I have listened to both their arguments and I have accepted them. The prosecution, also, presented good arguments and was very fair in what they had to say. A lot of young men go to gaol for offences of the kind which both of you have committed. You have got yourself involved in some very, very serious criminal behaviour. Each of you now has a criminal record to demonstrate that. However, I have decided not to send you to gaol. I have given you each a bond to be of good behaviour for three years. That means that you have got to stay out of trouble for three years, no drink driving, no brawling, no drug activity, no possession of drugs. If you do, you come back before me and I can re-think the sentence and perhaps impose a sentence which is more serious. 
    20. Mr Durrington, you have the supervision component because that was recommended by the Probation and Parole Officer. It was not recommended for Mr Corby so that is why your order is slightly different, but both of you must understand that if you misbehave yourselves then you will be back before me and I can re-think the sentence and impose a more serious offence (as said) which can involve things like community service, weekend gaol, or full-time gaol. Do you both understand? Now, stay out of trouble and good luck. 
    BLUNT: Your Honour, there is one final matter in the matter of Durrington. There was folder tendered which had a--HIS HONOUR: A what?BLUNT: A folder tendered, might that be returned?HIS HONOUR: Yes, which I think was exhibit B. I had taken that into account and looked through the papers.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      1. Mr Peter Johnson has appealed against his sentence. He was convicted of dangerous driving, that is an offence against s 42 of the  
      Road Transport (Safety and Management) Act 1999 
      . The maximum sentence-- 
       
      It says here Mr Kiru five years. 
       
       
      KIRU: Automatic disqualification is five years your Honour. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Five years. 
       
       
      KIRU: Automatic, say if there is no conviction, there’s no disqualification imposed by the magistrate your Honour then automatically five years. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Her Honour said three years, but it is five. 
       
       
      KIRU: Five. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: She reduced it to two. 
       
       
      KIRU: The five years is automatic your Honour. If the condition if there is no disqualification imposed by the magistrate. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
       
       
      KIRU: But the minimum is two years. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I understand the maximum, I understand the minimum, so she reduced it from five down to two, 
       
       
      KIRU: She has given the minimum two years, that’s the minimum she could impose. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I see. All right thank you. 
       
       
      2. The offence was committed on 23 February 2008 at Prospect. Mr Johnson was riding his motorbike weaving in and out of traffic on the M4 Motorway at Prospect. He was recorded at driving 167 kilometres an hour. Police estimate that he went more than that, up to 210 kilometres an hour. Even if it was 167 kilometres an hour I find that that was sufficient for the conviction of driving in a manner dangerous or speed dangerous. Mr Johnson was observed to have overtaken about 30 other cars with his motorbike. The opinion was expressed in the police facts that the speed caused significant danger to other motorists. 
       
       
      3. Mr Johnson has a criminal record which includes previous convictions for driving whilst disqualified. At the time that he was riding his motorbike on this occasion he was disqualified. His criminal record does not allow me to extend any leniency to him. 
       
       
      4. The circumstances in which the offence occurred do attract some mitigation. He was going to visit the grave of his daughter who had died a year before from a cot death. He was upset and feeling depressed at the time. He has managed to turn his life around from a decade of crime and drug use and this is very commendable. He and his wife are in difficult personal financial circumstances. He needs his licence and he is presently on workers’ compensation having suffered a back injury. He otherwise had a successful business in scaffolding. 
       
       
      5. As I said, the maximum disqualification or the automatic disqualification for this offence is five years, the minimum is two years. The learned magistrate, although the correctness of her decision is not in issue before me, reduced the disqualification from five years to two years from 29 April 2009. Her Honour clearly took into account Mr Johnson’s personal circumstances. She fined Mr Johnson $1,200 and ordered court costs of seventy dollars. 
       
       
      6. The only way that I can not impose a disqualification is by making an order under s 10 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999. There is no appropriate basis for such an order. I regard this offence as serious, although not at the top of the range. Nevertheless Mr Johnson’s record does not, as I said, allow him any leniency. I regard a period of disqualification of two years as quite lenient given his record and given the riding that he was undertaking. As I said there is no alternative way of avoiding that minimum period of disqualification which is an appropriate, that is appropriate alternative way.  
       
       
      7. Because of his own personal financial circumstances I propose to reduce the fine from $1,200 to $500. Accordingly I propose to partly allow the appeal. The orders which I make in this matter under s 20(2) of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       2001 are these. I set aside the sentence of the learned magistrate. Instead of that sentence I order that Mr Johnson be disqualified from holding a driver’s licence from 29 April 2008 the minimum period of two years. I Impose a fine of $500 and I waive the requirement to pay the court costs. I confirm the bond imposed under s 9 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      for twelve months, that bond to be of good behaviour. 
       
       
      8. Anything else Mr Kiru? 
       
       
      KIRU: I note your Honour the appellant has already entered into a s 9 bond on 26 April this year so there’s no need for-- 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: No need to re-enter it. Mr Johnson you have lost your appeal on your main point, the disqualification stays at two years for the reasons that I gave. It has to in my opinion because of your conduct on the road, but you have the minimum. I had not realised the automatic is not three years which I was saying to you, but five years. You could have been, as I said, facing a jury for a death or you could have been off the road for five years. The court has in fact been extremely lenient to give you the minimum particularly with your driving record, you have done very well. Not only that, I have reduced the fine more than half because of your personal circumstances and you do not have to pay court costs. You have a bond which means you have to stay out of trouble for twelve months or you will come back here, do you understand? Now you want to say something? 
       
       
      APPELLANT: Yes your Honour, please. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Go ahead. 
       
       
      APPELLANT: There was two things. When I spoke to you on our previous occasion I mentioned to you that when the officer pulled me over and took my licence he said that I’d lost my licence on the spot, that was in February and you said that you would be prepared to backdate me from February. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: What was the date of the offence? 
       
       
      APPELLANT: 23 February I believe. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: You want me to backdate it. Do you want to be heard on that Mr Kiru? 
       
       
      KIRU: The licence has been taken your Honour, there is room for your Honour to take into account the licence-- 
       
       
       
      9. I review my order which I have just made and I backdate the period of disqualification to be for two years from 23 February 2008 and to expire on 22 February 2010. 
       
       
      Yes, what was the second thing? 
       
       
      APPELLANT: It fell out of my head your Honour, I’m sorry. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: All right. Stay out of trouble, continue with the good efforts that you have been making up to now. 
       
       
      APPELLANT: Thank you. 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: I will return the file.

   1. HIS HONOUR: The appellant, Joseph Rosenburg, a convicted child sex offender, appeals against two convictions, one for entering enclosed lands without lawful excuse that being xxx Trafalgar Street, Annandale between 3.15pm and 6.54pm on 19 May and on the same day loitering in or near a public place frequented by children and at which children were present at the time of loitering.2. The evidence against him comes from a number of different sources. Two young girls, one aged nine and the other I think aged 10, told police on that day they were out the front of the premises concerned.3. On the other side of the street was a man looking in their direction, who then walked across to their side of the road, had a look at furniture and asked questions about the TV and furniture. The two girls went inside. A little later on they went back outside and he was still there. They walked down an alleyway but were unable to lock the gate because the bolt was too high for them. 4. About 6 to 7 pm that evening both of them were playing in the room of the young girl who lived in the premises; they went to the window as part of the game they were playing and saw the same man. He offered to give them $50 for a bike and said he would leave money under a mesh screen and then sought to engage in another conversation about boys and wanted to give them his telephone number.5. It would then appear that two people were passing by and he then said: “I will wait here while they pass by, do not tell anyone, keep this between us.” They then told the parents of the girl whose premises this was occurring in. Each girl signed a statement on that day, each of them was asked to look at a group of photographs and see if they could identify anybody on it. Neither of them identified the appellant. If there were nothing more, then clearly there could be no conviction of the appellant for either of the alleged offences. There is evidence from the owner of the house, or one of the owners, that he gave no permission to the appellant to be present in the premises, if he was in the premises, nor to touch any part of his house, if he did.6. There was evidence that establishes that the appellant was convicted of child sex offences in 1994 and given sentences that rendered him liable or eligible for parole on 16 June 1997. There was evidence that the premises concerned had a fence around it and thus were, within the terms of the law, enclosed premises.7. A fingerprint expert retained by the Police Service attended the premises; a relevantly qualified fingerprint expert and scientist attended the premises on Sunday 20 May 2007. He conducted a fingerprint examination and developed a palm print on the exterior of the side bedroom brick windowsill. That side bedroom brick windowsill was the windowsill of the window through which the two girls looked. That palm print was examined by other expert fingerprint officers who determined that it was the palm print of the appellant. 8. On 27 July police interviewed the appellant at the Balmain Police Station. He denied allegations that he had been talking to either of the girls, he denied that he had placed his hand on a window. He claimed to have a routine and said that because of this routine he could not have committed this offence.9. He claimed that he could not remember precisely what he was doing two months before on a particular day and a particular time, but that he stuck to a regular daily routine. He claimed to be a cleaner, he claimed to be cleaning in Kings Cross but he was not prepared to say where he was cleaning. He claimed to have lived in Surry Hills. 10. When the specific allegations of the two girls were put to him, he said he did not want to say anything about it.11. When the allegation was put that the person concerned had offered the two girls $50 he claimed not to usually have $50 to give anyone anyway. He claimed to have a vague understanding where Annandale was and thought it was along Parramatta Road, he knew someone who lived there but was not prepared to say who they were, but he believed that this person or persons lived near Norton Street and claimed that was the only street which he knew.12. He claimed that he had not gone to Annandale. He thought roughly he might have had an accident a couple of years ago, that would be the only time he could recall his going through Annandale on Parramatta Road. It is perhaps pertinent to observe that Norton Street Leichhardt is in Leichhardt, not Annandale and is some distance from Trafalgar Street Annandale. He claimed not to know where Trafalgar Street was and that he had not been to Annandale for at least 6 to 12 months. As far as Leichhardt and Annandale he did not know the difference between them. 13. When asked the questions again about approaching these girls and going to the window, he said it was not him. He then talked about his routine at Kings Cross, he claimed not to have gone to any house in the area, not to have worked in any house in the area, not to have mowed any lawns, not to have done anything. It was then put to him that his fingerprints were on the windowsill and was asked to explain how they could be there and his explanation was, that he did not have an explanation. 14. When the case went to Court he made a point of telling the Magistrate that he had severe scaring on his face at the time because of skin cancer, there was some evidence that he did suffer from skin cancer and may have had a scar on his face. He also gave evidence, he pointed out that he had tattoos on his arm, he pointed this out to me today, indeed today he is wearing a shirt with very short sleeves and there appear to be tattoos underneath the sleeve that are visible down about the elbow. He described to the learned Magistrate the tattoos and how far they extended and it would seem to me he even took off his jacket and put it on again. 15. He claimed to be a cleaner at the Moulin Rouge Night Club in Darlinghurst Road, Kings Cross to have been there all day long cleaning the premises and that he would have left the premises only about 6 o’clock at night. He said he set up tables, picked up laundry, part of his duties involved picking up laundry. The first thing in the morning was to pick up some laundry and The Crest Hotel or drop off laundry at The Crest Hotel and first thing in the afternoon to pick it up. There were two receipts that were tendered before the learned Magistrate. One showing that on 19 May at 2.54 in the afternoon laundry was paid for, another showing at 7.53 in the morning, the laundry was paid for and both paid for at The Crest Hotel Kings Cross. 16. When taken to what he had said to the police, by his own lawyer, he claimed to know two people in Annandale, one was his sister and the other was a supplier of marijuana. He claimed to have been smoking marijuana in May of 2007. He had been living at xx xxxx Street, Surry Hills and he claimed that he would normally walk to his marijuana supplier in Annandale. This, of course, was somewhat contradictory of his claim given to the police in the interview that he had not been to Annandale in the last two years or at least the last six months and he just passed through going along Parramatta Road.17. He then claimed that on a particular weekday he decided to walk his mother’s disobedient dog, the dog ran off, he ran after the dog to retrieve him, ran into the side of a house, noticed a mobile phone on the windowsill, picked it up out of curiosity, looked at it, thought it was an old Nokia and put it back. He claimed that he assumed this was Annandale and it sounded somewhere near where it was. He claimed he had not told the police at the time because under pressure it had just slipped his mind; after all they were asking about two girls, he has never spoken to two girls. At the time he was on bail and he was placed under arrest as a result of these matters.18. In submissions today he pointed to all these factors, spoke at some length and said that it was not possible for me to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of his guilt. I am unable to agree with that proposition. The fact that his palm print was on the windowsill, in my opinion cannot be explained by his claim that he picked up a mobile phone from some premises, the windowsill of some premises at some point and looked at them. His explanation that he would be walking a dog and it would go off the leash and the dog just happened to run into a house, it just happened to have a windowsill which just happened to have a mobile phone it does not ring true.19. The answers he gave to the police in my opinion were quite evasive. He is a man who gives a very strong impression of having being used to appearing in Courts and facing charges on other occasions, of course as part of the proof of this, these offences it was necessary for the Prosecution to prove he had been convicted of child sex offences and it may be that it was his involvement with those offences. However, in the course of submissions he referred at great length to his cell mates in recent times and various gaols and their organisation. His story does not ring true, he has got no explanation in my opinion for the palm print being found on the windowsill. The fact that his palm print being found on the windowsill establishes in my opinion that he was at that place at that windowsill, the two girls saw a man in that place and conducted a conversation with him as I have said.20. They clearly got wrong their identification of him by a photograph but his fingerprint identified him better than any photograph could ever have done. I am satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to convict him beyond a reasonable doubt. 21. I dismiss the appeal. I confirm the conviction and the sentence of three months imprisonment to commence on the 27 July 2007 imposed by the learned Magistrate in relation to the second offence. The sentence has already been served. I confirm the fine of $250 and $70 court costs for the first offence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with James J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: Elizabeth Ord applied for leave to appeal against sentences imposed on her in the District Court on 26 October 2007 by her Honour Judge Murrell for three offences under s 29B (since repealed) of the Crimes Act 1914 Commonwealth of imposing upon the Commonwealth by an untrue representation with a view to obtaining money and six offences under s 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code Commonwealth of dishonestly causing a loss to the Commonwealth. The applicant had pleaded guilty to all of the offences. Broadly stated, the offences were for receiving social security benefits, being family tax payments or benefits or parenting payments single or partnered, on the untrue basis that she was the carer or shared in the care of twin girls born to her on 17 April 2000. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge imposed for four of the offences sentences of full-time imprisonment of either 12 months or 18 months, all commencing on 26 October 2007, in respect of which her Honour made a recognizance release order that the applicant be released after serving 10 months and two weeks, that is on 8 September 2008. Her Honour imposed fixed terms of imprisonment of three months or six months for the other offences, all commencing on the same date 26 October 2007. 
     
      
    4 Under s 29B of the Crimes Act the maximum penalty was imprisonment for two years and under s 135.1(5) of the Criminal Code the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years.  
     
      
       
      Chronology 
       
      
    5 It is convenient to set out a chronology of some of the relevant facts.  
     
      
    6 The applicant was born in October 1978. In 1996 she gave birth to a son Jacob. In 1998 she entered into a relationship with a man Hayden Scott, who was not Jacob’s father. In 1999 Scott seriously assaulted Jacob and Jacob was removed from the applicant’s care by the Department of Childcare Services.  
     
      
    7 On 17 April 2000 the applicant gave birth in a hospital to twin daughters, of whom Scott was the father. The applicant remained in hospital until early May 2000. While she was in hospital, the applicant completed application forms for social security benefits on the basis that she would be the carer of her twin daughters. However, on 1 May 2000, before she was discharged from the hospital, her twin daughters were removed from her care by the Department of Childcare Services and placed in the care of their grandparents, on the grounds that the applicant’s partner Scott had seriously assaulted her son Jacob and that both she and Scott were addicted to illicit drugs. The twins have remained in the care of their grandparents. 
     
      
    8 Over a period of more than four years between May 2000 and July 2004 the applicant received family tax payments or benefits and parenting payments, on the basis, which was false, that she was the carer or shared in the care of her twin daughters. The total amount received was about $75,000 of which about $5,000 was subsequently repaid, leaving a net sum of just under $70,000.  
     
      
    9 The applicant’s offending conduct was discovered on 9 August 2004 and no further payments were made to her.  
     
      
    10 In 2004 the applicant’s partner Scott was sentenced to a term of imprisonment and the relationship between Scott and the applicant ended.  
     
      
    11 The applicant formed a relationship with a man named Jason Button and a child James was born to them on 27 August 2005.  
     
      
    12 In January 2007 court attendances notices were issued against the applicant on behalf of the Commonwealth. On 7 August 2007 the applicant entered pleas of guilty to the charges. As already noted, the applicant was sentenced on 26 October 2007. 
     
      
    13 Affidavits deposing to facts subsequent to the sentencing of the applicant were admitted on the hearing of this application but only on the basis that they could be used if this Court were to re-sentence the applicant.  
     
      
       
      Remarks on Sentence  
       
      
    14 In her remarks on sentence her Honour found that the offences were objectively “quite serious”, having regard to the amount of money received and the period over which the offending conduct had occurred. Her Honour found, in favour of the applicant, that the original claim had been made while the applicant was still in the hospital and would have expected that the twins would remain in her care. However, over the next few years the applicant had signed a number of forms in which she asserted that the twins resided with her and were dependant on her. Her Honour noted that the applicant’s explanation for her conduct was that, for most of the period of her offending, she had been living with Scott who was overbearing and demanding and both she and Scott required money to support their drug habits. 
     
      
    15 Her Honour observed that general deterrence is a very important consideration in sentencing for offences of social security fraud, because such offences are difficult to detect and it is important that perpetrators of such offences should be aware that, if discovered, they will most likely receive full-time custodial sentences. Her Honour said that, unless there are very special circumstances, a full-time custodial sentence should be imposed for social security fraud. On the hearing of this application counsel for the applicant accepted that this was a correct statement of sentencing principle. 
     
      
    16 Her Honour then proceeded in her remarks on sentence to make a number of findings about some of the matters she was obliged to have regard to under s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act. Her Honour found that the applicant had entered pleas of guilty which had facilitated the course of justice, the applicant was remorseful and there were reasonable prospects that the applicant would not re-offend.  
     
      
    17 The applicant had a criminal history, some of the offences having been committed while she was on some form of conditional liberty. However, her Honour found that the applicant’s criminal offending had been associated with her use of drugs and her relationship with Scott. The applicant had been a user of cannabis from an early age but Scott had introduced her to amphetamine and heroin. Scott had physically and mentally abused the applicant during their relationship.  
     
      
    18 Her Honour found that, after her relationship with Scott had ended, the applicant’s use of drugs had dramatically diminished, and by the time of being sentenced the applicant was drug-free, except that she occasionally used cannabis.  
     
      
    19 Her Honour then referred to the applicant’s son James and to the delay which had occurred in the bringing of criminal proceedings against the applicant. I will refer to these parts of her Honour’s remarks in some detail in dealing with the grounds of appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    20 The grounds of appeal against sentence which were pressed at the hearing by counsel for the applicant were:- 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 — The learned trial judge erred in not giving sufficient weight to the combination of factors identified in s 16A(2) (m), (n), (p) Crimes Act 1914. 
       
       
      Ground 2 — The learned sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the role played by Hayden Scott in considering the offences committed by the applicant.  
       
       
      Ground 3 — The effect of delay. 
       
       
      Ground 4 — The learned trial judge erred imposing a sentence which in the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    21 A further ground of appeal in the grounds of appeal which had been filed was not pressed at the hearing.  
     
      
    22 At the hearing of the application counsel for the applicant informed the Court that the head sentences set by her Honour were not challenged. The applicant’s contention was that the date on which the recognizances release order would take effect should be brought forward.  
     
      
    23 I will now deal in turn with the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 — The learned trial judge erred in not giving sufficient weight to the combination of factors identified in s 16A(2) (m), (n), (p) Crimes Act 1914. 
       
      
    24 Although the ground of appeal refers to all of pars (m), (n) and (p) of s 16A(2) of the Crimes Act, the only paragraph which was really pressed was par (p).  
     
      
    25 Paragraph (p) provides that a sentencing court must take into account “the probable effect that any sentence…under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants”. 
     
      
    26 I have already referred to the applicant’s infant son James born 27 August 2005, who was just over 2 years old at the time the applicant was sentenced. The sentencing judge found that the applicant was James’ primary care giver and that James was at an age when he needed a great deal of attention from his primary care giver. The applicant had been living with a sister of her partner, that is an aunt of the child. If the applicant was sentenced to full time custody, this aunt would become the child’s primary carer. She would be assisted by the child’s father and another aunt.  
     
      
    27 There was admitted into evidence in the proceedings on sentence a pamphlet prepared by the Department of Corrective Services headed “Mothers and Children Programme”.  
     
      
    28 At par 33 of her remarks on sentence her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is material before the Court as to the Department of Corrective Services’ Mothers and Children’s Programme. Quite likely it is that the programme would be suitable for the offender and young James. Given his age, he would qualify, and he would be at an age when he could spend time in prison without that experience scarring him for life. However, if the offender does apply for the Mothers and Children’s Programme, there will be an initial three months separation from her son. Because there are other requirements for entry to the programme there is no guarantee that, even after three months, the offender will be united with James. However, I am satisfied on the material before me that there is a good likelihood that if the offender wants to go down that path, she will be reunited with James in a custodial environment after about three months.” 
        
       
      
    29 In par 34 of her remarks on sentence her Honour said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “These circumstances do not amount to “exceptional circumstances” in term of the effect which the offender’s incarceration will have on her family. Luckily for James, there is community support, which means that, although he will be very distressed by the three months separation from his mother, his level of distress will be no more than any other child of his age who is close to his mother would experience. While I give some weight to the factor of the offender’s separation from James, both from her point of view and from his point of view, to my mind the situation is not so exceptional as would, for example, suggest that the offender should be given less than a full-time custodial sentence where that sentence was otherwise warranted. In my view it is warranted.” 
        
       
      
    30 In my opinion, par 34 should be read with par 33 and should not be interpreted as containing a finding, which would be inconsistent with a finding made in par 33, that, if the programme was entered into, James would after three months definitely be reunited with his mother.  
     
      
    31 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that it had not been open to the sentencing judge to make the finding in par 33 of her remarks on sentence, that, if the applicant wished to enter into the Department of Corrective Services’ Mothers and Children’s Programme, there was a good likelihood that she would be reunited with her child within the correctional system after about three months.  
     
      
    32 The evidence before the sentencing judge included the pamphlet about the Mothers and Children’s Programme. However, as was pointed out by the applicant’s representative in the proceedings on sentence, there was no evidence that the applicant had been, or would be, classified as suitable for entry into the Programme.  
     
      
    33 The applicant’s evidence in the proceedings on sentence about whether she would want to enter into such a programme was somewhat ambivalent. However, she did give evidence that she would rather enter into such a programme than be separated from her child.  
     
      
    34 Counsel for the applicant’s submission before this Court that it had not been open to the sentencing judge to make the particular finding relied heavily on the judgments in this Court in two cases involving the same party R v Togias (2001) 127 A Crim R 23, which I will refer to as Togias 1, and R v Togias (2002) 132 A Crim R 573, which I will refer to as Togias 2.  
     
      
    35 The extraordinary history of the criminal proceedings against Ms Togias was outlined by Hodgson JA in his judgment in Togias 2 at pp 574-575.  
     
      
    36 Ms Togias was charged with importing a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug into Australia. She pleaded guilty to the offence.  
     
      
    37 When Ms Togias first appeared for sentence she was 5 ½ months pregnant. The proceedings on sentence were adjourned until after she had given birth to her child, Ms Togias being granted bail. The proceedings on sentence were then further adjourned.  
     
      
    38 On a further adjourned date evidence was given by a psychologist that separation of Ms Togias from her baby would be “absolutely traumatic” for the baby. Evidence was given that there was a facility within the correctional system in which Ms Togias, if sentenced to full time imprisonment, could care for her child. However, acceptance into that facility would depend on an assessment which would take a number of weeks, during which she would be separated from her child. The programme in Togias would appear to be the same as, or at least substantially similar to, the programme of which evidence was given in the present case.  
     
      
    39 Ultimately the District Court judge sentenced Ms Togias to imprisonment for three years but directed that she be released forthwith upon entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for three years.  
     
      
    40 A Crown appeal against sentence was brought. The Crown appeal was allowed by the Court of Criminal Appeal (Togias 1) but the Court of Criminal Appeal did not itself re-sentence Ms Togias, remitting the matter for sentence to the District Court. 
     
      
    41 The matter came before a second District Court judge. Evidence was given before this judge that, although some of the assessments of the suitability of Ms Togias for admission to the programme could be carried out before she entered into custody, there would still be a delay of some weeks from the date of admission into custody before the question of her suitability for admission to the programme could finally be determined, during which Ms Togias and her child would be separated. 
     
      
    42 The second District Court judge sentenced Ms Togias to imprisonment for five years but ordered that she be released forthwith upon entering into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for five years.  
     
      
    43 A Crown appeal was brought against this second sentence. By majority (Hodgson JA, Simpson J agreeing, Smart AJA dissenting) the Crown appeal was dismissed. The majority held that a full time custodial sentence would necessarily mean separation of Ms Togias from her child for some weeks, while she was being assessed for inclusion in the programme, and that the Court should proceed on the basis that there was a probability, within s 16A(2)(p) of the Crimes Act, that Ms Togias would be separated from her child for the whole of any full time custodial sentence. The majority were influenced to dismiss the Crown appeal by the extraordinary circumstances that Ms Togias had been subjected to two separate and protracted sentence hearings in the District Court and two Crown appeals against sentence.  
     
      
    44 In Togias 1 it was held that the first sentencing judge should have deferred passing sentence on Ms Togias until after she had been assessed for her suitability for inclusion in the programme, so that the sentencing judge would know whether there would be any separation of Ms Togias from her child, if a full time custodial sentence was imposed. In the present case, the sentencing judge sentenced the applicant before her suitability for admission to the Mothers and Children’s Programme had been assessed. However, it was not submitted by counsel for the applicant that the sentencing of the applicant had been invalidated by reason of her Honour having sentenced the applicant before her suitability had been assessed. In any event, it would appear that the suitability of a prisoner, who is a mother with a young child, for admission to the Mothers and Children’s Programme cannot be determined, at least finally, until after the prisoner has been sentenced and information about the sentence imposed and the sentencing judge’s remarks on sentence are available to be considered by the correctional services authorities. 
     
      
    45 Counsel for the applicant’s submission about par (p) of s 16A(2) was based on a part of the judgment of Hodgson JA in Togias 2 (at 581 (26) and (27)), in which his Honour said that, in the absence of any evidence of even a provisional determination of the suitability of Ms Togias for admission to the Mothers and Children’s Programme, it having been within the power of the Department of Corrective Services but not within the power to Ms Togias to produce such evidence, the court should infer that there was a probability that Ms Togias would be separated from her child for the whole of any sentence of full time imprisonment imposed on her.  
     
      
    46 It was submitted that in the present case, there being no evidence of even a provisional determination of the suitability of the applicant for admission to the Mothers and Children’s Programme, the inference should be drawn that the applicant would be separated from her child for the whole of any sentence of full-time imprisonment, and not merely the first three months, and that it had not been open to the sentencing judge to make the finding that, if the applicant wished to be admitted to the Programme, there was a good likelihood that she would be reunited with her child within the correctional system after about three months.  
     
      
    47 I do not consider that this submission should be accepted.  
     
      
    48 I would not regard the Court of Criminal Appeal in Togias 2 as having laid down a general principle that, where a person to be sentenced is a woman with an infant child and there is evidence of a programme for mothers and children conducted by the Department of Corrective Services but no evidence that the woman in question has yet been assessed as suitable for admission to the programme, a sentencing court must infer that there is a probability that the woman will be separated from her child for the whole of any sentence of full time imprisonment which is imposed. 
     
      
    49 The inference drawn by the majority of the court in Togias 2 depended, at least partly, on the extraordinary history of the proceedings involving Ms Togias. The court proceedings relating to the sentencing of Ms Togias extended over approximately two years. It was obvious from the time of the first sentencing proceedings in the District Court that the welfare of Ms Togias’ child would be central to the sentencing of Ms Togias. In Togias 1 members of the Court of Criminal Appeal referred, pointedly, to the absence of any evidence of any assessment of the suitability of Ms Togias for admission to the programme. However, at the time of the sentencing proceedings before the second District Court judge, several months afterwards, there was still no evidence of even a provisional assessment of Ms Togias’ suitability. In these circumstances it is understandable why the Court of Criminal Appeal in Togias 2 drew the inference it did.  
     
      
    50 In my opinion, the findings of fact made by the sentencing judge in the present case in par 33 of her remarks, including that, if a full time sentence was imposed, there would be a separation of the applicant and her child for three months, that there was no guarantee that after three months the applicant and her child would be reunited but there was a good likelihood that, if the applicant wished to enter into the programme, she would be reunited with her child after about three months, were open to her Honour. It would, of course, have been of assistance to her Honour, if there had been evidence that at least some sort of provisional assessment of the applicant’s suitability for admission to the programme had been made.  
     
      
    51 I would reject the first ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2 — The learned sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the role played by Hayden Scott in considering the offences committed by the applicant.  
       
      
    52 In my opinion, this ground of appeal can be dealt with quite summarily.  
     
      
    53 When summarising her Honour’s remarks on sentence I noted that her Honour made findings that the applicant’s criminal offending had been associated with her use of drugs and her relationship with Scott and that it was Scott who had introduced her to the use of drugs other than cannabis.  
     
      
    54 I am satisfied that her Honour took these findings into account in sentencing the applicant. As has been stated by this Court on a number of occasions, a ground of appeal that insufficient weight was given to a factor which was clearly taken into account by the sentencing judge, is difficult to sustain. 
     
      
    55 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 — The effect of delay. 
       
      
    56 Her Honour recognised in her remarks on sentence that there had been a delay of two and a half years between the discovery of the applicant’s offending and the commencement of court proceedings against her and that during that period the applicant had achieved a substantial degree of rehabilitation, dramatically reducing her use of drugs.  
     
      
    57 As in the case of the previous ground of appeal, I am satisfied that her Honour took these findings into account in sentencing the applicant and a submission that her Honour gave insufficient weight to these findings should not be accepted. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 — The learned trial judge erred imposing a sentence which in the circumstances was manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    58 It was conceded by counsel for the applicant that this ground of appeal really depended on an acceptance of one or more of the previous grounds of appeal. As I have rejected all of those grounds, I would also reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    59 As I have rejected all of the grounds of appeal, while leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal against sentence should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL:I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Rodney Thomas Phipps, was found guilty at trial in the District Court of 16 counts of sexual abuse of his step-daughter. There were eleven counts of aggravated sexual intercourse, an offence under s66C(2) of the Crimes Act which at the relevant time carried a maximum sentence of ten years imprisonment, and five counts of aggravated indecent assault, an offence under s61M(1) of the Act which, then as now, carried a maximum sentence of 7 years imprisonment. In each case the circumstance of aggravation was that the victim was under the applicant’s authority. He was sentenced to terms of imprisonment aggregating 14 years with a non-parole period of 11 years, and he seeks leave to appeal against those sentences. I shall explain shortly how that aggregate sentence was arrived at. 
     
      
    3 The offences were committed over a period between 1998 and 2001, when the victim was aged between twelve and fifteen years. There is no need to dwell on the details of them. It is sufficient to say that they embraced penile/vaginal intercourse, anal intercourse on one occasion, and various incidents of what the sentencing judge described as ”sexual touching”. The penile/vaginal intercourse was unprotected, but the applicant would withdraw before ejaculating. The offences were part of a wider pattern of abuse, which included cunnilingus, extending over a period in excess of three years.  
     
      
    4 On each of the aggravated sexual intercourse charges, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years, comprising a non-parole period of 6 years and a balance of term of 3 years. On each of the aggravated indecent assault charges, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 4 years. The offences had occurred at four different addresses at which the applicant, the victim and her family were living over the relevant period. For the purpose of sentence, his Honour grouped the offences according to the address where they were living at the time. A number of offences were committed at each of the first three addresses, and the last offence (aggravated sexual intercourse) was committed at the fourth address. As to the first three groups, the sentences were concurrent for the offences within each group but the sentences for each of the second and third groups were directed to commence two years later than the group which preceded it. There was further accumulation by one year of the sentence for the last offence. 
     
      
    5 On the occasion of the first count (aggravated sexual intercourse), the applicant threatened to kill the victim if she made a noise. He was violent towards her mother, and on another occasion she agreed to sexual contact after he promised not to hit her mother anymore. She was in fear of him. At the same time, her natural father having left the household when she was very young, he was the only father she knew. His Honour found that there developed a relationship between them such that she became “almost totally” dependent upon him, and he exploited that situation “to the full”. The whole pattern of abuse was described by his Honour as “virtual sexual servitude”. His manipulative behaviour was such that his Honour regarded the offences as “amongst the most serious of their kind”.  
     
      
    6 A victim impact statement revealed psychological consequences for the victim of a kind which one might expect from such serious and persistent abuse. Moreover, it led to her contracting incurable genital herpes. His Honour noted the physical discomfort and embarrassment which this condition caused her, adding that it was a “complication which is a constant physical reminder of the abuse which she has suffered”.  
     
      
    7 If that were not enough, in 2001 the applicant was dealt with in the Local Court for aggravated indecent assaults upon three of the victim’s sisters. That occurred before the offences against the victim came to light, and some of those offences were committed while he was on bail for the charges relating to her siblings.  
     
      
    8 The applicant was a man in his thirties at the time of the offences, and is now forty. He had a dreadful upbringing. There is no need to dwell on it either. It is sufficient to say that his natural father, who suicided, was very violent towards his mother. She had two subsequent relationships with men, both of whom abused the applicant physically and one of whom subjected him to persistent sexual abuse. A forensic psychiatrist, who provided a report, was of the opinion that he was suffering from symptoms consistent with post traumatic stress disorder, which his Honour accepted to be a “serious mental affliction”.  
     
      
    9 Since late 2002, the applicant had been in a relationship with another woman and they had a daughter, who was three years old at the time of sentence. His partner was supportive of him although, given his history, his Honour entertained some fears for the welfare of the daughter. Applying the Static 99 statistical test (with appropriate caution), the psychiatrist considered that there was a significant chance of his re-offending. Nevertheless, the applicant had been undertaking counselling while in custody and expressed a desire to undertake a sexual offenders program. This, his Honour thought, showed “some insight”.  
     
      
    10 In the light of this material, and the fact that the applicant was likely to be held in protection throughout the custodial component of his sentence, his Honour found special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. It is that finding which is at the heart of the present application.  
     
      
    11 Such a departure is to be found in the sentence for each of the charges of aggravated sexual intercourse, 9 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. That non-parole period is a little under 67 per cent of the sentence. However, in the aggregate sentence of 14 years with a non-parole period of 11 years, the effective non-parole period is a little over 78 per cent of the sentence, that is, more than the statutory proportion of 75 per cent. This gives rise to the only submission of Ms Davenport SC, who appeared for the applicant. She argued that the overall sentence fails to reflect his Honour’s finding of special circumstances.  
     
      
    12 This Court has sometimes intervened in cases where, a judge having found special circumstances, it appears that the proportion of an effective non-parole period to an overall sentence has failed to give effect to the judge’s intention. After careful consideration, I do not think that this is such a case. His Honour had reserved judgment before passing sentence, and his remarks convey that he had given careful thought to the structure of the sentences and to the principle of totality. 
     
      
    13 The applicant stood for sentence for criminality of a high order, which had to be reflected in the effective non-parole period. The aggregate sentence still leaves him with a substantial period of parole eligibility, 3 years. His Honour achieved that outcome by giving effect to his finding of special circumstances in the sentences for the more serious offences. As the Crown prosecutor in this Court pointed out, there is a symmetry in the specification of a balance of term of 3 years in each of those sentences and in the overall term. 
     
      
    14 In the circumstances of this case, his Honour was not required to reflect the finding of special circumstances in the overall sentence as well as the sentence for each of the aggravated sexual intercourse charges. There is no reason to infer that he overlooked the matter, or that the overall sentence is anything other than that which he intended. In any event, it demonstrates no error.  
     
      
    15 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

    3 PRICE J: The Crown appeals against the sentence imposed upon the respondent John Paul Viana. The respondent pleaded guilty to an indictment which alleged that he, between 19 November 2004 and 6 February 2005 dealt with money that was proceeds of crime, being reckless as to the fact that the money was the proceeds of crime, and at the time of the dealing, the value of the money was more than $1,000,000. This was an offence of money laundering against s 400.3(2) of the Criminal Code (Cth) (the Criminal Code). The maximum penalty for such an offence is imprisonment for 12 years, or a $79,200 fine or both. Section 400.3(2) is found within Division 400 of the Criminal Code.  
     
      
    4 On 8 February 2008, the respondent was sentenced in the District Court at Penrith to imprisonment for 4 years 6 months commencing on 7 December 2005, with a non-parole period of 2 years 11 months and expiring on 6 November 2008.  
     
      
    5 The sole ground of appeal is that the sentence is said to be manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    6 The principles relevant to Crown appeals against sentence are well established and are summarised in Regina v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 per Wood CJ at CL at [70]. Considerable restraint is exercised by this Court before intervening in the orders made by a sentencing Judge.  
     
      
       
       
      The offence  
       
      
    7 The facts of the offence were not in dispute and a statement of facts was handed to the sentencing Judge which her Honour adopted in her sentencing remarks. The following is a summary drawn largely from that statement.  
     
      
       
      The respondent came to Australia to assist in the collection of a large sum of cash which was the money due to a Colombian national, Alexander Ayala-Serna (“Serna”), for his supply in Colombia of 300 kilograms of cocaine which had been imported into Australia. It was intended by those whom the respondent assisted, principally Serna, that on collection in Australia, the money would be sent overseas to Colombia. The respondent’s father (“Viana senior”), an associate to Serna, had agreed that the respondent would come to Australia to assist Serna with the repatriation of the cash. 
       
       
      The respondent arrived in Australia on 6 November 2004 with money for accommodation and the purchase of a car. Serna arrived on 19 November with other associates of his. They met up with the respondent in Sydney on the same day. 
       
       
      On 24-25 November 2004 the respondent, claiming to be a student studying in Sydney, rented a furnished apartment at Roseville for an initial three month period. The respondent paid $8510 in advance for this rental. By this time he was staying in an Artarmon motel while Serna and his other associates were staying at a North Ryde hotel, apparently because Serna wanted to be distanced from the planned handover of the money. 
       
       
      On or about 25 November 2004 by arrangement the respondent met with a man and gave him the keys to the vehicle the respondent had been driving. The following day the man returned the car with the cash, the subject of the charge, in boxes in the boot. A short time later the respondent contacted Serna and told him that the car had been returned, meaning that the cash had been delivered. Serna then came to the Artarmon motel and instructed the respondent to drive to the rented unit at Roseville. 
       
       
      Later, either on that day or the following day, the respondent and Serna removed the boxes from the respondent’s car and took them to the unit, where the two men counted bundles of money secured by rubber bands inside the boxes. Serna calculated that there was about $A5,050,000 which was then stored under a bed in the apartment. 
       
       
      Serna then told the respondent to contact Viana senior to find a way of repatriating the cash back to Colombia. Later, Serna was told by the respondent that Viana senior had found someone in Miami who had a contact in Australia who could repatriate the money back to Columbia for a commission of 25 per cent. 
       
       
      Before he left Australia Serna delivered $750,000 of the money to a man at a Kentucky Fried Chicken outlet in Artarmon, being the first step in arrangements made by Viana senior for the repatriation of the money overseas. 
       
       
      On 6 December 2004 Serna departed Australia on LAN Chile flight 800 to Santiago, Chile, having told the respondent to keep looking after the money. Later the respondent told Serna that arrangements had been made for the money to be sent out of Australia by a man who would take delivery of the money in one amount. 
       
       
      On 1 January 2005 John Iglesias arrived in Australia from the United States and joined the respondent at the Roseville unit. Serna played no part in Iglesias coming to Australia and did not know his identity.  
       
       
      On 1 February 2005 the respondent contacted the apartment rental agents and told them he would be departing on 6 February 2005, but his  
      uncle  
      would be staying until 15 March 2005. Iglesias later attended the agents’ office and took over the lease.  
       
       
      On 6 February 2005 the respondent left Australia, leaving Iglesias to guard the cash, but they remained in regular contact. Iglesias used a mobile phone previously purchased by the respondent in Australia and subscribed to using false details. 
       
       
      Intercepted calls between 10 February 2005 and 16 April 2005 revealed that the respondent and Iglesias were in regular contact with each other and Viana senior in relation to the cash now being safeguarded by Iglesias. The calls also showed that both the respondent and Iglesias were relying on Viana senior to arrange for Iglesias to meet with somebody who could collect the cash and repatriate it to Colombia. 
       
       
      On 18 February 2005 during a telephone conversation the respondent gave Iglesias detailed instructions as to how he should hand cash over to a third party in a restaurant car park. On 26 February 2005 the respondent told Iglesias that ‘ 
      another amigo has already left to go there’ 
      , this being a reference to a money launderer employed by Viana senior.  
       
       
      On 8 March 2005 in a coded telephone conversation, the respondent and Iglesias talked about the Chinese model and asked: “what  
      happened with the Chinese girl?” 
       The respondent replied:  
      “No, good, good, good, too. All of them are good, all of them good. Everything is well organized with those bloody bitches. 
      ” 
       
       
      On 12 April 2005 Wing Cheong Li and his wife Oi Ling Lee, Hong Kong Chinese who lived in Venezuela, travelled from Hong Kong to Australia. 
       
       
      On 13 April 2005 Iglesias contacted Li by telephone in Sydney. They made arrangements to meet in the city. Iglesias then spoke with the respondent and told him that he would be sending his money today. Later, Iglesias told the respondent that he had met “ 
      with that bandit of a girl and will be seeing her”.  
      The Crown case was that this was a reference to Li, not to his wife. The respondent then told Iglesias that he should be “ 
      observant, even if she is a person to be trusted”. 
        
       
       
      A few minutes later Iglesias asked the respondent if he should “ 
      give him the whole holiday package, the 27 days 
      .” The respondent replied, “ 
      No, no half of it mate. 
      ” The Crown alleged that this was a coded conversation in which Iglesias was asking if he should hand over all of the remaining money to Li, namely $A2.7 million. 
       
       
      Iglesias met with Li. They travelled to the Roseville unit where Iglesias handed Li two grey backpacks containing $A1.35 million, which Li took back to his city hotel, where he was staying with his wife. A little later Iglesias told the respondent that he had handed half ‘ 
      the holiday package’ 
       over and would hand the next half over the following day, 14 April 2005, which was what occurred. After that handover Iglesias told the respondent in a call: “ 
      Thank God the nightmare is over 
      .” Li later made arrangements to transfer some of the funds overseas. At the time of the arrests of Li and his wife they still had possession of $2.26 million and had caused, through a foreign exchange dealer, a little under $400,000 to be remitted overseas.  
       
       
      Iglesias departed Australia on 18 April 2005. On 19 April Li, his wife and another person, Xian, were arrested. They were found to be in possession of $A2,659,256.70.  
       
       
      Subjective circumstances  
       
      
    8 The respondent’s subjective circumstances were before the sentencing Judge by way of two Probation and Parole reports. He did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. Her Honour was informed by the respondent’s counsel that what was said to the probation officer under the heading “Factors Related to Offending” was not relied upon by the respondent. 
     
      
    9 Her Honour relevantly summarised his subjective circumstances as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender was born in New York. He informed the Probation Service he was abandoned by his mother when he was three. She was apparently a drug addict. His maternal grandmother contacted his paternal grandfather and his grandfather took him to Colombia for two years. His father remarried and at the age of five he went to live with his stepmother in Colombia. They joined his father, who had been living in the United States. He spent time with his father and stepmother in the United States and time with relatives in Colombia. There are three half siblings. It was when he was about twelve he realised that his stepmother was not his natural mother. There had been a great deal of conflict between them throughout those early years. He was forced to leave home at sixteen when it was thought he was implicated in a robbery of his stepmother’s belongings. He undertook some counselling but problems resurfaced again. In 2000 he heard that his birth mother had been trying to trace him in Colombia in 1995. Efforts were made to find her but sadly she had died. The offender is said to be harbouring feelings of guilt for not trying to locate her whilst she was still alive.  
        
       
       
        
        In 2004 the offender left Colombia and returned to live in the United States. He had a pregnant girlfriend but she was not able to accompany him. Without family support he lived in a car in Miami. His girlfriend gave birth to a son and he went to see him in April 2005. That relationship ended. The offender formed a new relationship and his new partner accompanied him back to the United States. She discovered she was pregnant shortly after his arrest and a son was born in July 2006. They have apparently returned to Colombia.  
        
       
       
        
        The offender was suspended from school in ninth grade. However he went on to complete high school at the age of seventeen, despite drug and gambling addictions. He began to study business administration at university. His father agreed to support him if he went to university but said he would give him nothing if he did not attend. He left the first university in which he was enrolled and enrolled in another university when his father threatened to withdraw financial support. In 2002 financial support was withdrawn by his father when he was expelled from university for low grades and poor behaviour, including substance abuse.  
        
       
       
        
        His employment history includes a period of accompanying a wealthy benefactor throughout South American countries as his personal assistant in 2002 and 2003. A letter has been tendered from a car parking station certifying that the offender worked from August 2005 until December 2005 as a car parking attendant. He was regarded as a good employee who showed up on time.  
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        Since his incarceration in Australia he has been gainfully employed in the industries section, the prison kitchen and as a television technician. He says he works to pay for overseas phone calls. In more recent times he has worked as a cleaner in the Justice Health Clinic at Parramatta Correctional Centre. In the opinion of the Probation Service the offender had a materially privileged upbringing which was dysfunctional. He has unresolved issues of substance abuse and gambling.”  
        
       
      
      
     
      
      The findings of the sentencing Judge  
       
      
    10 Her Honour found: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The respondent’s role was more significant than one of a mere underling or courier. He was entrusted with the funds after Serna left Australia. Once Iglesias arrived he did not cease his involvement but remained engaged with him. The respondent was to be sentenced in accordance with the facts to which he had pleaded guilty. 
        
       
       
      (b) The respondent had come to Australia with the knowledge  
       
        
        that he was to be involved in the repatriation of a large sum of cash from Australia to Colombia. He was engaged in this illegal activity from 6 November and his role did not cease upon his return to the United States. He continued to liaise with Iglesias throughout February and March and up until Iglesias left Australia in April 2005. The offender’s role was one of significance, if not a principal. The objective gravity of the offence called for the imposition of a full time custodial sentence.  
        
       
       
        
        (c) It was a matter which fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness.  
        
       
       
        
        (d) At the time of sentence the respondent was 26 years old and had been born in New York. He had no family or other contacts in Australia.  
        
       
      
     (e) He had no prior criminal antecedents. 
     
      
       
        
        (f) The respondent was extradited from the United States of America where he had been in custody since 7 December 2005. He had not disputed his extradition  
        
       
      
    11 Her Honour had regard to the subjective circumstances of the respondent – his lack of criminal antecedents, his age and the fact that he was alone in an Australian gaol without any support other than telephone contact with his family in the United States and Colombia. Her Honour remarked: 
     
      
       
        
        “But for the plea of guilty and his willingness with regard to his extradition I would have imposed a head sentence in the order of six years imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    12 During her sentencing remarks the sentencing Judge referred to the submission on behalf of the respondent that this was an unusual case as there was no evidence that he was to benefit financially from the enterprise. The extent of the respondent’s benefit was said to amount to a benefit to his father rather than himself and that was by way of a loan of $US1.2 million from Serna. Her Honour remarked “in other words, he was acting illegally at the behest of his father, who may well have some particular authority over him”. The Crown had told the sentencing Judge that it was common ground between the parties that the respondent acted at his father’s behest which had been confirmed by Serna in an interview with police.  
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    13 The Crown submitted that the head sentence of 6 years which was identified as the commencement point of the sentence was too low to reflect the respondent’s criminality. The Crown pointed to the amount of money involved, namely $5 million dollars and what was asserted to be the knowledge of the respondent as to the source of the money. In written submissions the Crown referred to the sentencing Judge’s failure to identify whether the respondent was reckless as to whether the money was the proceeds of a major drug offence, as opposed to simply being the proceeds of a crime. During oral argument the Crown argued that the respondent must have known that the origin of the funds was drug trafficking and asked this Court to make such a finding. It was, the Crown said, difficult to contemplate that the funds had any other origin particularly given that Serna was a Colombian national. The respondent’s knowledge was a component, the Crown contended, which could be used in determining the seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    14 Although her Honour’s characterisation of the respondent’s role was consistent with the Crown’s submission on sentence, the Crown asserted that the sentence imposed did not reflect this finding.  
     
      
    15 The manifest inadequacy was said to derive from the sentencing Judge: 
     
      
       
        
        a. Wrongly identifying 6 years imprisonment as an appropriate head sentence; 
        
       
       
        
        b. Failing to properly take into account the serious nature of such offences and to adequately reflect the element of general deterrence consistent with the legislative intent of Parliament regarding the seriousness of such offences.  
        
       
       
      Whilst acknowledging that appeals by the Crown should be rarely exercised, the Crown submitted that this case falls within the category where this Court should intervene.  
       
      
    16 Counsel for the respondent asked how one could conclude that a 6 year prison sentence was anything but a substantial penalty. The sentence, it was said, more than adequately reflected the objective criminality of a man without a criminal record who: 
     
      
    · At the direction of others, collected and safeguarded for a number of months a large amount of money; 
     
      
    · Stood to receive no direct financial gain; 
     
      
    · Did not have knowledge of the source of the monies and their connection to a previous importation of prohibited drugs into Australia; 
     
      
    · Was not involved in the illegal drug trade; 
     
      
    · Was not involved in any additional episodes of money laundering; 
     
      
    · Did not move the monies himself out of Australia; and 
     
      
    · Did not have the capacity or resources to do so in any event. 
     
      
    17 The respondent submitted that it was difficult to comprehend how a sentence of so many years full time imprisonment, given to a man without a criminal history, fails to communicate the message of general deterrence when you look closely at exactly what the respondent did. 
     
      
    18 In response to the Crown’s argument as to the respondent’s state of mind, it was contended that there were a number of illegal acts which could account for the existence of large amounts of cash exceeding $1,000,000. It was more realistic to conclude that anyone dealing with such a large amount of cash would be reckless to the funds being illegitimate. However, that did not support what the Crown urged was the next logical conclusion (at sentence at first instance) which was that the respondent was reckless to the funds being illegitimate monies from the importation of drugs. 
     
      
    19 The agreed facts, it was argued, did not support this conclusion and was not a matter that had been established by the Crown beyond reasonable doubt. The respondent submitted that the matters which supported this argument include: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) The length of time between the importation and the attempted repatriation of the monies; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The respondent did not use a false identity whilst in Australia; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The respondent received directions from Serna; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) Serna and others distanced themselves from him whilst in Australia; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) There was nothing to indicate that the respondent was in Serna’s confidence; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) His participation originated from his father’s dealing with Serna to obtain a substantial loan of money, not from any personal association with the illegal drug trade. 
        
       
      
    20 It was submitted that what the respondent did after he left Australia was not part of the charged period and could only serve to illustrate the extent of his criminality whilst in Australia. The respondent’s role, as compared to other persons identified in this offence, had to be at the lower end. He received directions and was not a decision maker. There was nothing particularly sophisticated in what he did, rather it was his trustworthiness which made him suitable to the task. Her Honour’s finding that the respondent’s role was more significant than an underling or courier was accurate as he was a trusted intermediary who collected and safeguarded the monies.  
     
      
    21 This Court was reminded that the respondent’s involvement came about from his father’s intention to take a loan from Serna, rather than from any allegation that he had some greater involvement in the illegal drug trade. This was said to be a factor which reduced his criminality rather than aggravating it. The only money provided to him was to pay for the costs involved in safeguarding the money. He appears to have received no significant financial gain which is supported by his having worked as a car park attendant from August 2005 to December 2005. 
     
      
    22 The six year starting point, counsel for the respondent submitted, adequately reflected the criminality of the respondent’s role.  
     
      
       
       
      Decision  
       
      
    23 Offences of money laundering under Division 400 of the Criminal Code received detailed consideration by this Court (Simpson, Howie and Hislop JJ) in Ansari v The Queen (2007) 173 A Crim R 112 and R v Huang, R v Siu (2007) 174 A Crim R 370. The amount of money or value of the property involved and what was alleged to have been the state of mind of the accused determine, in accordance with the scheme of the Criminal Code, the available maximum penalty.  
     
      
    24 The amount of money or value of the property which is dealt with by an offender distinguishes a s 400.3(2) offence (money or property worth $1,000,000 or more) with a maximum penalty of 12 years from a s 400.4(2) offence (money or property worth $100,000 or more) with a maximum penalty of 10 years or a s 400.5(2) offence (money or property worth $50,000 or more) with a maximum penalty of 7 years. As was said in R v Huang, R v Siu at [34]:  
     
      
       
        
        “The amount of money involved is clearly a highly significant matter because the legislation uses it as the principal means of dividing the offences into categories and it is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence.” 
        
       
      
    25 Where the state of mind of an offender is alleged to have been belief or intention the maximum penalty is 25 years (s 400.3(1)) whereas, where recklessness is alleged, the maximum penalty is 12 years (s 400.3(2)) and in the case of negligence 5 years (s 400.3(3)).  
     
      
    26 In Ansari Simpson J explained at [11]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “…s 400.3, properly analysed, creates six different offences, in pairs, graded in descending order of seriousness. The level of seriousness depends upon what is alleged by the Crown to have been the state of mind of the accused.” 
         
        
       
      
    27 In present case the principal factor which aggravates the seriousness of the respondent’s offending was the very large amount of money, namely $A5,050,000 which he dealt with. Furthermore, his criminal activity in Australia which was the subject of the charge extended over about 11 weeks. 
     
      
    28 No issue was taken by either party with her Honour’s identification of the respondent’s role being “more significant than one of a mere underlying or courier.” The sentencing Judge was entitled to take into account the contact he maintained with Iglesias after he departed Australia in her consideration of the respondent’s role in the laundering of the money. Whilst not the principal, his involvement was significant and not merely confined to being the custodian of the proceeds of crime. His criminal activity included the collection and counting of the money. It was the respondent who informed Serna that arrangements had been made for the money to be sent out of Australia and with whom Iglesias took up residence. After having left this country, the respondent was in regular contact with Iglesias. It is evident that her Honour took into consideration these matters.  
     
      
    29 No argument was advanced by the Crown during the proceedings on sentence that her Honour should find that the respondent must have known that the origin of the funds was drug trafficking. In written submissions the Crown had submitted to the sentencing Judge that by his plea the respondent had acknowledged that he was reckless as to the fact that the money was the proceeds of crime. As to the nature of the crime in question it was difficult, the Crown wrote, to conceive of another crime which would generate the level of the funds other than the importation of illicit drugs. On this issue the sentencing Judge did not make a finding. Her Honour, however, was aware of the significance of the mental state of the respondent when she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The moral culpability of an offender depends upon his level of involvement. That is reflected in the maximum penalties imposed for negligently dealing with monies, which is five years, the recklessly dealing with monies, which is twelve years, or the belief that monies were the proceeds of crime, which attracts the maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment. This offender has pleaded guilty to recklessly being involved.”  
        
       
      
    30 The Crown’s contention that this Court should find beyond reasonable doubt that the respondent did or must have known that the origin of the money was drug trafficking, in my view, infringes the principle in The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383 and is to be rejected. Such a finding would take into account a circumstance of aggravation which would have warranted a conviction for the more serious offence under s 400.3(1)(b)(i) of the Criminal Code which establishes an offence where a ‘person believes’ the money or property ‘to be proceeds of crime’.31 It was open to the sentencing Judge without infringing the principle in De Simoni to consider that the respondent was reckless as to the source of the funds being the importation or sale of prohibited drugs. The obligation was on the Crown to establish that matter beyond reasonable doubt. Whilst it is not evident from the remarks on sentence, the fact that the respondent acted at his father’s behest to enable him to obtain a loan from Serna was a matter which might have caused her Honour to step back from reaching such a conclusion beyond reasonable doubt. I am not persuaded that her Honour erred in not making the finding which the Crown submitted ought to have been made.  
     
      
    32 In the present case the amount of money dealt with by the respondent was considerable. In my opinion it makes little difference in assessing the objective seriousness of the present offence whether the respondent was reckless as to the source of the funds being a particular crime or to the funds being illegitimate. What the respondent did in his participation of laundering of just over $5,000,000 is to my mind the most important consideration. His role was not at the lower end as was submitted in this Court for the respondent.  
     
      
    33 It was accepted at the sentencing hearing that the respondent had acted at his father’s bidding and there was no evidence that he had benefited financially from the offence. Her Honour remarked that his father “may well have some particular authority over him”. His lack of financial gain was supported by his work as a car park attendant upon his return to the United States. These were considerations that her Honour was entitled to take into account as mitigating the objective seriousness of the criminal conduct.  
     
      
    34 In determining the sentence to be passed the matters identified in s 16A (1) and (2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) were required to be taken into account which her Honour acknowledged. These matters include the subjective circumstances of the respondent.  
     
      
    35 At the time of sentence the respondent had no prior convictions and was 26 years old. In various classes of offence less weight is extended to prior good character: see for example R v Leroy (1984) 2 NSWLR 441 (drug couriers); R v Barrentos [1999] NSWCCA 1 (drug importations). As there was no discussion during the sentencing proceedings or before this Court that less weight should be given to the respondent’s lack of prior convictions, it would be inappropriate to consider here whether the Leroy approach should apply to the present case. 
     
      
    36 Section 16A(2)(m) of the Crimes Act (Cth) required her Honour to take into account the prior good character of the respondent.  
     
      
    37 The importance of general deterrence in sentencing for an offence of money laundering was recognised by her Honour when she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There can be no doubt that the issue of general deterrence is of significance when sentencing offenders for offences which amount to money laundering. These offences by their very nature are difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute. The activity involves the disposition of funds used in illegal activities without confidence in which the original crimes would be unlikely to have been committed in the first place.”  
        
       
       
      Notwithstanding what was said, the Crown complains that the sentence does not reflect the need for general deterrence.  
       
      
    38 The Crown pointed out that the terminology used by her Honour that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness is derived from s 54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and has no relevance to sentencing of Commonwealth offenders. Whilst that is true, this Court has encouraged transparency in sentencing and, in my view, the sentencing Judge should not be criticised for exposing her reasons for the sentence imposed. Her Honour’s characterisation of the offence explains the notional starting point of the sentence of 6 years which is half the applicable maximum sentence. There was no complaint by the Crown for the reduction of the head sentence by 25 per cent “for the plea of guilty and his willingness with regard to his extradition.” The Crown’s complaint is that the identified starting point was manifestly inadequate.  
     
      
    39 The sentencing Judge carefully considered the decisions of this Court in R v Z [2006] NSWCCA 342, R v Huang, R v Siu, Ansari v The Queen which were said by the Crown to be comparative cases and took them into account as indicative of the range of sentences whilst acknowledging that none of them could be “said to be on all fours with this offender”. 
     
      
    40 In written submissions to this Court the Crown included a number of sentencing decisions for money laundering offences. Of those which have been the subject of appeals to this Court the Crown said that none are of sufficient similarity to the present case to permit any conclusion about what, if any, range of appropriate sentence has developed. A number of those cases were those considered by her Honour. The recent decision of Du Randt v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 121 which involved an offence contrary to s 400.4(2) of the Criminal Code was referred to. The money dealt with in that case was substantially less than in the present matter and the principal consideration on appeal was the weight given to the offender’s mental condition.  
     
      
    41 The sentencing decisions referred to can be, as the Crown submitted, distinguished for various reasons from the present circumstances. Whether the sentence imposed in this case is manifestly inadequate is the question to be determined by this Court.  
     
      
    42 The non-parole period of 2 years 11 months represented 64 per cent (round figures) of the head sentence which was within the usual range for Federal offences of somewhere between 60 and 66 per cent. The non-parole period must appropriately reflect the seriousness of the respondent’s criminality and meet the need for general deterrence. Although the Crown did not specifically argue that the non-parole period was inadequate such inadequacy would inevitably arise if the notional starting point of the sentence was definitely outside an appropriate range. 
     
      
    43 It is trite to observe that this is a Crown appeal and the question is not what sentence would have been imposed if the respondent had come before this Court for the first time to be sentenced. This Court will not interfere in the exercise of the sentencing Judge’s discretion unless either identifiable or manifest error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    44 No error has been demonstrated in her Honour’s approach to the sentencing task. Whilst in my opinion, the sentence is lenient, I am not persuaded in all the circumstances that the starting point of the sentence or the non-parole period was outside an appropriate range. The sentence is at the lower end of an appropriate range and within her Honour’s discretion.  
     
      
    45 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

      2006/3605 REGINA v Michael Rex CLARK 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: Late in the evening on 29 April 2005, Ernest Richard Clark, known as Dick Clark (the deceased), was shot whilst in the rear garden of his home at Bexley. Two bullets were fired. The first struck a glancing blow to the left side of his head. The second was fired at close range to the left side of his forehead. It penetrated his skull, fracturing the base of the skull and other facial bones. Dick Clark staggered a short distance before collapsing on the lawn. About an hour later he was found unconscious by his partner, Ms Jessica Chung. Ms Chung had returned home at about 12.30 am on 30 April 2005. An ambulance was called. Mr Clark was taken to the St George Hospital where he died that afternoon. He never regained consciousness. 
     
      
    2 Michael Rex Clark and his son, Ben Richard Clark, were charged with Dick Clark’s murder. It was the Crown case that they had engaged in a joint criminal enterprise whereby Ben Clark would shoot Dick Clark when Michael Clark was well away from the murder scene. He had to be well away so that he could not be accused of having committed the crime. Michael Clark, according to the Crown, needed that insulation because he had an obvious motive. He was in poor financial circumstances and was a beneficiary under Dick Clark’s Will. 
     
      
    3 When the matter was called on for trial before Patten AJ, Ben Clark pleaded guilty. On 24 August 2007, he was sentenced by Patten AJ to a term of imprisonment of 20 years, with a non parole period of 14 years. Michael Clark, however, pleaded not guilty. In March 2008, he was arraigned before a jury. On 2 May 2008, after a lengthy trial, he was convicted of murder.  
     
      
    4 It remains for me to pass sentence. Before I do so, I should first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. Where the facts are adverse, they must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour Mr Clark, it is enough that they should be established on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
       
      The shooting. 
       
      
    5 The circumstances in which Dick Clark met his death are not in doubt. Ben Clark lived with his father, Michael Clark, at Faulconbridge. At about 6.30 pm on 29 April 2005, Ben Clark left Faulconbridge by motorcycle for Dick Clark’s home. At 8.23 pm and again at 8.26 pm, he sent text messages to his father. Michael Clark was then in a restaurant at Richmond with his wife, stepdaughter and her boyfriend. At 8.27 pm, Michael Clark telephoned Ben. They spoke briefly. Ben was then in the Kogarah area, very close to Dick Clark’s home. It was a Friday night. Dick Clark was in the habit of watching the football on a Friday evening.  
     
      
    6 It may be inferred that, at some point soon after 8.27 pm, Ben Clark rode his motorcycle to his grandfather’s home. He took the precaution of parking in an adjacent street some distance away. He was armed with a loaded .38 calibre handgun. His grandfather invited him into the house. Together they sat and watched the football on television, each drinking beer. 
     
      
    7 At about 11.10 pm Ben left the house to go home. He walked up the back steps towards the back gate. His grandfather came outside to see him off. He was standing at the bottom of the steps when Ben Clark turned towards him and fired the first bullet. It was immediately clear that the first bullet had not killed him. Ben Clark descended several steps, moving towards his grandfather, and discharged the gun a second time, directly into his grandfather’s forehead, at close range. This was the fatal shot. 
     
      
    8 Ben Clark then made his escape. He rode back to Faulconbridge. Between 11.44 pm and 11.53 pm, there was an exchange of messages and a telephone call between Michael Clark and Ben. Soon after, Ben arrived home.  
     
      
       
      Motive. 
       
      
    9 The Crown submitted that the murder was akin to a contract killing. It was a planned execution and the motive was money. It was accomplished when Michael Clark was at a safe distance. Michael Clark, according to the Crown, was in a desperate financial situation. He so dominated his son Ben, that he was able to recruit him to carry out the shooting. Their agreement, according to the Crown, included a promise to Ben that he would share part of the inheritance. It was the Crown’s submission that this crime should be characterised as being within the worst category of murder (s 61(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) (“the Act”).  
     
      
    10 Counsel for Michael Clark contested each assertion. Whilst the jury had determined that there was an agreement between Michael and Ben Clark which involved Ben shooting Dick Clark, that agreement was not the product of Michael’s dominance over Ben. Nor could it be determined, beyond reasonable doubt, that the motive was money. Indeed, according to counsel for Mr Clark, it could not be inferred beyond reasonable doubt that part of their arrangement was that Ben receive a share of the inheritance.  
     
      
    11 The resolution of these issues requires a description of the relationships within the family. Let me begin by describing Ben’s relationship with his father and with the deceased. Ben was born on 26 March 1984. He was 21 years at the time of the murder. His mother, Mrs Rhoda Clark, was Michael Clark’s first wife. There were three children of the marriage. Only Ben opted to live with his father, although his brother later joined him. Rhoda Clark described the relationship between Ben and his father as “particularly close”. Michael Clark’s second wife, Jennifer, simply described them as “father and son”. Family members and friends of Ben denied that Michael Clark dominated his son. Ben, who gave evidence at the trial, described the suggestion of dominance as “rubbish”. 
     
      
    12 Ben Clark said that when he shot Dick Clark he was acting alone and out of fear. He explained that there had been a number of incidents five years earlier when he was working for Dick Clark. They took place during two weeks when he was at Dick Clark’s workshop at Granville in late 2000, or early 2001. His grandfather had repeatedly assaulted him sexually. Eventually, he had anally raped him. He was, at the time, some months short of 17 years old. The assaults were perpetrated in various locations throughout the workshop. The rape occurred in a small and cluttered room towards the rear of the workshop. His wrists had been bound to a shelf whilst he was raped. The jury was instructed that if they believed there was a reasonable possibility that Ben was sexually assaulted by Dick Clark, such that he had his own reasons for disliking his grandfather and may possibly have acted alone, they must acquit Michael Clark. The jury, by their verdict, clearly rejected Ben Clark’s evidence, which was unsurprising. His evidence, in its presentation and detail, was completely implausible.  
     
      
    13 What, then, was the motive of Ben Clark? There was some evidence of ill-feeling between Dick Clark and Ben, arising out of the short time that Ben had spent working in his grandfather’s workshop and showroom in 2000 or 2001. Patten AJ, when sentencing Ben Clark, accepted that Dick Clark probably abused Ben verbally because he regarded him as lazy. He may even have mildly pushed him or shoved him to get him moving. Patten AJ could not exclude the possibility that some ill-feeling persisted, and provided part of Ben Clark’s motivation. I share that view. 
     
      
    14 I am not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt that Michael Clark so dominated his son that Ben Clark, by reason of that relationship and regardless of his own feelings, was prepared to do his father’s bidding. If, as I think likely, Ben Clark had his own reasons for resenting Dick Clark, his recruitment did not require dominance on the part of his father. Nonetheless, Michael Clark, as a parent, was in a position of influence over his son. I am satisfied that it was agreed between them that part of the inheritance, once received, would be given to Ben by Michael Clark. 
     
      
    15 Let me move from that, to the relationship between the deceased and Michael Clark and the question of motive. On the Crown case, there was not only motive, but urgency. There was motive because Michael Clark stood to inherit money. He needed money because he was heavily in debt, with a limited income. There was urgency, according to the Crown, arising from recent changes in his father’s relationship with his partner, Ms Jessica Chung. His father was aged 74 years. His partner, Ms Chung, was a much younger woman, not yet 50 years. They had known each other for more than a decade. Although their relationship had involved intimacy, they had lived separately throughout that time.  
     
      
    16 However, in September 2004, their relationship had changed. Dick Clark sold his business and the flat in which he lived. He was therefore obliged to find another home. He and Ms Chung decided that they would live together in a house which she owned at Bexley. Renovations were undertaken, paid for by Dick Clark. The deceased had also made it known first, that he was contemplating the discharge of Ms Chung’s mortgage in respect of the Bexley property and, secondly, the purchase of a business on her behalf. The Crown alleged that Michael Clark was unhappy with these developments. He was said to be concerned at the dissipation of a significant part of his father’s cash assets. More than that, he was, according to the Crown, resentful of his father’s generosity towards Jessica Chung, which was in marked contrast with his meanness towards him. 
     
      
    17 Some aspects of the Crown case on motive were more persuasive than others. Michael Clark and his wife had relatively substantial debts. They had, between them, a limited income. Nonetheless, they got by. They had lived in this fashion for some time. Their circumstances at the time of the murder were not materially different from their circumstances at other times. Indeed, their position overall had marginally improved. They had a roof over their heads. They lived rent free in a house owned by Jennifer’s parents. Credit had been offered to them by a bank. I accept that it cannot be said that Michael Clark was, at the time of the murder, in a desperate financial situation. 
     
      
    18 However, I am persuaded that there was resentment by Michael Clark towards his father and concern at the dissipation of his father’s money. The resentment arose from a perception of unfairness and meanness on the part of his father towards him, in contrast to his father’s treatment of Ms Jessica Chung. Michael Clark was Dick Clark’s only child, having been adopted at the age of three years. 
     
      
    19 When Michael Clark was a child and a young man, he clearly did not get on well with his father. Michael Clark, as I will explain, was then convicted of various criminal offences and spent some time in gaol. After his release from gaol, he met his second wife, Jennifer. They married in 1991. Some stability was introduced into Michael Clark’s life that had previously been absent. Dick Clark was pleased with these developments. His relationship with his son improved. Dick Clark said to his sister and others that he was proud of Michael. He repeated that statement in a birthday card which he sent him in February 2005, a matter of months before the murder. 
     
      
    20 Whilst Michael Clark and his family were not desperate financially, it was plain that they were struggling. Dick Clark, in contrast, had sold his business in September 2004 and received $800,000. After the sale, there had been discussions between father and son concerning a loan of $50,000. The loan was never made. Michael Clark gave one version as to why it was not made. Ms Jessica Chung had an understanding, but was not directly involved in dealings between Michael and his father. In the absence of Dick Clark, it is difficult to know exactly what happened. But, whatever happened, it was clear by the later part of 2004 that there had been an argument between Michael Clark and his father concerning money. For a time they were estranged. They made up before Christmas and attended the same Christmas gathering. In January 2005, Dick Clark loaned his son $18,500. The loan was documented. Interest was payable. 
     
      
    21 Yet Michael Clark, and indeed members of his family, had gone to some length to please Dick Clark in the months before the murder. They had helped him clean out his workshop and flat and moved his belongings to Bexley. Ms Jessica Chung, on the other hand, had not been involved in the move. Michael Clark had done painting at Bexley to make it ready for his father. He had also done work on another home owned by Ms Chung at Carlton. 
     
      
    22 Further evidence was given by a witness, David Seckold, of a conversation with Michael Clark several months before the murder. According to Mr Seckold, Michael Clark said that he wished his father was dead. He referred to him as “a tight old prick”. The Asian lady was draining all his father’s money. 
     
      
    23 Mr Seckold was cross examined at some length. His evidence must be approached with caution. There had been a falling out between Mr Clark and Mr Seckold after a failed business venture. I accept that he had ill feeling towards Michael Clark. There was a suggestion that Michael Clark had disclosed to Mr Seckold’s wife that her husband was seeing another woman. There were also aspects of Mr Seckold’s evidence which were unreliable. Nonetheless, there was corroboration of the conversation that he recounted, suggesting ill will on the part of Michael Clark towards his father. The corroboration was provided by a recording made as a result of a listening device which captured a conversation between Michael Clark and his wife Jennifer. 
     
      
    24 I return to the issue raised by the Crown submissions. Was Michael Clark’s motive, in being party to a joint enterprise to murder his father, simply the money which he stood to inherit under his father’s Will? Should the crime, as the Crown suggests, be characterised as the equivalent to a contract killing? Unquestionably money was part of Mr Clark’s motivation. However, it was more complex than that. Michael Clark and his father shared a long history. There was, I believe, an emotional dimension to Michael Clark’s actions. Although there had been improvements in their relationship, I infer that there were still undercurrents of resentment and dissatisfaction, each towards the other. Michael Clark’s criminality was not that of a contract killer. 
     
      
    25 The offence plainly involved some planning and premeditation. The Crown drew attention to a feature of aggravation arising from a recent amendment to the Act. By reason of s 21A(2)(eb) of the Act, it is a matter of aggravation if the offence was committed in the home of the victim. The amendment operates in respect of a conviction after 1 January 2008, whenever the offence was committed (cl 57 of Sch 2 of the Act). It is clear from the Second Reading Speech (Hansard p2667) that the circumstance of aggravation apply, even where the assailant was invited by the victim into his home. The intention is that individuals should be entitled to feel safe from harm of any kind within their own home. 
     
      
    26 Let me move from the offence to the offender. 
     
      
       
      The subjective case. 
       
      
    27 Michael Clark was born on 15 February 1963. He is 45 years old. According to a history given to Mr Watson-Munro, a psychologist, who saw him for the purposes of preparing a report for the sentencing hearing, Mr Clark was raised in foster homes before he was adopted by Dick Clark and his wife. His adoptive parents separated soon after his adoption. He remained for a time with Mrs Clark. His father had, in the meantime, remarried. Michael Clark, at the age of about 14, went to live with his father and his new wife. She already had a child. There was considerable conflict between Michael Clark and his stepbrother, whom he believed was favoured both by his stepmother and his father. He began taking drugs and left school early. 
     
      
    28 In 1981, at the age of 18 years, he was a passenger in a motor vehicle which collided with a pole at high speed. He was seriously injured. He was admitted to hospital in a coma and remained unconscious for about two weeks. He stayed in hospital for four months and then underwent rehabilitation over a period of a further eight months. A neuropsychological assessment by the Wentworth Area Health Service in 2000 stated that Mr Clark had sustained severe brain injury. An MRI demonstrated extensive abnormality to the left frontal and left temporal lobes and less severe abnormality to the right frontal lobe. There was severe damage to the left optic nerve, such that Mr Clark became totally blind in the left eye. 
     
      
    29 In 1995 Mr Clark developed frontal lobe epilepsy. He takes extensive medication. According to the medical evidence tendered at the trial, confirmed by the report of Mr Watson-Munro, Mr Clark suffers difficulty with his memory and an impairment of information processing, as well as anxiety. Mr Watson-Munro also stated that he had poor impulse control. He has periodically suffered from depression. It was also said that he back problems arising from the motor vehicle accident. 
     
      
    30 A statement was tendered by Mr Clark’s wife. In that statement she said that her husband had been diagnosed on 12 September 2007 with a serious liver complaint involving the left lobe and an enlarged spleen. Mrs Clark said that it had been necessary for him to undergo some form of chemotherapy. Although I would have welcomed a neurological assessment of Mr Clark’s condition, rather than a psychologist’s report, and a report from his treating doctor in respect of the liver complaint, I accept that Mr Clark suffers from a number of significant disabilities. As to his intellectual function, he presented as an intelligent and forceful personality. However, I do not doubt that he has difficulties with his memory and other significant disabilities. 
     
      
    31 Returning to Mr Clark’s history, after the motor vehicle accident he accumulated a significant criminal record. He was convicted of various offences of dishonesty in the years immediately following. He was not, at that point, sent to gaol, but was fined or placed upon a bond. In November 1984, he was convicted of a number of drug offences and fined. In March 1986, he was sentenced to three months imprisonment for stealing and false pretences. Later the same year, a six month term of imprisonment was imposed for false pretences, various drug offences and escaping from lawful custody. On 17 April 1989, Mr Clark was convicted of armed robbery, shooting with intent to prevent lawful apprehension, and assault and robbery with an offensive weapon. On the charge of armed robbery, he was sentenced to seven years imprisonment with a non parole period of four and a half years. Lesser concurrent terms were imposed in respect of the other offences. One gathers that Mr Clark had been in custody since 6 May 1988 and was released some time in 1991. He has had no convictions since his release, apart from a minor assault in 1994. 
     
      
    32 However, the Crown drew attention to a conversation in July 2005 recorded by listening device. Mr Clark was speaking with his wife. In the course of the conversation, he acknowledged having committed various offences since his release from gaol, which had not been detected. He had therefore not been charged. The relevance of that conversation, as I understand the Crown’s submissions, is in respect of Mr Clark’s prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    33 Clearly, Mr Clark is not entitled to any leniency. On the question of rehabilitation, his wife provided a lengthy statement in which she described other aspects of her husband’s character, including the significant work that he had performed within the community. I accept that he has done useful work in the community and that that is also relevant to his prospects of rehabilitation. I should mention, however, that there is no remorse. Mr Clark insists that he is innocent. 
     
      
       
      A life sentence? 
       
      
    34 Against that background, I return to the Crown’s submission that the offence should be characterised as being in the worst category. It was submitted by the Crown that the level of culpability of Mr Clark was so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence, could only be met through the imposition of a life sentence (s 61(1) of the Act). My attention was drawn to the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; (2006) 164 A Crim R 126 at para [23], where his Honour conveniently set out the principles to be applied when determining whether an offence should be characterised as coming within the worst class of case. 
     
      
    35 However, for the reasons stated, the circumstances giving rise to the offence are far more complex than simple greed. I believe the offence arose, in part, from the relationship between Mr Clark and his father. I also believe the motor vehicle accident suffered by Mr Clark many years before, and the disabilities arising from it, were not irrelevant. Without diminishing the callous and brutal nature of this crime, which was certainly committed partly for financial gain, and with no regard to the sanctity of human life, I believe that a determinate sentence is appropriate, rather than a life sentence. 
     
      
    36 The Crown submitted, in the alternative, that if the offence were not in the worst category, then it was not far below that category. The offence is subject to s 54D of the Act. That section introduced a standard non parole period of 20 years for murder where the offence could be characterised as being “in the middle of the range of objective seriousness”. The objective seriousness of the offence must therefore be evaluated in accordance with R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 and MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93, at paras [32]-[33], determining whether there are reasons for departing from the standard, whether by increasing it or reducing it. 
     
      
    37 Here, there can be little doubt that the offence involved criminality on the part of this offender well above the mid range of objective seriousness. On the other hand, Mr Clark has significant physical disabilities which will certainly make any sentence imposed more onerous for him. He is not physically robust and is disabled in a variety of ways. 
     
      
    38 Counsel for Mr Clark also submitted that there was an issue of parity, or at least proportionality (Postiglione v The Queen [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295), arising from the sentence imposed upon the other person involved in the same joint enterprise, namely Ben Clark. Ben Clark was, as I have said, imprisoned for 20 years with a non parole period of 14 years. There was no Crown appeal. Counsel immediately acknowledged that there were significant differences between Michael Clark and his son Ben. Ben was 21 years old when the offence was committed. His father was 42 years old. Ben had pleaded guilty and had received a 15 to 20 percent discount. His father pleaded not guilty and went to trial. Ben had no criminal convictions. His father, Michael Clark, had an extensive criminal history. Nonetheless, it was submitted that Ben’s sentence was relevant.  
     
      
    39 I accept that there is an issue of proportionality, even though there are such obvious differences between Michael Clark and Ben Clark, that there can be no parity. Ben Clark’s sentence serves, to some degree, to moderate the sentence that may otherwise be thought appropriate in respect of Michael Clark.  
     
      
    40 Turning to the prospects of rehabilitation, the sentence I must impose will necessarily be lengthy. Taking account of Mr Clark’s likely age when released to parole, and the other circumstances of this case, including the matters mentioned by his wife, I believe that, notwithstanding his criminal record, his prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable. 
     
      
    41 I have, as required by s 44(2) of the Act, given consideration to the relationship between the term of the sentence and the non parole period. The parole period is less than that suggested by the Statute, but sufficient, in my view, in terms of the supervision which Mr Clark will require. The sentence should commence on the date that Mr Clark was taken into custody, namely, 21 July 2005. 
     
      
    42 Murder has always been regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar. Absent extraordinary circumstances, it calls for a substantial sentence to serve the interests of punishment, including denunciation and general deterrence. Here, the formulation and execution of a plan by Michael Clark to murder his own father, through the instrument of his son, in cold blood, obviously places this crime at the more serious end of the scale. Dick Clark was the much loved partner of Ms Jessica Chung, the brother of Marie Gilbert and the friend of many. I have before me statements from Ms Chung and Mrs Gilbert, which were read in open court. They are a poignant reminder of the horror of this crime, made worse by the gradual realisation that it had been committed by the deceased’s adopted son and grandson. The sympathy of the Court is extended to Ms Jessica Chung and Mrs Gilbert and other family members. I must, of course, deal with this material in a manner consistent with R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 85. 
     
      
    43 Michael Rex CLARK, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment made up of a non parole period of 24 years commencing on 21 July 2005 and expiring on 20 July 2029 with a balance of term of 6 years ending on 20 July 2035. Accordingly, the first date upon which you will be eligible for parole is 20 July 2029. The total sentence therefore involves a term of 30 years expiring on 20 July 2035 with a non parole period of 24 years.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The first plaintiff, Amin Boumelhem, was a director of the second plaintiff, Leisure Coast Tobacconist & Giftware Pty Ltd, and carried on its business in the wholesale and retail sale and distribution of tobacco products. The business became one of the subjects of an investigation by the first defendant, the New South Wales Crime Commission, into the alleged evasion of the payment of tobacco licence fees under the Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) Act 1987 (the Tobacco Act). On 28 October 1996, Mr Boumelhem was arrested and charged with conspiring to cheat and defraud the Office of State Revenue of New South Wales. On the same day, search warrants were executed at his private residence and at premises used for the conduct of the business. Business records and a large quantity of tobacco products were seized.  
     
      
    2 On 5 August 1997, the High Court delivered a judgment in which relevant provisions of the Tobacco Act were declared invalid on the basis that they purported to impose an excise, contrary to s90 of the Constitution: Ha v State of New South Wales & Ors (1997) 189 CLR 465. As a result, the prosecution moved to have the charge against Mr Boumelhem dismissed. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiffs instituted proceedings in this Court seeking damages arising from steps taken in the course of the investigation. By an amended statement of claim filed on 27 August 2007, Mr Boumelhem seeks damages for false arrest, false imprisonment and financial loss. The company seeks damages for loss of stock in trade, profits, and loss of business. Both plaintiffs claim damages for the detention of the items seized as a result of the searches, and a declaration that the search warrants were invalid at the time of their issue.  
     
      
    4 Apart from the Crime Commission, two police officers were joined as the second and third defendants, an officer of the Office of State Revenue as the fourth defendant, and the State of New South Wales as the fifth defendant. The second and third defendants arrested Mr Boumelhem and were involved in the searches. The fourth defendant was the inspector under the Tobacco Act dealing with the matter. The State of New South Wales was joined as the fifth defendant on the basis that it is vicariously liable for the wrongs alleged to have been done by the other defendants.  
     
      
    5 The current form of the statement of claim is the result of interlocutory proceedings before Studdert J, in which his Honour gave judgment on 19 December 2006 and on 27 June 2007. It is not necessary to examine the course of those proceedings or the orders his Honour made concerning the statement of claim. However, on 27 June 2007 his Honour also ordered that there be a decision on the following questions before the determination of the remaining issues in the case: 
     
      
       
        
        1) Were the search warrants invalid as at the date of their issue? 
         
         
        2) Was the warrant for the arrest of Mr Boumelhem invalid as at the date of its issue? 
        
       
      
    6 It was the resolution of these questions which came before me. As a result of a settlement reached between the plaintiffs and the fourth and fifth defendants since I reserved judgment in the matter, the second question need no longer be answered. It is only the validity of the search warrants which I must decide. On both questions, I heard argument from Mr Horsley, counsel for the plaintiffs, and from Mr Temby QC, who appeared with Mr Buscombe for the second, fourth and fifth defendants. The first defendant, the Crime Commission, did not seek to be heard separately, although the validity of the warrants bears upon its case. The third defendant, one of the police officers, has never been served with the statement of claim.  
     
      
    7 Obviously, a crucial part of the plaintiffs’ case is that the seizure of property from the private and business premises was unlawful, and the resolution of that question turns upon the validity of the search warrants. It is necessary to examine the statutory scheme by which the Crime Commission’s investigation was undertaken and the search warrants were issued. It will then be necessary to determine whether in the present case that investigative process was relevantly affected by the High Court’s decision in Ha.  
     
      
    8 The Crime Commission is constituted by the New South Wales Crime Commission Act 1985. Section 24 of that Act creates a Management Committee. By s25(1)(a), one of the functions of that Committee is to refer “matters relating to relevant criminal activities to the Commission for investigation”. “Relevant criminal activity” is defined in s3 as “any circumstances implying, or any allegations, that a relevant offence may have been, or may be being, or may be about to be, committed”. The term “relevant offence” is also defined so as to include (as the Act stood at the relevant time) an offence “that involves substantial planning and organisation and that involves, or is of a kind that ordinarily involves, the use of sophisticated methods and techniques”.  
     
      
    9 The investigation in the present case was initiated by a reference to the Commission under s25(1)(a). By s6(1)(a), one of the principal functions of the Commission is to conduct such an investigation. I shall examine the terms of the reference shortly.  
     
      
    10 Section 11 provides for search warrants, enabling a member of the Commission to apply for such a warrant to a justice authorised under the Search Warrants Act 1985. Relevantly, subs(2)(a) enables such an application if the Commission has reasonable grounds for suspecting that “there may be in or on any premises a thing or things of a particular kind connected with a matter relating to a relevant criminal activity, being a matter into which the Commission is conducting an investigation …”. By subs(3), the justice may issue a warrant authorising a police officer or other person to enter the premises and to search for and seize any such things. It was under that provision that the search warrants in the present case were issued and executed.  
     
      
    11 Paragraph 2 of the reference to the Commission describes the subject matter of the investigation as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        2. The allegations constituting the relevant criminal activity are that persons engaged in tobacco wholesaling or tobacco retailing in New South Wales may have committed, may be committing or may be about to commit offences that involve substantial planning and organisation and the use of sophisticated methods and techniques. 
        
       
       
        
        The offences arise from participation in schemes designed to evade the payment of large sums by way of tobacco licence fees under the  
        Business Franchises Licences (Tobacco) Act 
         1987, and the concealment of such evasion. 
        
       
       
        
        The offences include: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) making false statements to the prejudice of the Crown and the public revenue with intent to defraud (common law offence); 
         
         
        (b) conspiracy to defraud (common law offence); 
         
         
        (c) falsification of company books with intent to defraud (section 175  
        Crimes Act 
         1900); 
         
         
        (d) act with intent to cheat or defraud the Chief Commissioner for Business Franchise Licences (Tobacco) (section 176A  
        Crimes Act 
         1900); and  
         
         
        (e) money laundering (section 73  
        Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 
         1989). 
        
       
      
    12 The application for the search warrants complied with s11(2)(a), setting out the necessary suspicion entertained by the Commission and what were said to be the reasonable grounds for it. A copy of the reference was attached to it. Also attached was a statement by Detective Senior Sergeant P K Nolan, which contained the information upon which the application was based. Section 11(5)(a) requires a search warrant issued under the section to include “a statement of the purpose for which the warrant is issued, which shall include a reference to the matter relating to a relevant criminal activity into which the Commission is conducting an investigation and with which the things of the relevant kind are connected”. In compliance with that provision, the search warrants concluded with a statement of the nature of the Commission’s investigation derived from paragraph 2 of the reference.  
     
      
    13 Subject to the decision in Ha, there was no issue that each of the offences specified in the reference could be a “relevant offence” for the purposes of the Act and that the conduct alleged could amount to a relevant criminal activity. As I have said, the charge laid against Mr Boumelhem was the common law offence of conspiracy to cheat and defraud 
     
      
    14 For the plaintiffs, Mr Horsley noted that an allegation or suspicion of relevant criminal activity is basal to a reference to the Commission under s25 of a matter for investigation, as it is to the issue of a search warrant under s11. Unless an investigation can be said to relate to a relevant offence, giving rise to relevant criminal activity, it is not authorised by the Act, and a search warrant purportedly issued for the purpose of it would not be valid. In the present case, he argued, this means that the investigation must relate to alleged conduct which, if proved, would constitute a relevant offence.  
     
      
    15 He observed that the focus of the investigation was the alleged participation in schemes designed to evade payment of tobacco licence fees under the Tobacco Act, together with the concealment of that evasion. So much was apparent from Det Nolan’s statement and from the terms of the reference, the application for the search warrants and the search warrants themselves. Thus, it was participation in that evasion which would be the foundation of any offence which might be charged. Put shortly, his submission was that the conduct alleged “evaporated” as an offence “with the invalidation of the imposts” under the Tobacco Act by the High Court’s decision. 
     
      
    16 He relied upon the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Eid [1999] NSWCCA 59, (1999) 46 NSWLR 116. It is unnecessary to explain the procedural steps whereby that matter came before the Court. It is sufficient to say that the decision turned upon whether or not a warrant issued by a judge of this Court under the Listening Devices Act 1984 (since repealed) was valid. The warrant was expressed to have been issued for the purpose of investigating an offence of conspiracy to defraud, involving conduct leading to loss of revenue to the State of New South Wales. It was common ground that the investigation was into the evasion of licence fees under the Tobacco Act, so that the suspected offence was similar to that charged in the present case. The warrant was issued a little over a year before the decision in Ha. 
     
      
    17 The conspiracy charge was a “prescribed offence” for the purposes of the Listening Devices Act, and s16(1)(a) authorised the issue of a warrant upon application by a person who suspected or believed that a prescribed offence“has been, is about to be or is likely to be committed”. Adams J, with whom Abadee and Barr JJ agreed, referred to the High Court’s decision that the legislation imposing the licence fees was invalid, and said at [9]: 
     
      
       
        
        The effect of the invalidity may be shortly stated; since the State of New South Wales was not entitled to any licence fee, an agreement by persons so to arrange things (even dishonestly) that such a fee was not payable could not deprive the State of anything. 
        
       
      
    18 Thus, there was no prescribed offence which could have founded the issue of a valid warrant. That was so even though the warrant was issued before the High Court’s decision, because that Court’s conclusion meant that the legislation was void ab initio. Adams J (at [12]) referred to the following passage from the judgment of McHugh JA (as he then was) in Peters v Attorney General (NSW) (1988) 16 NSWLR 24 at 38: 
     
      
       
        
        The effect of an unconstitutional statute has not been authoritatively determined by the High Court. In  
        South Australia v The Commonwealth 
         (1942) 65 CLR 373 at 408, however, Latham CJ said: ""…The law is not valid until a court pronounces against it - and thereafter invalid. If it is beyond power it is invalid  
        ab initio 
        .”  
        
       
       
      After citing American cases and later Australian authority, McHugh JA observed (at 39) that “Australian constitutional theory seems to have generally proceeded upon the void  
      ab initio 
       doctrine"". 
       
      
    19 Approaching the question of the validity of the listening device warrant in that way, Adams J concluded at [14]: 
     
      
       
        
        I am of the view that the effect of the decision of the High Court in  
        Ha  
        declaring the Act invalid meant that it was invalid at the time of the issue of the warrant. It follows that the warrant was sought to investigate activities which were not contrary to the law. The warrant was therefore not authorised by the Act. 
        
       
      
    20 Mr Horsley submitted that the present case is determined by the reasoning in Eid, and that that case is not relevantly distinguishable. The retrospective effect of the decision in Ha, he said, is that the conduct the subject of the Commission’s investigation was not criminal. He referred to the five offences specified in paragraph 2 of the reference, quoted above, and noted that the first four of them required proof of defrauding or intent to defraud. Those elements could not be established because, to adopt the words of Adams J, “the State of New South Wales was not entitled to any licence fee”. The fifth offence, money laundering, required proof that the offender knew the money to be “proceeds of a serious offence”: s73(3) of the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crime Act 1989. For the same reason, the commission of a “serious offence” could not be established.  
     
      
    21 For the defendants, Mr Temby argued that Eid is distinguishable from the present case because of the terms of the legislation involved. By virtue of s16(1)(a) of the Listening Devices Act, the issue of a warrant under that Act was contingent upon suspicion that a specified offence had been committed. The effect of the decision in Ha was that the conduct alleged could not amount to that offence. Section 11 of the New South Wales Crime Commission Act does not require the allegation of a specific offence as the foundation for the issue of a search warrant. All that is required by subs (2) is the suspicion that there may be on premises a thing or things connected with a relevant criminal activity which the Commission is investigating. I have referred earlier to the broad definition of “relevant criminal activity”, which embraces “any circumstances implying,” or “any allegations” of, the commission of a relevant offence. The term “relevant offence”, as it bears on this case, is itself broadly defined.  
     
      
    22 As Mr Temby put it, consistently with the scheme of the legislation, the reference to the Commission under s25 of the Act did not assume that any particular offence had been committed but, rather, required the Commission to investigate whether any offence or offences had been, or were to be, committed. Paragraph 3 of the reference is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        3 The general purpose of the investigation is to:  
         
         
        (a) investigate the allegations; 
         
         
        (b) determine whether relevant offences have been committed, are being committed, or may be about to be committed; 
         
         
        (c) identify offenders; and 
         
         
        (d) assemble evidence that would be admissible in the prosecution of any such offenders for relevant offences, and furnish such evidence to the Director of Public Prosecutions. 
        
       
      
    23 Mr Temby pointed out that the five specific offences referred to in paragraph 2 of the reference were not intended to be exhaustive. The investigation might have uncovered the commission of other offences, falling within the definition of “relevant offence”, proof of which did not depend on the validity of the relevant provisions of the Tobacco Act. A scheme for the evasion of license fees, he said, might have involved persons making false statutory declarations, an offence under s25 of the Oaths Act. False documentation might have been created to avoid the payment of license fees, which could have constituted an offence under s178BB of the Crimes Act of making false statements with intent to obtain a financial advantage or, possibly, the offences of making or using false instruments under s300 of that Act.  
     
      
    24 In that context, he referred to certain parts of Det Nolan’s statement which alleged conduct incidental to a scheme to evade payment of the licence fees which could amount to criminal offences. It was said that false declarations had been made, and false and misleading documentation had been supplied, to the Customs Service. It was also said that police had seized a large sum of money received by a person in connection with the scheme, that that person had been charged with goods in custody as a result of that seizure, and that there was a plan to produce false documents to the police in an attempt to recover that money.  
     
      
    25 Mr Temby emphasised that he was not reliant upon that material to make good his argument. His principal submission was that, although the focus of the Commission’s investigation was the alleged evasion of the licence fees, the scope of the investigation was not confined to offences of which the evasion of those fees, or the intent to evade them, was an element.  
     
      
    26 To this, Mr Horsley responded that the reference for investigation was deprived of its substratum because, as he put it, the alleged evasion of licence fees “itself turns out to be entirely lawful”. Thus, the conduct which the management committee sought to be investigated was “substantially activities that would not be offences because of the invalidity of the excise”, and the reference could not be saved by the fact that “there may be some incidental offences that one could dream up that might not be so caught”. On the view urged by Mr Temby, he argued, the Commission could undertake an investigation of an activity not suggested to be unlawful on the speculative basis that it might expose conduct in the course of that activity which amounts to a relevant offence. Of course, the argument was by way of reductio ad absurdum, but he emphasised the need for “touchstones” to impose appropriate restraint upon the Commission’s exercise of its extraordinary powers. 
     
      
    27 I appreciate the force of that argument, but I am persuaded that Mr Temby’s approach is correct. Obviously, at the time of the reference for investigation and the issue of the search warrants, the licence fees were believed to be valid and the evasion of them understood to be an offence. In the light of the High Court’s decision, it must be accepted that that is not, and never was, the case. Accordingly, the prosecution of any offence to which the validity of the licence fees was essential would be without foundation. No doubt, that is why the prosecution of Mr Boumelhem for conspiracy to cheat and defraud was terminated. Nevertheless, the prospect of an investigation of a scheme to evade the licence fees bringing to light offences which were not contingent upon the validity of the fees was by no means fanciful. Relevant offences of such a kind might have been detected. 
     
      
    28 Given the broad scope of an investigation conferred upon the Crime Commission by its enabling legislation, it cannot be said that the decision in Ha rendered the reference in the present case nugatory. For the same reason, it cannot be said that the issue of the search warrants was not an appropriate exercise of the power conferred by s11. My conclusion, then, is that the search warrants were not invalid as at the date of their issue.

   JUDGMENT1. I am going to deliver judgment now on two matters raised. The first matter is this. The indictment charges an aggravated sexual assault and charges, in the alternative as count 2, an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. When he was arraigned Mr Orlowsky pleaded not guilty to count 1, the aggravated sexual assault, but guilty to count 2, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
    2. At the commencement of the trial, the Crown Prosecutor Mr Shaw indicated that the Crown did not accept the plea of guilty to the second count. He indicated that it followed that the second count was therefore at large and before the jury. I accepted that proposition and the jury was accordingly sworn to try both matters. 
    3. On closer examination of this point at the conclusion of the Crown case, it now appears that there is a divergence of practice between some states in Australia and between some states in Australia and England. The Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book (Bench Book), published by the Judicial Commission of NSW, says that the practice in such a case should be that which is followed in England, namely the only count which goes to the jury is the count in respect of which there has been a plea of not guilty. The second count is dealt with in the following way. If there is an acquittal on the first count then the court can proceed to convict the accused on his admission on his plea and sentence him on the second count. If there is a conviction of the first count then the second count should lie on the court file. 
    4. As I said that practice, referred to in Regina v Cole [1965] 2 QB 388, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, is the subject of approval in the Bench Book.  
    5. However, a different practice exists in Victoria. That practice is outlined in two authorities referred to me by Mr Shaw. The first is Regina v Broadbent [1964] VR 733, a decision of the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria. The second is an unreported judgment of the Victorian Court of Appeal in DPP v Collins [2004] VSCA 179. In a judgment in which the Chief Justice and Ormiston J agreed, the President of the Court of Appeal pointed out the differences in practice between Victoria and England and between Victoria and South Australia. His Honour does not make any reference to the practice in New South Wales. 
    6. The practice in Victoria in circumstances which have developed in this case is that described by the Full Court in Broadbent and referred to in Collins in a judgment in which Hudson and Adam JJ agreed. Sir Norman O’Bryan said that the “most convenient way to deal with the matter is to allow the whole trial to go forward, that is, the trial on both counts.” His Honour observed that the jury can be told that it can use the admission of the plea of guilty against an accused when considering the proper verdict on the second count. His Honour said that if the court “does otherwise and withdraws the lesser charge from the jury and proceeds only with the major offence, it might be supposed that the court had in some way accepted the plea of guilty, and so afforded the accused an answer by way of autrefois convict to the major charge.” 
    7. There does seem to me to be a difference in practice amongst these various jurisdictions. Mr Allen who appears for the accused in this trial, I think endorsed by Mr Shaw, informs me that the practice in his experience in the District Court is that both charges are at large before the jury. Insofar as there is a difference in practice, it seems to me that some weight must be attached to the fact that the Bench Book in New South Wales recommends and follows the English practice without any reference to the Victorian practice.  
    8. I think it likely, if any conclusion can be reached, that the practice in New South Wales is probably reflected in the Bench Book. However, Mr Allen makes the point that now that the second count is before the jury which has been sworn to try that count, it may affect the integrity of the trial if I were to purport to withdraw it. I think that there is some force in that argument. Mr Shaw acknowledges that force as well.  
    9. Therefore, because there is authority supporting both charges being at large before the jury, namely the Victorian cases, I have determined not to withdraw count 2 in the indictment in this case from the jury for the reasons which I have given. 
    10. I turn now to the second issue which I have been asked to resolve. That is whether I should leave with the jury, as an alternative to count 1, the charge of attempting to commit aggravated sexual intercourse without consent. Mr Shaw argues that that is an available option to me and appropriately and fairly points out the arguments for and against the proposition. Mr Allen argues that I ought not to leave the alternative of an attempt to the jury because it would prejudice his client in a number of ways.  
    11. I should add that the alternative is not pleaded nor was it opened on by the Crown Prosecutor. It is an alternative which in some way developed as a result of how the trial ran. It was apparent when Mr Allen was cross-examining the complainant that there is an issue as to whether the complainant’s earlier accounts of what happened were consistent with a sexual assault which did not involve penetration but which nevertheless was an attempt at that. Mr Allen cross-examined her about that, wanting to highlight what he will argue are inconsistencies between her earlier accounts to the police (which appear not to involve an allegation of penetration) and later accounts to the police and to this court (which do involve an allegation of penetration). 
    12. Mr Shaw argues that in favour of leaving the alternative is that it is available on the evidence if the jury determines to accept part of the complainant’s evidence but reject another part. He points out that although he did not open on it, it has been raised appropriately before the closing addresses and I agree with that. He argues that there is no prejudice to the accused because his case is that there was no sexual contact at all, so that Mr Allen’s cross-examination would have been the same, whether it was opened on or not. He also argues that, as a general rule, issue is joined on any alternative implied in the main charge. He acknowledges the arguments against, including the fact that he did not open on it and that the jury may be confused by the notion of accepting that part of the complainant’s evidence where she gave an account which fell short of penetration and rejecting the account given later where she included penetration. 
    13. Mr Allen’s arguments raising prejudice are these. Had the alternative of attempt been opened on in the first place, then he would have been far more cautious in cross-examining the complainant about her earlier statements. He cross-examined her on these statements, as I said, in order to highlight what he will argue are inconsistencies which will affect her credit. He says that if he had known that the alternative of attempt was at large before the jury then he would have been far more cautious in exploring that area with the complainant. 
    14. A second prejudice he says is that this is a case where the issue is straightforward. The jury has to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the complainant’s assertion that sexual intercourse occurred. His client, so far in the Crown case in a record of interview, says that no such sexual contact occurred at all. Leaving an alternative of attempt would, he says in the circumstances of that case, raise the likelihood of a compromise verdict between the two extremes. 
    15. I regard Mr Allen’s arguments as persuasive. In my view he has pointed to two very real and potential sources of prejudice to his client. The Crown Prosecutor has very fairly indicated that he raised the issue because it was always open to me as the trial judge to take the view that I should leave the alternative to the jury and he has drawn my attention to the relevant considerations.  
    16. I have determined not to leave the alternative to the jury because of the potential prejudice to Mr Allen’s client.

       Khaled Cheikho & Ors v Regina 
       
      FACTS 
       
      The applicants face charges of conspiracy to commit acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts under the  
      Criminal Code Act 
       1995 (Cth). One element of the offence is the commission of at least one overt act in pursuance of the conspiracy. The Crown seeks to prove as an overt act that one of the accused downloaded certain documents on the telecommunications service linked to the applicant Cheikho. 
       
       
      The manner of proof of these documents is in issue. The Crown seeks to tender a certificate, issued by the telecommunications carrier Optus, pursuant to s 18(2) of the  
      Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 
       1979 (Cth). The certificate outlines what acts Optus employees performed in order to enable listening and recording at ASIO of the telecommunications service, pursuant to and during the period of a valid warrant. This certificate has the effect of being conclusive evidence of the facts stated in the certificate both on the issue of admissibility and before the jury. 
       
       
      The certificate replaces an earlier certificate which contained assertions of fact that were arguably inconsistent which could give rise to an issue of illegality pertaining to admissibility. 
       
       
      The applicants challenged s 18(2) of the  
      Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 
       1979 (Cth) as being contrary to ss 71, 77 and 80 of the  
      Constitution,  
      and on the basis that it is not possible to challenge the legality of the interception on the basis that the certificate conclusively establishes a step in the chain of evidence to prove an overt act. The trial judge determined that the section was constitutionally valid. The applicants seek leave to appeal pursuant to s 5F of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912.

      Jurisdiction 
       
       
      (Spigelman CJ, Barr and Fullerton JJ agreeing) 
       
       
      1 Rulings on the admissibility of evidence in advance of a trial do not constitute a judgment or order within the meaning of s 5F of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912. [22] [191] [192] 
       
       
        
        R v Steffan

        R v F 
         [2002] NSWCCA 125; (2002) 129 A Crim R 126 cited. 
        
       
       
      2 The ruling of the trial judge is not only a step in making a ruling on evidence. The constitutional issue, and the effect of s 78B and s 78A of the  
      Judiciary Act 
       1903 (Cth) transformed the nature of the matter into a ruling on the effect of the evidence in terms of its conclusiveness. [23] [25]-[27] [28] [31] [191] [192]

      Illegality issue 
       
       
      (Spigelman CJ, Barr and Fullerton JJ agreeing) 
       
       
      Separation of powers 
       
       
      3 On the “preliminary” finding of fact by Whealy J there was no illegality. [85] [86] [191] [192] 
       
       
      4 The act must be read as a whole. A statutory regime which determines what constitutes illegal conduct and restricts the ability to establish such illegality, does not interfere with the separation of powers. The Court must give full effect to the entire statutory regime which is an issue of statutory interpretation, not constitutional validity. [108] [111] [115] [191] [192] 
       
       
      5 The degree of modification of the judicial process by s 15X of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1914 (Cth), which was upheld in  
      Nicholas v The Queen 
      , is directly analogous to s 18(2) of the  
      Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 
       1979 (Cth). [96] [109] [110] [191] [192]

      Trial by jury 
       
       
      6 Only the ‘essential characteristics’ of a trial by jury are protected by s 80 of the  
      Constitution 
       where proceedings have been commenced by indictment. [62] [191] [192]

      7 The identification of the circumstances in which a judge is able to reject evidence on the ground of illegality is capable of being modified by statute, relevantly a statute that creates the illegality. This does not impinge on any of the essential characteristics of a trial by jury or of the exercise of judicial power. [114] [191] [192]

      (Spigelman CJ, Barr and Fullerton JJ agreeing) 
       
       
      8 Facts that constitute elements of the offence are essential matters which the prosecution must establish. However, this may not be an exhaustive statement of constitutionally impermissible interference with fact finding in a criminal trial. [116] [154] [168] [191] [192]

      9 It is not one of the predominant or essential characteristics of a criminal trial in an accusatory system that there be no restriction on the proof of facts or the ability to challenge facts in the Crown case. [153] [160] [191] [192]

      11 Legal professional privilege and public interest immunity are established methods of restricting evidence based on balancing of competing public interests. They are compatible with the predominant characteristics of the exercise of judicial power and with the essential characteristics of trial by jury. [161] [191] [192]

      12 In the present case, the Parliament has balanced competing public interests. It is not alien to the criminal justice system for the Parliament to identify one public interest and adopt a conclusive certificate regime to protect it. It is not offensive to the predominant or essential characteristics of the exercise of federal judicial power. [106]-[107] [165]-[167] [191] [192] 
       
       
      Granting leave 
       
       
      (Spigelman CJ, Barr and Fullerton JJ agreeing) 
       
       
      13 Leave to appeal should be refused. The facts asserted in the certificate are too far removed from the facts in issue. [186] [189] [191] [192] 
       
       
      14 With respect to the chain of evidence issue, the fact that errors have occurred in interceptions on other occasions is entitled to minimal weight. The absence of a suggestion that there was any error in the identification of the computer or the content of the download should be given significant weight in the exercise of the discretion to grant leave. [171] [174] [191] [192] 
       
       
      15 In the case of the illegality issue, the constitutional point is entitled to minimal weight. The chain of evidence issue the constitutional point is entitled to greater but not significant weight. [173] [191] [192] 
       
       
      16 The fact that the Crown agreed to a significant range of matters to which the certificate could not conclusively certify will bind the Crown during the conduct of the trial. This is an important factor in determining leave to appeal. [179]-[180] [191] [192] 
       
       
      17 If there arises any reason to doubt the content of the certificate or the illegality of the processes described in it, the trial judge has options to reconsider the matter during the course of the trial, such as s 137 of the  
      Evidence Act 
      . [175]-[177] [191] [192]

       Khaled Cheikho & Ors v Regina 
       
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The applicants seek leave to appeal, pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, from a judgment of Whealy J of 27 May 2008. The applicant, Khaled Cheikho, has filed his application in time. The other applicants require an extension of time. The issue is the same in each case. Time should be extended. 
     
      
    2 Each of the applicants face charges under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Commonwealth Criminal Code”), alleging participation in a conspiracy to commit acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts, as defined in the Commonwealth Criminal Code.  
     
      
    3 The relevant provisions of the Commonwealth Criminal Code and a summary of the Crown case are set out by Whealy J. I proceed as if pars [4]-[20] of his Honour’s judgment were set out herein.  
     
      
    4 For present purposes it is pertinent to emphasise that one of the elements of a charge of conspiracy under s 11.5 of the Code is that: 
     
      
       
        
        “11.5(2)(c) the person or at least one other party to the agreement must have committed an overt act pursuant to the agreement.” 
        
       
       
      The Certificates 
       
      
    5 The issue now before the Court was raised on the voir dire being conducted by his Honour in the course of determining a range of pre-trial issues in the proceedings.  
     
      
    6 This application turns on s 18(2) of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) “the TIA”. Pursuant to the provisions of that Act, warrants may be issued for the interception of telecommunications.  
     
      
    7 Section 18 of the TIA makes provision for evidentiary certificates which are of conclusive effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “18 Evidentiary certificates 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The Managing Director or secretary of a carrier may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out such facts as he or she considers relevant with respect to acts or things done by, or in relation to, employees of the carrier in order to enable a warrant to be executed. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) A document purporting to be a certificate issued under subsection (1) and purporting to be signed by the Managing Director or secretary of a carrier is to be received in evidence in an exempt proceeding without further proof and is, in an exempt proceeding, conclusive evidence of the matters stated in the document.” 
        
       
      
    8 The application before Whealy J sought the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. A declaration that section 18(2)  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 
         1979 is unconstitutional either as violating the separation of powers embodied in Chapter III of the Constitution, or as violating the right to a jury trial guaranteed by section 80 of the Constitution. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Consequently, an order excluding the evidence purportedly given by Paul O’Brien in respect of telecommunications service subar@optusnet.com.au, dated: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) 31 August 2005; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) 6 September 2004; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) 3 March 2005; and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) 3 June 2004 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        as being irrelevant or otherwise as hearsay.” 
        
       
      
    9 The certificate tendered before Whealy J and proposed to be tendered at trial, is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. A true redacted copy of a warrant issued on 3 June 2004 by the Attorney-General, authorising the interception of telecommunication services, is annexed and marked with the letter ‘A’ (‘the warrant’). 
        
       
       
        
        2. Optus was informed of the issuing of the warrant on 3 June 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        3. A certified copy of the warrant was received by an employee of Optus on 3 August 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Between the period commencing on 3 June 2004 and ending on 7 September 2004, Optus employees did acts and things of a professional and technical nature that were necessary to enable the listening to and recording at the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) of the communications conducted using telecommunication service (02) 97073250 as they passed through the Optus network within one or two seconds of the communication being sent from the computer terminal. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Each communication passing over the telecommunication service specified in the warrant was transmitted directly to ASIO, without at any time being recorded or listened to by any Optus employee. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The equipment used by employees of Optus to facilitate the interception of communications enabled the recording by ASIO of the following information in relation to each communication: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          - the time and date of the communication; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          -  
          the direction of the communication ; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          - the content of the communication.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 The certificate before the Court replaced an earlier certificate that had been cancelled. The original certificate said, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “4. Between the period commencing on 3 June 2004 and ending on 7 September 2004, Optus employees did acts and things of a professional and technical nature that were necessary to intercept in real time the telecommunications service specified in the warrant which is annexed and marked with the letter A. Each communication was conducted using telecommunication service 0297073250 and was intercepted as it passed through the Optus network within one or two seconds of the communication being sent from the computer terminal. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The equipment used by employees to intercept each communication recorded the following information in relation to each communication: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            the time and date of the communication; 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            the direction of the communication; and 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            the content of the communication. 
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        6. The information which was recorded from the intercepted communications in relation to the warrant issues on ( 
        date 
        ) as set out in paragraph 5 was periodically supplied in a process established by Optus employees to employees of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation.” 
        
       
      
    11 The final certificate is in a distinctively different form in a number of respects. Four matters are of particular relevance. First, the contrast between original paragraph 4, which stated that Optus employees performed acts “necessary to intercept” the service and the final paragraph 4, which stated that the acts done were those “necessary to enable the listening to and recording at ASIO”. Secondly, there is a similar contrast between the reference to “recorded” in the original paragraph 6 and the addition of the words “enabled the recording by ASIO” in the final paragraph 5. Thirdly, the contrast between paragraph 5 of the final certificate and paragraph 6 of the original certificate in that the final certificate refers to the communication being “transmitted directly to ASIO” whereas the original certificate referred to the communications being “periodically supplied to ASIO”. Fourthly, the final paragraph 5 asserts, for the first time, that the communications were not recorded or listened to by an Optus employee.  
     
      
    12 In his Judgment Whealy J identified the effect of the new certificate as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[30] The February 2007 certificate has since been ‘revoked’ by Mr O’Brien and the new certificate has issued. The complaint made by Khaled Cheikho is that, arguably at least, the facts conclusively proved in the new certificate are substantially at variance with, or indeed contradictory of, the facts stated in the earlier certificate. The accused is, however, confronted by the provisions of s 18(2) which make the facts stated in the certificate to be tendered conclusive evidence of the matters stated therein.” 
        
       
       
      Issues on the Appeal 
       
      
    13 If leave is granted, the applicants intend to appeal on two grounds, alleging that the conclusive evidence provision in s 18(2) of the TIA violates ss 71, 77 and/or 80 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth, by: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “(i) Preventing or limiting enquiry into the legality of the interception conducted pursuant to the Act 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) Depriving the jury of the capacity to doubt the transmission of communications purportedly intercepted, pursuant to the Act for purposes, inter alia, of determining the existence of an overt act, relied upon by the Crown in it’s case statement.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 It is convenient to refer to these alternative bases for constitutional invalidity as the illegality issue and the chain of evidence issue. 
     
      
    15 The first basis, if upheld, could lead to the exclusion of the certificate from evidence, subject to the formulation of a statutory judgement or the exercise of a discretion. 
     
      
    16 The second basis, if upheld, would lead to the exclusion of the certificate from evidence or, if s 18(2) could be read down pursuant to s 15A of the Act Interpretation Act 1901, to reduce its effect from conclusive to prima facie evidence. 
     
      
    17 Detailed submissions have been made on behalf of the applicants on the issue of the constitutional validity of s 18(2) of the TIA. The Crown submits that the decision of Whealy J is not a “judgment or order” within s 5F. Alternatively, the Crown objects to leave to appeal being granted. The Attorney General of the Commonwealth has intervened on the constitutional issue if leave to appeal is granted. The factual basis of this application focused on the case of the accused, Khaled Cheikho. It was not suggested that the case of any other applicant differs in a material respect. 
     
      
    18 During the course of submissions attention focused on the particular content of the certificates here in question. It is pertinent to note that neither before Whealy J, nor in this Court, was there any attack on the certificate as going beyond the statute and being therefore invalid. There were references in submissions to the effect that, perhaps, certain statements were not authorised by s 18(2). That is not a matter before this Court.  
     
      
    19 If the certificate does not answer the statutory description then the appropriate relief is not a declaration of constitutional invalidity. The phrase found in s 18(2), with respect to a document “purporting to be a certificate”, may not prove to be as protective as it appears at first sight. (See Batterham v QSR Ltd [2006] HCA 23; (2006) 225 CLR 237 at [26].) 
     
      
    20 For purposes of determining the constitutional validity of a conclusive evidence certificate it is necessary to focus on the terminology of the legislation which the appellants contend is constitutionally invalid, rather than upon the terms of the particular certificate.  
     
      
    21 The content of the certificate and its effect on the particular proceedings may have implications for constitutional issues raised. Furthermore, the content and effect will be of particular significance in determining whether leave to appeal should be granted. 
     
      
       
      The Court’s Jurisdiction 
       
      
    22 Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, confers jurisdiction on this Court to hear and determine applications for leave to appeal from “an interlocutory judgment or order.” There is a well established line of authority that rulings on evidence in advance of trial do not constitute a judgment or order within the meaning of the section. (See R v Steffan (1993) 30 NSWLR 633 at 636A-C, 639B-640B; R v Bozatsis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 302, 304; R v F [2002] NSWCCA 125; (2002) 129 A Crim R 126 at [10], [17].) 
     
      
    23 The issues agitated before Whealy J and in this Court are related to both the admissibility and the effect of evidence. The issue of illegality raised in these proceedings is clearly related to admissibility. However, the constitutional challenge goes beyond admissibility to encompass the effect of the evidence in terms of its conclusiveness. 
     
      
    24 The orders sought by the applicants before Whealy J, set out at par [8] above, were first a declaration that s 18(2) of the TIA was unconstitutional and secondly, an order excluding the certificate from evidence. As expressed, the order was consequential upon the declaration.  
     
      
    25 Matters of this character must be determined as a question of substance and not of form. The fact that the appellants sought a declaration in terms is not conclusive. However, the fact that the declaration raised a constitutional question is of significance. Such a step has consequences which, in my opinion, transform the nature of the application from merely a ruling on evidence.  
     
      
    26 First, by force of s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), where a matter arising under the Constitution or involving its interpretation has arisen, the Court is obliged not to proceed unless notice has been given to the Attorneys General of the Commonwealth and of the States and s 78B(2) confers certain procedural powers on the Court.  
     
      
    27 Furthermore, by force of s 78A(1) of the Judiciary Act, the Attorney General of the Commonwealth, or of a State, is empowered to intervene in proceedings when such an issue has been raised. Where such intervention occurs the Attorney is taken to be a party to the proceedings for purposes of the institution and prosecution of an appeal by s 78A(3). (Cheeseman v Waters (1997) 77 FCR 221 at 226-227; Peacock v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission [2005] FCAFC 45 at [75]; and United States Tobacco Co v Minister for Consumer Affairs (1988) 20 FCR 520 at 534.) 
     
      
    28 The intervention of additional parties alters the nature of the lis so that it is no longer inter partes. These statutory provisions change the nature of the dispute from a ruling on the admissibility of evidence, even if the issue to be determined is, so far as the direct parties are concerned, only a stepping stone in an argument concerning the admissibility of evidence. 
     
      
    29 I am reinforced in this view by the fact that it is not necessarily the case, if constitutional invalidity is identified, that this will lead to the second order sought, ie the exclusion of the evidence. One of the options available to the Court, when a constitutional issue is raised, is to read down the provision.  
     
      
    30 In the present case, a possible, perhaps probable, outcome of the Court upholding any of the constitutional submissions of the applicants would be to read down s 18(2) of the TIA by eliminating the word “conclusive”. The certificate would still be admissible in evidence, but its effect would be no more than to shift a burden of an evidentiary or of a persuasive kind (it is unnecessary to determine which) to the defence.  
     
      
    31 Section 15A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) requires the Court to construe Commonwealth legislation, where that is possible, so that it remains a valid enactment to the extent to which it is not in excess of the legislative power of the Commonwealth. Assuming, without needing to decide, that such a reading down was appropriate in the present case, the option highlights the fact that the constitutional argument raised in the present proceedings constitutes a distinct lis. It is not appropriate to characterise it only as a step in making a ruling on evidence. 
     
      
    32 The decision of Whealy J was a judicial act that determined an identifiable and separate part of the proceedings, namely the constitutional validity of s 18(2) of the TIA. (See Steffan supra at 636A; R v RAG [2006] NSWCCA 343 at [15].) In my opinion, there is a “judgment or order” within s 5F. 
     
      
    33 I will deal further below with the issue of whether this Court should grant leave. An important consideration in determining that issue is to identify precisely how the tender of the certificate may impinge on the course of the trial. The issue of leave will also be affected by which, if any, of the applicants’ constitutional arguments is upheld. 
     
      
       
      The Reasons of Whealy J 
       
      
    34 Whealy J referred to the constitutional case law on both separation of powers and trial by jury. He adopted terminology from that case law and applied it to the two fields in a broadly similar way.  
     
      
    35 His Honour stated the test he applied with respect to the separation of powers argument was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[66] … the predominant characteristic of a criminal trial, for present purposes, is that it is for the tribunal of fact to determine ultimate facts (that is the elements of the offence) …” 
        
       
      
    36 His Honour adopted the concept of “predominant characteristic” from Nicholas v The Queen (1998) 193 CLR 173 at 232 [145] and the reference to “ultimate facts” from Nicholas at 236 [156], 238 [162] and 278 [252]. 
     
      
    37 With respect to the s 80 issue, his Honour adopted the following test: 
     
      
       
        
        “[94] … the jury should decide each of the elements of the crime with which the accused is charged …” 
        
       
      
    38 In the course of rejecting the applicants’ submissions on the s 80 issue his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[95] … The s 18 certificate procedure provides only that certain formal and technical facts are conclusively proved. They are not ultimate facts for the reasons I have analysed in relation to the first principal argument. The legislation does not take away from the jury its role of determining all or any of the ultimate issues of fact. In accordance with the established authorities, the ‘essential’ features, the fundamental features, of a trial by jury are unaffected by the legislation.” 
        
       
      
    39 In the course of rejecting the applicants’ submissions on the separation of powers issue his Honour made the following observation: 
     
      
       
        
        “[68] The legislation is, it will be seen, very limited in its scope. It enables the Managing Director of a carrier to certify facts ‘he or she thinks relevant with respect to acts or things done by, or in relation to employees…to enable a warrant to be executed.’ The actions of the employees of a telecommunication carrier in enabling the execution of a warrant are completely at a remove from the elements of the offence the prosecution will need to prove beyond reasonable doubt in relation to the charge against Khaled Cheikho. 
        
       
       
        
        [69] The purpose of the legislation was, as is commonly accepted by both counsel, to protect the identity of the carrier’s employees engaged in enabling the execution of warrants by police and other agencies. It was designed to save those employees from having to give evidence in Court. It was intended to provide for a certificate going to formal matters of technical evidence only, and not to any issue before the Court (see Explanatory Memorandum and Second Reading Speech – Hansard, House of Representatives 9 May 1995 page 1980).” 
        
       
      
    40 Whealy J characterised the certificate and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “[71] I am unable to see that any of the facts certified conclusively prove any of the ‘ultimate facts’, that is, the elements of the offence charged against Khaled Cheikho. Indeed, they have nothing to say as to those elements.” 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour characterised the Crown case: 
     
      
       
        
        “[74] It needs to be remembered that we are dealing here with circumstantial evidence of a particular kind. In this case, the Crown relies upon a substantial body of circumstantial evidence from which it will ask the jury to infer that it has proved the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. No circumstance in the present trial will prove guilt of itself. Indeed, many of the facts are of an apparently inconsequential kind. It is only when they are assembled with all the evidence in the Crown case that the prosecution asserts a mosaic of guilt is revealed.” 
        
       
      
    42 He added: 
     
      
       
        
        “[75] … In any event, it needs to be borne in mind that the Crown allegation here is that the accused downloaded material from the Internet on to his computer. This is simply one fact among a multitude of facts. It does not, as I say, suggest guilt of itself. Nor could proof of that fact in the present trial be evidence establishing an element of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        [76] When one turns to analyse the certified facts here, it will be apparent that they are not circumstantial facts, in any event, going to proof of the elements of the offence. True it is a telephone service is named and the subscriber of that service is named in the warrant. The facts certified, however, are essentially the ‘description’ of the acts of the employees of the carrier enabling the warrant to be executed. Those facts say nothing about the accused either directly or indirectly. They say nothing about his actions and nothing about whether he downloaded any material from the Internet. It does not appear the service is in his name. In addition, the facts certified are not facts going to proof of guilt but, rather, facts that relate only to the gathering of evidence, that is, a technical question as to what a carrier did in order to allow the execution of a warrant by ASIO. They are precursors to the task of interception. On the other hand, the material intercepted may properly be described as part of the Crown circumstantial case. The technical means to be used to enable ASIO to make the intercept, by way of contrast, are not.” 
        
       
      
    43 His Honour identified a range of matters which the accused could put in issue with respect to the interception and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[81] … [T]he certificate would not preclude any valid argument challenging the relevance of the intercepts. Nor would it preclude any valid argument as to the weight, if any, to be given to the intercepts in the overall evaluation of the Crown’s circumstantial case. All that is rendered conclusively proved by the certificate are the acts of the Optus employees certified by Mr O’Brien. Those acts, as I have explained, are not themselves, strictly speaking, part of the circumstantial case. It is true, I accept, that the accused would be precluded from arguing that the intercepts were not transmitted to ASIO. But the issue surrounding that fact is not a circumstantial fact, and it is very far removed from being an ‘ultimate fact’ in the sense of being an element of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    44 Finally, his Honour concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[82] … If the legislation does not distort the predominant characteristic of a trial and does not impinge upon the Prosecutor’s duty and obligation to prove the “ultimate facts” against the accused, it cannot be said that the accused is in any relevant sense disadvantaged in, or precluded from, meeting the case against him.” 
        
       
      
    45 With respect to the Crown’s reliance on the act of downloading as an overt act, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[88] … [T]he Crown has placed reliance on over 130 overt acts. Nonetheless, the downloading of extremist material (by all the accused) is said by the Crown to be one overt act. Does this result in a situation where the legislation is conclusive evidence of a fact or facts which are elements of the offence? The answer must, once again, be in the negative. As I have explained, a conclusive certificate under s 18 relates to only act by employees of a relevant carrier. The certificate does not include facts in relation to acts or things done by any other person, including any acts or things done by the accused. The certified facts, in a constitutional sense, leave untouched the elements of the crime for which the accused is to be tried.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions on the Appeal 
       
      
    46 The applicants’ submissions identified what was called a “critical fact” in the Crown case, namely proof that the accused Cheikho or another party to the conspiracy accessed and downloaded documents on a telecommunications service linked to one of the accused. This fact is relevant to the Crown’s case in three respects:  
     
      
       
      (i) As a fact from which, with other facts, it can be inferred that one of the accused was party to the alleged conspiracy; 
       
       
      (ii) As a fact from which it can be inferred that that accused had the requisite intention that an offence, namely preparation for a terrorist act, would be committed by some person; and 
       
       
      (iii) As the doing by one of the accused of an overt act pursuant to the alleged conspiracy. 
       
      
    47 The relevant overt act particularised is: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 8 July 2004, three documents in Arabic were downloaded from a website on a computer located at Khaled Cheikho’s home, as follows: 
        
       
       
        
        a) a 1 page document showing Osama Bin Laden and containing links to military lessons, Jihad websites, Jihad chat rooms, scholars of Jihad and news; 
        
       
       
        
        b) a 1 page document containing ‘a few advices’ inciting Muslims to engage in Jihad; and 
        
       
       
        
        c) a 12 page Arabic document containing instructions on the various types of explosives (including the speed, force, ferocity and sensitivity of explosives) and how to construct a detonator and manufacture improvised explosives from commonly available products.” 
        
       
      
    48 The applicants’ submissions focused upon the significance for the Crown case of establishing that the documents were, as a matter of fact, downloaded by a computer connected to one of the applicants.  
     
      
    49 First, the applicants submit that the certificate tendered before his Honour on the voir dire prevents them from raising an issue of illegality which may lead to the exclusion of the evidence. Pursuant to the provisions of the TIA an employee of the relevant telecommunications corporation is prohibited from recording or listening to the conversation intercepted. Such conduct, if established, would raise an issue of illegality under the TIA itself with respect to the admissibility of the communications into evidence.  
     
      
    50 Secondly, the applicants submit that the conclusiveness of the certificate will be used by the Crown as proof that the contents of the documents received at ASIO following the transmission by Optus employees, were downloaded as alleged. The applicants submit that they will not be able to challenge whether there was a download at all, nor put the Crown to proof of a step in the chain of evidence necessary for the tender of the intercepted material. 
     
      
    51 The applicants submit that the Crown cannot prove by means of direct evidence that any downloading of relevant documents occurred. It is not suggested, for example, that the Crown could establish that the downloaded material could be located on any relevant computer. Important aspects of the act of downloading will be established by means of the conclusive certificate. 
     
      
    52 With respect to the issue of illegality, the applicants rely on s 63(1)(b) which provides that intercepted communications shall not be given in evidence “subject to this part”. This prohibition extends to all legal proceedings. It is relevant to note that this section prohibits, under criminal sanction, the tender of intercepted information, whether lawfully obtained or not. There is no general discretion. However, that Part of the Act creates a regime for admissibility. 
     
      
    53 Pursuant to s 74, “lawfully obtained information” may be given in evidence in “exempt proceedings”, of which the present proceedings are an example. Furthermore, where there has been an interception that has contravened the statute, such as the prohibition upon an Optus employee recording or listening to a conversation, the interception may be admitted into evidence pursuant to s 75 of the TIA, if the Court is satisfied that there was an “irregularity” that was not a “substantial defect or irregularity” and which should “in all the circumstances … be disregarded”.  
     
      
    54 The conclusiveness of the certificate tendered on the voir dire is such that Whealy J will not consider the issues which could arise under s 75. I will refer to the relevant statutory provisions further when dealing with the illegality issue below. 
     
      
    55 With respect to the chain of evidence issue, the applicants submit that the Crown has to prove what happened at Optus, as well as what happened at ASIO. The first step is, they submit impermissibly, conclusively determined by the certificate. They place particular emphasis on the proposition that the “critical fact” they have identified is a particularised overt act and, accordingly, constitutes an element of the offence. 
     
      
    56 Mr H Burmester QC, who appeared for the Attorney, submitted that the certificate does not intrude into the area of determination of critical or even of significant facts. Matters which relate only to the gathering of evidence, he submitted, are not of that character.  
     
      
    57 The submissions of the Attorney, adopted by the Crown, turn on what the Attorney submits is the limited scope of a permissible certificate under s 18(2), characterising that scope by the use of such words as “formal” and “technical”. The Attorney submits that evidence about how certain material was received by ASIO, based on what employees of a telecommunications carrier did to enable the interception, does not impinge upon the content of the material intercepted or determine in any way an issue that goes to elements of the offence charged. Such a certified fact, which cannot be controverted, is not the type of fact that can prejudice the discharge of the judicial power or the ability of the jury to find facts necessary for the determination of criminal guilt.  
     
      
    58 The Attorney submitted that, although the certificate conclusively establishes that a particular service was intercepted and communications were transmitted to ASIO, there are important restrictions on the scope of the certificate. I will set out the detail of this submission below. 
     
      
       
      Trial By Jury 
       
      
    59 Section 80 of the Constitution relevantly states: 
     
      
       
        
        “[80] The trial on indictment of any offence against any law of the Commonwealth shall be by jury …” 
        
       
      
    60 The words “trial by jury” must be understood as a “constitutional expression” (Brownlee v The Queen [2001] HCA 36; (2001) 207 CLR 278 at 284 [7], 291 [33]); as are the words “Supreme Court” in s 73 (Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) (1996) 189 CLR 51 at 141); the writs identified in s 75(v) (Dalton v NSW Crime Commission [2006] HCA 17; (2006) 227 CLR 490 at 505 [34]); and “court of a state” in s 77(iii) (The Trust Co of Australia Ltd v Skiwing Pty Ltd [2006] NSWCA 185; (2006) 66 NSWLR 77 at [44]).  
     
      
    61 The case law on s 80 has primarily focussed on the word “indictment” (Kingswell v The Queen (1985) 159 CLR 264; Cheng v The Queen [2000] HCA 53; (2000) 203 CLR 248) or the word “jury” (Brown v The Queen (1986) 160 CLR 171; Cheatle v The Queen (1993) 177 CLR 541; Brownlee supra; Fittock v The Queen [2003] HCA 19; (2003) 217 CLR 508; Ng v The Queen [2003] HCA 20; (2003) 217 CLR 521). The focus of the issues that arise in the present case is on the words “trial … by”. One of the few cases which was directly concerned with this terminology in s 80 is Cheung v The Queen [2001] HCA 67; (2001) 209 CLR 1.  
     
      
    62 The fundamental test is that only the “essential characteristics” of trial by jury are protected by s 80 of the Constitution where proceedings have been commenced by indictment. (See Ng supra [9]; Brownlee supra [67], [17], [21]-[22], [33] [34], [54], [58], [71]; Cheatle supra at pp 557-558.)  
     
      
    63 A reference to “essential features” of a jury trial, as an authoritative statement of the constitutional guarantee contained in s 80, was first stated by O’Connor J in Huddart, Parker & Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead (1909) 8 CLR 330 at 375. This formulation was first authoritatively applied to s 80 in the joint judgment of the High Court in Cheatle supra at 549 and 560.  
     
      
    64 The issue before this Court is to identify, and perhaps to define, whether, and if so to what extent, it is an essential characteristic of trial by jury that the jury determine facts and/or that the judge must determine whether to withhold evidence on the ground of illegality. In Cheung supra, the High Court determined that it was not an essential characteristic of a jury trial that facts relevant to sentence must be found by the jury. There is no authority directly in point on the issues now before the Court. 
     
      
       
      Separation of Powers 
       
      
    65 The applicants submit that s 18(2) of the TIA impermissibly interferes with the separation of powers established by Chapter III of the Constitution. They rely on that aspect of this doctrine which is often characterised as the legislative usurpation of judicial power. The applicants rely on two alternative contentions.  
     
      
    66 First, they contend that s 18(2) constitutes a legislative usurpation of the judicial power by vesting such power in an officer of a private company, ie the senior executive of Optus authorised to sign the certificate, and/or in the representative of the executive branch of government, relevantly, the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is proposing to tender and rely upon the certificate. The section is said to be an impermissible usurpation by reason of the fact that it removes from the judge the function of determining whether conduct has occurred which Parliament has made illegal. I will refer to this as the illegality issue. 
     
      
    67 The second, and alternative, basis upon which it is submitted that there is an impermissible usurpation of judicial power is that a s 18 certificate conclusively determines that a particular fact exists, thereby preventing that tribunal of fact from doubting the existence of that fact or receiving evidence or submissions leading to the existence of such a doubt.  
     
      
    68 The applicants’ reliance upon the separation of powers doctrine does not, it appears, turn in any relevant respect on the identity of the tribunal of fact. The fact that it is a jury, rather than a judge, which is to determine the facts is clearly at the heart of the s 80 case. The Chapter III case propounded by the applicants is not, in my opinion, so confined. Nevertheless, there may be particular characteristics of a criminal trial which are constitutionally protected from intrusion, even though the parallel characteristics of a civil trial are not so protected. 
     
      
    69 There have been a variety of judicial formulations as to the test to be applied for a legislative usurpation of, or interference with the judicial power, which are in general terms equivalent and include: 
     
      
       
        Requiring a court “to depart to a significant degree from the methods and standards which have characterised judicial activities”. ( 
       Thomas v Mowbray 
        [2007] HCA 33; (2007) 81 ALJR 1414 at [111], [600] and [651]) 
       
       
        Legislation that “constituted a marked interference with the judicial process and circumscribed the judicial function and the discretions incidental to it”. ( 
       The Queen v Humby; ex parte Rooney 
        (1973) 129 CLR 231 at 250) 
       
       
        A law which requires or authorises a court to “exercise judicial power in a manner which is inconsistent with the essential character of a court or with the nature of judicial power”. ( 
       Chu Kheng Lim v Minister of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs 
        (1992) 176 CLR 1 at 27) 
       
      
    70 With respect to a criminal trial, Nicholas identifies a more specific test with respect to legislation that modifies the law of evidence and procedure, including: 
     
      
       
        “Interference with the governance of the trial and distortion of its predominant characteristics”. ( 
       Nicholas 
        supra at 232 [145]) 
       
       
        Legislation that deems to exist or to have been proved “any ultimate fact being an element of the offence”. ( 
       Nicholas 
        at 236 [156], 238 [162]) 
       
       
        “So radical and so pointed in their application … that they could be seen, in substance, to deal with ultimate issues of guilt or innocence”. ( 
       Nicholas 
        supra at 278 [252]) 
       
      
    71 These were the formulations to which particular emphasis was given in submissions in these proceedings. 
     
      
       
      The Illegality Issue 
       
      
    72 The Crown submits that no issue of illegality has arisen on the facts of the present case. 
     
      
    73 With respect to this issue the applicants assert that two inferences were available on the basis of the original certificate set out at [10] above. The first inference is that there was a recording by employees of Optus. This inference is, in my opinion, open. 
     
      
    74 The second inference for which the applicants contend is that there was a separate and later communication by Optus employees of the information they had recorded to employees of ASIO. In my opinion, this inference is not open or, at least, no more than faintly arguable. 
     
      
    75 The critical terminology is that found in par 6 of the original certificate as set out in par [10] above which states, to repeat: “The information which was recorded … was periodically supplied in a process established by Optus employees to employees of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation”. The import of this statement turns on the word “process”. It is not apparent that the process involved any act on the part of Optus employees. Nor does the word “recorded” indicate that what was “supplied” was the Optus illegal ‘recording’, if any, as distinct from passing on the same information as was ‘recorded’. It was the “information” that was said to have been “supplied” not the “record”, if any. 
     
      
    76 This analysis confirms the proposition that the communication of the information to ASIO by this “process” was as described in the terminology of par 5 of the final certificate namely that the communication was “transmitted directly to ASIO”.  
     
      
    77 No doubt for this reason Whealy J concluded, in what he described as a “preliminary reaction” as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[97] … I accept that the first certificate is rather opaque. I suspect that there may have been a certain wariness on the part of the certifier to be overtly specific about the way intercepts are transmitted to ASIO … I do not, however, read the earlier certificate as negating the fact that the interceptions went directly through the carrier to the agency. Read in that way, the second certificate is not contradictory of the first at all.” 
        
       
      
    78 As I have indicated, there is an arguable case, on the basis of the first certificate, that Optus employees listened to and recorded the intercepted communication. If that occurred it would be a contravention of s 7(1)(a) of the TIA on the basis that those employees intercepted a communication in circumstances where they were not authorised to do so by a warrant. The relevant warrant authorised only ASIO officers to conduct the interception. 
     
      
    79 If this did in fact occur then the recording of the interception by the Optus employees would not have the character of “lawfully intercepted information” as defined in s 6E(1) of the TIA, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “6E(1) … A reference in this Act of lawfully intercepted information is a reference to information obtained … by intercepting, otherwise than in contravention to subsection 7(1), a communication passing over a telecommunications system.” 
        
       
      
    80 In the submissions made by the applicants in this respect emphasis was placed upon s 63(1)(a). The section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “63(1) Subject to this Part, a person shall not, after the commencement of this Part: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) communicate to another person, make use of, or make a record of; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) give in evidence to a proceeding 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        lawfully obtained information or information obtained by intercepting a communication in contravention of subsection 7(1).” 
        
       
      
    81 One of the provisions in the Part, to which s 63(1) is made subject, is s 74 which states: 
     
      
       
        
        “74(1) A person may give lawfully obtained information (other than foreign intelligence information) in evidence in an exempt proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    82 The applicants’ submission is that, as the ASIO employees received the information recorded by Optus, that information retained its character in the hands of the ASIO employees, and subsequently the Crown, as being information obtained in contravention of s 7(1). Accordingly, s 63(1)(b) operated to prevent that information being given in evidence in the proceedings. 
     
      
    83 I observe that with respect to this step in the applicants’ submissions it does not matter whether the information is “lawfully obtained” or obtained in contravention of s 7(1). Section 63(b) applies to all intercepted information. The relevant issue is posed by s 74 which creates an exception for “lawfully obtained information” in an exempt proceeding, such as the present proceeding. 
     
      
    84 Accordingly, the crucial question on the issue of illegality is whether or not the information received by ASIO was “lawfully obtained information”, as defined in s 6E(1), within s 74(1). 
     
      
    85 If, as Whealy J found, on a preliminary basis, the transmission of the information to ASIO was automatic, so that the listening and recording by Optus employees was not the source of the information to ASIO, then that interception did have the quality of “lawfully obtained information”.  
     
      
    86 Pursuant to the warrant ASIO employees were authorised to conduct an intercept. If, as Whealy J found by way of a “preliminary reaction”, the technical means of interception occurred in such a manner as not to require any step by Optus employees between the technical interception and the communication to ASIO employees, then there is no contravention of s 7(1) in that respect. The fact, if it be a fact, that there was a contravention by reason of the recording and/or listening to the interception by Optus employees, as may be suggested on the original certificate, does not affect the transmission to ASIO. Nor does it result in the characterisation of that transmission as something other than “lawfully obtained information”. 
     
      
    87 Nevertheless, as his Honour made the relevant finding only on a preliminary basis, it is appropriate for this Court to consider the applicants’ submissions on the alternative basis that it is at least arguable that what Optus employees recorded was what was transmitted to ASIO. On this assumption s 63(1)(a) would be engaged and the information would not be “lawfully obtained information” within s 6E(1). 
     
      
    88 Section 18(2) of the TIA repeats, in substance, s 25A of the TIA introduced by amendment in 1985. That section made provision for the same kind of certificate which, similarly, would constitute “conclusive evidence” of matters stated in it. 
     
      
    89 In Hilton v Wells (1985) 157 CLR 57 the High Court determined, by majority, that the existing legislative scheme did not prohibit the admission into evidence of information obtained by an illegal interception. The general discretion, subsequently reflected in s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 could be invoked but there was no further restraint. (Section 137 of that Act made further provision.) 
     
      
    90 In 1987, the TIA was amended to overcome the effects of Hilton v Wells.  (See Grollo v Palmer (1995) 184 CLR 348 at 385-386; John Fairfax Publications v Doe (Jockey Tapes case) (1995) 37 NSWLR 81 at 85, 88.) Part VII of the TIA, which includes ss 63, 74, 75 and 76, constitutes a detailed and restrictive scheme in relation to admissibility of evidence obtained by the interception of telecommunications. The interaction of this scheme with s 137 and s 138 of the Evidence Act was not the subject of submissions on this appeal. 
     
      
    91 Former s 25A was re-enacted as part of that scheme in the new s 61. In 1993, s 18 was inserted in lieu of the 1987 version of s 61. Accordingly, the conclusive nature of a certificate has been a feature of the legislative scheme since 1985.  
     
      
    92 There may be a tension between the stringency of the regime created by Pt VII of the Act with respect to the admissibility of information obtained by illegal interception, on the one hand, and the practical impossibility of establishing such illegality in respects which are expressly and permissibly addressed in a certificate which has conclusive effect. This tension raises questions of statutory interpretation. It does not raise, in my opinion, a constitutional issue as to the limits of the powers of the Commonwealth Parliament which arise by reason of the separation of powers under Chapter III of the Constitution or by reason of the provision for trial by jury in s 80. 
     
      
    93 In this regard I can see no relevant distinction between s 18(2) of the TIA and s 15X of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) considered by the High Court in Nicholas supra. Section 15X operated with retrospective effect to restrict the application of the common law discretion to refuse to admit illegally obtained evidence. That discretion had been reaffirmed in Ridgeway v The Queen (1995) 184 CLR 19 with respect to a prosecution under s 233B of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). Nicholas also involved a prosecution under that section.  
     
      
    94 Section 15X was enacted as part of a legislative scheme in response to the decision in Ridgeway. Some sections of the amending legislation decriminalised the involvement of a law enforcement officer in controlled operations for the delivery of drugs to drug dealers. Section 15X applied to controlled operations which had occurred before the commencement of the Act. It stated, relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “In determining … whether evidence that narcotic goods were imported… should be admitted, the fact that a law enforcement officer committed an offence … is to be disregarded…” 
        
       
      
    95 I have had occasion to consider Nicholas in Lodhi v R [2007] NSWCCA 360 and reiterate my observations at pars [60]-[61]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[60] Section 15X did not abolish the relevant discretion. It removed an element, albeit a particularly pertinent, indeed critical, element, from the process of exercising the discretion. 
        
       
       
        
        [61] Four of the majority judgments in  
        Nicholas  
        (Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gummow and Hayne JJ) emphasised that s 15X limited the discretion of the Court to exclude evidence and that the common law of evidence had often been changed by legislation. (See at [23]-[24], [25]-[26], [53], [55], [151], [161]-[162], [235]-[236], [238].)” 
        
       
      
    96 The certificate in issue in the present case, has a similar effect to that identified. It does not abolish the relevant power to exclude evidence. However, on the argument propounded by the applicants, and assuming the validity of par 5 of the final certificate, the conclusive nature of such a statement in the certificate will, in substance, mean, paraphrasing s 15X, “the fact that an Optus employee committed an offence … is to be disregarded”. 
     
      
    97 I attach particular significance to the fact that four judges of the majority in Nicholas (Brennan CJ, Toohey, Gummow and Hayne JJ) emphasised that s 15X limited the discretion of the court to exclude evidence and that the common law of evidence had often been changed by legislation. (See at [23]-[24], [25]-[26], [53], [55], [151], [161], [162], [235]-[236], [238].)  
     
      
    98 Section 18(2) of the TIA is also a change to the law of evidence which directly impinges on both the common law principle with respect to the admissibility of evidence in a criminal prosecution and a stringent statutory regime. This is not a relevant difference for purposes of separation of powers or trial by jury analysis.  
     
      
    99 The legislative scheme for dealing with illegally obtained evidence found in the TIA, like the common law principle, involves the balancing of conflicting interests. This has always been recognised as the consideration at the heart of the discretion to exclude illegally obtained evidence. As the joint judgment of Stephen and Aicken JJ, frequently referred to, in Bunning v Cross (1978) 141 CLR 54 at 74, put it what is involved is: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the weighing against each other of two competing requirements of public policy, thereby seeking to resolve the apparent conflict between the desirable goal of bringing to conviction the wrongdoer and the undesirable effect of curial approval or even encouragement, being given to the unlawful conduct of those whose task it is to influence the law.” 
        
       
      
    100 See also the analysis of the case law by Brennan CJ in Nicholas supra at [32]-[35]. 
     
      
    101 Each of the four majority judgments in Nicholas emphasised that the discretion upon which s 15X impinged, involved the balancing of conflicting public policy considerations. Their Honours accepted that the alteration of the way the balance should be struck in that case did not constitute an impermissible usurpation of the judicial power (See at 35-36, 55, 159-160, 164-234.) 
     
      
    102 As Gummow J noted at 160: 
     
      
       
        
        “The legislature has now … struck a different balance between these competing interests.” 
        
       
      
    103 And as Hayne J said at 238: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of this particular discretion, the exercise of which depends upon the balancing of competing considerations, I see no intrusion on the judicial power by the legislature saying that in some kinds of case, one consideration (that of preserving the reputation of the court, by their not being seen to condone law breaking) is to be put to one side in favour of the consideration that persons committing a particular kind of crime should be convicted and punished.” 
        
       
      
    104 Furthermore, as Brennan CJ put it at [38]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In striking a balance between the factors relevant to the  
        Ridgeway 
         discretion, subject to the conditions prescribed by the Div 3 of Pt 1AB, the Parliament expresses where the balance of public interests lies. The declaration of the balance of public interest devolves on the court when the Parliament is silent, but once the Parliament has spoken, it is the voice of the Parliament that declares where the balance of the public interest lies.” 
        
       
      
    105 Similarly in the present case, s 18(2) involves a conflict of public interests of the same kind identified by the High Court in Nicholas and which was found not to involve any usurpation of the judicial power.  
     
      
    106 As I have indicated above, the origin of s 18(2) was in s 25A of the TIA, which, when it was introduced, was the subject of the following explanation by the then Attorney General: 
     
      
       
        
        “Initially, material obtained by interception was used for criminal intelligence purposes. However, as it is admissible as evidence in criminal proceedings, there are cases where it is appropriate and necessary to put the material into evidence. Strict proof of actions taken by Telecom employees would require those employees to give evidence in court. Telecom management had been advised that employees are unwilling to give such evidence because public identification of their involvement in narcotics interception would cause fear for their own safety, that of their families and that of their fellow workers. 
        
       
       
        
        Telecommunications interception is of great assistance to the Australian Federal Police in the prevention and detection of drug offences. It would be contrary to the public interest for the lawful interception of telecommunications to be reduced or prejudiced. In this Bill, the Government proposes that evidence of acts performed by Telecom employees to enable the execution of an interception warrant to be given by a certificate signed by the Managing Director of Telecom. Such a certificate would be conclusive proof of the matters contained therein. The matters which will be contained in the certificate are formal matters of evidence only and do not go to any issue before the court. 
        
       
       
        
        The Government recognises that there is an objection to a prosecutor seeking to establish, by certificate or averment, an element of the prosecution case going to the conduct of the accused. However, proof that a warrant was executed strictly in compliance with its terms is a purely formal matter.” (Hansard, House of Representatives, 9 May 1985, p 1980.) 
        
       
      
    107 Section 18(2) involves a balancing of public interests, by weighing the public interest to ensure that employees of telecommunications corporations act in support of the process of law enforcement, on the one hand, against the public interest in the exclusion of unlawfully obtained evidence. The latter public interest is expressly recognised by the legislative scheme adopted in the TIA. 
     
      
    108 In my opinion, the fact that s 18(2) appears in the same legislation that creates the scheme restricting admissibility makes the conclusion even clearer than was the case in Nicholas. Where the challenged provision appears in the same legislative scheme then the principle of statutory interpretation that the act must be read as a whole and effect given to all parts of it, is such that it cannot be said that the rights or expectations created by the legislative scheme with respect to the exclusion of illegally obtained intercept evidence has constitutional protection.  
     
      
    109 The degree of modification of (I do not use the word interference with) the judicial process constituted by the limitation enacted in s 15X of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), which was upheld in Nicholas, is directly analogous, in my opinion, to s 18(2) of the TIA. With respect to controlled operations that occurred prior to the enactment of s 15X, that section provided, as noted, that the illegality “is to be disregarded”.  
     
      
    110 In the regime which the TIA creates for the admissibility of evidence obtained by interception, both lawful and unlawful, s 18(2) has a similar consequence by ensuring that the conclusive nature of the certificate prevents the Court, as a practical matter, from determining the contrary in the case of factual matters properly within the statutory power to certify. In this regard, it is pertinent to note that the power extends only to “acts or things done … to enable a warrant to be executed”. This is a significant restraint, the bounds of which were not explored before Whealy J or in this Court. 
     
      
    111 The Court must give full effect to the entire statutory regime created by the TIA, both with respect to the significant restrictions on the ability to tender the product of unlawful interceptions and on the practical difficulty that a s 18(2) certificate places in the way of agitating the issue. This raises issues of statutory interpretation, not constitutional validity. 
     
      
    112 The applicants further contend that s 18(2) impermissibly interferes with the concept of trial by jury by removing from the judge his or her role in determining what evidence is properly receivable by the jury.  
     
      
    113 O’Connor J referred, in a frequently cited passage from Huddart Parker v Moorehead, supra at 375, to the proposition that one of the essential features of a trial by jury is that such trial occur “under the guidance of a judge”. I will set out the passage below. 
     
      
    114 Aspects of the role of the judge in a jury trial may constitute, in some respects, one of the essential characteristics of such a trial. Nevertheless identification of the circumstances in which a judge is able to reject evidence on the ground of illegality is a matter which by its very nature is capable of modification by statute. It is, relevantly, a statute that creates the illegality. Modifying that effect does not impinge on one of the essential characteristics of trial by jury or upon one of the predominant characteristics of the exercise of judicial power.  
     
      
    115 The judgments in Nicholas do, in my opinion, establish that the creation of a statutory regime which determines what constitutes relevant illegality and which restricts the ability to establish such illegality, does not interfere with the separation of powers. By parity of reasoning, such a regime does not impinge upon any essential characteristic of the constitutional conception of trial by jury. In each case the effect of the statute is to expand, not to restrict, the range of relevant facts before the tribunal of fact. In this critical respect there is a difference between the illegality issue and the chain of evidence issue. 
     
      
       
      The Centrality of Fact Finding 
       
      
    116 The Attorney’s submission, adopted by the Crown, conceded that Commonwealth legislation could not establish a conclusive certification regime for, to use the terminology in Nicholas at 236 [156], 238 [162], “any ultimate fact being an element of the offence”. However, there is a doubt in my mind whether the passages from the reasoning in High Court judgment that refer to proof of elements of the offence were intended to be exhaustive. If not, there is no guidance as to where the line is to be drawn for either separation of powers analysis or constitutional trial by jury analysis. 
     
      
    117 In the context of s 80, O’Connor J said in Huddart Parker v Moorehead supra at 375: 
     
      
       
        
        “What are the essential features of a trial by jury? … It is the method of trial in which laymen selected by lot  
        ascertain 
         under the guidance of a Judge  
        the truth in questions of fact 
         arising either in a civil litigation or in a criminal process.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    118 This passage was cited with approval, in the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ and McHugh J in Brownlee supra [16], where their Honours went on to say at [17] that this was not an exhaustive statement of essential characteristics of trial by jury. 
     
      
    119 Furthermore, the joint judgment in Cheatle also referred to this passage and said at 549: 
     
      
       
        
        “That statement correctly draws attention to the representative character of a jury and to the  
        fact-finding function which a jury traditionally served 
          
        in civil litigation and in criminal committal and trial processes. It does not, however, attempt to address the more particular question of what, if any, are the minimum requirements which must be observed to ensure that a jury in a criminal trial is adequately representative of the community.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    120 I add that the passage also does not “attempt to address” the minimum requirements as to fact finding on the part of the jury which constitute the constitutional conception of trial by jury.  
     
      
    121 It is not the case that O’Connor J’s reference to “ascertain … the truth in questions of fact arising” encompasses every fact to be adduced in evidence in a criminal trial. As Isaacs J stated with respect to s 80 in Huddart Parker v Moorehead at 386: 
     
      
       
        
        “The whole meaning in essence of the requirement is that a jury, and not a judicial officer, shall pronounce upon the guilt or innocence of the accused.” 
        
       
      
    122 This proposition is consistent with the proposition that the concept of “trial by jury” directs attention to the elements of an offence, rather than to each relevant fact.  
     
      
    123 This also appears to be the approach of Gleeson CJ, Gummow and Hayne JJ in Cheung supra, when their Honours said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[4] When an accused person is tried upon indictment before a judge and jury,  
        the role of the jury is to decide whether the accused is guilty or not guilty of the charge or charges laid in the indictment 
        . That involves determining the issue or issues joined between the prosecution and the accused. Such  
        issue or issues are defined by the terms of the indictment, and by the plea 
        …” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    124 In the context of that case, ie the determination of facts relevant to the degree of culpability for purposes of sentencing, their Honours went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[7]  
        It is necessary to distinguish 
        , not only between questions of guilt and questions of degree of culpability, but also  
        between issues, facts relevant to issues, and evidence 
        . The jury’s verdict decided the issues joined by the plea to the indictment. It did not decide, either expressly or by implication, all facts of possible relevance to sentencing. … Jurors are normally instructed that they are entitled to choose between parts of the evidence.  
        In order to convict they must find, beyond reasonable doubt, the constituent elements of the offence charged 
        , but, provided they reason to such a conclusion in a manner consistent with properly framed judicial directions,  
        their process of reasoning does not necessarily have to be unanimous 
        .  
        Unless a particular piece of evidence is logically crucial to the prosecution case, they do not have to accept 
        , beyond reasonable doubt, any particular witness or  
        any particular evidence 
        . These are familiar aspects as what is sometimes described as the inscrutability of a jury verdict.” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    125 Their Honours also referred at [53] to the similar observation that their Honours had made in Cheng v The Queen(2000) 203 CLR 248 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he constitutional command in s 80 is directed to jury trial and  
        issues joined between prosecution and accused 
        .” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    126 In Cheng, supra, their Honours had referred at [41] to the effect of a plea of guilty as constituting “a formal admission of the elements of the offence”.  
     
      
    127 I note that Kirby J, who has long taken a more expansive view of the constitutional guarantee in s 80 of the Constitution, has also identified the trial by jury as a mode of trial in which: 
     
      
       
        
        “[T]he jury decided by its verdict whether or not the prosecutor has proved the accused guilty of the offence charged.” 
        
       
       
      ( 
      Cheung 
       supra at [130]) 
       
      
    128 It may be that his Honour was not intending to confine this observation to the elements of an offence. 
     
      
    129 Similar issues have been addressed in the separation of powers case law: 
     
      
       
        “Judicial power involves  
       the application of the relevant law to facts as found  
       in proceedings conducted in accordance with the judicial process. And that requires that the parties be given an opportunity to present their evidence and to challenge the evidence led against them. It is  
       contrary to the judicial 
        process and no part of judicial power to effect a determination of  
       rights by applying the law to facts which are neither agreed nor determined by reference to the evidence in the case 
       ”. ( 
       Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd  
       (1999) 198 CLR 334 at 359 [56]) [Emphasis added] 
       
       
        “[T]he process to be followed must generally be an inquiry concerning the law as it is 
        and the facts as they are 
       , followed by an application of the law as determined  
       to the facts as determined 
       ”. ( 
       R v Trade Practices Tribunal; Ex parte Tasmanian Brewery Pty Ltd  
       (1970) 123 CLR 361 at 374 [emphasis added], a passage frequently referred to as authority, including in  
       Harris v Caladine  
       (1991) 172 CLR 84 at 150;  
       Polyukhovich v Commonwealth

       and  
       Bass  
       supra at 359 n 110) 
       
       
        “Consistency with the essential character of a court … necessitates [that] … facts [be] determined in accordance with rules and procedures which  
       truly permit the facts to be ascertained 
       ”. ( 
       Nicholas  
       supra at 208-209, referred to as authority in  
       Bass  
       supra at 359 n 110) [Emphasis added] 
       
       
        “[20] … A law that purports to direct the manner in which judicial power should be exercised is constitutionally invalid. However, a law which merely prescribes a court’s practice or procedure does not direct  
       the exercise of the judicial power in finding facts 
       , or applying law or exercising an available discretion.” [Emphasis added] ( 
       Nicholas  
       at 188 [20])  
       
       
        “[21] Section 15X  
       does not impede or otherwise affect the findings of facts by a jury 
       . Indeed, it removes the barrier which  
       Ridgeway  
       placed against tendering to the jury evidence of an illegal importation that narcotic goods where such importation had in fact occurred. Far from being inconsistent with the nature of the judicial power to  
       adjudicate and punish criminal guilt 
       , s 15X facilitates the admission of evidence of material facts in aid of correct fact finding.” [Emphasis added] ( 
       Nicholas  
       at 188 [21]) 
       
      
    130 The applicants relied on a number of United States authorities which determined that conclusive evidence legislation was constitutionally invalid. Many of the cases turned on due process reasoning, in whole or in part. Australian Chapter III jurisprudence has not recognised a due process requirement. (See Thomas v Mowbray supra at [111], [600] and [651].) There are United States authorities which deploy separation of powers reasoning either alone or together with the due process reasoning. Chapter III jurisprudence has been usefully informed by Article III jurisprudence from the United States but Australian separation of powers doctrine is not the same as that of the United States. The reasoning in the United States authorities may prove to be persuasive, whilst recognising that what may be regarded as the “predominant characteristics” of the exercise of judicial power in the United States, a matter which may vary from State to State in that nation, may not be the same as the identification of such characteristics in Australia. 
     
      
    131 The applicants drew the Court’s attention to the analysis of statutory conclusive evidence provisions in the 3rd edition of Wigmore on Evidence in which a distinction is clearly drawn between a provision which is in substance a rule of substantive law and one which is a rule of conclusive evidence. In this, the last edition produced by Wigmore himself, the learned author stated by way of contrast: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the one hand, so far as a so-called rule of conclusive evidence is not a rule of evidence at all, but a rule of  
        substantive law,  
        it is clear that the legislature is not infringing upon the prerogative of the judiciary to determine the truth of a fact in issue.” (p 714) 
        
       
       
      However: 
       
       
        
        “It is one thing for the judiciary, while exercising in its own way its constitutional powers, to choose to accept the aid of an official certificate in reaching its determination; but it is quite a different thing for the judiciary to be forbidden altogether to exercise its power in a certain class of cases. The judicial function under the Constitution is to apply the law in controverted cases; to apply the law necessarily involves the determination of the facts; to determine the facts necessarily involves the investigation of evidence as a basis for that determination. To forbid investigation is to forbid the exercise of an indestructible judicial function.” (p 715-716) 
        
       
      
    132 The learned author went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … That a legislature’s attempt to interfere with a judiciary’s powers by forbidding investigation of facts, though declaring certain testimony or other evidential data to be conclusive, is invalid. 
        
       
       
        
        The genuine instances of this sort, indeed, are rare; most statutes purporting to do this are really attempts to change the substantive law under the guise of a rule of evidence, and therefore may or may not be valid, according to their interpretation … In the present class, however, would be long statutes which, while plainly recognising one fact as still dominant in the substantive law, and not desiring to change it, should make another fact conclusive proof of it.” (p 720) 
        
       
      
    133 Much of the analysis in this part of Wigmore is concerned with what is called in Australia proof of constitutional facts, with respect to which the legislature could not enact any conclusive evidence provision. The position is the same in Australia. (See eg Nicholas supra at 236 [155]; Attorney-General (Cth) v Tse Chu-Fai (1998) 193 CLR 128 at 149 [54].) No such issue arises in the present case. 
     
      
    134 Considered as a whole the analysis in Wigmore may, however, be more consistent with a focus on the elements of an offence rather than on facts relevant to a fact in issue, encompassed by the chain of evidence argument in the present proceedings. In accordance with Wigmore’s analysis it may be that legislation which impinges upon facts not being “ultimate facts” or “elements of an offence” will usually be characterised as an alteration to the “substantive law”. 
     
      
    135 Of the two United States Supreme Court authorities upon which the applicants rely in this respect one was primarily concerned with separation of legislative and executive power, although reference was made to the judicial power, (United States v Klein 80 US 128 (1871)) and the other was concerned with due process and trial by jury, rather than separation of powers (Carella v California 491 US 263 (1989)). Nevertheless, the references in Carella to the fact finding function being assigned solely to the jury has some resonance for Australian s 80 jurisprudence although the Australian test requires the identification of an “essential characteristic”.  
     
      
    136 The US authorities are of limited assistance.  
     
      
       
      The Chain of Evidence Issue 
       
      
    137 The applicants contend that the conclusive nature of the certificate prevents each applicant from putting the Crown to proof of what they describe as a “critical fact”. The Crown must establish that there was in fact access to the website and an actual downloading of material and that this occurred via a computer linked to one of the applicants.  
     
      
    138 As I have indicated above, the Crown proposes to rely on the act of downloading and the content of the material downloaded in three different ways: as a circumstantial fact to establish the alleged conspiracy, as a fact from which it can be inferred that the accused Cheikho had the requisite intention and, perhaps most significantly, as an overt act committed by the accused Cheikho pursuant to the alleged conspiracy.  
     
      
    139 It appears to me that the reliance on the conduct as an overt act is the use which most closely approximates proof of an “ultimate fact”. If that is constitutionally permissible, I cannot see that either of the other respects would differ. For ease of analysis it is appropriate to consider reliance on the certificate as a step in proving an overt act. 
     
      
    140 I have set out at par [4] above the provision of the Commonwealth Criminal Code that constitutes the occurrence of an overt act as an element of the offence of conspiracy. Section 11.5(2)(b) expresses that element in terms of a person who is a party to the agreement ‘committing an overt act’. 
     
      
    141 The focus of this element of the offence is not upon an act occurring, it is upon the person who carried out the act. Nothing in the certificate, indeed in any possible certificate, could contain an assertion of fact that identifies the person who downloaded the information. Nor could any such certificate assert that the relevant act was undertaken “pursuant to the agreement”. Indeed, that linkage is implicit in the use of the word “overt” to identify an act. 
     
      
    142 Nevertheless, the information available from Optus employees is a significant step in establishing that a download occurred and that it was linked to the use of a particular telecommunications service. Reliance upon the fact of a download is an element of the offence in the sense that the download constitutes the “act” within the meaning of “overt act”. Other aspects of the requirement found in s 11.5(2)(c) will have to be established by the Crown in the course of its overall circumstantial case. The “act” of downloading will be established by the combined effect of the conclusive certificate and proof of receipt of the relevant information by ASIO. 
     
      
    143 The proposition upon which the applicants rely in this respect was variously stated. For present purposes it is, in my opinion, a sufficient characterisation of their case that they will be placed in a position where they are unable to require the Crown to prove its case or to challenge, in any way, the first step in what is, in substance, a series of interrelated steps. There is an analogy with chain of custody of physical evidence, the tender of which is an essential part of the Crown case. That is to say, the act of downloading is of comparable evidentiary significance to a physical object which is to be tendered in the Crown case, for example, in order to prove that a piece of the accused’s clothing contained blood which other evidence, based on DNA sampling, establishes was that of the victim.  
     
      
    144 The applicants submit that the chain of “custody” of the downloaded information is of such character. It is not enough, they submit, to seek to tender only the evidence of what ASIO recorded. It is necessary, before that evidence is admitted, to establish how ASIO came to record it, perhaps most significantly, to establish that the download occurred by use of a particular computer. 
     
      
    145 On this approach, perhaps the most pertinent fact asserted in the certificate in issue in the present case is the identification in par [4] of the telecommunication service that was intercepted. There are, no doubt, other matters that will be proved on a chain of “custody” basis. However, the identification of the service, which is linked to one of the accused, is of such significance that analysis can concentrate on that assertion of fact. 
     
      
    146 The submissions by the Attorney, adopted by the Crown, rely on the references to “predominant characteristics”, “element of the offence” and “ultimate facts” in the authorities to which I have referred at [70] above. He submits that a conclusive evidence provision is constitutionally permissible as long as the fact is not an element of the offence. 
     
      
    147 The Crown submits that the overt act constituted by the downloading of the information on the particular occasion the subject of the certificate is not an element of the offence. This is based on the proposition that the Crown only has to prove one overt act in order to make out the charge. It has provided particulars of 134 distinct overt acts. 
     
      
    148 In my opinion, this issue is not to be determined in terms of numbers. The Crown relies on each overt act as particularised. A conclusive certificate which stated, in terms, that a particularised overt act occurred would constitute proof of an element of the offence. On the Attorney’s submission this would not be permissible. 
     
      
    149 In substance, the issue before this Court is whether a fact which must be established in order to prove the occurrence of an overt act can permissibly be the subject of a conclusive evidence statutory provision. Such a fact is appropriately characterised as a fact relevant to a fact in issue. However, the word ‘relevant’ covers a wide spectrum of closeness of connection. Questions of fact and degree are necessarily involved. 
     
      
    150 In my opinion, the applicant’s case involves the consideration of the scope of the accusatorial system of criminal justice which operates in Australia. So far as I am aware this characterisation of our system of criminal justice was introduced into contemporary jurisprudence by Chief Justice Gleeson in Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd v State Pollution Control Commission (1991) 25 NSWLR 118 when his Honour referred at 127F to: “our accusatorial system of criminal justice, which obliges the Crown to make out a case before an accused must answer”. 
     
      
    151 On appeal to the High Court his Honour’s characterisation was quoted with approval by Mason CJ and Toohey J (Environment Protection Authority v Caltex Refining Co Pty Ltd (1993) 178 CLR 477 at 500) and their Honours, and McHugh J in a separate judgment, both adopted that characterisation for the purpose of analysing the privilege against self-incrimination. (See at 501, 503, 504, 508 and 546.)  
     
      
    152 This characterisation has subsequently been frequently referred to in High Court jurisprudence: in the context of the principle of duplicity (Walsh v Tattersall (1996) 188 CLR 77 at 94); to explain the right to silence and determine that the rule in Jones v Dunkel did not apply to a criminal trial (RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620 at [22]; Azzopardi v The Queen [2001] HCA 25; (2001) 205 CLR 50 at [34], [38], [64]; Dyers v The Queen [2002] HCA 45; (2002) 210 CLR 285 at [9], [60]); to explain the inapplicability of the rule in Browne v Dunn (1893) 6 R 67 (HL) to a criminal trial (MWJ v The Queen [2005] HCA 74; (2005) 80 ALJR 329 at 340 [41]); to explain the approach a Court of Criminal Appeal should adopt when applying the proviso (Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [43]; TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124 at [109]); to determine whether or not the conduct of counsel caused a miscarriage of justice at the trial (Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 79 ALJR 662 at [25]); to identify the duties and responsibilities of the prosecution (Libke v The Queen [2007] HCA 30; (2007) 230 CLR 559 at [71]-[72]); to explain the obligation to disclose the Crown case to an accused (Mallard v The Queen [2005] HCA 68; (2005) 224 CLR 125 at [67]); and the obligation to provide particulars (HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 82 ALJR 723 at [9], [57]). 
     
      
    153 It cannot, however, be said that it is one of the predominant characteristics, or an essential characteristic, of a criminal trial in an accusatory system that every single fact which is relevant to the discharge by the prosecution of its onus to prove the case against an accused beyond reasonable doubt must be regarded as of equal significance. I repeat, questions of fact and degree arise. 
     
      
    154 Clearly where a fact constitutes an element of an offence the concept of the accusatory system has a clear application. As Hayne J said in Tully v The Queen [2006] HCA 56; (2006) 230 CLR 234: 
     
      
       
        
        “[73] A criminal trial is an accusatorial process in which the prosecution bears the onus of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. If an accused person pleads ‘not guilty’, the accused puts the prosecution to proof, beyond reasonable doubt, of  
        every element of the offence or offences charged 
        .” [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    155 In Chief Executive Officer of Customs v El Hajje [2005] HCA 35; (2005) 224 CLR 159 the High Court was concerned with s 144 of the Excise Act 1901 (Cth) which permitted averments in an information or complaint to constitute prima facie evidence of the matters of fact averred. Kirby J noted at [50] the tension between an averment of an “essential part of the offence” and the accusatory system. In that case, there was no challenge to the constitutional validity of s 144, but Kirby J’s reasoning suggests that any attempt to make such an averment conclusive evidence would not be compatible with the Constitution. (See esp at [69]-[70].) This was, however, a dissenting opinion. Furthermore, the issue was not argued in the Court and was not dealt with in the majority joint judgment. 
     
      
    156 There are other statements, by Justice Kirby in which his Honour emphasised that elements of the offence are essential matters which the prosecution had to establish in an accusatory system. For example in R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; (2007) 228 CLR 232 his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[162] … The accusatorial form of criminal prosecution, observed in Australia, requires the prosecution to establish the criminal accusations made by it against an accused and to make good the precise offence charged in the indictment.” 
        
       
      
    157 In any event, as I have indicated above, the Attorney and the Crown concede that a conclusive evidence certificate directed to an element of the offence would not be permissible. Nevertheless, I am not at present satisfied that the only constitutional protection of the fact finding function in an accusatory system, particularly in a trial required to be by jury, should be limited to “ultimate issues” or “elements of the offence”. Facts may be so closely connected with such matters as not to be distinguishable from them. 
     
      
    158 The concept of an accusatory system is not equivalent to the concept of an adversary system. It has a different and, in some respects, a broader scope. An accusatory system encompasses procedural and, especially, evidentiary requirements which go beyond the adversarial process. The accusatorial system of the common law tradition is distinguished from the inquisitorial system of the civil law tradition by reason of the development of a formal, separate law of evidence in which facts which would pass the test of relevance are not admissible into evidence. Although many of these rules find their origins in the jury system, the rules are not, or are no longer, so confined.  
     
      
    159 The existence of a separate law of evidence, constituting a distinct body of exclusionary rules, is one of the most fundamental differences between the common law tradition and the civil law tradition. The distinction between an accusatorial system and an inquisitorial system was once described, as accurately as shorthand labels can do so, as the distinction between “procedural truth” and “fact”. (See G L Certona “The Accusatory System v. The Inquisitorial System: Procedural Truth v Fact?” (1982) 56 Australian Law Journal 288.) 
     
      
    160 It is, in my opinion, not an essential or predominant characteristic of an accusatorial system of criminal justice that there be no restriction on the proof of facts or the ability to challenge facts in the Crown case. No doubt most of the restrictions in the law of evidence operate in favour of an accused. This is a manifestation of the fundamental principle that every accused must receive a fair trial. However, some forms of restriction on the admissibility of evidence will operate in favour of the prosecution. 
     
      
    161 There are two significant examples of legal restriction upon the admissibility of evidence, which are well established in the criminal law, and which indicate that restrictions on the ability of an accused to adduce evidence or to contest evidence in the prosecution case are compatible with the predominant characteristics of the exercise of judicial power and with the essential characteristics of trial by jury. I refer to the doctrine of legal professional privilege and to the doctrine of public interest immunity. Each of these well established common law principles carries with it the possibility of restricting access to information which would enable the accused to contest facts adduced in the Crown case. 
     
      
    162 In Carter v Northmore Hale Davy & Leake (1995) 183 CLR 121 the High Court was concerned with the effect of a claim on legal professional privilege upon criminal proceedings. The issue in that case was stated expressly (see eg at 125) in terms of whether a document subject to legal professional privilege can be compelled to be produced on a subpoena issued on behalf of an accused person in criminal proceedings, when those documents could establish the innocence of the accused or materially assist his defence. The High Court, by majority, held that there was no such exception to a claim for legal professional privilege.  
     
      
    163 The reasoning of the Court recognised that there was a conflict between two public interests of which one was the interest in the fair trial. However, the law with respect to the legal professional privilege had struck the balance rather than leaving it to the courts to undertake a balancing of the conflict of public interests. (See eg at 128, 134-135, 161-162.) The history of the law with respect to claims of legal professional privilege was of great significance in the conclusion reached that no balancing exercise was permissible because the balance had already been struck, by well established, longstanding precedent. (See also R v Derby Magistrates’ Court; ex parte B [1996] AC 487 esp at 507-508, 509; B v Auckland District Law Society [2003] 2 AC 733 esp at [37]–[51]) 
     
      
    164 The position with respect to public interest immunity is different because a balancing exercise is undertaken by the Courts. (See eg Waterford v The Commonwealth (1987) 163 CLR 54 at 64-45.) A liberal approach to public interest immunity is adopted in a criminal case. (See eg Commonwealth v Northern Land Council (1993) 176 CLR 604 at 633; Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 esp at 413-416, 431, 455-457.) Nevertheless, the public interest may require that the interests of an accused in a criminal trial are made subject to the public interest in non-disclosure. 
     
      
    165 In a sense, the issue before the Court in this case turns on a balancing exercise that has been conducted by the Parliament. Parliament has identified a particular public interest that requires protection, namely the willingness of persons employed by a telecommunications company to assist the law enforcement process by taking technical steps required to enable law enforcement agencies or security agencies to intercept communications. I have set out at par [106] above the extract from the Second Reading Speech which identifies the relevant public interest. 
     
      
    166 This public interest falls to be assessed in a context in which Parliament has established a regime for the admissibility of information obtained by intercepts in criminal proceedings, in cases of both lawfully intercepted information and of unlawfully intercepted information. As part of that regime the Parliament has adopted a provision for a conclusive certificate.  
     
      
    167 The principle of legal professional privilege in its application to criminal proceedings and the potential impingement upon criminal proceedings of the doctrine of public interest immunity, indicates that the kind of provision the Parliament has made in s 18(2) is not so alien to the criminal justice system as to render the section offensive to one of the predominant or essential characteristics of the exercise of federal judicial power. 
     
      
    168 Matters of fact and degree are, as I have indicated, necessarily involved unless the Court accepts that there is no constitutional restraint on any fact short of an element of the offence. In my opinion, in an accusatory system, the essential characteristics of trial by jury or the predominant characteristics of the exercise of judicial power with respect to fact finding, cannot be so narrowly confined. 
     
      
    169 Whether the constitutional restraint is breached depends on the circumstances of the particular case. In the context of the present application, this raises the issue of whether leave to appeal should be granted. 
     
      
       
      Should Leave be Granted? 
       
      
    170 Unlike the illegality issue, with respect to the chain of evidence issue there is nothing of any character before the Court which suggests that there is any reason to doubt that any of the facts recorded in the certificate, let alone the material recorded by ASIO, was in any sense inaccurate or even doubtful. Nevertheless, the applicants submitted in this Court that “the possibility that the interception did not occur in the manner suggested by the certificate in the present case is not fanciful”. The applicants sought to place before the Court evidence that, in the relevant year, ASIO had on other occasions caused wrong telecommunications services to be intercepted and, indeed, on occasion had acted without authorisation under the TIA. 
     
      
    171 The fact that errors have occurred on other occasions is, in my opinion, entitled to minimal, if any, weight. There is nothing before the Court to suggest that the material in this case as recorded by ASIO is anything other than an accurate record of what was downloaded by the computer that can be linked to one of the accused. I refer in particular to the identification of the telecommunications service intercepted. 
     
      
    172 It is generally inappropriate for this Court to seek to micromanage a long and complex criminal trial by intervening in the pre-trial process. The applicants submit that the Court should not permit a trial to proceed to the detriment of the accused in a manner which may not be permitted by the Constitution. They place particular emphasis on the fact that the trial is estimated to last for at least a year. The resources to be expended will be substantial and, they submit, the constitutional issue should be determined now so that there is no risk of a conviction being recorded on an erroneous constitutional basis, necessitating a retrial. 
     
      
    173 The fact that a constitutional point has been raised is not of any special status when determining whether to intervene with a grant of leave at this stage. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to have regard to the weight of the constitutional point when exercising leave. For the above reasons, in the case of the illegality issue, the constitutional point is, in my opinion, entitled to minimal weight. Similarly for the reasons I have given, the chain of evidence issue is entitled to greater but not, in my opinion, significant weight. 
     
      
    174 Each of the accused is entitled to make the Crown prove its case. That does not, however, mean that the criminal trial must be permitted to proceed as if it were some kind of forensic game in which there cannot be a bad point if it is a point taken by the accused. The absence of a suggestion that there was any error in the identification of the computer or the content of the download should be given significant weight in the exercise of the discretion to grant leave. 
     
      
    175 If it should emerge in the course of the trial, that there is any reason to doubt the content of the certificate, the trial judge has a range of options available to reconsider the matter. 
     
      
    176 I should add that these options would also be available if something further emerges on the illegality issue. 
     
      
    177 Although this Court has not heard submissions on this issue, it appears to me that should any reason to doubt any fact in the certificate emerge, the trial judge could well form the judgment under s 137 of the Evidence Act that the probative value of the certificate is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. It may be that the exclusion of the evidence pursuant to s 137 would be avoided if the Crown agreed that the certificate would stand only as prima facie evidence, so that it did not rely on s 18(2) of the TIA, and the jury was instructed accordingly. 
     
      
    178 There may be other respects in which the course of the trial affects the manner and significance of how the s 18(2) certificate impinges on the accusatory system of criminal justice. 
     
      
    179 As I have indicated above, Mr Burmester identified, and the Crown agreed, a significant range of matters to which the certificate in this case would not extend. He submitted that it: 
     
      
       
        Does not preclude arguments about the admissibility of any material allegedly derived from that interception; 
       
       
        Does not preclude the accused from seeking to prove that the evidence could not have come from the intercepted service; 
       
       
        Does not prevent the accused from leading evidence to cast doubt on who the subscriber to the telecommunications service was or who may have downloaded material; 
       
       
        Does not prove that any material allegedly derived from that interception and put forward in evidence was obtained from that service; 
       
       
        Does not prevent the accused from challenging the accuracy of anything allegedly said or transmitted over the intercepted communication, including whether it in fact was said or written. 
       
      
    180 These submissions will, no doubt, bind the Crown in the conduct of the trial. They were not challenged by the applicants in this Court. I regard this as an important factor in determining whether leave to appeal should be granted. 
     
      
    181 On the basis of these submissions, the scope of s 18(2) is very limited. Not only does the certificate not impinge on any element of the offence, the certificate has very little significance for facts relevant to a fact in issue, including with respect to the chain of custody argument propounded by the applicant.  
     
      
    182 The tender of evidence of the communication, based upon the interception at ASIO, cannot be the subject of a conclusive certificate. Section 18(4) and (5) relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “18(4) The Director General of Security or the Deputy Director-General of Security may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out such facts as he or she considers relevant with respect to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) anything done by an officer or employee of the Organisation in connection with:

        information obtained by the execution of such a warrant. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) A document purporting to be a certificate issued under subsection (3) or (4) … is to be received in evidence in an exempt proceeding without further proof and is, in an except proceeding,  
        prima facie  
        evidence of the matters stated in the document.” 
        
       
      
    183 A provision for a prima facie consequence arising from a certificate is, of course, quite different in its constitutional implications from a conclusive certificate. 
     
      
    184 Mr Burmester submitted, and the Crown adopted his submissions, that although a certificate may assert that steps were taken to enable ASIO to listen to the content of the communication a certificate may not in fact say, relevantly, that there was a download of any particular communication on a particular day. The “critical fact” upon which the applicants primarily relied, is not itself conclusively established. 
     
      
    185 The evidence from ASIO as to what happened on a particular day may be the subject of a certificate, but it would have only prima facie force. The Attorney submits that facts to which a permissible certificate can attest are too far removed from any issue in the criminal trial to constitute an impermissible intrusion on either the separation of powers or trial by jury. It cannot be said, Mr Burmester submitted, that a conclusive certificate is constitutionally impermissible no matter what fact it covers. As I have indicated, I accept that issues of fact and degree arise and in the present case the matters are too far removed, in the sense accepted by Whealy J. 
     
      
    186 In the present case, his Honour’s reasoning, which I accept, is particularly relevant to the issue of leave. The matters to which the certificate relied upon in the present case attests are too far removed from the facts which, on the present state of the Court’s knowledge, are facts in issue. 
     
      
    187 Notwithstanding the limitations placed upon the use of the certificate by the Attorney and the Crown, an important aspect of the case of the applicants on this issue remains intact. There is a chain of evidence issue, in the sense that, without the Optus certificate under challenge, the Crown would not be able to tender the material intercepted by ASIO, as the relevant chain has not been established.  
     
      
    188 Nevertheless, in view of the Crown concessions as to the deployment of the certificate, this consideration is not shown to be of sufficient significance in the likely course of the trial, to justify the grant of leave. 
     
      
    189 Weighing these various considerations, in my opinion, leave to appeal should be refused on both the illegality issue and the chain of evidence issue. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    190 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Time to lodge an application for leave to appeal extended up to and including the date on which the application was filed in matters 2007/2397; 2007/2399; 2007/2400; 2007/2452; 2007/2454; 2007/2455. 
        
       
       
        
        2 Leave to appeal refused in each case.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 On 16 June 2003 an incident occurred on escalator 11 leading to the foyer of the Star City Casino. Mr John McLean, then aged 79, claimed that he fell and suffered injury in the course of that incident.2 The issues involved in deciding the claim were: 
     
      
      1 The circumstances that caused the plaintiff to fall. 
       
      2 Whether those circumstances were the result of the defendant’s neglect. 
       
      3 The extent to which the plaintiff was injured as a result of the incident. 
       
      4 The compensation, if any, to be awarded to the plaintiff. 
      
    ISSUE 1 – THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PLAINTIFF’S FALL3 The plaintiff claimed that the cause of the incident was a malfunction of the handrail on escalator 11.4 The defendant’s response to the claim was that the incident occurred when a patron, Mr Toutounjian, collapsed on the escalator, causing a crush of persons as the escalator arrived at its discharge point.Evidence of the plaintiff and Mrs McLean5 The plaintiff and Mrs McLean gave evidence of their recollections of the incident. The plaintiff said that he and his wife were in the habit of travelling several times each week from their home on the Central Coast to the Casino to play roulette. They travelled by train and took a bus to the Casino. On disembarking from the bus they ascended to an atrium area of the Casino using escalator 11.6 On 16 June 2001 there were six persons on the bus, four of whom stepped onto the escalator ahead of the plaintiff and Mrs McLean. The first of them was a gentleman, identified as Mr Toutounjian. He was followed, in order, by a woman of Asian appearance, two women of European appearance, Mrs McLean and the plaintiff.7 The plaintiff said that on stepping on to the escalator he placed his left hand on the moving rail and noticed that it was hot. The escalator, however, moved normally until the group travelled about half way towards the Casino. At that point the handrail stopped moving but the steps of the escalator continued to move. The plaintiff lost his balance and fell backwards on the escalator. Mrs McLean fell backwards onto him and two of the ladies fell on her.8 The plaintiff thought he had been knocked out because he next found himself at the bottom of the escalator and the escalator had stopped moving. He walked up the escalator, which by then was empty. His concern at this point was to find Mrs McLean.9 He said there were 12 to 14 members of the defendant’s staff milling around at the top of the escalator. Mr Toutounjian was lying parallel to the adjoining descending escalator receiving attention from two men. The lady of Asian appearance was also lying on the floor near the escalator receiving attention from two men. She was bleeding from the left side of her head.10 The plaintiff found Mrs McLean seated on a walled structure near the top of the escalator. She was shocked and had mislaid her handbag. He retrieved it from a point at the top of the escalator.11 He then noticed that blood was dripping from his arm. He was given some paper towels by a Casino employee. Ambulances were called to take Mr Toutounjian and the injured lady to hospital. The plaintiff declined to go with them, stating that his wife was in shock and he wanted to take her home.12 After drinking a hot toddy and waiting a while, they went home.13 Mrs McLean’s evidence added little to this description of the incident. Like the plaintiff, she remembered that the handrail stopped moving so that her left hand was moving behind her while her feet were travelling forward. There followed a real melee with people falling on her so that she fell down. At the top of the escalator a man’s hand took hold of her and pulled her up and off the escalator. She then walked to the wall where she sat, shocked, until the plaintiff found her.Evidence of the defendant 14 The defendant produced three significant pieces of evidence. The defendant tendered the records of the ambulance service and the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where Mr Toutounjian was treated after the incident and called Mr Btaiche, an employee, who was among the first to assist in removing from the escalator persons who were caught in the crush behind the fallen Mr Toutounjian. It produced a DVD that was said to be a compilation of the tapes recorded by security cameras directed at the top of the escalator at the time of the incident.15 Mr Toutounjian was not called to give evidence. The parties agreed that he was not available for that purpose. The ambulance service report recorded that Mr Toutounjian said he felt dizzy prior to falling backwards. The clinical notes of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital confirmed that he reported that, while travelling on the escalator, he was unable to move his left arm and both legs and that he was dizzy.16 Mr Btaiche said that at the time of the incident he was lunching in the Noodle Court with a colleague close to the top of the escalator. He heard women’s voices that had a tone of panic in them. He looked towards the escalator and saw a large man, whom I assumed was Mr Toutounjian, holding the handrails on each side of the escalator and falling backwards on three ladies who were trying to hold him up. With his colleague, he dragged Mr Toutounjian from the escalator. By then he had half fallen on to the escalator. He then assisted the women from the escalator one by one.17 Mr Btaiche did not recognise the plaintiff.18 The plaintiff initially denied that he appeared in the material that was recorded on the DVD. He subsequently agreed that the DVD showed him, after the incident, with Mrs McLean talking to a person at a small table placed beside the top of the escalator and later receiving attention to his injured arm. He agreed that he and Mrs McLean were seen on the DVD describing the incident to a woman, apparently employed by the defendant. The woman can be seen on the DVD taking notes as they, sitting and standing, spoke to her and made movements suggesting they were demonstrating what occurred.19 The plaintiff complained at length about the nature of the materials provided by the defendant. I have already noted that the DVD was said to be a compilation of security tapes.20 Mr Joseki was a surveillance officer at the time of the incident. He explained that each security camera within the Casino was allocated 21 eight hour tapes that were used on a rotating basis. In addition, surveillance officers were allocated three television monitors upon which they viewed the events recorded on the tapes in the security cameras. Mr Joseki said that, when notified of a medical incident, the practice was that a surveillance officer monitored the event until instructed to cease doing so. The surveillance officer then transferred all recordings of the incident onto a composite tape, known as a risk management tape. The original tapes were then returned to service and taped over. Mr Joseki agreed that it was a matter for the surveillance officer to decide which parts of the original tapes were to be copied to the risk management tape and that the duty officer who supervised the control room was permitted to direct that material be included or excluded.21 Mr Joseki agreed that the DVD contained material recorded only by security cameras placed at the top of the escalator. None was taken from a camera placed at the foot of the escalator because this particular camera was normally positioned so that it faced away from the foot of the escalator. Mr Joseki said that if it was turned towards the escalator it was of limited utility because it covered only the very bottom steps.22 The plaintiff’s concerns about the DVD were that the whole of the incident might not have been copied to the risk management tape or that some editing might have occurred to the benefit of the defence.23 The plaintiff further complained that the defendant failed to comply in full with his requests, made by way of subpoenae and notices to produce, for the production of documents. In particular, the defendant failed, without explanation, to produce the handwritten notes taken, apparently by one of its employees, of the description of events provided by the plaintiff and Mrs McLean immediately after the incident.24 A typed Incident Report forming part of Exhibit X reported that the following statement was made by the plaintiff: 
     
      
      A male collapsed on the escalator, falling backwards and knocking my wife and I down. 
      
    25 The Incident Report was compiled by Mr Jones, the defendant’s Security Supervisor on duty at the time of the accident. Mr Jones did not recognise the plaintiff and I considered it unlikely therefore that he took the plaintiff’s statement.26 These deficiencies in the documentation and recording of evidence by the defendant were of concern. Defendants should not be encouraged to act in this manner because of the obvious prejudice to plaintiffs and because withholding materials without explanation might lead to the drawing of inferences that would not assist the defendant.27 In this case, however, I was satisfied that missing material would not assist the plaintiff and that the editing of the taped material did not cause him prejudice. This was because, having identified the plaintiff as the person speaking with a Casino employee after the incident, it was then possible to return to the material at the commencement of the recording and to identify him. He was shown at that point travelling immediately behind Mrs McLean on the still moving escalator in the crush of persons banked up behind the fallen Mr Toutounjian. Although difficult to confirm, it appeared probable that the plaintiff was not standing at that time. A person at the top was shown assisting the plaintiff from the escalator.Was there any associated malfunction of the escalator?28 The question remained whether there was any malfunction of the escalator, in particular the handrail, and if so whether that malfunction contributed materially to the plaintiff’s fall.29 The DVD was of little assistance in determining if the handrail stopped running as claimed by the plaintiff. At one point on the recording, a man appeared to move forward on the escalator while his left hand travelled in a position behind him, indicating that it was possible that the handrail temporarily stopped. At other stages in the recording, the handrail could be seen continuing to run. Mr Adams and Dr Hill observed the same features. Mr Macbeth was the only expert to take the view that the handrail continued to move at all times. 30 Mr Btaiche could not state whether the handrail was operating at the time of the incident. He said that when Mr Toutounjian had his hands on them, there was a slight drag on the handrails.Expert Evidence31 The plaintiff relied on the evidence of Dr Hill, a highly qualified mechanical engineer. The defendant objected to my receiving expert evidence from Dr Hill because his expertise did not extend to the operation of escalators. I was satisfied, however, that Dr Hill’s field of study qualified him to provide opinions on the operation of plant and machinery generally and as such on the operation of the plant and machinery necessary to operate an escalator.32 Dr Hill noted that the plaintiff felt the handrail to be abnormally warm immediately prior to the incident. Dr Hill’s opinion, based on instructions that the handrail came to a complete halt, was that the heat was probably the result of friction causing increased resistance between the handrail and the structures over which it travelled to a point where the drive was unable to overcome the level of resistance imposed and the handrail ceased to operate. His opinion was that friction between moving components usually occurred gradually and that the increase in temperature of the handrail ought to have been recognised as a feature warranting attention. This feature, he said, would be noted if a system of regular inspection were in place. Dr Hill confirmed that the operation of the handrail could be temporarily interrupted.33 The defendant relied on Mr Macbeth, described as an occupational health and safety consultant. The plaintiff did not object to Mr Macbeth’s report notwithstanding that it did not disclose his qualifications, except to state that he retired from WorkCover in August 2003 and that in November 2003 he completed a certificate in occupational health and safety management systems auditing. He did not state the name of the institution at which he undertook this course of study.34 I was not persuaded that Mr Macbeth had the necessary qualification or expertise to provide the opinions contained in his report. Those opinions were directed at: 
     
      
      1 The behaviour of the handrail: from his observations of the DVD and an enhanced version of the recording he concluded that the handrail did not stop running in the course of the incident. 
      
     
     
      
      2 Possible causes of the accident: he concluded that Mr Toutounjian’s fall was the cause. This opinion appeared to be based on the report of an employee of the defendant rather than any independent investigation. 
      
     
     
      
      3 The adequacy of the maintenance regime for the escalators: his conclusion that the regime was adequate appeared to be based, without explanation and without mechanical engineering expertise, on his suggestion that  
      there does not seem to be much maintenance required such as replacement of parts. 
      
    35 I was therefore not assisted by the opinions of Mr Macbeth.36 Mr Macbeth’s opinion that the handrail continued to run was contrary to my conclusion, on viewing of the DVD both in its original form and the enhanced version, that a man appeared to move forward on the escalator while his left hand travelled in a position behind him, indicating that it was possible that the handrail stopped temporarily. Dr Hill and Mr Adams agreed with my observations.37 Dr Hill agreed that the operation of the handrail could be temporarily interrupted. Mr Toutounjian was described by Mr Btaiche as gripping each of the handrails before his collapse. This evidence was confirmed on the DVD where Mr Toutounjian was seen gripping the handrail on the plaintiff’s left hand side.38 There was no reason to reject the evidence of Mr Btaiche that this caused some drag on the handrail. Both the plaintiff and Mrs McLean said that the handrail stopped running. Although the plaintiff was clearly confused about what happened to him in the course of the incident, Mrs McLean’s evidence matched precisely that shown on the DVD. On the basis of her evidence I accept that, more probably than not, the handrail did stop running temporarily as a result of the drag placed on it by Mr Toutounjian’s grip.Post incident investigations39 At the time of the incident Otis Elevator Company Pty Ltd was under contract to the defendant to provide repair and maintenance services to the lifts and escalators at the Casino. Otis Elevator Company employed mechanics, Mr Civitella, who worked full time at the Casino and Mr McKeown, who worked there two days a week and was called in from time to time by Mr Civitella when assistance was needed.40 Mr Civitella said that he carried out his work on a rotation basis so that at intervals of about two weeks he inspected escalator 11, replaced parts where necessary and attended to such cleaning and lubrication as he considered necessary. He completed maintenance reports after each of these inspections in which he described this work as preventative maintenance. His maintenance records indicated that he attended to escalator 11 on 3 June 2003.41 Mr Civitella said that from time to time the drive belts for the handrails of the escalators under his care began to shrink, causing friction and heating in the handrail. The solution to this shrinkage was to cut and extend the drive belt and ultimately to replace the belt. He said this did not cause a problem with the operation of the handrail, except that it reduced the efficiency of its operation.42 Mr Civitella was called to the escalator after the incident. By the time he arrived the escalator had been switched off. It was not started again until the following day, after a WorkCover representative inspected it.43 He denied that he was told that there had been a malfunction in the handrail. As far as he knew, a person had collapsed on the escalator.44 On 17 June 2003 Mr Civitella was present when the WorkCover representative attended at the Casino to inspect the escalator. He opened the machine room for the purposes of inspection and said he did whatever the WorkCover representative asked him to do. He could not remember what that might have been but assumed that he was asked to remove the sides of the escalator to allow for inspection of its mechanism. He did not recall seeing any defects in that mechanism. The WorkCover representative gave permission for the escalator to be put back into operation. Mr Civitella completed a maintenance report on 17 June 2003 with the words Scheduled preventative maintenance and lubricate.45 Mr Civitella said that the escalator operated normally when it was returned to service. He said that, if a handrail ceased to run, it was an indication of a major problem in the operation of an escalator. He saw no such major problem. He agreed that, operating normally, the handrail should not stop moving if a patron fell while holding onto it.46 Mr Civitella made no mention in his evidence about the involvement of Mr McKeown in the inspection of the escalator on 17 June 2003.47 Mr McKeown said he was with Mr Civitella at the Casino between 8.15 am and 2.30 pm. His evidence was that he went to the Casino as fast as possible after he was told by Mr Civitella that an incident had occurred. He said the WorkCover representative left the site before he arrived. This evidence conflicted with the Incident Report that indicated that the WorkCover representative was on site at 11 am on 17 June 2003.48 Mr McKeown said he inspected both handrails and tested them in a fashion that he described as follows: 
     
      
      A. … I put my foot up against the escalator, grabbed the handrail with both hands and physically tried to stop the handrail moving. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. And in attempting that test what, if anything, did you notice? 
      
     
     
      
      A. The handrail had perfect tension on it, it was stone cold which meant it wasn’t running hot, there was no indication there was a problem with the handrail. 
      
     
     
      
      Q. Were you able to stop the handrail? 
      
     
     
      
      A. No. 
      
    49 After this test, Mr McKeown checked the mechanism for any noises but detected no abnormality in its operation.50 The inspection was completed at 12 noon and the escalator was turned on at that time. It was running stone cold and normally. He returned with Mr Civitella after about 45 minutes to confirm that it continued to run normally.51 Mr McKeown said that the development of heat in an escalator handrail would be noticeable immediately and detected by the mechanic or Casino staff so that it could be attended to. He agreed that drag on a handrail indicated that it was not working properly.52 As far as documentation was concerned, Mr McKeown agreed that some documentation would follow the WorkCover inspection but said he had not been involved with it. He assumed that it had been passed on to the defendant’s supervisory staff. He agreed that he completed no maintenance record following his inspection of the escalator.53 Mr McKeown asked for his opinion of how, in addition to working with him until 2.30 pm on escalator 11, Mr Civitella, before he finished his day’s work at 3.30 pm, had time to complete maintenance on the several other items of plant and equipment referred to on the maintenance slip completed by him on 17 June 2003. Mr McKeown agreed that each of the other items listed on the slip normally took 30 to 60 minutes to complete. He suggested that on 17 June 2003 Mr Civitella undertook very rudimentary inspection and maintenance tasks only.54 Mr McKeown said that on inspection he noticed that a new drive belt was in place for the handrail on the left side. This surprised him because he did not attend to its installation. He made a very fine adjustment to the drive belt because it was stretched. Mr Civitella firmly denied that any new drive belt was installed in the left side handrail. 55 No WorkCover documentation was produced in response to the plaintiff’s requests but the Incident Report contained the following entry, dated 20 June 2003, by Daniel Dhiba, the defendant’s occupational health and safety manager: 
     
      
      Further to our conversation and OTIS’ request for Workcover approval before they start the escalators near the noodle bar, John Simbilant, Inspector Workcover has visited today (17/6/03, approx. 11 am) following our request. John instructed OTIS staff on site (Leon) to resume operation of the escalator if they deem is  
      [sic] 
       safe to operate. It is in operation at present. 
      
    56 There was no evidence of any other mechanical defect affecting the operation of escalator 11 after it was returned to service.57 Dr Hill suggested a reason why no defect was identified in the handrail drive belt. He said that friction and resulting heat and drag were the possible results of the accumulation of dust or debris in the mechanism operating the drive belt and it was possible that this material was removed when Mr Civitella applied lubrication the next day. Issue 1 - Findings58 The objective independent evidence of the Ambulance Service and Royal Prince Alfred Hospital records indicated that Mr Toutounjian fell because of a medical condition and not because the handrail stopped running.59 The evidence of Mr Btaiche and the DVD indicated that the plaintiff’s account of what occurred to him in the course of the incident was wrong.60 I reject the plaintiff’s evidence that he fell to the bottom of the escalator and walked up the then static escalator.61 There was no evidence to support the plaintiff’s claim that the handrail was abnormally hot. There were many aspects of the plaintiff’s evidence that proved to be unreliable and in the absence of supporting material I therefore reject this evidence.62 I accept the evidence of Mr Btaiche that pressure placed on the handrail by Mr Toutounjian placed drag upon it. I find it probable that this resulted in a momentary interruption to the operation of the handrail.63 Mr McKeown’s evidence concerning the investigation undertaken after the incident was inconsistent with that of Mr Civitella and in conflict with the evidence concerning the WorkCover inspection. Mr KcKeown’s evidence has been disregarded.64 The investigations undertaken by Mr Civitella revealed no defect in the handrail or the handrail drive belt. The only service undertaken on 17 June 2003 was lubrication. No repair was required and the mechanism operated normally after the escalator was returned to service.65 I accept Dr Hill’s explanation for the momentary interruption to the operation of the handrail.66 In the absence of evidence of significant defect in the mechanism for the operation of the handrail and of other than short term interruption to the operation of the handrail, I find that the probable cause of the melee described by Mrs McLean was Mr Toutounjian’s collapse on the escalator.67 I find that the plaintiff fell on the escalator when he was caught in the crush of persons that resulted from Mr Toutounjian’s collapse.68 I find that the plaintiff did not fall as a result of the momentary interruption to the operation of the handrail.ISSUE 2 - NEGLIGENCE69 The plaintiff claimed that the cause of the malfunction was the negligence of Star City Pty Limited in failing to maintain the escalator adequately, operating the escalator in a defective condition and failing to warn members of the public entering the Casino of known defects in its operation. The defendant denied that the escalator was defective or inadequately maintained.70 In order to succeed in his claim, it was necessary that the plaintiff establish that: 
     
      
      1 There was a foreseeable risk that patrons using the defendant’s escalators would lose balance if the handrail was temporarily interrupted. 
      
     
     
      
      2 The risk was of a magnitude that required the defendant, acting reasonably, to take preventative action. 
      
     
     
      
      3 Acting reasonably, the defendant ought to have taken preventative action that would protect the plaintiff against the risk. 
      
    Foreseeability71 The evidence indicated that in June 2003 the defendant had more than an appreciation of a potential risk of injury to persons using its escalators in the event that the handrail ceased to operate while the steps of the escalator continued to run. 72 There was a prior incident on escalator 9 in June 2000 in exactly the circumstances claimed by the plaintiff. On that occasion a patron suffered injury after falling backwards when the handrail stopped running while the steps continued moving. 73 The defendant was aware that the risk was recognised by Standards Australia to the point where Australian Standard 1735.5 was introduced requiring that handrail monitors be installed in all escalators in public use after that date.74 The defendant received recommendations from Thomson Elevator Consultancy Services and recommendations and quotations from Otis Elevator Company for the installation of handrail monitors.75 Mr Fitzgerald, a member of the defendant staff responsible for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of its escalators requested funding to implement the recommendations of the installation of handrail monitors. Funding was not forthcoming. There was no evidence that cost of the installation of the handrail monitors was beyond the defendant’s means. In fact, funding was provided and the handrail monitors were installed in the 2006/2007 year.Prevention76 The plaintiff pointed to a number of features as evidence that the defendant failed to take appropriate preventative action.77 There was evidence that for a period the escalators were in poor condition and were operating inefficiently. There were records of multiple defects to which technicians were called in 2001 and 2002 and to a lesser extent in 2003.78 The plaintiff’s statement that the handrail was unusually hot on the morning of the incident suggested to Dr Hill that there was friction affecting the handrail drive belt and that it was not operating properly. Dr Hill and Mr Adams suggested that, if a regime of regular inspection was in place, this defect would be noted and maintenance undertaken. 79 Mr Btaiche noted drag in the handrail when it was gripped by Mr Toutounjian. This was another feature that one might expect to be noted in the course of a regime of regular inspection.80 Mr Civitella and Mr McKeown said that handrail drive belts from time to time required adjustment.81 There was inconsistency in the evidence of Mr Civitella and Mr McKeown on the matter of whether a new drive belt had recently been fitted to the left handrail on escalator 11. Mr McKeown said he thought it necessary to adjust the belt in the course of his inspection on 17 June 2003.82 It was suggested that I should draw an inference adverse to the defendant from the absence of evidence of the WorkCover inspector concerning the condition of the escalator on inspection on the day following the incident.83 The defendant offered no explanation for its failure to adopt the recommendations to install handrail monitors.84 The defendant responded to these points as follows.85 Inspection of the escalator before it was returned to service disclosed no defect in the handrail or the handrail drive belt.86 There was evidence of a concentrated effort by the defendant and its contractor, Otis Elevator Company, in upgrading escalators and lifts at the Casino to the point where Thomson Elevator Consultancy Services reported substantial improvements and a reduction by one half in 2002 in the fault rate of these items of equipment. It also reported that by December 2002 internal escalators were not suffering from handrail or any other general issues.87 Thompson Elevator Consultancy Services, in December 2002, identified seven faults on escalator 11, one of which related to pulsing in the handrail while it was in motion. The report did not specify whether it was referring to the left or the right handrail. 88 Mr Civitella agreed that pulsing in a handrail was an indication that friction was occurring and stated that the defect was easily rectified by extending its length. There was evidence in the maintenance records that the right handrail was extended on 7 January 2003, suggesting that it was this handrail that was affected. There was no similar record dealing with the left hand rail, although a report provided to the defendant by Otis Elevator Company in March 2003 made reference to planned repairs that included lengthening both handrails.89 The interruption to the operation of the handrail was momentary. There was no evidence to establish the effect that a handrail monitor would have in such circumstances. Dr Hill, the only expert with mechanical engineering qualifications, was unable to assist the court on this question. It was left therefore to speculation to decide whether the handrail monitor would have assisted in preventing injury to the plaintiff.90 There was no statutory obligation to upgrade the defendant’s escalators by installing handrail monitors in existing equipment.91 The defendant had in place a comprehensive regime of repair and maintenance, described as follows: 
     
      
      1 Mr Fitzgerald was engaged by the defendant as its facilities contracts supervisor. His responsibilities included: 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) Managing contracts entered into between the defendant and various contractors for the maintenance and operation of the facilities of the Casino; 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) Walking the Casino on a daily basis and checking its facilities including the escalators. His inspection involved checking the escalators by touching their handrails to check for heat and to note whether the handrail was running at the same speed as the steps. He also took hold of the handrails at each end of the escalators and, if he was able to stop the handrails from running, he switched off the escalator, barricaded it and called the technician. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) He inspected one half of the 21 escalators in the Casino each day with the result that escalator 11 was inspected two to three times each week. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Mr Fitzgerald said he had no concerns with escalator 11 between January and June 2003. 
      
     
     
      
      2 The defendant also employed two facilities shift managers who were responsible for supervision of the Casino’s facilities on a 24 hour basis. The shift managers worked 12 hour shifts and were responsible for supervising up to 20 technicians during the day and four technicians at night. They had authority to shut down an escalator when warranted by a defect presenting a hazard to patrons or staff. 
      
     
     
      
      3 The defendant engaged Thomson Elevator Consultancy Services to conduct an annual audit of its escalators and lifts and to identify hazards and risks that required attention. 
      
     
     
      
      4 The defendant held a contract with a reputable company, Otis Elevator Company, that required that the escalators be serviced and maintained to specified standards. There was no evidence that the specified standards were inadequate. 
      
     
     
      
      5 The contract required that Otis Elevator Company provide personnel, including Mr Civitella who was based at the Casino between 7 am and 3.30 pm on weekdays. Mr McKeown, also employed by Otis Elevator Company, was responsible for supervising Mr Civitella. He worked at the Casino between the same hours on two days each week. Additional staffing was provided for major repairs. 
      
     
     
      
      6 Mr Civitella serviced the escalators on a rotation basis, so that each escalator received his attention at two weekly intervals. 
      
    Issue 2 - Findings92 In the light of the pleadings and my findings on issue one, the examination of the extent to which the defendant breached its duty of care to the plaintiff could only relate to the condition of the mechanism operating the handrail that allowed for drag and the interruption to the operation of the handrail when pressure was placed upon it.93 There was no evidence that the installation of a handrail monitor would have prevented the plaintiff’s fall, even if that fall had been the result of destabilisation following the temporary interruption to the operation of the handrail.94 Dr Hill and Mr Adams both stated that such a fault could be detected if a proper system of inspection were in place. They did not express opinions about the level of inspection that they considered would be reasonable. They did not express opinions on the regime operating at the Casino at the time of the incident.95 I was satisfied by the evidence that the defendant’s system for repair, maintenance and inspection of its escalators at the Casino at the time of the incident was comprehensive, reasonable and adequate.96 I find that the momentary interruption to the operation of the handrail was not the result of negligence on the part of the defendant.ISSUE 3 – INJURIES CAUSED BY THE INCIDENT97 The plaintiff claimed that as a result of his fall he suffered the cuts to his arm to which I have already referred. He also claimed that his shoulder came into contact with the side of the escalator as he fell. His injuries were listed as: 
     
      
      Shock 
       
      Injury to the cervical spine 
       
      Aggravation of pre-existing conditions in his cervical spine 
       
      The development of MRSA infection 
       
      Scarring and disfigurement 
       
      Aggravation of a pre-existing injury to his lumbar spine 
      
    98 I did not doubt that the incident caused the plaintiff to suffer some shock but there was no evidence to establish that it resulted in any diagnosable condition. This part of his claim was not considered further.99 There was evidence that the plaintiff suffered from a longstanding condition affecting his cervical spine. After a sudden significant deterioration of the symptoms in his neck, involving pain in his neck and shoulders and loss of power in his hands, surgery in the nature of anterior decompression and fusion at the C3-4 and C6-7 levels was undertaken in 1999. The plaintiff conceded that he always held the view that the problems with his neck were caused in 1959 by a work related incident where he struck his head on the roof of a mine. He continued to press this claim after the incident. Coal Mines Insurance rejected his claim of a work related injury to his cervical spine.100 There was evidence that the plaintiff suffered from a longstanding condition affecting his lumbar spine, the result of injury suffered in the course of his work as a coal miner. His problems were attended to surgically in 1955, 1986 and 1994 with laminectomies and fusion of lumbar vertebrae. Further surgery was undertaken in 2004. Coal Mines Insurance accepted liability for this injury prior to the incident at the Casino and met the plaintiff’s medical expenses for his treatment.The Cervical Spine101 The most significant part of the plaintiff's claim related to an alleged severe aggravation of the condition of his cervical spine. There were a number of significant problems facing the plaintiff in establishing a connection between the incident and the subsequent deterioration in the condition of his cervical spine.The development of symptoms102 The plaintiff and Mrs McLean said that symptoms in his neck developed soon after the incident. Mrs McLean said that she noticed that the plaintiff became less steady on his feet and that he started to bump into things.103 The plaintiff said that he suffered three episodes when he passed out and vomited. One took place on the golf course and another at a railway station. He said they occurred within a short period of time in about November 2003. He then developed further symptoms involving loss of power in his arms and shoulders.104 These symptoms led him to consult Dr Farey in May 2004 and further surgery was undertaken on his cervical spine in June 2004. A complication arose and further surgery was undertaken in March 2005. The plaintiff's recovery from this surgery was complicated by an MRSA infection that was diagnosed in June 2005.105 The claims made by the plaintiff and Mrs McLean that he suffered symptoms in relation to his neck shortly after the incident were not supported by medical records. The plaintiff consulted his general practitioner, Dr Phadke, on 18 and 26 June 2003. Dr Phadke's notes refer to multiple skin wounds on the right forearm that were healing well and to a complaint of back pain. The next relevant note was made by Dr Phadke on 19 December 2003 to the effect that the plaintiff still had back pain. He referred the plaintiff for x-ray of his lumbar spine.106 The first medical record of any concern relating to the plaintiff’s cervical spine was contained in a letter from Dr Chia, Royal North Shore Hospital, to Dr Phadke dated 14 May 2004 concerning osteoarthritis in the plaintiff’s left knee but concluding with the words … we have asked him to resolve his neck issue  before a knee replacement was done.107 The plaintiff also consulted Dr Farey, the orthopaedic surgeon whom he consulted in relation to his neck on 14 May 2004. Dr Farey reported that the plaintiff told him on that date that he developed neck pain and further symptoms of spinal cord compression after an assault at Star City Casino on 16 June 2004. He complained that his hands were clumsy and that he suffered from increased numbness in his hands and feet and a recurrence of unsteadiness of gait.108 Investigations undertaken at the request of Dr Farey identified a disc protrusion at C5/6 and other degenerative changes. The plaintiff was admitted to Royal North Shore Hospital on 23 June 2004 and surgery was undertaken by Dr Farey on 25 June 2004 for anterior decompression and fusion at the C4/5 and C5/6 levels.109 The notes made at the time the plaintiff was admitted to the Hospital record that the plaintiff stated that he suffered weakness and numbness in his arms and hands for the last few months. The Physiotherapy Department recorded the date March 2004 and gradual deterioration affecting the plaintiff’s legs, arms, neck and shoulders.110 Ms Walker reported that she was informed that the plaintiff’s symptoms developed in December 2003. Dr Ghabrial was told that the symptoms commenced after the incident on 16 June 2003.111 Dr Khan recorded that the plaintiff developed a recurrence of symptoms of weakness in his arms and legs in May 2004. 112 The plaintiff was examined by Dr Potter in February 2005 and Dr Rowe in March 2005 at the request of Coal Mines Insurance. The plaintiff at that stage was pressing claims that his medical problems affecting his lumbar and cervical spine were work related. Dr Potter recorded: He cannot recall any further recent neck injury … and there was no reference in his report to the incident.  Similarly, there was no reference to the incident in Dr Rowe’s report. He reported that the plaintiff informed him that the cervical fusion undertaken in 1999 was not successful so that another fusion was required in 2004.113 The plaintiff said he made a deliberate decision not to disclose to Dr Rowe the injury he claimed he suffered in the incident. He said he did not like Dr Rowe because he had never written a report that favoured him. The plaintiff denied that he made similar decisions to withhold his claimed neck injury from Dr Potter and Dr Ruff, the orthopaedic surgeon who treated him for his lumbar spine. He denied that he deliberately withheld information about the incident because he feared that it would affect negatively his claim on Coal Mines Insurance.114 Dr Sage was interested to know dates of the three episodes when the plaintiff said he passed out and vomited. He said if they occurred close to June 2003 that a connection was highly likely. The plaintiff said they occurred within a short space of time in November 2003.115 Dr Phadke had no record of these episodes. The plaintiff said he did not formally consult Dr Phadke in respect of them because he recovered quickly. He suggested he might have mentioned them to Dr Phadke informally at the golf club. 116 There was evidence indicating that the plaintiff suffered from episodes prior to June 2003. Dr Phadke’s notes referred to two turns suffered by the plaintiff in January 2002 and February 2003, involving sudden memory loss for short periods. Dr Kleinman reported on 25 August 2000: 
     
      
      He has developed a new set of problems recently, on 3 occasions he has suddenly developed a severe cramp in the left leg just above the ankle and then has blanked out and when he has woken up he has found that he has vomited profusely but the pain has gone from his leg. This is very odd and suggests that something is happening above the foramen magnum and he should certainly be seen by either a Neurosurgeon and Neurologist to establish a cause for these rather bizarre symptoms. 
      
    117 There was evidence indicating that a golf course incident occurred in August 2004. Dr Phadke recorded on 27 August 2004: 
     
      
      FEW DAYS BACK HE AS  
      [sic]  
      WALKING ON THE GOLF COURSE AND FELT UNWELL 
       
      THAT NIGHT WENT TO WYONG HOSPITAL HAD IV FLUIDS WAS TOLD HE HAS PNEUMONIA 
       
      HAD ANTIBIOTICS 
       
      HAS BEEN ON RULIDE AND AMOXIL 
       
      FEELS MUCH BETTER 
      
    118 Dr Farey reported that he was not able to state that the incident was the cause of the subsequent further cervical disc protrusion. He accepted that a head or neck injury could exacerbate an underlying condition but pointed out that the prior spinal fusion might accelerate degeneration at levels adjacent to the fusion. This, he said, could be the cause of the deterioration of the plaintiff’s condition with respect to neck pain or disc protrusion.119 Similarly, Dr Sage, on the information available to him was unable to conclude that there was a connection. He noted that Dr Farey did not appear to believe that there was a strong connection. He referred to his difficulties in obtaining from the plaintiff a history of significant neck aggravation after the incident and to the absence of record of complaint in Dr Phadke’s notes. Like Dr Farey, he pointed to the propensity for spontaneous prolapses of cervical discs to occur, particularly in the circumstances of a pre-existing fusion.120 Dr Sage, reporting in July 2007, said: 
     
      
      From his history today you can pick up when the cord compression occurred from a large prolapse at the C5/6 level, probably sequestrated. This occurred at a golf course where his wife was playing, but he was not. Neither he nor his wife were able to give me the date, but he saw Dr Farey in May 2004 and since he had a significant problem it is likely it was only a short period before this time. 
      
    121 Dr Sage went on to note that, although Mrs McLean said that the plaintiff was significantly affected by the Casino incident, there was no mention in the general practitioner’s notes of what would be noticeable co-ordination problems if they were in fact significant.122 Dr Kahn, referring to the absence of record of complaint in relation to the neck and the apparent development of symptoms 10 months after the incident in May 2004, was of the opinion that the plaintiff did not sustain any significant aggravation to his cervical spine and the disc protrusion at C6/7 was not the consequence of the fall on 16 June 2003. Rather, the condition treated in 2004 was due to progression of the plaintiff’s degenerative condition in the cervical spine which might have been accelerated by previous surgery and fusion at the C3/4 and C6/7 levels.Lumbar Spine123 There was evidence that the plaintiff complained of increased back pain after the incident and that these complaints resulted in further investigations that were undertaken in December 2003.124 He consulted Dr Ruff, orthopaedic surgeon, and, after some delay to allow for surgery to his cervical spine, Dr Ruff performed decompression surgery at various levels of his lumbar spine in October 2004. Dr Ruff reported that the plaintiff made good progress after surgery with excellent relief of his symptoms and good return to normal function. 125 Dr Potter and Dr Rowe reported the plaintiff’s view that back surgery was not as effective as suggested by Dr Ruff. Dr Potter reported that the plaintiff was using a brace and that he complained of ongoing back and bilateral leg complaints and instability and proprioceptive problems. Similar complaints were made to Dr Rowe who added that the plaintiff relied on a walking stick because of poor balance.126 There was no suggestion in the evidence that these problems were related to the incident rather than to the long standing condition of the plaintiff’s lumbar spine as a result of a work injury.127 Dr Kahn reported in February 2006 that the soreness in the plaintiff’s back had settled. He concluded that he suffered a temporary aggravation of the pre-existing condition that lasted for a period of some weeks or months.Issue 3 - Findings128 The evidence of the plaintiff and Mrs McLean that he experienced symptoms in his neck immediately after the incident is rejected in the absence of any medical record to confirm it.129 I accept the opinion of Dr Sage that, having regard to the significance of the claimed problems, it was likely that his neck symptoms developed a short period before he consulted Dr Farey in May 2004 and that symptoms of such significance would be recorded in the general practitioner’s notes if they occurred prior to that date.130 The plaintiff’s admission that he made a deliberate decision not to disclose to Dr Rowe that after the incident he developed back and neck symptoms indicated his capacity for deceit and added support to the proposition that the incident did not further injure the cervical spine or significantly aggravate the pre-existing condition.131 I reject the plaintiff’s evidence that he did not make a similar deliberate decision to withhold information about the incident from Dr Potter and Dr Ruff. I find that he did so because he was concerned that the information would negatively affect the claims he was then making on Coal Mines Insurance.132 I reject the plaintiff’s evidence that three episodes occurring in November 2003 were indicative of the time at which the further cervical disc prolapse occurred. It was apparent that the plaintiff suffered from similar episodes prior to the incident.133 I reject the plaintiff’s evidence that the episodes he claimed occurred in November 2003 would not be reported to his general practitioner. A number of previous episodes were reported and recorded. An episode occurring on the golf course more than one year later was reported to his general practitioner and recorded.134 There was no expert medical opinion to support any claim that connected the injuries suffered by the plaintiff in the incident and the subsequent cervical disc prolapse.135 It was not submitted by the plaintiff that injuries suffered in the incident generated the need for the surgery undertaken by Dr Ruff to the lumbar spine.136 There was no evidence of aggravation of symptoms in the plaintiff’s neck and this aspect of his claim is rejected.137 I accept Dr Khan’s opinion that the plaintiff suffered a temporary aggravation of symptoms in his lumbar spine.138 I accept that the plaintiff suffered multiple lacerations to his right forearm in the incident and that they healed shortly after the incident.ISSUE 4 - ASSESSMENTDisabilities139 It follows from the findings on the issue of the injuries suffered in the incident that the disabilities of which the plaintiff complained were not the result of injuries suffered in the incident. Further, there was considerable inconsistency between the plaintiff’s evidence and the medical records.140 Conceding the longstanding conditions affecting his lumbar and cervical spines, the plaintiff said that at the time of the incident he was maintaining an active lifestyle. He continued to play golf relying on transport rather than walking around the golf course. He helped Mrs McLean with housework by vacuum cleaning each Friday. He was driving without restriction and visiting the Casino twice a week. He was able to mow his lawn and attend to external maintenance in his home.141 The plaintiff said that prior to the incident he had no symptoms in his neck and that his residual back pain was managed with Brufen, a pain killing medication that he took daily. He and Mrs McLean travelled from time to time with their caravan. 142 The plaintiff said that after the accident he suffered from increased pain in his back and his neck. He could no longer play golf. The caravan was disposed of because he could no longer manage the physical effort of setting it up. He continued to manage his increased back pain with Brufen, although his activities were further restricted. He could not mow the lawn or undertake external house maintenance such as cleaning gutters, painting and using a ladder. He could only assist with car washing.143 The plaintiff said he recovered from surgery but that he suffered from disabilities affecting his capacity to balance and further restricting his neck movement. In particular, he said that he was unable to drive long distances because of his difficulty in turning his head to check for vehicles to the side of his car.144 The plaintiff denied that his neck movements were restricted prior to the accident to the point where he experienced difficulty driving. He maintained this denial notwithstanding the record of the evidence that he gave before his Honour Judge Bishop in the Compensation Court on 19 March 2001 to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        His Honour 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. … How are you yourself finding that results of the neck surgery. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A. Well, I wake up in the morning with a stiff neck and I have a 30 to 40 per cent disability in turning, driving the car, you know, you're looking for that blind spot. I can't get round there to see that. 
        
       
      
    145 The plaintiff said that he had plucked out of the air the 30% to 40% disability figure given to Judge Bishop. This explanation by the plaintiff was undermined by a report of Dr Kleinman dated 25 August 2000 in which he noted on examination that the plaintiff had only 50% of the normal range of movement in his neck and that the plaintiff told him that he had neck pain and stiffness so that it was hard for him to turn his head to the right and left when driving.146 The plaintiff said nothing in his evidence in chief of problems with long term left leg sciatic pain and wasted thigh muscles. They were raised with him in cross-examination when he agreed that they caused him to limp. He denied that the problems increased to the point where they significantly disabled him or had any impact on his level of activity in 2003. This evidence was contradicted by reports of Dr Ellis and Dr Rowe in April 2003, two months prior to the incident.147 Dr Ellis diagnosed osteoarthritis of the left knee noting that the plaintiff's knee pain was worse with activity and that his capacity for walking had reduced over time. Dr Ellis recommended a total knee replacement.148 Dr Rowe recorded that the plaintiff complained of soreness in his left knee dating from 1997 and of aching in the knee with certain activity. He recorded that the plaintiff told him that that he felt that the knee would restrict him to the house if he did not have a total knee replacement and that he would need a wheelchair. Dr Rowe did not consider the knee replacement was warranted.149 The plaintiff's evidence that the condition of his left leg had not deteriorated over time was contrary to the request he made in November 2006 to Coal Mines Insurance for a mobile chair scooter on the basis that his capacity to walk was restricted by the condition of his left knee and associated muscle wasting.150 The plaintiff’s claim that he could no longer play golf was undermined by material in Ms Walker’s report, dated December 2005, to the effect that, prior to the incident he played golf three times a week and after it only once a week. She reported that on a typical day the plaintiff might join friends for a round of golf and that he drove a panel van in order to transport his golf clubs.151 Ms Walker also reported that Mrs McLean told her that the plaintiff stopped most of his usual heavy tasks because his low back pain and sciatica were exacerbated by the fall in June 2003.Issue 4 - Findings152 The evidence established that the plaintiff was less physically active at the time of the incident than he claimed.153 I have no doubt, however, that the plaintiff, at the age of 83 and with serious conditions affecting his spine and left leg, is restricted in his capacity to undertake physical activity. 154 Some of those restrictions pre-existed the incident. Others have developed since the incident but are the result of the ongoing progression of pre-existing conditions. They are not the result of injuries suffered in the incident that occurred on the defendant’s premises on 16 June 2003.155 The effect of the injuries that were suffered, namely, lacerations to his right arm and temporary aggravation of the pre-existing condition of his lumbar spine was of short term consequence.156 The consequences of the injuries were limited to the point where the plaintiff did not reach the threshold of 15% of a most extreme case and he therefore did not qualify for compensation for non economic loss.157 The plaintiff might well require the attendant care services and the equipment recommended by Ms Walker. The need for those services and equipment was not generated by the injuries suffered in the incident. Any short term additional need for attendant care services did not meet the threshold requirements of six hours per week for a period of six months. The plaintiff therefore did not qualify for compensation for attendant care services.158 The plaintiff consulted Dr Phadke on a limited number of occasions for treatment after the incident. His out of pocket expenses would extend to the cost of those consultations only.ORDERS159 Verdict for the defendant.160 The plaintiff is to pay the defendant’s costs of the proceedings. This order is suspended until 22 August 2008 to allow either party to list the proceedings for further argument on the issue of costs.161 Exhibits will be retained for 28 days or until further order.

   JUDGMENT1 Robert Kauter appears for sentence today having pleaded guilty at the first opportunity to an offence of supplying a commercial quantity of ecstasy. When I sentence him for that matter he asks that I take into account three other matters, one relating to the supply of ketamine, one to the supply of cocaine and a third offence of possessing a restricted substance, namely Viagra.2 The offender’s wrongdoing came to the attention of police when they were conducting one of their now familiar drug dog operations. This time it was police dog Chilli, which the police used. I know that the day of the offender’s arrest was shortly before the Mardi Gras and one suspects that police may have been rather active in their efforts because of the relationship between the Mardi Gras and drug use. The drug dog indicated a scent of prohibited drug around the offender when they were patrolling in the Mansions Hotel in Kings Cross at about 7.30pm on 1 March this year. The offender provided an excuse, saying that he had earlier had a smoke, but police took the offender to the male toilets where they began to search him. They there discovered a quantity of cocaine and some tablets which later proved to be ecstasy. 3 The offender was arrested and taken back to the police station and interviewed. The offender was less than truthful in that interview. However, during the course of it he consented to police going to the unit where he lived in order that they could conduct a further search. The offender, police and Chilli therefore, went to the offender’s unit in Kellett Street, Kings Cross. With the assistance of the dog, police discovered a large quantity of light green coloured pills. They turned out to be ecstasy on later examination. They were identical to the ones earlier located on the offender. Police also discovered more cocaine. 4 On this occasion, the offender admitted that he had a substantial quantity of ecstasy tablets. Police asked him to estimate how many tablets there were. He said that there were between three hundred and four hundred. The offender knew full well at that stage that there were more tablets but attempted to minimise his wrongdoing when he spoke to the police during the interview. In fact, as he told me during the course of his evidence in court today, there were five hundred tablets. A simple mathematical calculation suggests that that figure is much more likely to be correct than the three to four hundred figure which the offender earlier gave. 5 When he was asked about the cocaine he said that he did not intend to sell the cocaine. His admission of guilt in relation to that matter was explained on the basis that he intended to share it. A similar situation applies to the ketamine.6 The offender told police about the ketamine when he volunteered that he had a Holden Commodore parked outside his home unit which he believed may contain further drugs. It was there that police discovered the Viagra, but also the ketamine to which I have made earlier reference. The fact that the offender volunteered to police information which led to them seizing the Viagra and the ketamine is a matter clearly to the offender’s credit.7 The ecstasy tablets weighed, in total, one hundred and forty-three grams. The commercial quantity of ecstasy is one hundred and twenty-five grams, and the large commercial quantity is five hundred grams.8 The offender explains that he had been dealing in ecstasy tablets for some time in order to fund his substantial addiction to cocaine. He says that he had more ecstasy tablets in his possession on 1 March than he would usually because of the Mardi Gras. He clearly saw that there was going to be increased demand and he was determined to satisfy that increased demand. He took advantage of the relationship between the Mardi Gras and ecstasy use to maximise the amount of money he would make, in turn so that he could maximise his cocaine use.9 The legislature has comparatively recently turned its attention to sentences imposed for offences such as commercial drug supply. For many years the maximum penalty for that offence was twenty years imprisonment but the legislature introduced, in 2002 I think it was, the concept of a standard non-parole period for selected offences. This is one of those. The standard non-parole period for this offence is ten years. Thus one would expect, absent a plea of guilty, in cases where the objective criminality is in the middle of the range, a number of non-parole periods in the order of ten years would be imposed. I will return to that expectation later in these remarks. One thing is clear, however, and that is that the legislature intended that penalties for offences such as this should increase. The legislature clearly expected that judges would respond to the imposition of a standard non-parole period by increasing, and significantly so, sentences which had previously been imposed for commercial drug supply. 10 There is little to explain why the offender became involved in such a serious crime. He had a stable upbringing, has the support of family and friends, and was always in employment. Indeed, at the time of this offence he was earning good money. His employer at that time who gave evidence before me today, described him as a valuable employee and said that when he checked out his references when Mr Kauter applied for the job he discovered that he had been well regarded by previous employers as well. The only explanation as to why the offender became a drug supplier, and a significant one at that, is that he himself became a drug user and needed to fund his drug addiction. As is often the case, the offender’s drug use started out at a reasonable level but then progressed to the extent that he had a serious addiction, something he was not prepared to admit to himself, let alone to his friends and family.11 The offender was a man of prior good character, subject to two qualifications. One is immaterial. He has an earlier conviction for driving whilst disqualified, but I propose to disregard that. The other qualification is that he, as a regular drug user, was a person who regularly committed criminal offences relating to his purchase and use of prohibited drugs. He progressed to the stage where his drug dealing became what I would call “large scale”. Five hundred tablets of ecstasy is a very significant quantity. In addition, there are other factors suggesting large scale drug dealing such as the fact that when police searched his home they found five mobile phones - one of those may well have been his then girlfriend’s - and numerous plastic bags. Even if, of course, the mobile phones and the plastic bags had an innocent explanation the number of tablets themselves is suggestive of large scale drug dealing. The offender also had scales and Glucodin. He gave evidence that they were related to his personal drug use and had nothing to do with him supplying for sale any drugs. Notwithstanding some hesitation I will accept what the offender says. I will accept that the offender is remorseful. He gave evidence about his experience in custody since 1 March this year and his somewhat belated recognition of the impact that drugs have upon the lives of almost every member of the community. He recognises, as do most of us with experience in the criminal law, that an enormous proportion of those in custody are there because they have committed drug related offences, whether they are directly related to drug supply and use, or indirectly, as addicts commit all manner of offences in order to obtain drugs to satisfy their own addiction. The offender was perhaps not in the best position to rationally think about his drug supply activities, being a significant drug user himself, but since he has given up drugs whilst in custody it appears that it has finally dawned on him that a blasé approach to these offences is no longer appropriate.12 One of the matters I am required to consider is whether the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend in the future. Frankly, I do not know whether he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend in the future given the extent of his offending and the depth of his drug addiction, but that does not mean that I have entirely disregarded his prospects of rehabilitation and the chance that he will not re-offend. Just because a matter does not reach the level provided for in s 21A(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act does not mean that it is irrelevant. Whether it reaches that standard or not it is a matter I am required to take into account and I have done so. He does have some prospects of rehabilitation. Certainly he gave evidence suggesting that he had a very strong desire to rehabilitate himself now that he realises many things he did not realise before. But, as I say, given the extent of his criminality and given the level to which he became addicted to drugs I cannot describe his prospects of rehabilitation as good.13 One of the matters that I must identify is where in the objective range of seriousness this offence falls. Mr Hamill submitted that I would find that the offence was lower than the midrange. He relied in particular on the quantity involved. As I mentioned, commercial quantity offences extend from one hundred and twenty-five grams to five hundred grams, and the offender’s criminality was one hundred and forty-three grams. 14 Mr Hamill also relied on a submission that this was a one-off because of the Mardi Gras. I do not regard that as relevant to my assessment of the objective gravity of this offence. The fact that it was committed on perhaps one occasion, only does not make the offence itself objectively less grave. 15 Nevertheless, I am prepared to find that the offence is less than the midrange of offences of this type, because of the quantity involved. This is not to suggest some sort of mathematical approach, but bearing in mind that one of the most important factors in deciding the objective gravity of a drug supply crime is the quantity of drug supplied, the quantity on this occasion is what has primarily persuaded me to make the finding that the objective gravity is less than the midrange. Of course the standard non-parole period is not of direct application in any case because of the plea of guilty which was entered at the first opportunity thereby entitling the offender to a discount on the sentence he would otherwise have received of twenty-five per cent. Nevertheless, the standard non-parole period remains as a guidepost which I must bear firmly in mind. 16 Let me return now to the question of the sentencing statistics which I mentioned earlier in these remarks. 17 Notwithstanding that the sample size is relatively small I do regard it as significant that not one non-parole period more than six years has apparently been imposed since the imposition of standard non-parole periods. If the standard non-parole period is ten years one might have expected that at least one of the twenty-six cases got what the legislature described as the standard. Of course, the obvious explanation for this conundrum is that all of the twenty-six cases involved pleas of guilty. It may be that that is the case. But even given that consideration the relationship between the statistics and the standard non-parole period suggests that there must have been quite peculiar factors which have led to what, in the light of the standard non-parole period, are very lenient sentences. There must have been unusual factors which have led to sentences which, on their face, fail to reflect the legislature’s attitude towards sentences for offences of this type, as reflected in the standard non-parole period. 18 The Court of Criminal Appeal has, on many occasions, suggested that sentencing statistics are of limited utility because little information about such cases is provided by the statistics themselves. This puts me in something of a difficult position. The legislature say one thing, the sentencing statistics, on their face, suggest something else and the only way of resolving it is to assume that each of the twenty-six cases in the statistics had a very unusual feature.19 In this case, there is one matter firmly in the offender’s favour and that is that absent his drug use and drug supply there is much to be said for him. He is clearly an intelligent man, valued by his current employer to the extent that a job remains open for him when he is eventually released from custody. 20 Perhaps this case demonstrates the evil which drug supply is, that a man with much to contribute to society, such as Mr Kauter, could, through people supplying him with drugs, turn into a person who is willing to inflict the same problems on others by supplying drugs to them. It demonstrates the real scourge that drug use and drug supply is in our community. For that reason offences such as this require sentences which provide a significant level of general deterrence. There is also a need for retribution in this case, heightened by the fact that there are Form 1 matters to be taken into account.21 It is accepted that only a custodial sentence and a full time one is appropriate in this case. The offender was clearly trafficking to a substantial degree and there is nothing at all to suggest any exceptional circumstances which would justify other than a full time custodial sentence. It must be a sentence of some considerable length, too, for the reasons that I have earlier identified. In particular, there is a need to deter others who might be tempted to fund their drug addictions through large scale drug supply. 22 There are special circumstances in this case. This will be the offender’s first time in custody and a longer period of supervision on parole will aid in the offender’s rehabilitation which in turn will benefit not only him but the community. It is in the community’s interests, as well as the offender’s, that he commit no further offences in the future and an extended period of supervision on parole will assist that objective.23 This case should serve as an example to others who may think that drug use is benign. The offender has demonstrated how easy it is to allow drug use to take over a part of a person’s life to the extent that they commit offences of such gravity that they are required to spend a lengthy time in custody. The offender’s drug use caused his life to spiral down out of control to the stage where he himself was prepared to supply drugs to others who in turn may have found their lives spiralling down out of control as well.24 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of three years to date from 1 March 2008 and a head sentence of six years. The non-parole period will expire on 28 February 2011 on which day the offender is eligible to be released to parole.25 Are there any other orders required, Madam Crown, Mr Hamill?26 DODDS: Yes, your Honour, an order for the destruction of the drugs and the restricted substance.27 HIS HONOUR: The drugs and the restricted substance, the Viagra tablets, are to be destroyed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: This is the concurrent hearing of two appeals. Each appellant was convicted before his Honour Judge Bennett SC on 21 July 2006 of an offence against s 270.6(2) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth).  
     
      
    2 The indictment against the appellant Sieders alleged that he: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about 1 December 2003 and 31 May 2004 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales conducted a business, namely a brothel, that involved the sexual servitude of other persons, knowing about that sexual servitude, contrary to s 270.6(2) of the  
        Criminal Code Act  
        1995 
          
        (Cth).” 
        
       
       
      The indictment against the appellant Somsri was identical, save only that instead of saying  
      “namely a brothel” 
       it said  
      “namely brothels” 
      .  
       
      
    3 The two appellants were sentenced on 8 December 2006. The appellant Somsri was sentenced to an overall term of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2½ years, each of which periods commenced on 9 July 2006. The appellant Sieders was sentenced to an overall term of 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years, each of which were to commence on 27 May 2006. The differing commencement dates of the sentences directly reflected differences in the period that each appellant had been in custody before being sentenced. 
     
      
    4 The provisions of the Criminal Code that are of central relevance to these appeals are: 
     
      
       
        
        270.4 Definition of  
        sexual servitude

          (a) a threat of force; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a threat to cause a person’s deportation; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) a threat of any other detrimental action unless there are reasonable grounds for the threat of that action in connection with the provision of sexual services by a person.

          conducting a business  
          includes:

    5 Section 270.5 required there to be both a territorial nexus of a particular type with Australia, and an element of conduct outside Australia, before an offence is committed against s 270.6. A ground of appeal that contended that s 270.5 had not been complied with was abandoned by both appellants.  
     
      
    6 The Dictionary at the end of the Criminal Code contains the following definitions: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        detriment 
         includes any disadvantage and is not limited to personal injury or to loss of or damage to property. 
        
       
       
        
        threat 
         includes a threat made by any conduct, whether express or implied and whether conditional or unconditional.” 
        
       
      
    7 I note that sections 80B-80E Crimes Act 1900 reproduce these provisions of the Code, save for section 270.5, and hence would catch conduct occurring wholly within New South Wales that was within the terms of sections 270.4 and 270.6 of the Code. However the present trial and appeals were conducted as though only the Code provisions were relevant. 
     
      
       
      Uncontroversial Factual Matters 
       
      
    8 The appellant Somsri owned and managed three brothels, one in Strathfield and two in Parramatta. With his wife, the appellant Sieders owned and operated a brothel at Penrith. 
     
      
    9 The Crown called evidence from five Thai women concerning whom orders have been made not to disclose their identity. I shall refer to them (in the order in which they gave evidence) as AA, BB, CC, DD, and EE. The latter four had worked as prostitutes at these brothels during the period to which the indictments related, on the terms of a type of “contract” that lies at the centre of this case. AA, who was an older cousin of BB, had worked as a prostitute at the brothels pursuant to such a “contract” prior to the period to which the indictments related.  
     
      
    10 Each of the latter four women had entered into an agreement, while in Thailand, to provide sexual services in Australia. That agreement was with a Thai woman known as Montha or Pat, who recruited potential sex workers in Thailand, and then sent them to Australia pretending they were tourists.  
     
      
    11 All the women except BB were informed in Thailand that when they came to Australia they would be subject to a “contract” in the sum of approximately $45,000, which they were obliged to repay by earning an equivalent sum through prostitution in the brothels to which they were sent. BB’s evidence was that she was informed of those matters in Australia. The “contract” sum had to be repaid before they could earn any money for themselves. One of the women, and a member of the family of another, were additionally required to enter into a written agreement in Thailand as to repayment of a (significantly lesser) sum of money.  
     
      
    12 Each of the women was accompanied, on the flight to Australia, by a male escort, who delivered them to one or other of the appellants, or to Sieders’ wife. For the duration of the flight and their passage through Australian customs and immigration each of the women was given custody of a sum of money. However, upon passing through customs and immigration they were required to return that money. All the women bar one handed their passports and return airline tickets to either Somsri or Sieders, at the request of Somsri or Sieders. 
     
      
    13 On arrival in Australia the women were immediately taken to the brothel where they were required to work. The rules as to paying off their contracts were usually then explained to them. The women were told or given to understand that they would not receive any money in hand, and were not free to leave unless and until they had worked off their “contract” sum. The only exception to this was that very occasionally a customer might give them a tip (which the evidence said could be $5 to $20), that they were free to keep for themselves.  
     
      
    14 After arrival in Australia, Somsri or Sieders made arrangements for a solicitor/migration agent to make application on behalf of the women for a protection (refugee) visa on fictitious grounds. The making of such an application gave the women some standing under Australian migration laws, such that until the application was dealt with by the authorities the women would not be deported. In some cases, an amount said to be attributable to the cost of obtaining a visa was added to the “debt” that the women were required to work off. 
     
      
    15 No woman worked at the one brothel all the time. They worked sometimes at the brothels owned by Somsri, sometimes at Sieders’ brothel, and sometimes at a brothel managed by someone else. They were taken from one place of work to another, often by Somsri. On some occasions they asked for, and were granted, permission to leave the brothel for a specific purpose. Otherwise, they lived in one or other of the brothels or (only for some of the women, and for them only occasionally) in the house of one of the brothel owners. Their food and sleeping accommodation were provided by the brothels. BB had a mobile phone (the bill for which was paid by AA), on which she could telephone people, including her family in Thailand.  
     
      
    16 Four of the five prostitutes who gave evidence were able to pay off their “debt”, in periods ranging from 2 months and 20 days, to 7 months. Once the “debt” was repaid, these women continued working at brothels, though being paid for their services, and able to choose where they would work. 
     
      
    17 The woman who did not pay off all of her “debt” was BB. The Immigration Department sent people to the Strathfield and Penrith brothels on 20 May 2004 to check on the visas of the prostitutes. The immigration officials took some of the prostitutes away from the brothels. BB was one of the prostitutes detained in those raids. She was held in Villawood Detention Centre for a time, and later returned to Thailand. 
     
      
    18 There is evidence of sums of money being remitted by Sieders and Somsri to Pat. The dates and amounts, and the identities of remitter and remittee are established by documentary evidence. The Crown submits, without challenge by the appellants, that sums remitted by Sieders can be identified as being $9,595 relating to BB on 24 April 2004, and $8,625 relating to CC on 3 January 2004. As mentioned earlier, BB arrived in Sydney on 23 April 2004. CC arrived in Australia on 3 January 2004.  
     
      
    19 The Crown alleges, without contradiction by the appellants, that amounts remitted by Somsri to Pat can be identified as being $8,625 relating to BB on 23 April 2004, and $8,000 relating to EE on 23 February 2004. EE arrived in Australia on 23 February 2004. Other documentary evidence shows Somsri remitting $7,700 to Pat on 2 March 2004, and $6,800 to Pat on 3 March 2004, though those payments are not linked by the evidence to the arrival of any particular Thai woman.  
     
      
    20 The scale of charges according to AA and EE was $55 for fifteen minutes, of which the prostitute got $35. Half an hour cost $85 of which the prostitute got $50, and one hour cost $150 of which the prostitute got $85. The prostitutes were given credit for the full amount of their entitlement, without any deduction for tax. Thus paying off $45,000 would require the prostitute to perform 1286 fifteen-minute services, or 900 thirty-minute services, or 530 one-hour services. 
     
      
    21 DD was told that the rate of charges was $55 for fifteen minutes, of which the prostitute would get $30. Half an hour cost $75 of which the prostitute would get $45, and one hour cost $135 of which the prostitute would get $80. Though the reason for this discrepancy in rates was not explored in the evidence, DD was aged 37 at the time of the trial, and the other women were younger. At those rates, paying off $45,000 would require the prostitute to perform 1500 fifteen-minutes services, or 1000 half-hour services, or 563 one-hour services.  
     
      
    22 Each prostitute kept a record of her own earnings. As well, a record was kept by the brothel management. 
     
      
       
      The Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    23 The grounds of appeal that the appellant Sieders presses are: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The verdict is unreasonable, or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence on the bases that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the facts alleged by the Crown are insufficient to establish the offence charged; and/or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) there was no evidence, or no sufficient evidence to establish that the appellant had the required fault element with respect to the offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. A miscarriage of justice was occasioned as a result of the trial judge’s direction to the jury that they could convict the appellant if they were satisfied he was reckless as to the fact of sexual servitude. 
        
       
      
    24 The appellant Somsri appeals against conviction on grounds formulated in slightly different words, but no different in substance to those on which Sieders appeals.  
     
      
    25 Both appellants also seek leave to appeal against the sentence imposed, on the ground that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    26 Consideration of this ground requires the evidence of some of the individual witnesses to be stated in some detail. 
     
      
       
      AA’s Evidence  
       
      
    27 AA came from a country area in northern Thailand. She had been brought up by her uncle and aunt. That uncle and aunt were the parents of BB. They lived on a farm. The uncle had at some stage borrowed money from a bank for the purpose of his farming, but his farming venture had not been successful, and he was unable to pay the money back. Before AA left for Australia he was not strong, not well, and unable to work. 
     
      
    28 AA arrived in Australia on 18 May 2002. She came here under an arrangement whereby she had to repay $53,000. She paid that by working for a person called Gou, and when she paid it off she continued working as a prostitute, sometimes in a brothel owned by Somsri. She gave her evidence through a Thai interpreter. At the time of the trial she could not read English, and could speak English “a little”. 
     
      
    29 AA kept in contact by telephone with her family in Thailand. In early 2004 AA was aware that ""the family had no money"". At some stage AA suggested to BB that she come to Australia to work as a prostitute, and gave some information about how to go about achieving that objective. The means that AA suggested did not produce results. AA told Somsri about the prospect of BB coming to Australia, and Somsri telephoned Pat in AA’s presence. Somsri suggested to Pat that she contact BB, and gave her BB’s telephone number. BB told AA as arrangements with Pat developed.  
     
      
    30 By April 2004 AA was living in an apartment of her own, but still working at Somsri’s brothel. Somsri set the prices charged at that brothel. On 23 April 2004 Somsri collected AA and took her to the South Strathfield brothel to work. Later that day Somsri arrived there with BB. To AA’s observation, BB was not well – she was coughing, had a runny nose, and after she made a telephone call home was homesick and crying. AA was cross-examined about BB’s demeanour on the day BB arrived: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did she appear to you to be happy and comfortable about the idea of providing sexual services? 
         
        A. She was just kind of nonplus.” 
        
       
      
    31 Over the Anzac Day weekend BB telephoned AA and asked to be picked up, as she was not well. At that time BB was working at the Penrith brothel owned by Sieders. AA told BB she should ask Tu (Sieders’ wife). BB telephoned AA back, saying that Tu had said that AA should ring Somsri. AA then telephoned Somsri, and asked if it was all right if she picked up BB. Somsri replied, ""I have already talked to Tu, yes you can go and pick her up"". When AA collected BB from the Penrith brothel BB had red eyes and a swollen face as if she had just been crying, and she appeared unwell.  
     
      
    32 BB stayed at AA’s flat for two to three days. On the third day Somsri arrived at the flat. AA told her that BB was not well yet, and had her period. Somsri then said “let [BB] go and have a rest at the shop"". (The brothels were sometimes referred to as ""shops"".) There was another conversation on that occasion where Somsri asked AA:  
     
      
       
        
        “… would you like to buy [BB], we'll go half each. So I said ""how much?"". [Somsri] then said ""Seventeen thousand. If you would like it, then we go half.” I then said I did not have any money. [Somsri] then said to [BB] ""pack your belongings and go and have a rest at the shop"""". 
        
       
      
    33 Somsri then took BB with her. Also in that conversation Somsri said “… they bought the person for 17,000 and it was half with Phee Tu, should I want to buy the share I could buy their share of the half.” (“Phee” is a Thai honorific that is sometimes placed in front of a person’s name.) 
     
      
    34 AA gave evidence in cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. It became obvious to you not long after your cousin commenced working in the sex industry that she was unhappy, would you agree with that? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    35 On another day in early May 2004 AA and BB were both working at one of Somsri's brothels. Somsri asked AA “Please teach [BB] to work”. AA then gave BB advice about how to make herself appear attractive to clients, so that the client would choose her. 
     
      
    36 Later in May BB telephoned AA and asked AA to pick her up. After BB had obtained permission from Somsri, AA collected her from another brothel that was run by an Asian man. AA delivered BB back to a different Somsri brothel the next morning. 
     
      
    37 After BB was seized by the Immigration authorities and taken to Villawood Detention Centre AA received a telephone call from Tu. AA’s evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “A. She said that [Somsri] had gone and visited [BB] at Villawood. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. But security said that [BB] did not wish to meet anyone. Had [BB] said anything concerning the two of us or not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That is what she asked you is that what you are saying? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you say? 
         
        A. I said that I did not know. Tu then said that [BB] maybe some women at the Villawood Detention Centre said something to [BB] or not. If saying about myself to [Somsri] and [Somsri] and if I would come in to any problem because I was submitting an application as [Sieders’] fiancée. My children are here and if my children and myself, my family doesn’t get anything from here then I would do something back to you and [AA’s] family as well. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. This is what Tu was saying to you, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
       
      BB’s Brother’s Evidence 
       
      
    38 BB's elder brother gave evidence that, before BB left for Australia, he was aware from conversations with AA that AA was working in Australia as a prostitute. BB asked him to meet someone to sign a contract about a loan, “as a guarantor”. He met Pat, who had a contract document with her. At the time the amount referred to in the contract was blank, but Pat said, in response to a question from the brother, that the amount of the loan was 450,000 baht. He wrote that amount in the document, and signed it. The document did not nominate any time by which the loan was to be repaid. Pat told him that the amount was to cover the cost of applying for a visa, a plane ticket and a passport. She also said that the money would be deducted from the income that BB would receive from working, and that would take about three months. At the then current exchange rates 450,000 baht was approximately A$15,350. The brother was earning 7500 baht per month, and was “definitely not” in a position to repay 450,000 baht.  
     
      
    39 The brother gave evidence that in one telephone call, after BB had come to Australia, she told him that she would ask police to come and arrest her from her place of work. His response was: “I asked her whether she was sure because these people are influential.” Her response to that was to cry. 
     
      
       
      BB’s Evidence 
       
      
    40 BB was aged 23 at the time of the trial. Documentary evidence showed she was born in May 1983, and so was aged 20 in April 2004. She gave evidence, in Thai, that she had a high school education. At the end of school she could speak a little English, but not much. She left to live in Bangkok with her elder brother at about the age of 20, and had a job selling porridge, in which she earned 5000 baht per month. She was aware that her cousin AA was in Australia working as a prostitute. Both BB’s mother and AA asked BB if she would like to go to Australia to work in the sex industry. Though BB had never worked as a prostitute previously, she decided, after almost a year of deliberation, to come to Australia, and set about making arrangements. At the time of her decision she was concerned that the bank might take the family's home away, and they would have nowhere to live. She said “when I decided to come here I wanted to come and earn an income in order to help my family to be clear of debt.”  She was aware that when she went to Australia she would be working in a business which provided sex in return for money, but said she was not aware of the conditions in which she would have to work. 
     
      
    41 After the first set of arrangements for coming to Australia fell through, BB came in contact with Pat. Pat arranged for BB to enter into a sham marriage, obtain a passport in her new married name, open a bank account with money provided by Pat, and have a document purporting to be from an employer that falsely stated that she was an assistant manager with a salary of 8000 baht per month. On the basis of that documentation, and the representation that BB’s “husband” would be staying in Thailand, Pat obtained for BB a visa for travel to Australia as a tourist for five days.  
     
      
    42 Pat told BB:  
     
      
       
        
        ""… that I had to find someone to come and sign a contract and that person has to be related or be siblings to me … she said that this contract would be for me that when I arrived here, should I ever escape, then the person who signed that contract would have to be responsible if I escape."" 
        
       
      
    43 Two or three days before BB travelled to Australia she introduced her brother to Pat, and he signed a contract with her. At that meeting BB photocopied her brother's identification card, and, at Pat's request, gave that photocopy to her. BB said that she knew at that stage that she would owe some money in relation to the arrangements that had been made to send her to Australia, but she did not know the amount or how it would be paid back. 
     
      
    44 On the day of BB’s flight to Sydney she travelled to the Bangkok airport. There she met Pat, who gave her an airline ticket, some money, and her passport. BB also met the man who was to accompany her to Sydney. She arrived in Sydney on 23 April 2004. Once in Sydney she went with the man to a hotel, and waited. He took back the money that Pat had given her. She was left with a bit over 200 baht (200 baht was worth about $7). She also had a personal ATM card, relating to a bank account that had no money in it. 
     
      
    45 Somsri arrived and collected her from the hotel in a taxi. She asked BB to hand over her passport and airline ticket, which BB did. In the course of the taxi ride Somsri telephoned Pat, and handed the phone to BB, who responded to a question from Pat about the time she had arrived there. They went directly to the brothel at South Strathfield. There, BB was provided with some clothing “short and also thin… the clothing that working girls had to wear to work”. Somsri asked her to try them on and “at first I dare not”, “when she asked me to try them on I did not want to try -- put them on because they don't look -- they don't look good.” She was instructed, by both Somsri and AA, about how to greet clients. She was also advised by AA to keep her own record of clients serviced, to make sure that she was not cheated. On the first day she serviced one or two men. AA’s boyfriend gave her a SIM card for her mobile phone. 
     
      
    46 She came to learn, after her arrival, that the figure that she had to pay was $45,000. Somsri gave her the working name of “Vivian”. Somsri told her “that she had to move me to go and work at other places as well and for me not to … work at that place only”. Somsri gave her no information about what days she had to work, or whether she would have any days off. 
     
      
    47 Apart from occasions when BB obtained permission to stay at AA’s, and one occasion when she stayed at AA’s without permission, BB slept at the brothel at which she had been working. 
     
      
    48 BB’s first move away from Somsri’s brothel was to Sieders’ brothel at Penrith. Somsri told her “that I had to go and work about three or four days at Penrith and then she would come and pick me up to come back to the same place.”  
     
      
    49 BB was cross-examined about that conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Didn’t she say to you tomorrow morning there will be someone come and pick you up to work at Penrith for three days? 
         
        A. It’s the same thing. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did you say ‘Why do I have to go and work there’? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And did Somsri say ‘Over there they haven’t got enough staff, just go and help them out?’ 
         
        A. She did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did she say ‘You don’t have to worry, it’ll be the same as working here’. Did she say that? 
         
        A. Yes she did.” 
        
       
      
    50 Sieders collected BB, and drove her to the Penrith brothel. Once BB had arrived there, she telephoned AA and asked to be picked up, as she was not well. BB handed the telephone to Tu, who then spoke to AA. Tu later made a telephone call to Somsri, after which AA and AA’s boyfriend came to collect her. BB heard Tu say to AA “that she did not know what was wrong with me, that when I arrived I cried.” (If AA’s evidence that this occurred over the Anzac Day weekend was accepted, these events occurred in BB’s first week in Australia.) 
     
      
    51 The Penrith brothel was located upstairs from a Thai restaurant. AA, the boyfriend and BB went there to eat. BB told AA that she would like to go home (meaning Thailand), that she no longer wanted to be here, and she asked AA to “do whatever that will facilitate me to go home”. At that time two police officers walked into the restaurant, and BB asked AA “to please go and let the police know and come and arrest me and send me home.”  AA’s response was to laugh, and to tell her to stop crying and eat. 
     
      
    52 BB agreed in cross examination with the proposition that “after a very short time of being in Australia you found yourself totally unsuited to the sex industry”. 
     
      
    53 After BB had been at AA’s flat for three or four days Somsri came to the flat and asked AA whether BB had fully recovered. AA said that she was better but not fully recovered. To that Somsri said that “today she was picking me up to go to work … I had had many days off already”. Somsri then waited for BB to pack her things, and took her to one of Somsri's brothels. BB’s evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now when you were at your cousin’s flat did you want to go with Somsri or not? 
         
        A. No I did not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why did you go with her? 
         
        A. It was necessary for me to go. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why was it necessary for you to go? 
         
        A. There was no other choice. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Are you saying that you had no other choice? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why do you say you had no other choice? 
         
        A. Because I did not want to work. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why didn’t you have a choice? 
         
        A. Because I couldn’t go anywhere. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why not? 
         
        A. I don’t know how many days I was here then when the person said to me that I could not go anywhere. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Which person? 
         
        A. [Somsri] told me as I asked a girl at work were talking about it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Talking about what? 
         
        A. That when you come and work here if you have not paid all your debts back yet you cannot go anywhere. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who said that to you? 
         
        A. [Somsri] also said that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Who else said it to you apart from [Somsri]? 
         
        A. The working girls who worked together with me told me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was this on the first day you arrived? 
         
        A. I don’t think it was the first day. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Was it said at Penrith? 
         
        A. I knew from the shop at Strathfield and the people at Penrith also said that.” 
        
       
      
    54 BB serviced five or six people that day. 
     
      
    55 When cross-examined about the passage of evidence that I have just set out she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You were telling us there, weren’t you, that when you come here to work if you hadn’t paid the debt you weren’t allowed to go anywhere, was that what you were suggesting? 
         
        A. Yes, someone told me that when I come here had I not paid off all the debts yet I did not have any rights to go anywhere on my own. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Weren’t you saying that it was [Somsri] … who said to you that you couldn’t go anywhere unless you paid the debt off? Is that what you were saying in answer to those questions of the Prosecutor? 
         
        A. Yes, she said that as well as other working girls had also told me that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can I specifically put this to you that the accused Somsri never ever said to you that you couldn’t go anywhere unless you paid the debt off? 
         
        A. Yes, I said that – I think that she said that because she said that if I didn’t pay off all the debt yet I could not go anywhere, should I want anything I can ask someone else to buy it for me.” 
        
       
      
    56 On occasions when she went to Penrith, Somsri told her that she was to go there, and Sieders came and picked her up. While at Penrith she slept at the brothel. Two or three times while she was at Penrith she did “escort work” which involved visiting clients at their home. On those occasions sometimes Sieders drove her to the home, and sometimes the client drove her. 
     
      
    57 On one occasion Somsri told BB that she would take her to get her visa extended. Somsri took her to be photographed, and she saw a solicitor. She signed a document, which she thinks was blank at the time she signed it. (It turned out to be an application for a protection visa, which told an elaborate and completely fictitious story about BB being a lesbian who was persecuted by extremist religious groups in Thailand, which caused her to fear to return.) 
     
      
    58 On three or four occasions she asked customers to help her. There was one Thai speaking man to whom she said (in Thai) “please help me get out of there, whatever you can do, please help me. I would like to go home.” After initial reluctance, that man said he would help, and made a telephone call in her presence, and spoke to someone in English, but the impression of BB was that he was unable to make contact. She asked other non-Thai speaking customers at the South Strathfield brothel to help her, saying (in English) “help me please. I want to go home. I not in work no good.”  She gained the impression that they agreed to help her. She gave the number of her mobile telephone to two of the customers. Her evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Why was it that you asked customers who saw you at the brothel to help you? 
         
        A. I did not wish to do this type of work. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why didn’t you just walk away? 
         
        A. The reason I did not just walk out because I remembered the word that Pat said to me that when I came to work in Australia should I escape, all the debts that would have to be borne by my brother. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And when you got to Australia, you were told I think you’ve told us that you owed $45,000, is that right? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Were you in a position to pay back $45,000? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What about your brother [name]? 
         
        A. No he himself also had no ability to do so. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you think would happen if you walked out without paying back $45,000? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you think would happen if you or your brother did not pay back the debt of $45,000? 
         
        A. I thought that all of us would be in trouble including our parents. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What do you mean by in trouble? 
         
        A. We had to find money to pay back the debt and I was also afraid that they would come and harm us. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Why was it that you decided to ask your customers to get immigration to arrest you, what advantage to you did you see from that course of action? 
         
        A. I thought that they could protect me. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. By doing what? 
         
        A. I thought that if they could come and help me get out of there then I could go home. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. When you asked the customers to help you did you think that anybody would know that you had asked for that course of action to take place? 
         
        A. At first I was afraid that someone would learn about it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And later? 
         
        A. It was necessary for me to speak, had I not asked anyone to come and help me escape then I would have to work there forever.” 
        
       
      
    59 Her cross-examination about that evidence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Now when you used the expression ‘should I escape’ were you referring to avoiding the debt, not paying the debt, that is you not paying the debt? 
         
        A. What I meant was should I escape and would not go to work or should I escape to go and work some place else. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you knew that in that arrangement with Pat you would be responsible for the debt if it wasn’t paid, that you were initially responsible for the debt if it wasn’t paid, you understood that, didn’t you? 
         
        A. Is not me, it’s my brother.” 
        
       
      
    60 The cross examination included: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Can I put this to you, that was the prime reason why you embarked on a plan to contact Immigration in the hope that you’d be deported back to Thailand? 
         
        A. No, it’s incorrect because I did not wish to work this type of work because I could not handle, I could not face it, handle it.” 
        
       
      
    61 One or two weeks before BB was picked up by Immigration she was working at a brothel called “shop 10” owned by a Chinese person, not by Somsri or Sieders. She telephoned AA and asked to be picked up from that brothel. AA enquired why. BB said that she did not want to work, she was sick. AA asked whether Somsri knew about her wanting to go home. (The impression from the transcript is that “go home” in that context referred to leaving that particular brothel, not going back to Thailand.) BB said that she had not. AA said to give Somsri a ring and let her know that BB was asking AA to come and pick her up from the shop. The evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you ring the accused Somsri? 
         
        A. I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you say to her? 
         
        A. I said that I’m sick and I’m asking [AA] to come and pick me up. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did she say? 
         
        A. At first she wouldn’t allow it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did she say to you? 
         
        A. She said that for me to persevere and stay there. It’s almost morning. She would come and pick me up. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Yes and then what did she say, or what did you say? 
         
        A. Then the conversation ended there. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Well did she say that you could or shouldn’t leave? 
         
        A. No she said I could not leave. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you ring your cousin [AA] after that telephone call? 
         
        A. Yes I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did you say to [AA]? 
         
        A. I asked her to come and pick me up and I told her that [Somsri] would not let me go back – go home. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did [AA] arrive at the shop 10? 
         
        A. Yes she did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you speak to anyone at shop 10 as you left? 
         
        A. No I did not. I just packed things and then I just walked out. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did anything happen as you walked out? 
         
        A. There was a Chinese man who saw me walking out and he followed me out. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you hear him say anything or did he do anything? 
         
        A. I heard him calling out – shouting out my name. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Is that Vivian? 
         
        A. Yes that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you drive off with your cousin [AA]? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
      
    62 BB spent the night at AA’s flat, and in the morning telephoned Somsri. Somsri said that she would pick BB up at shop number 10. BB said she was not at shop number 10, she was at AA’s. Somsri was surprised to hear that, and asked how she had been there. BB told her that she was so sick that she asked AA to come and pick her up. Somsri said BB was to ask AA to drop her back to Somsri's brothel. BB was taken back there. The evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you have a conversation with the accused Somsri that day? 
         
        A. I felt that when I went into the house she then acted as if she was unsatisfied, unhappy.” 
        
       
      
    63 One of the customers who BB had asked to help her, got in contact with the immigration authorities. Before the immigration authorities acted on the information BB was moved to the Penrith brothel. She notified the customer by SMS of the address to which she had been moved. It was soon after that that the Immigration Department raids occurred.  
     
      
    64 On the day of the immigration raids, there were too many working girls at the Penrith brothel for the number of clients. One of the girls asked for permission to go out shopping. BB asked that girl to please ask Sieders if she could go also. Sieders gave that permission. While they were out shopping BB received a call on her mobile phone, from a voice she recognised as Sieders. She handed the telephone to the other woman, who then passed on a message that Sieders had said to hurry back. They did so. It was after they returned to the brothel that the Immigration Department raid at Penrith occurred.  
     
      
    65 After BB was detained by immigration, she had a telephone conversation with AA in which AA recounted a conversation she had had with Tu: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. What did [AA] say was said? 
         
        A. She said that Phee Tu had rung and threatened her. 
        
       
       
        
        A. Did she go on? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did she say? 
         
        A. She said that if I give the interview to the police, anything that will have anything to do with Phee Tu herself, then my family and Phee Tu’s family will be in trouble and will never live in peace again.” 
        
       
       
      CC’s Evidence 
       
      
    66 CC gave her evidence in Thai. 
     
      
    67 CC was born in northern Thailand, where her parents were farmers. She left school at the age of 12. She went to Bangkok when she was aged about 20, and found employment as a waitress. There, she did not do any sex work. She came in contact with Pat. Pat explained to her that if she went to Australia she would be doing sex work, and would have to pay back a debt of $45,000.  
     
      
    68 CC met Pat at Bangkok airport, who introduced her to a man who accompanied her to Sydney. CC did not have custody of her own passport or tickets. She was given cash before she left Bangkok, which she returned to the man in Sydney when he asked for it. The man took her to a hotel, from which she was collected by Somsri, Sieders and Tu.  
     
      
    69 CC was taken first to the Penrith brothel. Sometimes she ate at the brothel, and sometimes at the house of Sieders and Tu. She was taken to different brothels to work from time to time, by Sieders. She was not told at the beginning of the day or the end of the day where she would be working on the following day. Tu told her that she should go to extend a visa to remain staying here, and that it would cost $1600, which would be paid by being added to the contract amount. She was taken to see someone about getting a visa, and signed a form. She did not realise that that form was an application for a protection visa.  
     
      
    70 Another Thai term that appears in the evidence is “matak”, which translates as “mother of the contract.”  CC said that the mothers of her contract were Somsri and Tu. Their role was to receive money, until $45,000 had been repaid to them.  
     
      
       
      DD’s Evidence 
       
      
    71 DD gave her evidence in Thai. When she was taken to the office of the solicitor who made a visa application in her name, ""I did not say anything because I could not speak English that well"". 
     
      
    72 DD did factory work in Bangkok. She married another factory worker, and they had two children. They encountered financial problems, and the bank took away a house on which they had paid a deposit. The husband was often away from home, sometimes for months without any contact, and DD found that he was living with another woman. The husband had worked as a taxi driver, but eventually he lost his taxi. DD arranged for her children to live with a friend or relative, and set about working overseas as a sex worker. She eventually came in contact with Pat, who introduced her to a woman called Pet, who said that her younger sister had a restaurant in Australia. Pet told DD that her husband would have to sign a contract for 500,000 baht. DD asked her husband to do so, but he refused. When Pet was told this she said that DD would have to sign the contract herself. Pet and a man brought a contract document to DD to sign in which the amount was 600,000 baht, not 500,000 baht. The man said that that was the amount because her husband did not sign. At the time the contract was signed Pet said:  
     
      
       
        
        ""If you work and you pay back the debt then there's no problem. Should you escape then your family will certainly have problems."" 
        
       
      
    73 Before DD left Bangkok a friend told her that the amount of debt you actually have to repay would be $45,000, notwithstanding the amount stated in the contract.  
     
      
    74 DD gave evidence about being accompanied to Australia by a Japanese man, given cash for the journey but being required to hand it back to her travelling companion once she had arrived. She arrived in Sydney on 3 December 2003. The Japanese man took her to a hotel, where she was met by Somsri and another Thai woman. DD kept her passport and airline ticket on arrival. DD heard a conversation between Somsri and the other Thai woman in the course of which they agreed to pay “8500” each to the Japanese man. DD was then taken to Somsri's house, where she met Tu. Somsri told her that “you have to pay me 45,000 in debt”. DD gave evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Did you have any conversation with the accused Somsri about what would happen if you left the brothel before the debt was paid? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. What did she say to you? 
         
        A. She said that if you wanted to escape you cannot escape because other working girls will be talking about it and you will – it will be found out where you went. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did you say anything? 
         
        A. I said that I would not escape because I have a contract.” 
        
       
      
    75 At one stage she heard Somsri saying that AA’s niece would be coming to Australia and that Somsri “had to share half with Tu”. The evidence continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Half with what, did she say? 
         
        A. It meant that [BB] would be owing half of the debt each, to each of them, with Tu.” 
        
       
       
      (The jury were instructed that that evidence was admissible only against Somsri.) 
       
      
    76 There were three occasions when Somsri sent $1000 to the family of DD in Thailand. Those amounts were added to DD’s debt. 
     
      
       
      EE’s Evidence 
       
      
    77 EE was one of 10 children of vegetable farmers. She was educated to primary school level. Her father died when she was about 18. She had a child as a result of a short-lived relationship. After a number of months she left the baby with her mother, and went to Bangkok to work in a restaurant. In late 2003 she went to Hong Kong for two months, and worked in the sex industry there, earning about 80,000 baht. On returning to Bangkok she came in contact with Pat, from whom she understood that if she went to Australia she would have to pay back $45,000, and that she would pay it back by working in the sex industry.  
     
      
    78 A man accompanied her on the flight to Australia. The man took her to a hotel, from which she was collected by Somsri and Sieders. On arrival, EE gave Somsri some money that the man had given her, and (at Somsri's request) her passport and airline ticket. She was taken to the Penrith brothel, and told she could sleep there. The next day Tu explained to her the rates of charge and division of charges. She usually worked seven days a week, but sometimes only six. Her usual hours of work were from 12 midday till 3am or 4am. She worked at brothels in Penrith, Parramatta, Strathfield and Granville. It was Somsri who took her from one brothel to another. She gave evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. During the course of working to pay off the contract, did you understand that you could leave the brothels and go and work elsewhere? 
         
        A. No I could not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And what did you think would happen if you left without paying off the contract? 
         
        A. I did not have any thought at all because I had no intention to go anywhere because my English was not good.” 
        
       
       
      Mr Kazi’s Evidence 
       
      
    79 Mr Kazi, a solicitor who acted in connection with the applying for protection visas for the Thai women, explained that a person who arrived in Australia on a tourist visa was eligible to apply for a protection visa within 45 days of arrival, and that if such an application was made the applicant was then entitled to a bridging visa that entitled them to stay in Australia and work until the application was decided. Kazi first met Sieders about September 2003 in connection with a visa application for Sieders’ wife. Sieders later telephoned Kazi several times and asked whether he was interested “to lodge some protection visa applications for their clients, for their friends”. These were “the girls”. Sieders told Kazi that he had a massage parlour or brothel. Sieders said “we do lots of protection visa application.” Thereafter, Sieders brought about four to five persons, all from Thailand, to apply for visas. 
     
      
    80 Kazi first met Somsri in late January 2004, when she came to his office to speak to him about lodging visa applications. She told him that she had a brothel and was a partner with Sieders. She told him that the girls came in under tourist visas, “and handed over me the passport of the girls to say what kind of visa they can lodge”. Kazi explained to her that they were not allowed to work under a tourist visa. Somsri then asked him to lodge the protection visa application. In all, Somsri sent him a total of “about four or five girls”. 
     
      
    81 He gave evidence that at some time in the period between September 2003 and April 2004 two or three girls were detained and the Immigration Department cancelled their visas because they were working. Kazi said he talked to both Sieders and Somsri: 
     
      
       
        
        “I talked to them, why you allow them to work, they said they have to work otherwise how can we support them.”  
        
       
      
    82 In one such conversation Sieders said to him: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that girls need to work because we have to pay some money to some people, they got a lot of outstanding debts. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In what context did he say this to you, what were you speaking about? 
        
       
       
        
        A. In relation to the bridging visa because they are not allowed to work but they are working and the Department did cancel their visa on the basis that I asked them to wait until their bridging visa is in effect and that is the thing they said, no they have to work otherwise we can’t support them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can’t what? 
         
        A. Otherwise we can’t support financially because we have to give them, they’re in debt, the costs involve to bringing them here or getting the visa.” 
        
       
      
    83 He also gave evidence of a conversation with Somsri: 
     
      
       
        
        “Sir I did it a couple of occasions in short after visa application lodge she call me, she want to make sure that she got visa or not and then I said she need to wait three months and then she said no, they have to work.” 
        
       
      
    84 His evidence about EE was that ""she could not speak English at all"". 
     
      
       
      The Offence Under Section 270.6(2) 
       
      
    85 Under this heading in the judgment I will seek to explain what is involved in the definition of sexual servitude and the offence under section 270.6(2). In the course of trying to explain, I will on occasions seek to convey a concept by using paraphrases of the statutory language. It should be clearly understood that I am not suggesting that any paraphrases that I use in this part of the judgment are necessarily ones that would be suitable to be used in instructing the jury. Rather, they are attempts to convey the concepts that the statutory language conveys, by using somewhat different language. There is a risk in this that the precise nuances of the statutory language might not be captured, even if the general purport is conveyed. Thus any explanation given here is not intended as a substitute for the statutory language. 
     
      
    86 There is nothing in the definition of sexual servitude that makes it inapplicable to a man or boy. However, as all people involved in the present case who were alleged to be in sexual servitude are women, for ease of explanation I shall speak as though the person in sexual servitude is female. 
     
      
    87 The first thing to notice about the definition of sexual servitude is that sexual servitude is a condition of a person. Because it is a condition of a person, it is an attribute of a particular identifiable person. It is not an action, or a series of actions, or even a failure to act, on the part of anyone. Rather, it is a state of affairs, of a fairly general kind. It is a state of affairs or set of circumstances in which the person in question lives her life. 
     
      
    88 An essential condition for a person being in sexual servitude is that that person provides sexual services. In the present case, there is no dispute that that condition is satisfied. 
     
      
    89 Another essential condition for a person being in sexual servitude is that the person in question is either not free to cease providing sexual services, or not free to leave the place or area where the person provides sexual services. Ceasing to provide sexual services, and leaving the place or area where the person provides sexual services, are each actions of the person in question. However, so far as is relevant to the definition of sexual services, they are not actions that the person in question has actually taken at any time in the past. Rather, they are potential actions, which the person in question might in future take. At a fairly high level of abstraction, one can readily understand the notion that a person who provides sexual services might cease to provide those services, or might leave the place or area where the person provides the sexual services. 
     
      
    90 What the notion of a person being not free to engage in a particular action seeks to capture is that there is something about the state of affairs or set of circumstances in which the person lives that prevents, or seriously inhibits, the person from engaging in that particular action. Being not free to engage in a particular action can arise from a matter of law, as occurs when a person is not free to enter or leave a country without a valid passport, or a married person is at any particular time not free to marry the next day someone other than their present spouse. It can arise from physical constraint, as occurs when a person is kidnapped. It can arise from a social or moral pressure that the person in question cannot resist, as occurs if a child is not free to go out at night without parental permission, or in some cultural traditions a person is not free to wear any type of clothing they might choose in certain situations, such as being in public. It can arise from limitations on the person's economic resources, as when the vast majority of people in Australia aged between 25 and 60 are not free to spend a year without working. It can arise from limitations on the person's own abilities, in the sense that a person of below average intelligence is not free to become a university professor, or a person of ordinary physical skills is not free to compete in the Olympic Games. There may well be other sources of limitations on a person's freedom to act in a particular way. 
     
      
    91 It is not necessary for the circumstance that makes a person “not free” to take some particular action to be one that renders that action absolutely impossible in all senses. For instance, a person with the care of an aged infirm parent can legitimately say that they are not free to live apart from the parent, notwithstanding that they are physically capable of walking out the door and never coming back.  
     
      
    92 There is nothing in the notion of being not free to engage in a particular action that requires the person in question to actually want to engage in that action. Thus, even if the person in question is happily married and with not the slightest desire to marry anyone else, he or she still has a lack of freedom to marry someone else the next day. A person who enjoys getting up and going to work every day, and who would be horrified at the prospect of a year’s idleness, can still be not free to take a year off work because he or she could not afford it. In these examples, for the purpose of immediate decision-making, the lack of freedom of the person in question is unimportant, because of what they actually want to do. But there is nonetheless a lack of freedom. 
     
      
    93 Thus, for a person to be not free to cease providing sexual services, or not free to leave the place or area where the person provides sexual services, it is not necessary for them to actually want to cease providing sexual services, or to leave the place or area where the person provides the sexual services. Rather, what is involved is that, if they were to want to, there would be some circumstance or set of circumstances in which they live that would prevent, or seriously inhibit, their taking that action.  
     
      
    94 Further, it is possible for a person to be not free to take some particular action even if they have agreed that they will not take that action, or if their being not free to take that action is a consequence of something that they have freely agreed to. For example, it seems that in Roman law one of the ways of becoming a slave was by a person agreeing to do so (WL Westermann, The Slave Systems of Greek and Roman Antiquity (1955) American Philosophical Society at 84; The Cambridge Ancient History, 2nd ed, Vol VII Part 2 at 329-331; TJ Cornell, The Beginnings of Rome (1995) Routledge at 281-283; W Buckland, The Roman Law of Slavery (1908) Cambridge University Press at 427-428). The definition of slavery in section 270.1 of the Code is: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the condition of a person over whom any or all of the powers attaching to the right of ownership are exercised, including where such a condition results from a debt or contract made by the person.” 
        
       
       
      In  
      R v Wei Tang  
      [2007] VSCA 134; (2007) 16 VR 454 at [41] Eames JA (with whom Maxwell P and Buchanan JA agreed) said that the words  
      “including” 
       and following in that definition: 
       
       
        
        “do not expand the definition but merely make it clear that conduct that the victim agreed to, or contracted to undertake, whether to meet a debt or otherwise are included within the definition. A volunteer slave, in other words, is no less a slave.” 
        
       
       
      Similarly, an employee who agrees to devote all his or her time to the business of his or her employer is not free, while the contract of employment is on foot, to work for anyone else, even though the employee freely entered the contract. 
       
      
    95 The definition of sexual servitude requires there to be a lack of freedom to do either one of the two specific things identified in paras (a) and (b) of the definition. Thus, it is concerned only with a very specific respect in which there is a limitation on the freedom of action of the person in question. A person can be free to do a multitude of different things, but if she is not free to cease providing sexual services, or not free to leave the place or area where she provides sexual services, she will, if the other condition of the section is met, be in sexual servitude. 
     
      
    96 Another essential condition before a person is in sexual servitude is that her lack of freedom (of the relevant types) arises because of the use of force or threats. When the lack of freedom is something that exists only because of a constraint on the person potentially taking action, the phrase because of the use of force or threats does not convey the notion of a causal relationship that is actually in operation. Rather, what it seeks to capture is the notion that if she were to want to take the type of action in question, it would be the use of force or threats that would provide a cause of her not taking that action.  
     
      
    97 I do not think that the language requires that the use of force or threats be the sole cause of her not taking that action. However, even so, to say that “because of X, a person is not free to do Y” still requires X to play a quite significant role in the person's not doing Y. It is a stronger thing to say “because of X, a person is not free to do Y”, than to say “because of X, a person would not do Y if the possibility of doing Y were to present itself to her”. For some actions there might be ten or twenty different reasons why a person would not do Y if the opportunity arose, but it might not be appropriate to say of each of those reasons that because of it the person was not free to do Y. Whether the factors that inhibit a person from taking a particular course of action are strong enough for the person to be not free to take that action is very much a matter of evaluation of the circumstances of the individual case. 
     
      
    98 There is no necessity for force or threats to be used by the accused before the accused commits an offence under section 270.6(2). Rather, the force or threats can be used by anyone. What is essential about the force or threats is the role that they play in the lack of freedom (in the relevant respects) of the person in question. 
     
      
    99 In seeking to understand the statutory definition of threat, a threat of any other detrimental action can be a threat of any disadvantage at all, whether to the provider of the sexual services or anyone else. Thus a threat of disadvantage to, for example, a friend or relation of the provider of sexual services can be a relevant threat, if it is because of that threat that the provider of sexual services is not free in the relevant respects.  
     
      
    100 As a matter of language, a threat of detrimental action is a threat to take any kind of action whatever that will be to the disadvantage of someone. There is no reason why a threat of detrimental action needs to be a threat to take action that is illegal. Indeed, a threat of detrimental action can be a threat to take action that the person who it is contemplated will be subject to the detriment has agreed to. Under the ordinary mortgage securing a loan from a bank, the mortgagee agrees that if the debt and interest are not paid on time the bank can sell the mortgaged property - even so, when the bank tells a defaulting debtor that if he or she does not pay it will sell the mortgaged property the bank is threatening to take action that is detrimental to the mortgagor. It is just that (absent legislation like moratorium statutes) there is usually nothing illegal about a bank threatening to enforce its security. 
     
      
    101 There is no need for a threat of detrimental action to be specific about the particular detrimental action that might be taken. In some circumstances, it can be a clear threat to say “We know where you live”, or “Your daughter is quite pretty, isn't she”, or “You’ll regret this”.  
     
      
    102 There is an exception to the definition of “threat” concerning a threat of detrimental action when there are reasonable grounds for the threat of that action in connection with the provision of sexual services by a person. Though that exception was not relied on in the present case, it seems to me to seek to capture the sort of action detrimental to an employee that an employer might take against any employee whose work performance was not satisfactory. 
     
      
    103 For someone to be in a condition of sexual servitude is not in itself an offence on the part of any one. Before the offence under section 270.6(2) is committed, it is necessary for the accused to conduct a business (in the extended sense stated by section 270.6(3)). In the present case, there is no issue that both Somsri and Sieders conducted the business of a brothel. 
     
      
    104 The offence under section 270.6(2) also requires that the business in question involves the sexual servitude of other persons. For that to occur, it is not sufficient that someone who happens to be in sexual servitude has some role to play in the business. It is possible to conceive of a person who is in fact in sexual servitude, who has a part-time job in a business unrelated to the sex industry – in that case, the proprietor of that business may well not be conducting a business that involves the sexual servitude of other persons. The section does not say that it is an offence to conduct business that involves a person who happens to be in sexual servitude. Rather, before a business involves the sexual servitude of other persons, the sexual servitude of those persons must have some role to play in the business. Without trying to be exhaustive, one way in which this might occur is if the business in question involves provision of sexual services, and the sexual servitude of the people in question is relevant to enabling the business to provide the sexual services. 
     
      
    105 In the present case, there was no dispute that the four women in question worked in the businesses that Somsri and Sieders conducted. There is active dispute, however, about whether it is correct to say that any of them were in sexual servitude. 
     
      
    106 Another necessary element of the offence under section 270.6(2) is that the person who conducts the business knows about, or is reckless as to, that sexual servitude. A woman is in a condition of sexual servitude by reason of the existence of certain facts or state of affairs. For a business proprietor to know about or be reckless as to that sexual servitude, the business proprietor must know about, or be reckless as to, the facts or state of affairs by virtue of which the woman in question is in sexual servitude. I will give further consideration later in this judgment to what is involved in being reckless as to that sexual servitude.  
     
      
       
      Aids to Construction 
       
      
    107 So far I have been approaching the construction of section 270.6(2) and the definition of sexual servitude purely as a matter of textual analysis. Section 15AB Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth) permits certain classes of extrinsic material to be looked at as an aid to construction: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) to determine the meaning of the provision when: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the provision is ambiguous or obscure; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the Act and the purpose or object underlying the Act leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    108 The provisions of the Code relating to sexual servitude were inserted by the Criminal Code Amendment (Slavery and Sexual Servitude) Act 1999. The Revised Explanatory Memorandum relating to that Bill states that the provisions “are based on model provisions developed by the Model Criminal Code Officers’ Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General”.  
     
      
       
      The Officers’ Committee Report 
       
      
    109 The report of that Committee was published in November 1998. Apart from a stylistic change in the wording relating to the penalties, the provisions as enacted are identical to those recommended by the Committee. The report of the Committee drew together a variety of treaties concerning slavery and related topics. Amongst them was the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 8(3)(a) of which stated, “no one shall be required to perform forced or compulsory labour”. The report explains, at 16, the source of the Committee’s terms of reference:  
     
      
       
        
        “In December 1997, the Commonwealth Justice Minister, Senator Amanda Vanstone, warned that Australia had insufficient laws to stop women being forced into ‘sex slavery’. She has argued that Australia needs legislation which targets the traffickers that recruit, organise and profit from those engaged in prostitution and sexual exploitation (see, for example, the Brisbane  
        Courier Mail, 
         13/12/97, p 9) and the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General referred the issue to the Model Criminal Code Officers’ Committee for examination and report. As a result, the Committee issued a discussion paper in April 1998. The overwhelming response from consultation was that legislation in some form was desirable.” 
        
       
      
    110 The report continued, at 17: 
     
      
       
        
        “Commonwealth interest in ‘sex slavery’ or ‘sexual servitude’ pre-dates the issue of the discussion paper by several years. From the beginning the Commonwealth proposal focused on the international trade in women and children for the purposes of prostitution with particular attention being given to the traffic in people from Asian countries to Australia for commercial sexual purposes. A part of that trade involves the recruitment of children or young women from the poorer regions of developing countries, their import into Australia and employment in the sex trade in Australia under conditions which amount to ‘slavery’, ‘involuntary servitude’ or under what might be called servile conditions.” 
        
       
      
    111 The report referred to some information provided by the Australian Federal Police relating to such activities, and said, at 17: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clearly, there are a variety of arrangements and consequences alleged. In some cases and to various degrees, any pay received by the workers is offset by real or contrived debts or costs for board and lodging, and the degree to which the women are subjected to confinement and restriction is hard to ascertain but can also be reasonably assumed to be variable.” 
        
       
      
    112 The report referred, at 19, to a particular proposal that the Commonwealth had advanced for legislation that contained an inclusive definition of “servile conditions” that included: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) where a person, employed to engage in prostitution, is not free to terminate that employment, or is not free to terminate it within a reasonable time and/or on reasonable terms; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) where a person, employed to engage in prostitution, is not free to decline to render sexual services to a particular person or persons; 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) where a person, employed to engage in prostitution, is not free, without fear of retribution, to leave his or her place of employment or residence according to his or her wishes or choosing; 
        
       
       
        
        (v) where a person’s sexual services are pledged to another as security for a debt, and the value of those services, as reasonably assessed, is not applied towards the liquidation of the debt or the length and nature of the sexual services to be rendered are not reasonably limited and defined.” 
        
       
      
    113 The Committee did not proceed with that proposal. As it explained at 33-34: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Committee has also moved away from the previous formula which referred to the victim as being by reason of force or threats not free to cease providing sexual services within a reasonable time or on reasonable terms. This has been replaced by a simple reasonable grounds exception. 
        
       
       
        
        The Committee believes it assists to list threat of force or deportation as examples of unwarranted threats but agrees with criticism that the reference to other legal process should be removed as a specific example as it could mislead people. 
        
       
       
        
        It was also decided to remove from the definition the mention of being free to decline to provide services to a particular person or persons. The Committee is concerned that such a serious offence should not apply where someone is happy to provide sexual services, is free to leave, is not beaten or subject to other force; but simply refuses to kiss any clients. It should not be the case that an employer who threatens to sack the person on that basis should be able to be charged with the sexual servitude offence. While there are more serious issues, such as the policy in relation to condoms, the object of these offences is to regulate servitude, not prostitution. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        There were a number of submissions which expressed the view that there will never be a time when it is reasonable (or warranted) for a person to be deprived of the freedom to refuse the provision of sexual services. This is incorrect. The reality of sex work is that where someone is employed to provide sexual service, there is invariably an obligation under the contract to deal with an assigned customer. To do otherwise would broaden the offence to the extent it would mean almost all employment of sex workers would be caught by the serious sexual servitude offence. This may be the desired result for some people, but is outside the main object of the offence and certainly cannot be made such a serious offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The definition of threat also now includes threats to another person, (for example, the victim’s child).” 
        
       
       
      The Revised Explanatory Memorandum 
       
      
    114 The Revised Explanatory Memorandum stated, concerning the definition of sexual servitude: 
     
      
       
        
        “The opening words of subclause (1) of this provision make it clear that for the purposes of the relevant offences under the Bill “sexual servitude” will only arise if one of the two specified manifestations of sexual servitude is brought about by the use of force or threats. Further, the definition of ‘sexual service’ in subsclause (2) makes it clear that sexual servitude can only arise in connection with the provision of commercial sexual services. 
        
       
       
        
        The force or threats need not be against the sex worker but may be against another person, such as the sex worker’s child. 
        
       
       
        
        The difference between slavery and servitude in the Bill is essentially one of degree. To establish slavery it must be shown that the accused exercises a power of ownership over the victim. Servitude falls short of ownership but the domination over the victim is such as to effectively deny her or his freedom in some fundamental respects. In relation to the sexual servitude offences in the Bill it is only if the victim’s freedom is denied in respect of one of the two matters listed in this subclause that an offence is committed. 
        
       
       
        
        Whether a person is ‘not free’ in relation to the matters specified in the definition will be determined on the facts of each case and in the context of the mischief the legislation is directed against; namely, sexual ‘servitude’. The fact that a person may suffer a penalty under the terms of a typical employment contract would not of itself amount to being ‘not free’. It is only if the force or threats effectively denies the person her or his freedom in relation to the two specified matters that sexual servitude can be made out. In borderline cases, where there is doubt about whether a person is ‘not free’ in relation to the matters listed in the definition, it is expected that the courts will resolve the matter in favour of the defendant. 
        
       
       
        
        Subclause (2) also provides an expanded definition of ‘threat’, to include (a) a threat of force; (b) a threat to cause a person’s deportation; or (c) a threat of any other detrimental action unless there are reasonable grounds for the threat of that action in connection with the provision of sexual services by a person. 
        
       
       
        
        Whether there are reasonable grounds for a threat of detrimental action is a question of fact to be determined in the circumstances of each case. However, even if there are no reasonable grounds for a threat, sexual servitude will not be made out unless the circumstances are such that the threat effectively denies the person her or his freedom in relation to one of the two matters listed in the definition of sexual servitude.” 
        
       
       
      The New Offence of Debt Bondage 
       
      
    115 Both appellants placed reliance upon the fact that section 271.8 of the Code came into effect on 3 August 2005. The legislation that introduced it, the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons) Act 2005 (Cth), removed the definition of “sexual service” contained in section 270.4, and inserted a definition in identical terms into the Dictionary. It inserted into the dictionary of the Code new definitions: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        debt bondage  
        means the status or condition that arises from a pledge by a person: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) of his or her personal services; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) of the personal services of another person under his or her control; 
        
       
       
        
        as security for a debt owed, or claimed to be owed, (including any debt incurred, or claimed to be incurred, after the pledge is given), by that person if:  
        
       
       
        
        (ba) the debt owed or claimed to be owed is manifestly excessive; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the reasonable value of those services is not applied toward the liquidation of the debt or purported debt; or  
        
       
       
        
        (d) the length and nature of those services are not respectively limited and defined. 
        
       
       
        
        personal service  
        means any labour or service, including a sexual 
         
        service, provided by a person.” 
        
       
      
    116 It also inserted a new section 271.8: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        271.8 Offence of debt bondage 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A person commits an offence of debt bondage if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person engages in conduct that causes another person to enter into debt bondage; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person intends to cause the other person to enter into debt bondage. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Penalty: Imprisonment for 12 months. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) In determining, for the purposes of any proceedings for an offence against subsection (1), whether a person (the  
        first person 
        ) has caused another person (the  
        second person 
        ) to enter into debt bondage, a court, or if the trial is before a jury, the jury, may have regard to any of the following matters: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the economic relationship between the first person and the second person; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the terms of any written or oral contract or agreement between the second person and another person (whether or not the first person); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the personal circumstances of the second person, including but not limited to: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) whether the second person is entitled to be in Australia under the  
            Migration Act 1958 
            ; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the second person’s ability to speak, write and understand English or the language in which the deception or inducement occurred; and  
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (iii) the extent of the second person’s social and physical dependence on the first person. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Subsection (2) does not: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) prevent the leading of any other evidence in proceedings for an offence against subsection (1); or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) limit the manner in which evidence may be adduced or the admissibility of evidence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    117 The appellants submit that the creation of this new offence shows that the offence of sexual servitude is not applicable to cases where a person has voluntarily entered into an agreement to provide sexual services, and have the payment for those services applied towards payment of a debt. 
     
      
    118 Before considering the merits of that argument, there is a prior question of the extent to which it is legitimate to use a statute which amends a previously existing statute as an aid to the construction of the statute in its unamended form. Various cases, collected in Pearce & Geddes, Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 6th ed (2006) LexisNexis Butterworths para [3.33]-[3.35] suggests that this legitimately can be done in at least some circumstances. Rather than puzzle over how that could ever be correct as a matter of principle, I shall consider what High Court authority requires me to do.  
     
      
    119 A limit on the scope within which a subsequent statute can be used to construe an earlier statute was considered by Dixon, Evatt, and McTiernan JJ in Deputy Federal Commissioner of Taxes (SA) v Elders Trustee and Executor Co Ltd [1936] HCA 64; (1936) 57 CLR 610. It concerned a landholder who held certain pastoral leases. Prior to 30 June 1914 these pastoral leases were exempt from land tax. Amending legislation, assented to on 21 December 1914, removed that exemption, and said nothing about from what date the exemption was removed. The question for decision in the appeal was whether the exemption applied for the financial year beginning on 1 July 1914. That matter was complicated because (at 624): 
     
      
       
        
        “… the amending Act of 1930 contains a provision showing the that the legislature understood the exclusion made by the Act of 1914 from the exemption of Crown leases operated in respect of the financial year beginning 1st July 1914 … 
        
       
       
        
        Except for the evidence of legislative intent supplied by this provision, we should have felt little doubt that the exclusion effected by the Act of 1914 from the exemption conferred on Crown leases by sec 29 did not operate in respect of the financial year beginning 1st July 1914.” 
        
       
      
    120 However, the amending Act of 1930 ultimately did not cause their Honours to depart from the view they had reached that the land was exempt from tax in the year in question. They said, at 625-6: 
     
      
       
        
        “Doubtless the true explanation is that, in drafting the Act of 1930, it was supposed that the exclusion by the Act of 1914 of Crown leases from the exemption took effect for the financial year beginning 1st July 1914. But, in our opinion, the supposition ought not to lead us to give that effect to the Act of 1914. “An Act of Parliament does not alter the law by merely betraying an erroneous opinion of it” (Maxwell 
        , Interpretation of Statutes,  
        6th ed (1920), p 544, and, per Lord Atkinson 
        ,  
        Ormond Investment Co v Betts 
          
        (1928) AC 143, at p 164). “Where the interpretation of a statute is obscure or ambiguous, or readily capable of more than one interpretation, light may be thrown on the true view to be taken of it by the aim and provisions of a subsequent statute"" (per Lord Atkinson (1928) AC at p 164). In  
        Cape Brandy Syndicate v Inland Revenue Commissioners  
        (1921) 2 KB 403, at p 414, Lord Sterndale said: ""I quite agree that subsequent legislation, if it proceed upon an erroneous construction of previous legislation, cannot alter that previous legislation; but if there be any ambiguity in the earlier legislation, then the subsequent legislation may fix the proper interpretation which is to be put upon the earlier."" In reference to this statement, Lord Buckmaster said in  
        Ormond Investment Co v Betts 
         (1928) AC, at p 156: ""That is, in my opinion, an accurate expression of the law, if by `any ambiguity' is meant a phrase fairly and equally open to divers meanings."" But it is not permissible to construe an unambiguous phrase in an earlier Act by an erroneous assumption of its effect contained in a later Act which did not purport to alter or amend the earlier Act (per Lawrence LJ,  
        Port of London Authority v Canvey Island Commissioners  
        (1932) 1 Ch 446, at p 493).  
        
       
       
        
        In the present case the Act of 1930 did not intend to amend the Act of 1914. It was not concerned with it and was dealing with a matter unconnected with the question for what financial year the amendments made by the Act of 1914 first took effect. On that question it did no more than proceed upon an assumption. It was a question depending, not on an ambiguous word or phrase, but on the absence from the Act of 1914 of any express statement of the financial year first to be affected. The ordinary rules of interpretation supplied the deficiency and, in our opinion, made it clear that the amendments first applied, not to the financial year then current, for which the land tax liabilities had accrued nearly six months before, but to the then next ensuing financial year.” 
        
       
      
    121 In Grain Elevators Board (Vic) v Dunmunkle Shire [1946] HCA 13; (1946) 73 CLR 70 the issue concerned whether land owned by a statutory Board was exempt from local government rates as “land the property of His Majesty which is unoccupied or used for public purposes”. Five of the six judges who sat held that the exemption did not apply because the Board had a separate corporate existence, and was not “His Majesty”. A statute amending the rating Act, at a time later than the rating year in question, established a specific exemption for some, but not all, of the land of the Board in question. Two of the five judges who made up the majority (Latham CJ at 77, and Dixon J at 85-86) referred to that later exemption. Latham CJ said it was one of several factors that “tend to show that the Board was not, by reason of its constitutions and functions, entitled to the immunity which it now seeks to establish.” Dixon J, at 86, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although the provision was passed too late to apply to the present case, I think it may be considered on the question of interpretation. It would be a strange result if we were to interpret prior legislation as giving a wider exemption than that conferred by the provision so that the express exemption it makes would prove unnecessary and the qualifications it places upon that exemption would be futile.” 
        
       
      
    122 Neither judge referred to either authority or principle as justification for this way of proceeding. When the other three judges who made up the majority did not use the amending legislation as an aid to construction, making use of it is not part of the ratio of the case. However, accepting that even an unreasoned dictum of Latham CJ and Dixon J is entitled to respect, the proposition for which the dictum stands is a narrow one. It is that when there is an earlier and a later pronouncement by a legislature that bears upon a single topic (in this case, whether and in what circumstances the Board had to pay rates) the later provision can be looked to as an aid to construction of the earlier. That is not the situation here, where section 270.6(2) creates one offence, and section 271.8 creates a different offence. 
     
      
    123 In Khoury v Government Insurance Office of New South Wales [1984] HCA 55; (1984) 165 CLR 622 an insurer had declined a claim on the basis of a material non-disclosure by the insured. Section 18 Insurance Act 1902, introduced in 1974, entitled a court to excuse a failure by an insured to observe or perform a term or condition of a contract of insurance if the insurer was not prejudiced. The trial judge had used that provision to excuse the non-disclosure. In the High Court, the provision was held inapplicable, on the ground that an insured’s duty to disclose material facts was not an implied term of the contract, but an obligation which the common law imposed as an incident of the relationship between the parties (at 637). After the loss in question the New South Wales Parliament, in 1983, introduced a new section 18A into the Insurance Act, that, in broad terms, provided for a contract of insurance that was entered after the commencement of the section to not be vitiated by reason only of a misrepresentation or non-disclosure unless it was material, and there was a measure of culpability on the insured (of the types more precisely defined by the section) concerning the misrepresentation or non-disclosure. Having reached the conclusion that section 18 did not apply to the non-disclosure in question because the obligation to disclose was not a term of the contract, Mason, Brennan, Deane and Dawson JJ continued, at 639: 
     
      
       
        
        “In that regard, while one cannot construe the terms of a 1974 legislative provision by reference to the terms of a non-retrospective 1983 provision, the  
        Insurance (Amendment) Act 
          
        1983 
         (NSW) illustrates that it cannot be assumed that, if the New South Wales Parliament had intended in the 1974 amendments to the Act to provide relief in cases of a failure to discharge the long established common law duty of disclosure, it would have done so in the broad terms adopted in s 18 for cases involving a non-prejudicial breach of a term or condition of the contract. When, by that 1983 Act … the New South Wales Parliament introduced new provisions in the Act (s 18A) to provide general relief in cases of omission or non-disclosure, it adopted a quite different approach to that of s 18 and subjected the relief to conditions which would appear not to be satisfied in the present case.” 
        
       
      
    124 That later majority statement in the High Court makes clear that the earlier provision could not be construed by reference to the later one. The only use that the majority judgment in Khoury made of the later statute was as an illustration of the way in which Parliament could have cast section 18, if Parliament had intended it to have the effect that the High Court had already held it did not have.  
     
      
    125 That view is consistent with the principles stated by McHugh and Gummow JJ in Commissioner of Stamps (SA) v Telegraph Investment Co Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 44; (1995) 184 CLR 453 at 479 that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is the intention of the legislature when effecting textual amendment of an Act to produce a revised text which thereafter  
        and as to subsequent events 
         is to be construed as a whole.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      See also at 463 per Brennan CJ, Dawson and Toohey JJ to similar effect. Their Honours are not there suggesting that the later Act can affect the construction of the earlier, as applied to events before the coming into effect of the later Act. If the submission of the appellants in the present case were correct, the court would be using the later Act to affect the construction of the earlier, as applied to events before the coming into effect of the later Act. 
       
      
    126 In Commissioner of State Revenue (Victoria) v Pioneer Concrete (Vic) Pty Ltd [2002] HCA 43; (2002) 209 CLR 651 Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at [52] adverted to “the difficulties involved in using an amending Act to construe earlier legislation”. Their Honours adopted, as one of the reasons for not using the amending Act as an aid to construction in the case before them, that (at [52]):  
     
      
       
        
        “The amendments have work to do, even assuming the correctness of the appellant’s argument in the present case, and are not inconsistent with that argument.” 
        
       
      
    127 In Allina Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1991) 28 FCR 203 at 212 Lockhart, Burchett and Gummow JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There was some debate before us as to the circumstances in which courts are entitled to examine a later statute to determine whether it throws any light upon the interpretation of an earlier statute. Plainly this course can be taken when the words of the earlier statute are ambiguous, but if the words of the earlier statute are clear, little assistance may be gained from the later statute. Also, care must be exercised to ensure that the words in the later statute have not been inserted to remove possible doubts: see

    128 In my respectful view, that statement is consistent with the High Court authority to which I have referred. 
     
      
    129 The appellants rely upon a statement made in the second reading speech for the Criminal Code Amendment (Trafficking in Persons Offences) Bill 2004 when introduced in the Senate on 8 December 2004, where it was said that the offence of debt bondage: 
     
      
       
        
        “… prevents traffickers from using unfair debt contracts and other similar arrangements to force victims into providing sexual services or other labour to pay off large debts supposedly incurred by the trafficker in transporting the victim to Australia.” 
        
       
      
    130 Some amendments were made in the Senate to the Bill as originally introduced. In section 271.8(2)(b) the words “between the second person and another person (whether or not the first person)” replaced the words “between the first person and the second person” that had appeared in the Bill. Also, para (ba) was added to the definition of “debt bondage”. The revised Explanatory Memorandum made available to the House of Representatives in 2005 when the amended Bill came before it, included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “One tactic employed by people traffickers is the use of debt contracts or arrangements. Under these arrangements, the victim is coerced into providing sexual services or other labour to pay off large ‘debts’ supposedly incurred because the trafficker has arranged the victim’s travel to a country or entry into that country or has organised employment and accommodation for the victim following the entry. 
        
       
       
        
        New subsection 271.8(1) makes it an offence to engage in conduct that causes and is intended to cause another person to enter into debt bondage. The definition of  
        debt bondage  
        … is based on the definition adopted in the  
        Supplementary Convention (to the 1926 International Convention to Suppress the Slave Trade and Slavery) on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade and Institutions and Practices similar to Slavery. 
        ” 
        
       
      
    131 That the legislation is based on the 1956 Supplementary Convention no doubt provides the reason for the definition of “debt bondage” including the juristically unusual notion of a “pledge” of person services.  
     
      
    132 The Explanatory Memorandum for the 2005 version of the Bill set out the definition of debt bondage, and continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The definition refers to a “debt owed or claimed to be owed”. This definition is drafted to ensure that traffickers who invent or grossly inflate debts owed to them by their victims are covered by the offence. For example, where a trafficker claims that his or her victim owes a debt of $20,000 on the basis that the trafficker booked and paid for the victim’s $2000 airfare to Australia, the debt “claimed to be owed” will be covered by the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The definition also refers to debts that are “manifestly excessive”. For example, the offence will apply where the debt that the trafficker claims the victim owes under a debt arrangement is unreasonably inflated, and as a result, it will take the victim many more years to repay the debt, even if the reasonable value of the victim’s services are applied toward the liquidation of the debt or the length and nature of those services are limited and defined. 
        
       
       
        
        This definition of debt bondage is sufficiently limited to ensure the offence does not inadvertently target legitimate employment arrangements involving the application of services towards the liquidation of the debt and the limitation and definition of the length and nature of the services involved. 
        
       
       
        
        The definition of debt bondage is not limited to a debt that exists at the time the pledge is given. The definition is drafted broadly to ensure it captures situations where the debt owed or claimed to be owed increases following the making of the pledge. This would cover situations where, for example, the perpetrator applies some of the value of the services provided to the liquidation of the debt, but also provides accommodation or other amenities to the victim, effectively increasing the amount of the debt owed. It would also cover the situation where, for example, the perpetrator provides payment to the victim, either in the form of money or some other valuable consideration. 
        
       
       
        
        New subsections 271.8(2) and (3) are in similar terms to new subsections 270.7(1A) and (1B). Subsection 271.8(2) provides that a court or jury may have regard to a broad range of information, including the economic relationship between the victim and alleged offender, the terms of any contract or agreement and the personal circumstances of the victim, in proceedings under this section. For example, a brothel owner and a broker may enter into a contract about the victim. The court or jury may have regard to the terms of this contract when determining whether the brothel owner caused the victim to enter into debt bondage. 
        
       
       
        
        However, new subsection 271.8(3) provides that new subsection 271.8(2) does not limit the leading of any other evidence, nor does it limit the manner in which evidence may be adduced or the admissibility of evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        Consistent with new subsections 270.7(1A) and (1B) in the deceptive recruiting offence, new subsections 271.8(2) and (3) are designed to ensure that the court or jury is able to take into account significant power imbalances.  
        
       
       
        
        This offence is less serious than the trafficking in persons offences or the sexual servitude or slavery offences. The penalty for this offence is 12 months imprisonment, which enables this offence to be dealt with as a summary offence, reflects the relative seriousness of the offence. The debt bondage offence provides an alternative in cases where it may be difficult to prove the commission of one of the more serious offences. The offence recognises that debt bondage is exploitative in itself and conducive to more significant abuse of individuals by those in a position to exploit them.” 
        
       
      
    133 In my view there are significant differences between the offence of debt bondage, and the offences created by section 270.6. First, the offence of debt bondage is only committed by a person who causes another person to enter into debt bondage. Thus, it does not extend to a situation like that covered by section 270.6(2), where a person who is already in a state of sexual servitude becomes involved in a business. Second, a condition of debt bondage can arise for a person who provides any labour or service, whether or not it is a sexual service. Third, the indicia of debt bondage that are set out at paras (ba), (c) and (d) of the definition are indicia that relate to the terms of the arrangement under which the debt bondage arises. The indicia of sexual servitude are of a quite different type – they concern respects in which the person in question is not free in particular respects, and the reason why that person is not free in those respects. It could be possible for a person to be in debt bondage, but still be free to cease providing the personal services in question by raising enough money to pay off the debt. By contrast, if the existence of the debt creates a condition of sexual servitude it is because the woman in question has no practical prospect of paying off the debt other than by continuing to provide sexual services, and that circumstance is the reason why she is not free in one of the relevant senses. There is a world of difference between an offence that has as one of its elements a lack of freedom of the victim, and one that does not. Fourth, the Explanatory Memorandum makes clear that it is recognised that there will be an overlap between the two offences. It makes clear that part of the reason for choosing the penalty of 12 months imprisonment is to enable a debt bondage allegation to be dealt with summarily. It is quite common in the criminal law to have alternative offences that can overlap with each other, but where one is more serious than the other, and the less serious is able to be dealt with summarily.  
     
      
    134 In my view, there is no ambiguity in the wording of section 270.6(2) that needs to be clarified by reference to the later legislation. The earlier and the later legislation do not deal with the same topic. The later legislation had not come into operation at the time of the events to which the present charge relates. The later legislation has ample work to do that is independent of the work done by the earlier legislation. For all these reasons, I do not accept that the later enactment of the offence of debt bondage shows that the condition of sexual servitude could not arise as a consequence of the existence of a debt, and an agreement to provide sexual services to pay off that debt. 
     
      
    135 I do not find anything in the various suggested extrinsic aids to construction that I have been discussing causes me to form any view of the construction of section 270.6(2) and the definition of sexual servitude that I derived purely as a matter of textual analysis.  
     
      
       
      Was there Evidence of the Disputed Elements of the Offence? 
       
       
      Events in Thailand 
       
      
    136 In the present case, there were various events that happened in Thailand that might arguably have contributed to one or more of the women not being free, in one of the relevant senses. That Pat required a guarantee from a close relative of BB, that BB’s brother had signed a guarantee for an amount he had no prospect of repaying, and that Pat had taken a photocopy of the brother’s identity card (with the clear inference that she thereby would have the means of finding where he was to enforce the guarantee), inhibited BB (on her evidence, which the jury seems to have accepted) from leaving the brothel once the work had become unacceptable to her. That DD had signed a personal guarantee in Thailand, which might possibly be enforced against her if she were to return home, might arguably have contributed to a lack of freedom on her part. There was a fairly clear statement by Pat about detrimental consequences that could flow from not adhering to the agreement - that should BB “escape” all the debts would have to be borne by her brother, and Pet told DD “should you escape your family will certainly have problems”. Somehow, BB’s brother had obtained the impression that the people who had organised BB’s relocation to Australia were “influential”, and communicated that impression to BB. There was evidence of the detail of the educational and family background of each of the women in Thailand, from which one can conclude that they were each extremely poor, and that many of them had significant family responsibilities. 
     
      
    137 However, even though a jury would be justified in concluding that such events in Thailand could contribute to the relevant lack of freedom of any of the women once they had come to Australia, unless it could be shown that Somsri or Sieders knew of, or were reckless as to, those events, they would ultimately need to be left out of account in deciding whether the offence under section 270.6(2) had been committed. Neither Sieders nor Somsri gave evidence. While there were some transcripts of police interviews with Sieders and Somsri that were tendered in evidence, the statements that Sieders and Somsri made in those records of interview were self-exculpatory, and in any event the questioning of the police officers concentrated on what Sieders and Somsri had done, not what they knew. The police asked no questions about topics that might elucidate what Sieders or Somsri knew about the detail of the background of the women and how each of them came to be in Australia, or what enquiries they made about that detail. The evidence of the various Thai women at the trial did not establish that either Sieders or Somsri were told about any of these events in Thailand.  
     
      
    138 Thus, the evidence does not justify a finding beyond reasonable doubt that either Somsri or Sieders knew about these events in Thailand, or was aware of a substantial risk that any deleterious consequences might arise to any of the women or any of their families in Thailand. It will be recalled that, in relation to two contracts that were signed in Thailand, the amount was much less than $45,000, and the practice seems to have been for payment for any woman to be sent to Thailand as soon as that woman arrived in Australia. The total amount sent to Pat in Thailand for BB was $18,220, [paras 18 and 19 above], greater than the amount for which BB’s brother had signed as guarantor. While there was no evidence of the amount sent to Pat concerning DD, a jury would not be justified in concluding that the 600,000 baht for which she had signed had not been repaid. In circumstances where it could not be concluded that there would be disadvantageous consequences to anyone in Thailand from the women not performing their contracts, and in any event evidence was lacking about Sieders or Somsri being aware of a risk of disadvantageous consequences in Thailand, it could not be said they were reckless about such events in Thailand. 
     
      
    139 As I have said, there was no issue in the present case that the women were involved in the provision of sexual services within the meaning of section 270.4. Nor was there any issue that both Sieders and Somsri were conducting a business of running their respective brothels. Nor was there any issue that the four women in question were involved in each of those respective businesses. The appellants submitted that the Crown had not established that the business involved the sexual servitude of other people. That was so, in particular, because there was no evidence of the element of “use of force or threats”. 
     
      
       
      Lack of the Relevant Freedoms? 
       
      
    140 I shall consider first whether there is evidence on which a jury could have reached the conclusion that the women in question were not free to cease providing sexual services, or not free to leave the place or area where they provided sexual services. In so doing, I shall leave out of account any events that occurred in Thailand.  
     
      
    141 Evidence of matters that occurred in Australia and that were relevant to whether the women were not free to cease providing sexual services or not free to leave the place or area where they provided the sexual services during the period that their debt was unpaid was as follows.  
     
      
       
      (a) The women were under significant limitations concerning where they could physically go. The airline flight to Australia of each of them was with a male escort, and the escort remained with them until they were physically delivered to one or other of the brothel keepers. Unless they obtained permission (which was seldom granted) they were not permitted to leave the brothel at which they were working from time to time. There was evidence of being explicitly told that they  
      “could not go anywhere” 
      . They were delivered from one place of work to another. They had no choice about the place they would be working, and did not even have information in advance about the place at which they would be working on any particular day.  
       
       
      (b) DD gave evidence that she was specifically told by Somsri  
      ""if you wanted to escape you cannot escape because other working girls will be talking about it and you will -- it will be found out where you went"". 
       A jury may well take the view that the fact that the notion of  
      “escape” 
       was used at all was an indicator of lack of freedom in the relevant respects, and that the reference to  
      “it will be found out where you went” 
       was likely to convey the message that something detrimental would be done to the escapee. BB’s evidence repeatedly spoke of leaving Somsri’s employ as  
      “escape” 
      , not  
      “resigning” 
      . 
       
       
      (c) BB was required to work even when she was unwell and unhappy.  
       
       
      (d) There was evidence from AA about being asked by Somsri whether she would like to  
      “buy” 
       BB. Even allowing for the fact that the original of that evidence was given in Thai, concerning a conversation conducted in Thai, and that it was possible that there was a measure of metaphor in using the word  
      “buy” 
      , a jury could still regard that evidence as making a contribution to an overall picture of lack of freedom in the relevant respects.  
       
       
      (e) Apart from DD, they did not have their passports or return air tickets, so leaving Australia was not a practical alternative for them. Even in relation to DD (who initially kept her passport and ticket) it would have been open to the jury to take the view that the practice of Mr Kazi was to require a passport to be handed to him at the time of making application for a protection visa, and that DD lost custody of her passport at that time.  
       
       
      (f) While they were working off their  
      “debt” 
       they had no source of income apart from continuing to work as prostitutes in the particular brothels where they were sent from time to time – they had no spending money at all apart from tips (which were occasional pocket money, not a living wage), and even those tips were derived from prostitution. They were dependent upon the brothel owners to provide them with food and shelter. It would have been open to the jury to form the view that they did not have the means to repay the  
      “debt” 
       other than by continuing to provide sexual services, and that the only way in practical terms open to them to continue to provide sexual services was by continuing to work under the direction of Sieders and Somsri. 
       
       
      (g) They were illegal immigrants, with no legal right to work in the period until their bridging visa was obtained. Even once the bridging visa was obtained their immigration status was precarious, as the bridging visa had been obtained through fraud. Their English was rudimentary or non-existent. Their skills and education were such that, if they wanted to obtain employment outside the sex industry and were free to do so, the only employment open to them would be in comparatively unskilled jobs. They had no social contacts in Australia before they arrived (apart from BB, who had contact with AA, but AA’s actions suggested that she was unlikely to help BB to cease providing sexual services.). For these reasons, the practical opportunity for them to obtain work other than prostitution in Australia in the short term was extremely limited or non-existent. 
       
       
      (h) The way in which BB was eventually able to cease providing the services, and leave the place where she provided sexual services, was by setting in train the extreme step of an Immigration Department raid. It was not her own unaided decision or volition that ultimately enabled her to cease providing the services, and leave the places where she provided the services. 
       
      
    142 It is a distinct possibility on the evidence that all the women except BB made a deliberate choice in Thailand to undertake the debt of $45,000, knowing that the only way they had any prospect of paying it back was by continuing to work as prostitutes for the whole time until it was paid back. It is a distinct possibility on the evidence that all the women except BB made this decision because they hoped that, once the debt had been repaid (and it was a common theme in Pat's conversations with them that the debt could be repaid in a matter of months) they would have the prospect of earning considerably more than they could earn if they were in Thailand. In that sense, there was a distinct possibility on the evidence that it was a matter of rational choice on their part to enter into the arrangement in the first place. The evidence does not establish that they were told about the precise physical limitations that they would be under, or any of the other matters that I have listed above as possible contributors to their lack of freedom, but once they were subjected to those conditions they do not seem to have complained or done anything about seeking to free themselves from the conditions under which they worked, other than by diligent work over long hours to pay off the debt. Even allowing for those possibilities being open on the evidence, there was still material on which a jury could conclude that all four of the women were not free to cease providing sexual services, and not free to leave the place or area where she provided the sexual services, while her debt remained unpaid. 
     
      
       
      ""Because of the Use of Force or Threats""? 
       
      
    143 Mr Roberts SC, counsel for the Crown on the appeal, submitted that it had never been suggested to the jury by counsel for either of the accused that a reason why no offence had been committed was because, even if the women were in fact in sexual servitude, there had been no use of force or threats that was known to either of the appellants.  
     
      
    144 I do not think the situation is quite as clear-cut as that. Mr Gelbert, counsel for Sieders at the trial, said early in his address to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The Crown addressed you … and he indicated to you that from his impression of the case the real issue which focused in this case was whether there was sexual servitude, and that is a fact.. … It is the defence case that the prosecution has not demonstrated to you at all that there is any verifiable threat or force that has been imposed on any of these women …""  
        
       
      
    145 He pointed out that none of the women had ever told Sieders that they did not want to do the work, and there was no evidence that Sieders had made any threat to any of them. As well, however, later he submitted that even though there was some evidence of threats having been made in Thailand, they were not made by Sieders, and it was too remote to say that any threat made by Pat had emanated from Sieders. As well, Mr Gelbert said:  
     
      
       
        
        ""you have to be satisfied that Mr Sieders was part of some act, by threat or force, of sexual servitude. You would not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of that.""  
        
       
      
    146 Though that statement does not put clearly the proposition that, even if there were threats, Sieders did not know of them, it may at least be consistent with the proposition.  
     
      
    147 The emphasis in the address of Mr Wendler, counsel for Somsri at the trial, was, understandably, a little different. He concentrated on the contract having been entered into freely, and with full disclosure. He emphasised that under it: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Her obligation was to pay back the money, not an obligation to have sex …"" 
        
       
      
    148 In relation to the evidence about Somsri pointing out to some of the women that they should not escape, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""How was that a threat? And how is the threat simply for Somsri to remind her nothing more or less than the economic obligation or the debt obligation that she has…?"" 
        
       
      
    149 Thus, one of the ways in which the appellants now put their case, namely that even if there were threats they did not know of them, was at best put to the jury only in an imprecise and shadowy way, and certainly not as a prime focus of the defence case. Even so, the Crown must prove every element of the charge against an accused. Subject to some limitations the precise scope of which may be open to debate, it can be open on appeal to a convicted person to take the point that there was no evidence of some essential element of the charge, even if that point had not been taken in the court below: Crampton v R [2000] HCA 60; (2000) 206 CLR 161 at [11], [14], [21]; R v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; [2007] 228 CLR 232 at [54]; R v Hines (1991) 24 NSWLR 737 at 742-744; R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427; (2001) 125 A Crim R 505 at [56]. I propose to assume without deciding that this Court should examine whether there was adequate evidence of use of force or threats that was known to either of the appellants. 
     
      
    150 There was no evidence of any explicit threat of force by anyone against any of the women, whether in Australia or in Thailand. While the conversation that AA had with Tu after BB had been seized by the immigration authorities contained a threat, that threat was not shown to be made on behalf of either Sieders or Somsri, and in any event, other than possibly as a piece of retrospectant evidence of very dubious weight, it occurred too late to be a contributor to any of the Thai women having been in sexual servitude. I propose to leave it out of account. 
     
      
    151 Mr Corish, counsel for Somsri on the appeal, accepted that there are some circumstances in which, if someone says to someone else, “you are not going anywhere”, that can be a quite definite threat. There was evidence of Somsri saying to BB “you are not going anywhere”. Mr Corish accepted that it was “potentially open” for a jury to find that Somsri knew that it was a threat. In my view Mr Corish was right to make this concession, and indeed in my view it was not only “potentially open” to a jury to find that Somsri knew it was a threat, it was actually open to a reasonable jury to make that finding. 
     
      
    152 As well, there was evidence of Somsri specifically saying to DD that if she escaped “it will be found out where you went”. In my view, it would be open to a jury to find that that was a relevant threat. 
     
      
    153 There is no analogous evidence relating to Sieders of conversations with any of the women. Indeed, Sieders did not speak Thai, and there is no evidence of him having any conversation at all with any of the women who gave evidence. 
     
      
    154 However, apart from the evidence of threats by Somsri, there is in my view evidence of matters that could form the basis for the jury to make a finding that each of the appellants knew that the women were not free to cease providing sexual services, and not free to leave the place or area where she provided sexual services, and that each of those lacks of freedom was because of the use of threats. Each of Sieders and Somsri knew about the limitations on where the women could physically go. From the management positions that they each occupied in their respective businesses, it was open to the jury to find that they knew about the contract arrangement under which the women were working, and that the women were not paid for their work until such time as the debt was paid off. From the evidence of the involvement of both accused with Mr Kazi, it would be open to a jury to conclude that they were aware of the precarious immigration status of the women, and also about their inability to repay the “debt” other than by continuing to work. It would be open to a jury to find that it was an intrinsic part of the contract that, for so long as the woman in question was continuing to work at paying off her debt she would not have a presently enforceable obligation to pay a sum of money, but that if she were to cease working before the debt was paid off she would then have a presently enforceable obligation to pay a sum of money that she did not have the means to pay. In my view it would be open to a jury to find that the arising of a presently enforceable obligation to pay a sum of money that the woman could not afford to pay, had implicit in it a threat of detrimental action. In my view, the jury would be entitled to conclude that each of the accused was aware that because of the prospect of that detrimental consequence arising if they were to cease work, the women were not free to cease providing sexual services.  
     
      
    155 Further, when Sieders and Somsri themselves imposed and enforced the physical limitations under which the women lived, and it was only by continuing to subject themselves to those physical limitations that the women would continue to earn money to enable the debt to be paid off, it would be open to a jury to conclude that it was because of the prospect of the debt arising if they were to seek to break free from those physical limitations, that the women were not free to leave the place or area where they provided sexual services.  
     
      
    156 When the tendency of the debt arrangement is to keep the women providing sexual services in the businesses of Sieders and Somsri, it would be open to a jury to find that each of those businesses was one involving sexual servitude. 
     
      
    157 Thus, in my view, the first ground of appeal is not made out. 
     
      
    158 Both appellants drew attention to the decision of the Victorian Court of Appeal in R v Wei Tang [2007] VSCA 134; (2007) 16 VR 454. In that case, the Court of Appeal quashed the appellant’s conviction on five counts of possessing a slave contrary to 270.3(1)(a) of the Code and five counts of using a slave contrary to the same provision. The facts arose from circumstances broadly similar to the present case, in that five Thai women incurred substantial debts under an agreement entered in Thailand, and, pursuant to that agreement, travelled to Australia and worked as prostitutes to repay the debts. The ratio of the case depended upon a finding of the constitutional validity of the provisions in question, analysis of the elements of the offences charged and whether those elements had been made out, and a consideration of the adequacy of the trial procedures. However, in the course of analysing the elements of the offence charged Eames J (with whom Maxwell P and Buchanan J agreed) expressed some obiter views about the scope of section 270.6, at [88]: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, s 270.6 of the Code, which created the offence of sexual servitude, was in existence when the applicant engaged in the conduct giving rise to the slavery charges. That provision was not utilised by the Crown, no doubt in recognition that a conviction under that section could not have been achieved, having regard to the definition of “sexual servitude” in s 270.4(1). The offence occurs where the offender, by means of force or threats, requires a person to engage in sexual services, so that the person is not free to cease providing the services or is not free to leave the place where the sexual services are being provided. On the face of it, such an offence would seem to involve certain conduct on the part of the offender, concerning the provision of sexual services by the complainant, which would be even more serious than that alleged in the present case. Here there was no suggestion that the five contractors provided sexual services because of force or threats. While there would have been practical impediments to doing so and economic consequences for them were they to do so, Ms Carlin accepted that each of the complainants could have refused to complete the contract she had entered. Had this been a case where threats and force had been applied to the complainants, and had the applicant been charged and convicted of sexual servitude, then the maximum penalty for that offence would have been 15 years’ imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    159 The appellants submitted that the same reasoning should apply in the present case. I do not accept that submission. First, in the present case there is no concession by the prosecutor, or finding, that each of the complainants could have refused to complete the contract she had entered. Second, I do not, with respect, accept that the correct analysis of section 270.4 requires inquiry to be directed to whether the contractors provided sexual services because of force or threats. Rather, the statutorily mandated inquiry is whether the person in question is, by reason of force or threats, not free in the two relevant respects. Of course, if it was shown that the women had provided sexual services because of force or threats, that would be powerful evidence that they were, by reason of force or threats, not free in either of the two relevant respects – but it is not the only way in which sexual servitude can be established. Third, I do not accept that there is a dichotomy between women not being free to cease providing sexual services, or to leave the place where the sexual services are provided, and there being practical impediments and economic consequences if they were to cease to provide those services, or leave that place. Sometimes, practical impediments to taking a particular course of action, and economic consequences of taking it, are such that one is not free to take it. 
     
      
    160 It is also appropriate to state here that, if I were to consider the evidence for myself I would, by following the line of reasoning that I have indicated would be open to a reasonable jury to find, come to the conclusion that each of the women was in sexual servitude, and that each of the accused knew of that sexual servitude. My view on the topic is relevant because it has a role to play in the second ground of appeal, to which I now turn. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – Recklessness  
       
      
    161 The reader will have observed that s 270.6(2)(b) provides that an essential part of the offence is that the accused “knows about, or is reckless as to, that sexual servitude”, and that the indictment alleged that each accused conducted a business that involved the sexual servitude of other persons “knowing about that sexual servitude”. A copy of the indictment was made available to the jury before the Crown Prosecutor opened.  
     
      
    162 It was only at the stage of the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address that the notion of recklessness was mentioned at all. Ultimately, the judge gave directions to the jury concerning recklessness. The appellants submit, in ways I shall examine in more detail later, that the trial judge introducing and directing the jury in relation to recklessness resulted in both procedural unfairness, and also substantive error when recklessness was not part of the allegation in the indictment. Considering that submission will involve a closer examination of the part that recklessness played in the trial. 
     
      
       
      The Part Recklessness Played in the Trial 
       
      
    163 The part of the trial that involved the jury took place from 27 June 2006 until 21 July 2006. Though the opening address of the Crown Prosecutor is not transcribed, no party suggests that the concept of recklessness played any part in that address. 
     
      
    164 Some assistance in understanding the course taken in giving directions can be gained from discussions in the course of the trial between the judge and counsel concerning the issues. One such discussion occurred on Monday, 10 July 2006: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: So far as the trial has unfolded, I’ve been able to glean, insofar as the issues between the Crown and the accused are concerned, there’s no question that the girls were out here engaged in providing sexual services. It doesn’t seem to me to be an issue that they were doing so under the terms of some agreement by means of which they were obliged to repay a sum of money approximating $45,000, in some instances more, depending upon who was bearing the burden of the applications for extending their visas. There doesn’t seem to be any issue that they were working under the obligation that the $45,000 or thereabouts was to be paid before they could earn money for themselves. It also doesn’t seem to be a question that the $45,000 was earned within a period of something a little less than three months, in each case there’s no question that, as I understand things, that the accused were engaged in the conduct of these businesses at the premises that have been identified in the Crown case. The accused Sieders being engaged in the conduct of the business at 373 High Street Penrith and the accused [Somsri] being engaged in the conduct of the premises, or the businesses at the premises at the other locations. The issue, as I understand the questions that have been put to the witnesses so far, seems to be the extent to which the girls were bound to that agreement and the extent to which they were free to depart from the arrangement without consequences to themselves or their families. Does that fairly summarise the issues? I’m not obliging you gentlemen to commit yourself to this proposition but just for the purposes of dealing with this question, is that a fair summary of the issues that are relied in this trial between the Crown and the accused? 
        
       
       
        
        WENDLER: Our case is there’s no sexual servitude on the facts. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes but by expanding on what that means, have I summarised fairly the position your client is respectively advising? 
        
       
       
        
        WENDLER: Yes.” 
        
       
      
    165 Mr Gelbert did not say that his position was any different. The passage I have set out was occasioned by the judge giving consideration to whether a newspaper article on the topic of sexual slavery, that had been published over the weekend, required the discharge of the jury. On such a topic, it would be obvious to experienced counsel (as these were) that the relationship between the contents of the newspaper article, and the issues that the jury will be asked to decide, is a matter of critical importance. If Mr Gelbert had a different understanding of the issues to Mr Wendler, it would be incumbent on him to make his different position clear to the judge. The judge did not discharge the jury. 
     
      
    166 After the last Crown witness concluded giving evidence, each accused elected to call no evidence. 
     
      
    167 On 17 July 2006 the Crown Prosecutor, Mr Roberts, gave his closing address to the jury. He referred to the terms of the indictments, and then to the terms of section 270.6(2): 
     
      
       
        
        “… which reads any person or a person who conducts any business that involves the sexual servitude of other persons and who knows about and it goes on – I don’t think we’re terribly concerned with this – ‘Or is reckless as to that sexual servitude’ is guilty of an offence.”  
        
       
      
    168 He went on immediately to explain the term “sexual servitude” to the jury. He made no reference to recklessness in the rest of his address. 
     
      
    169 Both the Crown Prosecutor and Mr Gelbert completed their addresses before lunch. Mr Gelbert made no reference to recklessness. 
     
      
    170 Immediately after lunch, and before the jury was brought back, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Just before we get the jury, Mr Crown, you made a passing reference in your address to the jury to recklessness. Are you relying upon that part of the offence? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I don’t think it would necessarily obviate your Honour from referring it to the jury, but I would have thought that knowledge of this contract seems to be obvious and recklessness seems really not to arise at all. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No. The concept of recklessness is always an exercise and I wasn’t going to bother them with it if it wasn’t a matter you wanted to pursue. 
        
       
       
        
        Anyway, I have quickly knocked something together over lunch for the assistance of the jury. I will provide copies just for your consideration. I will have to give a closer consideration myself overnight, but at least if Mr Gelbert and the Crown can consider it and, Mr Wendler, you can have a look at it at your leisure.” 
        
       
      
    171 The trial judge was referring to the first draft of a document that eventually became a set of written directions for the jury. Mr Wendler then addressed the jury. 
     
      
    172 After the jury had retired at the end of Mr Wendler’s address the judge referred to his draft directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m not quite happy with this thing about recklessness. I’ve drawn upon someone else’s efforts for that part of it and it doesn’t seem to me to comply with the provisions of section 5.4” 
        
       
      
    173 Mr Roberts indicated he would like to “have a look at that because of the technical aspects”. He then made various requests to the judge concerning directions to the jury. Mr Gelbert made various requests for directions, but made no submissions about what if any submission should be made concerning recklessness. Mr Wendler then made various requests for directions, and also made no request for a direction concerning recklessness. When Mr Wendler indicated he had completed his requests for directions the following exchange then occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: All right, can we look at this question of recklessness Mr Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        WENDLER: Just in relation to recklessness, I wouldn’t be seeking a direction on recklessness in this case. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I can imagine-- 
        
       
       
        
        WENDLER: Well I mean, in any case. I mean the case isn’t a recklessness type case. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well it depends upon the case that the Crown has gone to the jury with and there’s only been one reference to the word “recklessness” and that was in the course of the Crown’s address to them this morning. At the very beginning when he referred to section 270.6(2), when he simply referred to the third element of knowledge or recklessness and then moved on. But there’s been no suggestion in explicit terms that this is a case of recklessness but it is the scope within the section of its application. It’s probably scope by reason of the evidence that’s before, particularly in the case of Sieders. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Well we say that the question of – we put our case primarily on the fact that assuming that, and that we prove that the accused is aware of the fact that the girls were on a contract, he’s aware and there is other evidence to show that each accused is conversant with the incidents of a contract, therefore, if the incidents of the contract involve the condition of sexual servitude, then in a case of each accused, they knew about it but we submit that it is necessary to go on and speak about recklessness and it would be wrong to put it in the terms of that document. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes I agree. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: And it would have to be put in the terms of 5.4 of the-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes I drew upon a document prepared by one of my brothers for that and as I was going through and adapting it to the particular charge in this case. I made it that the second concept is really one of negligence. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: I’ll just try and just do it myself your Honour, or adapt the words to this-- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But I agree, in my view it’s section 5.4(1) and Mr Crown I simply, and Mr Gelbert and Mr Wendler, I’ll simply adapt the paragraph to embrace the code. That’s what it is.” 
        
       
      
    174 The reference to “5.4” is a reference to one of the introductory sections of the Criminal Code. It is convenient to set out the relevant introductory sections at this stage: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        3.1 Elements

        5.1 Fault elements 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A fault element for a particular physical element may be intention, knowledge, recklessness or negligence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) Subsection (1) does not prevent a law that creates a particular offence from specifying other fault elements for a physical element of that offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        5.3 Knowledge 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A person has knowledge of a circumstance or a result if he or she is aware that it exists or will exist in the ordinary course of events. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        5.4 Recklessness 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) A person is reckless with respect to a circumstance if: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the circumstance exists or will exist; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) A person is reckless with respect to a result if: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk. 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) The question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable is one of fact. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (4) If recklessness is a fault element for a physical element of an offence, proof of intention, knowledge or recklessness will satisfy that fault element.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    175 The judge and counsel then had a discussion concerning the manner in which the draft directions should be re-written to deal with the concept of recklessness. From the content of that discussion it is apparent that both the judge and counsel had the draft directions in front of them. After some drafting suggestions passed between the judge and Mr Roberts, the transcript continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR … I’ll have a look at a way to explain the term “unjustifiable” by reference to the dictionary, but I should use the language that’s contained in that provision but I think that suggestion is the appropriate form of the direction for that. Is there anything you gentlemen want to say to-- 
        
       
       
        
        GELBERT: Not at the moment. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Mr Wendler, did you want to-- 
        
       
       
        
        WENDLER: I’m just still looking at 5.4, and then 5.43 [ 
        semble  
        5.4(3)] of course. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Sorry, 5.4 
        
       
       
        
        WENDLER: Three, the question whether taking a risk is unjustifiable as one of fact. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        WENDLER: That will have to go in obviously.” 
        
       
       
      After a little more discussion of the direction concerning recklessness, the discussion between judge and counsel turned to other topics. 
       
      
    176 At the start of the hearing the next day, (18 July 2006) and in the absence of the jury, the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I had my associate send in to counsel the written directions that I’d settled yesterday evening. Have you had a chance to look at them? I haven’t amplified very much that point with regard to recklessness. It didn’t seem to be necessary ultimately after I’d given some thought to the matter. But in any event, is there anything that, you firstly, Mr Crown, do you want to say something?” 
        
       
      
    177 Each of Mr Roberts, Mr Gelbert and Mr Wendler made submissions about drafting amendments, and the conclusion of which the transcript recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I might just adjourn for five minutes and go and make these corrections on this document to ensure that they’re correct and then I’ll bring them straight back in. Yes, Mr Wendler?” 
        
       
      
    178 Mr Wendler then made application for two specific directions, neither of which related to recklessness. The Court then adjourned briefly, to enable the directions document to be printed. 
     
      
    179 Upon resumption, the judge made the settled version of the directions document available to counsel, the jury was brought back, and the judge gave directions to the jury, in the course of which he distributed the written directions. The directions document identified the elements of the offence as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “That between the dates alleged and at the place identified in the charge the accused: 
        
       
       
        
        1. did conduct a business; 
        
       
       
        
        2. that involved the sexual servitude of other persons; 
        
       
       
        
        3. knowing about, or being reckless as to, that sexual servitude.” 
        
       
      
    180 The written direction concerning element 3 was: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are two ways by which the Crown may seek to establish  
        element 3 
         for this offence. 
        
       
       
        
        First, the Crown may seek to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, in each case, had actual knowledge that the businesses they were conducting involved the sexual servitude of other persons. 
        
       
       
        
        With regard to this first alternative, in each case you must ask yourself whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was aware that the businesses they each were conducting involved the sexual servitude of other persons. If that is your finding, then  
        element 3 
         has been established. 
        
       
       
        
        If however you were not so satisfied, then you must consider the concept of  
        recklessness 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown will have proven  
        element 3 
         for this offence if, in each case, although it has not proven actual knowledge, it has proven beyond reasonable doubt that he accused was reckless as to whether the conduct of their businesses involved the sexual servitude of other persons. The accused would be  
        reckless 
         with respect to that circumstance, if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a) he or she was aware of the substantial risk that the business involved the sexual servitude of other persons; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it was unjustifiable to take that risk. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The question of whether taking the risk was unjustifiable, is a question of fact for you, the jury. 
        
       
       
        
        You must therefore decide in each case whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was a substantial risk that the business involved the sexual servitude of other persons, and if so, whether the accused was aware of that substantial risk. 
        
       
       
        
        You must then in each case decide the circumstances that were known to the accused at the time those persons were engaged in the provision of sexual services, and, having regard to those circumstances, determine whether it was unjustifiable for the accused to have taken that risk.” 
        
       
      
    181 The oral directions concerning element 3 were to the same effect. The judge’s oral directions to the jury continued until almost lunchtime. 
     
      
    182 After the jury had departed for lunch, Mr Roberts made various requests for amendments to the directions or supplementary directions. 
     
      
    183 After the lunch break, Mr Gelbert made various requests for directions, that did not include anything on the topic of recklessness.  
     
      
    184 By that stage it was apparent that one of the jurors was unwell. The judge sent the jury home, and adjourned until the next day. 
     
      
    185 On the next day, 19 July 2006, the judge gave an oral précis to counsel of the supplementary directions he proposed to give to the jury. There followed a discussion that occupies over eight pages of transcript, in which all counsel participated with the judge, and in which no mention was made of any direction concerning recklessness. 
     
      
    186 The judge brought the jury back, and gave further directions. After the jury had retired the judge enquired of counsel whether they had any further submissions. Mr Wendler requested two supplementary directions, neither of which related to recklessness. 
     
      
    187 After an adjournment, the jury was brought back, and the judge gave still further directions to it. The directions finished that afternoon. 
     
      
    188 The next day, 20 July 2006, the jury assembled very briefly before being sent by the judge to consider its verdict. 
     
      
    189 After the jury had retired for some time, they sent a note, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “Would you explain to us all, as simply as possible, the contents of page 3 of the note as to the elements and in particular the concept of recklessness.” 
        
       
      
    190 The trial judge indicated to counsel how he proposed to deal with that request. He indicated, in broad terms, an intention to take the jury through what he had said in the document about element 3 in its entirety, and to give a direction concerning circumstantial evidence. Mr Roberts indicated that he thought that was a good idea. Mr Wendler said, “I think I’ll just wait to hear what your Honour says and then respond to it that way.” Mr Gelbert said nothing on that topic. 
     
      
    191 The jury returned to court at 2:35pm. The judge elaborated on the written directions concerning the third element of the charge. In the course of so doing, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The law says this, the accused would be reckless with respect to that circumstance, that is the conduct of their businesses involving sexual servitude, if he or she was aware of the substantial risk, that is that there was a – and they are simply words, substantial risk, that the businesses had people working in them who were in the condition of sexual servitude. They might not know, or you might not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they actually knew, but yet they might know that there is a substantial risk that the people, or at least some of the people there were in the condition of sexual servitude. If there was a substantial risk, if there was that substantial risk of those people being in that condition, the law says that they cannot simply turn a blind eye and walk away and continue nevertheless. 
        
       
       
        
        If, having regard to the circumstances known to him or her at the time, it was unjustifiable to take that risk, that is to continue conducting the business with a substantial risk that there were people in the condition of sexual servitude, if it was not justified for them to continue, well then the third element will have been established. 
        
       
       
        
        I have used the term wilful blindness and it seems to me that that might best assist you in light of the tenor of your question in relation to this with regard to recklessness. If there is a substantial risk that these women were in a condition of sexual servitude and if the accused were aware of that substantial risk, and having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, with regard to that you need to look at a number of things which I will come to, but having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, if it was unjustifiable to continue to conduct the business in respect of those people, in respect of whom there was a substantial risk of them being in sexual servitude, well then the third element is made out by the Crown.  
        
       
       
        
        … Well of course before you get to this you would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that there was the sexual servitude of those persons. Once you have reached that level of persuasion, if you have, in respect of that part of the case, then you consider, well, were the accused, or either of them in respect of their particular cases, were they aware of the substantial risk that those women were in sexual servitude. You might not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that they actually knew, but if in the circumstances you come to the view that they were aware of the substantial risk and according to the circumstances that were known to them at the time, him or her at the time, it was unjustifiable for them to continue in this activity, then the third element is made out.” 
        
       
      
    192 His Honour summarised the evidence that the jury could look to in deciding whether the third element was made out: 
     
      
       
        
        “You have first of all, the description of the circumstances in which the women were working as sex workers for these accused, in these businesses that have been identified to you. You have their descriptions of where they were living. You have the descriptions they have given as to their movement between the premises and how they were taken from one to the other and by whom. You have the evidence that has been given in relation to the harvesting of the money that was generated by these women in providing sexual services; who took control of the money and what happened to it and to what purpose it was applied. You have the evidence of what the women have described themselves as to their perception of what they were told by the accused from time to time in the course of their work. You have the description of the circumstances of their delivery into the care or custody, depending upon your view of the evidence, of the accused when they came into this country, delivered by a man who travelled with them from Thailand, taken to a hotel where they remained until the accused [Somsri], and on I think at least one occasion, accompanied by the accused Sieders, meeting at the hotel and then taking them from there immediately to a brothel where they were put to work after some short period of time. 
        
       
       
        
        You have got the evidence of the telecommunication interception that has been tendered before you. You listened to what was said between the accused in that conversation. You also have the evidence of the interviews with the police officers and the acknowledged lies.” 
        
       
      
    193 The telecommunication intercept to which his Honour referred was a conversation between Somsri and Sieders, in English, in which Somsri complained about lack of business since the immigration raids because girls don’t want to work as they are scared of immigration. Somsri also reported on telling a man from Immigration “I don’t have my girl. I don’t buy girl, I don’t do contract any more”. 
     
      
    194 After the jury retired, Mr Gelbert raised a concern that the term “wilful blindness” could distract the jury from the terminology of the section itself, and requested that the judge withdraw the words “wilful blindness”. Mr Wendler joined in that application. His Honour declined to do so. 
     
      
    195 After a further period, the jury sent another note enquiring, “what elements do we use to define ‘substantial risk’?” Discussion between the judge and all three counsel about how to deal with that question occurs over seven transcript pages. All four lawyers expressed a disinclination to paraphrase the words of the section. The judge gave further directions, to the effect that they were ordinary English words and should be applied in accordance with the jurors’ understanding of the language. 
     
      
    196 The next day, Friday, 21 July 2006, Mr Gelbert was absent and Sieders was represented by Mr Willis. The jury returned with guilty verdicts at 2:35pm. After those verdicts were announced, the judge asked both Mr Wendler and Mr Willis whether there was any reason why he should not proceed to formally convict his client of the offence. Both Mr Wendler and Mr Willis answered that question in the negative. The judge then proceeded to formally convict each of the accused. 
     
      
       
      Procedural Unfairness? 
       
      
    197 The appellants submit that the decision to instruct the jury about recklessness resulted in procedural unfairness. They submit that the entire case had been conducted on the basis that the Crown had to prove that the accused knew that the women were in a condition of sexual servitude, but the judge’s direction undermined that position. The direction opened up a new area of inquiry, namely whether either of the accused were reckless as to the events that had taken place in Thailand.  
     
      
    198 This submission should be evaluated in light of rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules: 
     
      
       
        
        “No direction … given by the Judge presiding at the trial, shall, without the leave of the Court, be allowed as a ground for appeal … unless objection was taken at the trial to the direction … “ 
        
       
      
    199 As is apparent from the history I have related, no objection was taken at the trial to the direction that was given, apart from the specific objection about the expression “wilful blindness”. 
     
      
    200 In R v Solomon [1980] 1 NSWLR 321 a trial judge gave directions in relation to murder on the basis of reckless indifference to human life when the parties had conducted the trial without reference to that possible way in which murder could be committed. Street CJ at 327-328 held that in some circumstances it can be open to a trial judge to give directions on a matter tending towards conviction that neither party has relied upon. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that, where a judge does cover fresh ground in terms that are correct in law and properly based on evidence in the case, at the highest his decision so to do will only be challengeable if it can be seen that the accused person was thereby placed at a tactical disadvantage. In such a situation, appellate intervention would be appropriate, not by reason of the judge having canvassed fresh ground simpliciter, but by reason of unfairness attending his so doing. 
        
       
       
        
        The relevant unfairness will ordinarily be looked for in procedural considerations. The judge, drawing upon his own forensic experience, will be readily appreciative of the tactical considerations which will have governed counsel in the conduct of the case for the accused. Objections to evidence, lines of cross-examination and decisions upon the material to be advanced on behalf of the accused, not to mention the general trend of the final address to the jury made on behalf of the accused, will all, of course, have been governed by the nature of the Crown case as opened by the prosecutor and developed through evidence tendered on behalf of the Crown at the trial. It is readily understandable that, within these procedural and tactical fields, there could arise an element of real prejudice, if the judge, in his summing-up, raises new approaches available to, but not expressly relied upon, by the Crown. But in every case in which a question arises regarding the development of new approaches, the question concerning the judge at first instance, and on appeal the question concerning this Court, will be to determine whether in so doing there will be worked an unfairness to the accused.” 
        
       
      
    201 The principles have recently been stated by Johnson J in Robinson v R [2006] NSWCCA 192; (2006) 162 A Crim R 88 at [137]-[149] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where a ground of appeal against conviction asserts that a miscarriage of justice has occurred arising from the trial judge leaving to the jury a possible basis of conviction which had not been relied on by the Crown, a number of principles arise for consideration and application. 
        
       
       
        
        Firstly, a criminal trial is conducted as adversarial litigation:  
        Whitehorn v R 
         (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 682;  
        Nudd v R  
        (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at 618 [9]. An accusatorial process is involved in which the prosecution bears the onus of proving the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt and in which the prosecution must put its case fully and fairly before the accused is called on:  
        R v Carroll 
         (2002) 213 CLR 635 at 643 [21];  
        R v Ronen 
         (2004) 62 NSWLR 707 at 722–3 [67];  
        Weiss v R 
         (2005) 80 ALJR 444 at 455 [43]. 
        
       
       
        
        A cardinal principle of adversarial litigation is that, subject to carefully controlled qualifications, parties are bound by the conduct of their counsel, who exercise a wide discretion in deciding what issues to contest, what witnesses to call, what evidence to lead or to seek to have excluded, and what lines of argument to pursue:  
        Nudd  
        at 618 [9]. 
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, the judge’s role in a criminal trial is to hold the balance between the contending parties without himself taking part in their disputations; the judge does not exercise an inquisitorial role in which he seeks himself to remedy the deficiencies in the case on either side, nor is it part of the function of the trial judge to don the mantle of prosecution or defence counsel:  
        Whitehorn 
         at 682. The fundamental task of a trial judge is to ensure a fair trial:  
        R v Meher 
          
        [2004] NSWCCA 355 at para 76. Trial judges should normally refrain from advancing an argument in support of the Crown case that was not put by the Crown. There are two reasons for the unacceptability of a judge using the summing up as a vehicle for strengthening the Crown case — first, it is inconsistent with judicial impartiality and secondly, to do so denies the prosecution and the defence the opportunity either to disavow, or to meet the argument:  
        R v Meher 
          
        at paras 87–93. 
        
       
       
        
        Thirdly, the obligation of the Crown Prosecutor in opening the Crown case is not merely to outline the facts which the Crown proposes to establish in evidence, but to indicate, in conceptual terms, the nature of the Crown case to assist the trial judge, counsel for the accused and the jury:  
        R v Tangye 
         (1997) 92 A Crim R 545 at 556. Although there are no formal pleadings as such in criminal trials, the Crown is required to formulate the basis upon which it puts its case against the accused and essentially to adhere to that case:  
        Tran v R 
         (2000) 105 FCR 182 at 203 [133]. 
        
       
       
        
        If there is to be any change in the nature of the Crown case after the case was opened, it is vital that it be identified with some precision in the absence of the jury before counsel commence their final addresses:  
        Tangye  
        at 556. Where the prosecutor has nailed the Crown’s colours to one version of events in opening, and has been permitted to depart from that position during the course of the case, the prejudice may, depending on the particular circumstances of the case, be so great as to warrant the conviction being quashed:  
        Tran 
         at 206 [148]. 
        
       
       
        
        Fourthly, a trial judge is obliged to leave to the jury defences which appear to the judge to be reasonably open, notwithstanding that they have not been canvassed by defence counsel. This forms part of the obligation of the trial judge to ensure that the accused person has a fair trial according to law. There is, however, no corresponding obligation on the judge to give directions upon matters tending towards conviction:  
        Solomon 
         at 327. However, where the Crown has elected to formulate and present its case in a particular way, a question may arise as to whether there are other matters of fact or law which the trial judge, in the discharge of the duty to ensure a fair trial according to law, considers it necessary to put to the jury even though the matter was not propounded or developed by the Crown. The fairness or unfairness of travelling beyond the ground covered by the Crown will be evaluated by the trial judge and will be to the forefront in the decision as to how far, if at all, new considerations will be put to the jury:  
        Solomon 
         at 327–328, 336. 
        
       
       
        
        A trial judge who is considering instructing the jury concerning a basis for conviction which is not relied upon by the Crown must consider the fairness of such a course and, in particular, any tactical disadvantage which it may create for the accused:  
        Solomon 
         at 328, 333–334, 336;  
        R v Pureau 
         (1990) 19 NSWLR 372 at 377. 
        
       
       
        
        Relevant unfairness will ordinarily be looked for in procedural considerations. The judge will be appreciative of the tactical considerations which have governed counsel in the conduct of the case for the accused, including objections to evidence, lines of cross-examination, decisions concerning the tender of material and the content of the final address to the jury on behalf of the accused:  
        Solomon 
         at 328. Where it appears to a presiding judge that the evidence in the case leaves open a finding of guilt on a basis not opened by the Crown, the better course is to raise the matter with counsel prior to final addresses and then, according to the responses of counsel, a decision can be made whether it is appropriate that the direction be given. If it is to be given, the jury will have the benefit of the submissions of both counsel upon the question:  
        Solomon 
         at 336. The accused then will not be deprived of the opportunity of having submissions made on his behalf on that issue:  
        Solomon 
         at 336;  
        R v GAS  
        (1998) 3 VR 862 at 863, 877–8;  
        R v King  
        (1985) 17 A Crim R 184 at 187;  
        King v R 
         (1986) 161 CLR 423 at 432–3;  
        Carr 
          
        v R  
        [2000] TASSC 183; (2000) 117 A Crim R 272 at 285 [49];  
        R v Whitfield 
         [2002] NSWCCA 501 at para 67. 
        
       
       
        
        Unfairness to the accused in the conduct of the trial resulting from the trial judge’s direction to the jury upon a basis for conviction not relied upon by the Crown may arise from a range of tactical disadvantages, including an inability to cross-examine Crown witnesses, adduce evidence in the defence case and make closing submissions to the jury on the matter:  
        Solomon 
         at 328, 336;  
        GAS 
         at 863;  
        Carr 
         at 285 [49]. Even if the prejudice to the accused was confined to the inability to address the jury upon the question, that itself is capable of being a most significant area of prejudice:  
        R v RTB 
         [2002] NSWCCA 104 at paras 55–61;  
        Meher 
         at paras 113–116, 130;  
        Carr  
        at 285 [49]. 
        
       
       
        
        A miscarriage of justice may arise where the Crown elects to confine the basis for conviction to acceptance of critical Crown witnesses with no alternative and inconsistent factual scenario being advanced by the Crown. In such circumstances, defence counsel will address the jury to answer the Crown’s case theory advanced in the closing address. If then, for the first time, the trial judge advances an alternative factual scenario based upon rejection of significant parts of critical Crown witnesses, the conduct of the trial may have altered. The Crown has been saved from the need to advance bases for conviction which are inconsistent. The defence counsel is deprived of the opportunity of addressing the jury upon the basis that the Crown is advancing inconsistent bases for conviction. The participants in the trial, including the Crown, the accused and the jury will hear, for the first time, the alternative basis for conviction being advanced by the trial judge in the summing up. Unfairness of this type leading to a miscarriage of justice was found to exist in  
        Carr 
         at 285 [49]. 
        
       
       
        
        Fifthly, where the trial judge raises in the summing up a basis for conviction which was not relied upon by the Crown, there is the added difficulty that the direction carries particular force because it is coming from the judge and not the Crown:  
        RTB 
         at paras 57, 60. It may produce positive mischief if the judge raises arguments which could have been, but which were not put or requested by counsel:  
        R v Heuston 
         (1995) 81 A Crim R 387 at 393. 
        
       
       
        
        Sixthly, the question to be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal is whether there has been an unfairness to the accused which gives rise to a miscarriage of justice by reason of the conduct of the trial and which requires the Court’s intervention:  
        Solomon 
         at 328, 336;  
        R v King 
          
        at 
          
        187;  
        Carr 
         at 285 [49].” 
        
       
      
    202 Those principles have recently been re-stated in Smale v R [2007] NSWCCA 328 at [80], [83].  
     
      
    203 In the present case the trial judge raised the question of recklessness with counsel for the first time after Mr Gelbert had completed his address but before Mr Wendler began his. The Judge provided a draft of the remarks he was proposing to make on the topic. Mr Gelbert did not seek to make any supplementary address to the jury concerning recklessness, and Mr Wendler made his address knowing that the judge was contemplating giving a direction concerning recklessness. No counsel submitted that the judge ought not direct the jury concerning recklessness. Even when it became apparent, from the notes the jury sent, that they were giving attention to the topic of recklessness, counsel for the accused did not submit that the judge ought modify or withdraw the direction he had given concerning recklessness. Indeed, they collaborated in discussing the way in which the judge should answer the jury’s questions.  
     
      
    204 As Hunt AJA said in South v R [2007] NSWCCA 117 at [33],  
     
      
       
        
        “… the atmosphere of a trial is rarely apparent from an appeal book.” 
        
       
      
    205 If experienced defence counsel who have sat through a trial have failed to object that the course the judge had taken, or was proposing to take, created unfairness for their client, there is difficulty in making good, on appeal, the submission that there has been any such unfairness: Smale v R at [98]; South v R at [35]. In light of that, and of my own conclusion that the verdicts were justified on the evidence (a relevant matter in light of Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300) I would not uphold the submission that making mention of recklessness caused a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    206 A subsidiary aspect of this ground of appeal related to the trial judge’s direction concerning “wilful blindness”. There are numerous judicial warnings about the danger of using the expression “wilful blindness” when directing a jury concerning an offence in which knowledge is the mental element: R v Schipanski (1989) 17 NSWLR 618 at 620-621 per Gleeson CJ (with whom Grove and McInerney JJ agreed); Kural v R [1987] HCA 16; (1987) 162 CLR 502 at 511-512 per Toohey and Gaudron JJ (dissenting); R v McConnell (1993) 69 A Crim R 39 at [41] per Wood J. 
     
      
    207 In the present case, reading the directions concerning recklessness as a whole, I am not persuaded that their overall effect was to create a potentially misleading impression in the mind of the jury.  
     
      
    208 For these reasons I would reject the submission that there has been a denial of procedural fairness. 
     
      
       
      Substantive Unfairness? 
       
      
    209 The appellants submit that, as well, there has been substantive unfairness arising from the introduction of the notion of recklessness. It is said to arise because section 270.6(2)(b) created two distinct offences, one of which had knowledge as its fault element, the other of which had recklessness as its fault element. For the appellants to have possibly had a verdict of guilty entered against them by reference to the jury finding them guilty of an offence different to that with which they were charged, was submitted to give rise to substantive unfairness. 
     
      
    210 I am not persuaded that section 270.6(2)(b) creates two separate offences. While section 3.1(1) of the Code provides that “an offence consists of physical elements and fault elements” section 3.2(b) contemplates the possibility that there might be more than one fault element for the physical element of an offence. 
     
      
    211 In its own wording, section 270.6(2) suggests, by the use of the expression “an offence”, that only a single offence is intended to be created. The penalty provision for breach of section 270.6(2) is consistent with that view, providing a single penalty regardless of whether the offence is committed by knowing about, or by being reckless as to, the sexual servitude (though differentiating between whether the offence is an aggravated one or not). In those respects section 270.6(2) can be distinguished from section 270.3, in which subsections (1) and (2) create separate offences, with separate penalties, depending on whether the particular transactions relating to slavery that each defines were committed intentionally, or committed reckless as to whether the transaction involved a slave, slavery or slave trading.  
     
      
    212 For these reasons, in my view it is not established that there has been the kind of substantive unfairness that is alleged in the convictions being recorded. 
     
      
    213 I would not uphold the second ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Leave to Appeal Against Sentence 
       
      
    214 Both appellants seek leave, under section 5(1)(c) Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to appeal against their sentences. 
     
      
       
      Somsri’s Appeal 
       
      
    215 Somsri bases her application for leave to appeal against sentence on the basis that the overall sentence and non-parole period is manifestly excessive having regard to: (a) the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender, and (b) the sentence imposed on the co-offender. 
     
      
       
      Objective Seriousness of the Offence 
       
      
    216 Mr Corish submits that the objective seriousness was “towards the lowest end of the scale” in light of various factors. I will consider each of these in turn. 
     
      
    217 The first is that there was no deception or manipulative conduct which induced the victims to work in the brothels, and each of the complainants was aware of the conditions of the arrangement prior to arrival in Australia. In broad terms this submission is correct. As a matter of detail, it could be said against it that there was evidence that BB was not aware of all the arrangements, just of the fact that it was proposed that she be providing sex in return for money, and that concerning the other women it is not shown that they were aware of the physical limitations under which they would live in Australia, or of the fact that they would receive no money at all, apart from the occasional tip, until their “debt” was repaid. However, the main reason why I would be disinclined to place weight upon this factor is that section 270.7 of the Code creates a separate offence of deceptive recruiting for sexual services. If Somsri had engaged in, or been an accessory to, any deceptive recruiting for sexual services, and there was no separate charge in relation to that deceptive recruiting, and Somsri requested that it be taken into account in sentencing her in connection with the charge under section 270.6(2), it could be taken into account and could have a tendency to increase the sentence. However, that is not a reason why her conduct should be regarded as being “towards the lowest end of the scale”.  
     
      
    218 The next basis of Mr Corish’s submission is that the applicant played no personal part in taking steps for the complainants to leave Thailand. He points out that the judge, in his remarks on sentence, commented: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submits that there is little difference in the relevant factual circumstances of each offender. However the evidence at trial reveals that the offender [Somsri] had more extensive contact with the Thai organiser Pat than the offender Sieders. This is so in my assessment …” 
        
       
      
    219 It is inaccurate to say that Somsri played no personal part in taking steps for the complainants to leave Thailand. There was evidence that it was Somsri who telephoned Pat, at AA’s suggestion, and set in train the process through which BB came to Australia. 
     
      
    220 As well, there is a separate offence under section 270.6(1) whereby: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) whose conduct causes another person to enter into or remain in sexual servitude; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) who intends to cause, or is reckless as to causing, that sexual servitude; 
        
       
       
        
        is guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
       
      Somsri was not charged with that offence, nor with being an accessory to the committing of that offence. The offence of which she has been found guilty does not relate to the circumstances in which any of the women came to leave Thailand and entered upon the sexual servitude. 
       
      
    221 The next factor on which Mr Corish relies is that “the operation of a brothel is not an illegal activity. But for the condition of commercial servitude, the provision of sexual services in a brothel is entirely lawful.” 
     
      
    222 I have difficulty in regarding this as a factor that mitigates the severity of the conduct. It is somewhat like saying “but for the fact that he was driving in a manner dangerous to the public, driving a motor car is a perfectly lawful activity”. It is the features of conduct whereby it is criminal that are of particular significance in deciding the objective seriousness of the offence, not features of the conduct that are not the aspects that make it criminal. 
     
      
    223 The next factor on which Mr Corish relies is that the women were not physically restrained or prevented from leaving by virtue of any threat of force or confinement. In relation to Somsri, there was the evidence of her conversations concerning the women “escaping”, and her conversation with DD in which she said that if DD escaped, “we will find you”. I accept that an assessment of the conditions under which the servitude happened is appropriate. The trial judge took this factor into account, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I accept that in [Sieders’] case there has been no physical coercion exercised by him and that the extent to which he exercised control over these girls was somewhat more limited than that control exercised by [Somsri].” 
        
       
      
    224 But even though there was no physical restraint on the women (in the sense of being locked up, or chained), and that is relevant to assessment of the seriousness of the offence, the message was clearly got through to the women, and accepted by them, that they were not free to leave until their debt had been paid. In relation to BB, Somsri collected her from AA’s flat and put her to work notwithstanding that she was ill.  
     
      
    225 The next factor relied on by Mr Corish was that, once the debt was discharged, some of the women continued to work in the sex industry. The judge accepted that that was so in his remarks on sentence. As the judge remarked, the fact that they have continued to work in that fashion  
     
      
       
        
        “does not bring to account the risk faced by these women that at any point in time they were liable to deportation, and had the prospect of generating the money required to discharge their debt only to be then deported from this country without the opportunities to which counsel have referred.” (ROS 6) 
        
       
      
    226 In any event, the continuance of the women working in the sex industry is consistent with their having voluntarily entered the arrangement in the first place, and not having changed their minds thereafter. However, the essence of the offence does not lie in compelling someone to do that which she does not wish to do. Rather, it lies in employing people, in this particular industry, who are not free to carry out the activities identified in section 270.4(1)(a) or (b) because of the use of force or threats, should they wish to carry out those activities. 
     
      
    227 The final matter relied on by Mr Corish was that the trial judge referred, (at ROS 25.2) to the women having been “the subject of exploitation” by people such as Somsri and Pat. The trial judge did not explain which of the various shades of meaning of “exploitation” he was intending. It is undoubtedly true that the women were utilised for the purpose of financial gain by Sieders and Somsri, in the sense in which any employer exploits his or her employees. It may be that the trial judge meant nothing more than that. However, in the present case the evidence indicates that the amount required by the Thai arrangers was less than $20,000 per woman, yet the women were required to “repay” $45,000. While it was the obligation of the brothel owners to provide food and shelter for the period during which the debt was being repaid, the shelter was provided in premises for which the brothel owners incurred no marginal cost, and the cost of the food for the period in question would have been nothing like $25,000. The “mothers of the contract” stood to make a considerable profit, in addition to the brothel owners receiving the proportion of the earnings that they would receive from a prostitute who was not under contract. I see no error in the trial judge’s having referred to the women being the subject of exploitation.  
     
      
    228 Standing back from these individual factors, and bearing in mind that the maximum penalty is 15 years, setting an overall term of 5 years with a non-parole period of 2½ years does not seem out of keeping with the objective seriousness of the offence. For someone to be denied personal freedom, concerning so intimate a matter as with whom and under what circumstances they will have sexual relations, is an inherently serious matter. 
     
      
       
      Parity 
       
      
    229 The trial judge imposed different sentences on the offenders “to reflect the differences in their criminality”. Mr Corish submits that the distinction made by the judge is that Somsri was found guilty of conducting a business at a number of brothels, whereas Sieders was found guilty of conducting a business involving a single brothel. 
     
      
    230 In my view, that submission misreads the trial judge’s remarks on sentence. His Honour pointed to various other differences between the two offenders, namely: 
     
      
       
      (a) Three of the women involved in the case were employed in Sieders’ brothel, whereas all four were employed by Somsri. (ROS 15) 
       
       
      (b)  
      “[Sieders’] role is marginally less than that of [Somsri]” 
       (ROS 15) 
       
       
      (c)  
      “… the extent to which he exercised control over these girls was somewhat more limited than that control exercised by [Somsri] 
       (ROS 23-24) 
       
      
    231 Those remarks are in my view justified, bearing in mind that it was only concerning Somsri that there was evidence of a warning given to one of the women not to escape, or of a conversation concerning “buying” one of the women. As well, there was evidence of Somsri insisting on BB working when she was unwilling to do so, and of her having a direct role in contacting Pat to arrange the bringing to Australia of BB. There was evidence of Somsri being one of the “mothers of the contract”. There was no corresponding evidence concerning Sieders on any of these matters. In my view the trial judge was justified in drawing a distinction between the two sentences to the extent he did.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances of Somsri 
       
      
    232 The subjective circumstances of Somsri were detailed in a report of a psychologist, Associate Professor Stephen Woods.  
     
      
    233 He reported that Somsri was currently aged 34 (a misprint for 44), the eldest of 3 children from her parents’ marriage, and part of a blended family of 13 children. Her father left home when she was about 5. She lived with her father for a couple of years, then moved to live with her mother. By that time there was a stepfather, who, like her father, was an emotionally and physically abusive person. She was raped at age 13, became pregnant, and in consequence she and her family were socially ostracised in their village, and forced to leave school. At the age of 15 she left her son in the care of her mother and moved to Bangkok to obtain work. She came to Australia in 1997, as she had a sister living in Australia. During the time she was here she met a man and began a relationship with him, and ultimately married him. She separated from that husband in 1999.  
     
      
    234 In late 1999 she met her current de facto partner, with whom she had no children. She began working as a prostitute in Australia around the time of separating from her husband. She continues to support her son in Thailand, who has a disability resulting from a motor accident. Around three months prior to her arrest she rented the premises where the offence occurred (I note that does not match other evidence – she was arrested on 30 July 2004 and DD had arrived and been taken to Somsri’s brothel on 3 December 2003). Professor Woods expressed the view that she was experiencing symptoms consistent with a post traumatic condition referred to as Disorder of Extreme Stress Not Otherwise Specified, resulting from her rape and detention, and subsequent ostracism, and aggravated by the need to leave her son in the care of her mother to go to a large city to find work at the age of 15. He also found that she was suffering from an acutely depressed mood, arising from her poor language skills and being the only Thai-speaking person in the gaol. He took the view that her risk of re-offending was low, and that her social isolation was exacerbating her psychiatric condition. The trial judge did not accept that her psychiatric condition had any causal relationship with the offence of which she had been found guilty. He has referred to the evidence concerning her subjective circumstances, and I do not see any basis for concluding that he did not take it into account. 
     
      
    235 There were no comparable sentencing statistics available for the judge, as this was the first prosecution that had been brought under the section (or, it seems, under any of its State analogues). However, the trial judge referred to the sentences imposed in R v DS (incorrectly cited in the judgment below as R v Diaz) [2005] VSCA 99; (2005) 191 FLR 337 (guilty pleas to 5 counts of sexual slavery offences) and R v Lelah [2002] VSCA 96 (conviction by a jury of a number of offences relating to the use of drugs to induce a person to continue prostitution). 
     
      
    236 The trial judge considered, in a way not shown to be in error, the various factors that section 16A and 17A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) require to be taken into account. 
     
      
    237 I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed by his Honour on Somsri fell outside the range of a permissible sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    238 The fact that this is the first time an offence under section 270.6(2) has been considered by an appeal court is in itself sufficient reason to grant leave to appeal. However I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Sieders’ Sentence Appeal 
       
      
    239 Sieders seeks leave to appeal against the sentence, on the ground that the sentence is manifestly excessive. His counsel submits that there were two specific errors made by the trial judge, namely in finding: 
     
      
       
      (i) that the women worked without payment to themselves; and 
       
       
      (ii) that the jury’s decision was consistent with the applicant  
      “knowing” 
       of the sexual servitude, as opposed to being  
      “reckless” 
       as to that fact. 
       
      
    240 The submission that the judge’s finding that the women worked without payment to themselves is erroneous is based upon some evidence given by BB’s brother. The brother gave evidence of sending text messages to his sister requesting that money be sent to him. He said he had received some money from her, around 10,000 baht (about A$340). No documents relating to that transfer of money were tendered. BB denied that she had sent any money to her brother. There was evidence that before BB came to Australia AA gave BB’s brother some rights to withdraw money from an account that AA had, and that AA sent money over to BB’s mother. (T 75). In his remarks on sentence the trial judge said (ROS 8) that he was satisfied that the women “were under a contract to work without payment as prostitutes u",2008-08-12 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Blanch J.2 GROVE J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Blanch J in draft form. As his recapitulation of the agreed facts demonstrates, the objective seriousness of the criminal conduct of the applicant was very high and the finding of the learned sentencing judge that the offence was close to being in the worst category for the particular offence was plainly correct. The extreme youth of the applicant constituted an essentially isolated subjective factor which might attract mitigation of sentence.3 The legislative mandate in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 needed to be applied. Unless otherwise stated section references are to that statute. I agree with the reasons of Blanch J for rejecting the argument that Hulme DCJ failed to have proper regard to the provisions of that Act. 4 It would be less than candid, however, not to state that the submission that his Honour erred in failing to give effect to his intention to impose a non-parole period which will expire prior to the applicant’s 21st birthday has caused me considerable concern. 5 Section 19 empowers a sentencing judge to direct that the whole or part of any term imposed on a person under the age of 21 be served as a juvenile offender. The eligibility to serve such whole or part of term in that fashion expires when the offender attains the age of 21 unless the term itself is scheduled to expire within the six months following that attainment. See s 19 (2). Hence, in setting the non-parole period in respect of the sentence on the applicant there existed power to direct that that term be served as a juvenile offender, he having been born on 26 December 1990, until 25 June 2012. 6 It is recognized that the effect of a direction may be overridden by the Minister who, pursuant to the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987, may transfer an offender who has attained 18 years to an adult prison, but I would regard the existence of a power which may or may not be implemented as irrelevant to the performance of judicial function in assessing sentence, determining a non-parole period and whether or not to make a direction under s 19.7 An express submission was made in the District Court (page 7 transcript 31 August 2007) that “behaviour modification therapy suggested in a psychological report could be best addressed in a juvenile detention facility and that, while no submission was made about a non-parole period which would extend after the applicant attained 18 years of age”, it was submitted that, in the light of the expiry of that potential when the applicant was 21, any non-parole period would not extend beyond that period of time.8 In his remarks on sentence his Honour analysed the various experts’ reports but did not specifically deal with this submission. He did state that he was satisfied “there are special circumstances for the offender to be detained after he has attained the age of 18”. He did not at that point refer to a particular time at which that form of detention should terminate. He then referred to the desirability of the applicant undertaking programmes and counselling and concluded that “it is distinctly possible that such programmes will not be efficacious for the offender at the present time but will become so as the offender moves into his later teenage years”.9 Thereafter sentence was imposed comprising a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months with a balance term of 4 years commencing on 22 May 2006, the date on which actual custody had commenced. The transcript records that his Honour specified to the applicant, “You will be eligible for release on parole on the expiry of the non-parole period on 22 November 2011”. Obviously, 6 years 6 months commencing on 22 May 2006 will expire not on 21 November 2011 but on 21 November 2012. On 21 November 2011 the applicant will be one month five days short of his 21st birthday, however his Honour continued and later stated, “Pursuant to s 19 (3) of the Children (Criminal Procedure) Act 1987 I direct that you serve your sentence as a juvenile offender until you attain the age of 21”.10 Section 19 (3) was germane as the applicant had committed a defined serious indictable offence but that provision is subject to subsection (2), the effect of which I have noted above.11 The back of the indictment has not been endorsed but as the Crown submissions note, and the document was produced during the hearing of the appeal, his Honour’s “signed record of proceedings correctly records 2012”. 12 The mechanics of the provisions of s 19, if applied to the present matter, would operate as follows, observing of course, that what is involved is a date of earliest eligibility for release to parole and not an entitlement to be so released.13 A non-parole period expiring on 21 November 2012, being just short of 11 months after the applicant’s 21st birthday and longer than the six months extension contemplated by s 19 (2), would see the applicant detained in juvenile detention from 22 May 2006 until 26 December 2011, a period of about 5 years 7 months and then he would be kept in the environment of an adult prison for about 11 months. That sequence is a potential consequence of the specification of a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months. A specification of a non-parole period of 6 years 1 month would operate to have the applicant achieve eligibility for parole at the extreme end (by four days) of the period in which he could be kept in juvenile detention.14 Given the clear policy of placing primary focus upon the rehabilitation of young offenders evidenced in s 6 and the existence of programmes which would be undertaken in juvenile detention, I have found an outcome which involves over 5½ years followed by a little under a year in adult confinement somewhat troubling. I was attracted by the force of the submission by counsel for the applicant that it requires only a relatively slight change in the proportion of non-parole period to head sentence to have a dramatic effect upon the impact of the sentence. 15 Although, as his Honour observed, the forecasts of the experts were relatively gloomy, only time and experience will show whether the applicant can make a positive response. If he does make good use of his opportunities while in juvenile detention, I would apprehend a genuine risk that any rehabilitation achieved might be compromised by transferring him to an adult facility. That transfer will inevitably happen if his non-parole period does not expire until 21 November 2012. Irrespective of when his non-parole period is ordered to expire, if he fails to make use of his opportunities he will, by attainment of age, be so transferred. My concern is principally focussed upon the above described risk which the “slight change” postulated by counsel would avoid. In view of the short period involved it is difficult to perceive the risk as necessary and its avoidance would be in harmony with the principle expressed in s 6 that young offenders require guidance and assistance.16 However, there is nothing in his Honour’s remarks nor in the record to indicate an intention (as asserted in the ground of appeal) that the applicant spend the whole of his non-parole period in juvenile detention. The power of this Court to intervene is exercisable upon finding error and in its absence it is necessary to maintain discipline against succumbing to temptation to substitute a preferred sentence or order for that which is made by a sentencing judge within the ambit of his discretion.17 The unchallengeable finding that the offence lay near the worst case category demands rejection of the submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The combination of his Honour’s expression of a non-parole period of 6 years 6 months, his reference to juvenile detention until the age of 21, his Honour’s awareness of the applicant’s birthday and the signed note confirming the date of expiry of the non-parole period at 21 November 2012 obliges a conclusion that the reference to 21 November 2011 was an error of either tongue or transcription and does not provide a basis for finding a material error and authorizing a variance to the sentences and orders made by Hulme DCJ.18 Despite the concerns which I have expressed, I agree that the orders proposed by Blanch J should be made.19 BLANCH J: By notice dated 18 April, 2008 the applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed in the District Court on 6 September, 2007. On 16 July, 2007 he appeared at the Bathurst sittings of the District Court and entered a plea of guilty to a charge that on 19 May, 2006 he had sexual intercourse with CN without her consent knowing she was not consenting and at the time he maliciously inflicted actual bodily harm. The offence is under s61J(1) Crimes Act 1900 for which a maximum penalty of 20 years is prescribed and there is a standard non-parole period of 10 years.20 The applicant was born on 26 December, 1990 and at the time of the offence he was aged 15. At the time of sentence he was 16. Accordingly, the offence is a serious children’s indictable offence and must be dealt with accordingly to law. At the time of sentencing he asked that a further offence of detaining CN for advantage be taken into account. That offence is under s86(2)(b) Crimes Act 1900 for which a maximum penalty of 20 years is prescribed. On 6 September, 2007 the applicant was sentenced to a term of 10½ years imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6½ years, the sentence and non-parole period to date from 22 May, 2006 with the non-parole period to expire on 21 November, 2012. 21 The agreed statement of facts tendered was in the following terms: 
     
      
      On the evening of 19 May 2006 CN, who was then twenty-six years old, met up with a group of friends at an address in Kelso. The offender was also at that address. He had known CN for about eight months. Later in the evening CN and the offender went to a unit in Forest Place in Bathurst. Two other males were in that unit. CN and the offender spoke with these men for a short time before the offender requested sex from CN. She declined. He then demanded it and she again declined. At this point the offender became violent. He armed himself with a length of wood, approximately 80 to 100 centimetres long and 40 millimetres wide, and struck CN with it a number of times to the head and upper body, thereby inflicting injuries to her head that bled profusely.  
      
     
     
      
      The offender continued to demand sex whilst carrying out this assault. Out of fear CN lay on the bed in the room and the offender removed her blood splattered coat, shirt and underwear. He then inserted his penis into her vagina and had sexual intercourse with her for a period of time, ejaculating inside her. 
      
     
     
      
      When he had finished the offender told CN to stand up naked in front of the other two males. He then offered her to them in order that they have sexual intercourse with her but they declined. 
      
     
     
      
      The offender then threatened and struck CN again with the length of wood and demanded that she have a shower. She complied. After showering CN was held captive at the unit for some time. At around midnight she managed to escape from the unit but was pursued by the offender. He managed to detain her and return her to the unit where he further assaulted her. Witnesses heard CN screaming and one saw her being pursued by the offender. Police were called but they failed to find her. 
      
     
     
      
      CN remained at the unit for a further number of hours during which time the offender taunted, threatened and further assaulted her. The other two males continued to be present but they did nothing to assist CN or call the police. 
      
     
     
      
      About 2.30am two teenage girls arrived at the unit to visit one of the occupants. On entering they saw CN semi-naked and covered in blood. They saw the offender in possession of the length of wood and waving it in the direction of CN. These two girls then assisted CN to leave the unit. The offender followed them into the street still armed with the piece of wood. He called to CN to return but she and the two girls walked away. The offender threatened CN not to contact the police. 
      
     
     
      
      As they got out of sight of the offender CN lost her composure and disclosed the sexual assault to the two girls. They took her to a nearby house where police and ambulance officers were summoned. CN was taken to Bathurst Base Hospital where she was spoken to by detectives. At this time it was noted that she was severely traumatised by the incident and frightened of the offender to the point that she asked for police assistance to leave Bathurst. 
      
     
     
      
      CN suffered the following injuries: a wound to the front left of her head that required five sutures, a wound to the back of her head that required two sutures, significant bruising to the face and head, a blackened left eye that was swollen and closed, large defensive bruises and welts to the inner upper thighs. 
      
    22 On 22 May, 2006 the applicant was arrested. He denied any involvement in the assault. Police noted blood stains on his shoes and semen with the applicant’s DNA profile was detected in a high vaginal swab taken from CN. Her DNA profile was also found in blood stains on the applicant’s clothing.23 The criminal history of the applicant is that he first appeared before the Children’s Court in October, 2004 when aged 13 for an offence of possess implements to enter a conveyance and larceny. He subsequently appeared at Bathurst Children’s Court in February, 2005 and was given a bond to be of good behaviour for 12 months in respect of a number of offences of dishonesty and assaulting police. In October, 2005 he was fined on a charge of possess prohibited drug and on 21 November, 2005 he was released on probation for 10 months in respect of a charge of larceny and a charge of take and drive conveyance without consent. The commission of this offence was a breach of that bond. At the time of this offence he was also on conditional bail in respect of another matter.24 The sentencing judge had the benefit of a Juvenile Justice report, a report by Ms Anita Duffy, psychologist and a report by Dr John Kasinathan, psychiatrist. The Juvenile Justice report indicates he was born in Walgett and has always lived with his mother. He said he first met his father when he was 14 years of age, however, it is said he had a close relationship with his grandfather and uncles. Reports indicate he left school in term 2 of year 8 after periods of disruptive behaviour and non-attendance at school. He claimed to have been drinking alcohol, smoking cigarettes and taking cannabis from the age of 7. He said he inhaled petrol for 6 months prior to his arrest. The report noted his disrupted upbringing in an Aboriginal family and concluded that his reluctance to accept responsibility for the offence may inhibit his future capacity to avoid offending. The report expressed the need for him to address his problems with substance abuse and his lack of education. The psychiatric report of Dr Kasinathan said he met the diagnostic criteria for sexual sadism because the suffering of the victim was sexually exciting to him and assessed him as having a high risk of future offending for offences related to sex and violence.25 The offence is obviously a very serious one but which was committed at a time when the applicant was almost 15 years and 5 months old. It is the reconciliation of the principles relevant to those 2 factors which creates the difficulty in arriving at an appropriate sentence in this case.26 On behalf of the applicant it is submitted that the sentencing judge erred in failing to have proper regard to s6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. That section reads as follows: 
     
      
      6 Principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction 
       
        
        A court, in exercising criminal jurisdiction with respect to children, shall have regard to the following principles: 
        
       
       
      (a) that children have rights and freedoms before the law equal to those enjoyed by adults and, in particular, a right to be heard, and a right to participate, in the processes that lead to decisions that affect them, 
       
      
     
     
      
      (b) that children who commit offences bear responsibility for their actions but, because of their state of dependency and immaturity, require guidance and assistance, 
      
     
     
      
      (c) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow the education or employment of a child to proceed without interruption,  
      
     
     
      
      (d) that it is desirable, wherever possible, to allow a child to reside in his or her own home, 
      
     
     
      
      (e) that the penalty imposed on a child for an offence should be no greater than that imposed on an adult who commits an offence of the same kind. 
      
    In particular it is said that the sentencing judge did not make specific reference to s6(c).27 What the sentencing judge said was: 
     
      
      “There are a number of principles that I must have regard to in sentencing in this case. First are the principles relating to the exercise of criminal jurisdiction in relation to children set out in s6 Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. I will not set out the terms of that section but I confirm that I have borne them in mind.” 
      
    He then went on to deal in particular with s6(b).28 I do not see that a failure to quote s6(c) indicates that his Honour did not have proper regard to it. In a very careful judgment he said that he had borne in mind all the provisions of the section. Moreover the judge specifically did refer to the Juvenile Justice report noting the applicant would be able to participate in sexual offender and drug counselling programs while in custody. A failure to mention allowing the applicant’s education to proceed without interruption in my view is not an error, particularly when the judge said he had taken all the provisions of s6 into account. I note in this case the applicant had already left school and it cannot be said that his current education was being interrupted.29 It is next submitted on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge erred in failing to give effect to his intention to impose a sentence with a non-parole period which “will expire prior to the applicant’s 21st birthday.” It is the fact that in the remarks on sentence the judge in sentencing him to a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months from 22 May, 2006 said “You will be eligible for release on parole on the expiry of the non-parole period on 21 November, 2011”. A non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months from 22 May, 2006 would in fact expire on 21 November, 2012. The signed record of proceedings records the expiry date of the non-parole period correctly as 21 November, 2012.30 At no stage did his Honour say he was intending that the non-parole period would expire prior to the applicant’s 21st birthday. The relevance of that argument in this case is that the sentencing judge directed that the applicant serve his sentence as a juvenile offender until he attained the age of 21. He will attain the age of 21 on 26 December, 2011. Bearing that in mind it is clear his Honour expected him to be in custody at least until 26 December, 2011 and it would appear the mention of a non-parole period expiring on 21 November, 2011 was simply a mistake by his Honour which was corrected when he signed the record of proceedings.31 This ground highlights the applicant’s underlying submission that a slight reduction in the non-parole period would enable the applicant to serve the whole of the sentence in a Juvenile Justice facility whereas, as the sentence presently stands, he would be required to serve the last part of his non-parole period in an adult institution. That is a factor which is relevant to consider but under s28 of the Children (Detention Centres) Act 1987 the Minister has the power to transfer him to an adult institution at any time after he turns 18. It might be expected that in considering exercising that power the effects on his continuing education (if any) will be taken into account. 32 The third ground of appeal is that the non-parole period is in all the circumstances manifestly excessive. This ground raises for consideration the difficulties of balancing the need for deterrence on the one hand and the fact that general deterrence is a matter of less significance when sentencing a juvenile. The principles relevant to that have been considered on a number of occasions by this Court (see, for example, MS2 v The Queen (2005) 158 ACrimR 93 and KT v R [2008] NSWCCA 51). The facts of this case are objectively very serious. The sentencing judge has, in my view, correctly categorised the offence as close to the worst category of offence under s61J. Having found that, his Honour then referred to the standard non-parole period of 10 years as giving some guidance and ultimately taking into account the age and subjective features relevant to the applicant, he arrived at a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months. In my view, the sentencing judge gave proper consideration to all relevant matters in fixing the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are no errors in the way the sentence was imposed and, in my view, the sentence was correct. I am not of the view that a sentence of less severity is warranted and in accordance with s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: This is an application for leave to appeal from an interlocutory order made on 23 April 2008 by a District Court Judge (Finnane DCJ) upholding a claim of public interest immunity in relation to the documents called for in paragraphs 1-7 of an amended schedule to a subpoena issued on behalf of the accused (the applicant for leave to appeal) and setting aside the subpoena in relation to those paragraphs. The amended schedule was annexed to a letter dated 22 April 2008 from the accused’s solicitor to the Crown Solicitor’s Office. 
     
      
    2 The accused, the applicant for leave to appeal, is in custody on remand awaiting trial in relation to charges connected with the shooting of a number of persons on 12 September 2004. The shooting was said to involve the affairs of a motor cycle gang known as “The Nomads”. 
     
      
    3 At his committal hearing, a policeman, Senior Constable Wild, gave evidence and was cross-examined. It was put to Senior Constable Wild that he said to a Mr Campton, one of the victims of the shooting, while the latter was in hospital by reason of his wounds: 
     
      
       
        
        Wild: Do you know who had done this? 
         
        Victim: No 
        
       
       
        
        Wild: Do you want to know who did it? 
        
       
       
        
        Victim: No. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    4 The solicitor for the applicant gave evidence in an affidavit sworn for the application to this Court that he was present at the committal and that he took from Senior Constable Wild’s evidence at the committal that shortly after the shooting the police obtained information as to what had taken place inside the premises in question and who was responsible for the shooting. The solicitor expressed his conclusion that the information was or must have been derived from some form of electronic surveillance on a person who observed the events or was informed of them shortly after they occurred. He stated that the police have a record of this information. The affidavit set out a number of matters by way of submission as to the application.  
     
      
    5 Open affidavits of Sgt David Driscoll, the officer in charge of the investigation, were before the primary judge and this Court. The first affidavit was directed to oppression and the absence of apparent forensic purpose. The second foreshadowed public interest immunity claims. 
     
      
    6 An open affidavit of Acting Deputy Commissioner Peter Dein was before the primary judge and this Court. A claim for public interest immunity privilege was made in a confidential affidavit of Acting Deputy Commissioner Dein that was given to the primary judge. It was provided to this Court. 
     
      
    7 The Commissioner of Police also relied in this Court on an open affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Paul Carey. He set out the history of the matter and provided two confidential exhibits: Confidential Exhibit PC 1 and Confidential Exhibit PC 2. Confidential Exhibit PC 1 contained the documents caught by paragraphs 1 to 7 of the amended schedule to the subpoena. Confidential Exhibit PC 2 was another affidavit of Assistant Commissioner Carey which was confidential. The Court examined (without opposition) the information referred to above that claimed to be confidential. Plainly it bears that character. 
     
      
    8 Before the primary judge debate first took place on the subject of the legitimate forensic purpose of the subpoena. The solicitor for the accused relied on the matters stated at the committal and in particular the aspects of that which he said revealed that the documents sought would reveal information germane to the identity of the person who shot Mr Campton. He relied on the cross-examination of Senior Constable Wild and what Mr Campton said Senior Constable Wild said to him (Mr Campton) in hospital. 
     
      
    9 The solicitor stated that the legitimate forensic purpose was ascertaining what information was given to the police on the day of the shooting because it was said to contain evidence of an eyewitness (not the victim and proposed witness in the trial, Mr Campton). It was submitted that the statement made by Senior Constable Wild at the hospital revealed that there was another witness. The solicitor did not seek the identity of that witness but the documents to reveal what he or she saw and told the police. 
     
      
    10 Mr Grady, who appeared for the Commissioner of Police before the primary judge and before this Court submitted to the primary judge that there was no legitimate forensic purpose demonstrated and he relied on the confidential affidavit, for the whole of his application. 
     
      
    11 The primary judge then looked at the confidential affidavit. 
     
      
    12 It should be noted that the issue of forensic purpose (or lack thereof) was a ground of setting the subpoena aside, as well as a relevant consideration bound up with the claim for public interest immunity privilege. 
     
      
    13 After the primary judge read the confidential affidavit he said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        In my opinion there may be a legitimate forensic purpose in getting access to the material but I uphold the claim of public interest immunity … 
        
       
       
      His Honour then set aside paragraphs 1 – 7 of the relevant schedule to the subpoena. 
       
      
    14 After some further discussion, the following exchange between the primary judge and the solicitor for the accused took place: 
     
      
       
        
        GALLOWAY: That’s fine. Your Honour indicated to my friend in reply to the production of the records and we know from that transcript they do exist by the way, I gather from your Honours decision – I’m just clarifying a couple of matters – that you don’t require to see the material in possession --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Having regard to the affidavit, I do not require to see the actual material. 
        
       
       
        
        GALLOWAY: I think it’s important to note for the record, your Honour having decided on – I mean no disrespect in saying this to you, on deciding the public interest claim I note the respondent hasn’t been heard in relation to that aspect of the matter. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s right. I have looked at it, I have decided. Now I cannot, by making this decision, prevent you issuing another subpoena and arguing it again before the trial judge subject of course to the right of the trial judge to reject it as vexatious or something. But it is a purely interlocutory order. 
        
       
       
        
        GALLOWAY: I understand, your Honour, and for the purpose of -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: And I might say the trial judge might, having regard to what occurs at the trial, might want to revisit it, I don’t know. I’m not suggesting he would. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    15 There were nine grounds of complaint in this Court in the amended application as to the conduct of the application by the judge, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) that the trial judge erred in law by declining to afford the accused procedural fairness in respect to the right to be heard on the issue of public interest immunity; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) that the trial judge erred in law by reason of the denial of procedural fairness for want of adequate reasons; 
        
       
       
        
        (3) that the trial judge erred by failing to take into account the evidentiary inadequacy of the open affidavit in support of the alleged privilege; 
        
       
       
        
        (4) that the trial judge erred in law by failing to take into account the serious departure from proper investigative procedure in respect of an alleged victim in relation to the content of the alleged confidential information the subject of claimed public interest immunity; 
        
       
       
        
        (5) that the trial judge in determining the application as to public interest immunity erred in law by failing to take into account to the legitimate forensic purpose in respect of which production was sought; 
        
       
       
        
        (6) that the trial judge erred by failing to take into account the importance of the information as to the innocence of the accused and the flawed veracity and credibility of the Crown case as to who shot and wounded Dale Campton being one of the alleged physical elements in the indictment against the accused under s33 of the  
        Crimes Act 1900 
        ; 
        (7) that the trial judge failed to take into account the matters identified in s130(5) of the Evidence Act 1995 in determining whether production should be required; 
        
       
       
        
        (8) that the trial judge erred by failing to hold that the accused had established on the cards that the documents would materially assist the accused’s case in establishing his innocence; 
        
       
       
        
        (9) that the trial judge erred by failing to inspect each of the actual documents to determine whether the content as to the identity of the shooter of Dale Campton would materially assist the accused’s case in establishing his innocence. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    16 Ground 7 can be dismissed immediately. The application was covered by the common law, not the Evidence Act 1995: Esso Australia Resources Ltd v Commissioner of Taxation of the Commonwealth of Australia (1999) 201 CLR 49. 
     
      
    17 Ground 1 is, however, made out. The primary judge, in effect, refused to hear the solicitor for the accused on the question of public interest immunity. It may have been that the judge took the view that since the accused and his solicitor were not entitled to see the confidential material seeking to substantiate the immunity that meant that he did not have to provide the solicitor for the accused with an opportunity to put submissions to him. That would not follow at all. The primary judge should have given Mr Galloway (the solicitor for the accused) an opportunity to address the issues in the light of the open evidence. This was an error in his Honour’s approach. Parties should be entitled to address a court on an issue such as this. It may be that it can be said that a denial of a right to address made no difference. I would prefer to recognise the error in his Honour’s approach and approach the matter afresh by recognising the error as the basis for granting leave to appeal. In these circumstances, it is unnecessary to deal with the other complaints about the approach of the primary judge. 
     
      
    18 Mr Street SC, who appeared with Mr Edwards, on behalf of the applicant put detailed submissions about how the documents the subject of the subpoena must go to the question of identification. He stressed the seriousness of the charges; he asserted the impropriety of what Senior Constable Wild was said to have done; he stressed the asserted legitimate purpose of production of the documents. He said that the surrounding material of Mr Campton’s evidence, the recent withdrawal of some of Mr Campton’s evidence and the discussion said to have taken place at the hospital all made it plain that it was “on the cards” that the documents the subject of the paragraphs in the subpoena would materially assist the defence: see Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404 at 414; Attorney-General for New South Wales v Chidgey [2008] NSWCCA 65; R v Saleam [1999] NSWCCA 86[11]. 
     
      
    19 No objection was taken to this Court inspecting not only the confidential affidavit before the primary judge but also the Confidential Exhibits PC 1 and PC 2. A reading of that material permits me to say that I am not persuaded that the documents would assist the defence in any way. I am clearly of the view that it was not “on the cards” that this would be so. This being the case, there is no basis to order a stay should access be refused to the documents covered by the relevant paragraphs of the amended schedule to the subpoena (as in my view, it should be). No legal principle requires this Court to conclude that the material (being the affidavit material and the documents themselves) cannot be looked at to assess this issue, as appeared to be put on behalf of the applicant 
     
      
    20 The documents are clearly entitled to the protection of public interest immunity privilege. To elaborate reasons for that conclusion would tend to destroy the privilege. So, I do not propose to do so. 
     
      
    21 It was submitted that the respondent had waived parts of the confidential affidavit by a submission that those parts assisted in the conclusion that no forensic purpose existed. I reject that submission. The whole of the confidential material can be examined to assess the public interest in the material in question remaining confidential and immune from access. By its nature and content, it also tends to undermine the assertions made on behalf of the applicant based on the surrounding circumstances to which attention was drawn. To say more than this would undermine the confidentiality of the material. It is sufficient to repeat, at this point, the conclusion that I am not persuaded that the documents sought would assist the defence in any way. 
     
      
    22 Although I am of the view that the primary judge erred in not hearing the applicant’s solicitor on the application, I would not interfere with his order. Therefore, I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    23 Thus the orders that I would make are as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal from the order of the District Court made on 23 April 2008 setting aside paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 of a further amended schedule to a subpoena issued on behalf of Hassan Ibrahim to the Commissioner of Police, the form of such schedule being attached to a letter dated 22 April 2008 from Galloways, Solicitors and Attorneys to the Crown Solicitor’s Office. 
       
       
      2. Dismiss the appeal. 
       
      
    24 Each of the members of the Court has in his possession confidential material. The representative of the respondent should make arrangements with the Registrar of the Court of Criminal Appeal for the safe retrieval of this material.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Barr J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: This is an appeal by the Crown under s5F(3A) Criminal Appeal Act against a decision made in the District Court rejecting the tender of a statement signed by the complainant and principal Crown witness in the trial of the respondent, Richard Harry Morton. 
     
      
    3 The respondent is due to be tried in the District Court on a charge that on or about 22 February 2007 at Leichhardt, while in the company of one Timothy Lee Davis, he robbed Matthieu Marie Bruno Scherer of a mobile telephone and a wristwatch the property of Mr Scherer, and alternatively that at the same time and place he robbed Mr Scherer of those goods.  
     
      
    4 Mr Scherer was a French national, resident temporarily in Sydney and working under the terms of a visa. A little after midnight on 22 February 2007 Mr Scherer was on his way home from work. He seated himself at a bus stop in Parramatta Road, Leichhardt. Two men went up to him, the respondent and Davis. Davis was the shorter of the two men. He was wearing a light coloured singlet. The respondent was wearing a black t-shirt. He was bald and bearded. He was wearing jeans which had a rip in one leg. Mr Scherer had his mobile telephone in his hand. Davis demanded that he hand it over. He took hold of him and pulled him off the seat and onto the ground. As he lay there Davis raised his fist in a threatening manner. Mr Scherer handed over his mobile phone. Davis demanded his money and bag. The respondent leaned over and tried to remove Mr Scherer’s watch from his wrist. Mr Scherer was so afraid that he undid the watch and handed it to him. Mr Scherer slid under the bus stop seat to try to get away but the two men ran around the bus stop and cut him off. Mr Scherer made some excuse and put the attackers off their guard. He used the moment to run away and seek help from the proprietor of a shop which was open nearby. He said, “Please help me. They took my wallet, my phone”. He pointed to his two attackers, who could be seen from the shop. The proprietor saw them and ran towards them. They were getting into a taxi. He told the taxi driver not to drive off. He pulled Davis out of the back seat and went to take hold of the respondent. He denied responsibility. He said that the other man had Mr Scherer’s “stuff”. So the respondent was left in the taxi and the driver took him away. The shopkeeper dealt with Davis and the police were called. While they were there the respondent returned on foot. He pretended to be a friend of Mr Scherer and handed him back his mobile telephone and watch and some coins. He said, “Hey mate, I got your phone and watch back. I found them in the taxi”. He also said something to the effect that Davis had thrown the goods into the taxi. He began to act aggressively and announced that he was under the influence of methadone. One of the officers, Constable Jarvis, drew Mr Scherer aside and asked whether he knew the respondent. Mr Scherer said that the respondent was the man who had stolen his watch. He identified him by the tear on his jeans. The respondent and Davis were arrested. 
     
      
    5 Mr Scherer was taken to the police station and was asked to make a statement. His first language was French. He spoke some English but felt that he needed help in putting what he wanted to say into that language. Accordingly he telephoned a friend of his, Mr Amaury le Pivain. He attended and the two of them spoke at the police station. Mr le Pivain spoke French and English well. Constable Steinmetz took the statement. The three persons spoke together and in that way the statement was prepared in English. Mr Scherer signed the statement. This critical part of it was the only evidence that the respondent had stolen the wristwatch, viz -  
     
      
       
        
        After I gave this man my phone, he continued to stand over me, He then said to me, “Give me your money and your bad”. I then saw the other man, the one with the bald head and beard, come over to where I was. The bald headed man stood over me and he bent down and lifted up my left wrist. He didn’t say anything to me, but he was trying to undo my watch to take it. He was having trouble undoing the latch on my watch and I was scared I would get hurt if I didn’t give it to him, so I undid it for him and he took it off my wrist. I don’t know where he put it. 
        
       
      
    6 The trial came on for hearing while Mr Scherer was still in Australia, but Davis had not yet then been committed for trial and the Crown asked for the respondent’s trial to be vacated so that there could be a joint trial of the two robbers. The trial was adjourned and Mr Scherer returned to France.  
     
      
    7 In due course Davis was committed for trial. The trial of him and the respondent jointly was fixed to commence on 31 March 2008. As the time for trial approached, the Crown attempted to secure the attendance of Mr Scherer. I shall review later in this judgment what was done. When the trial was called on Mr Scherer was absent and no arrangement had been made for him to give evidence by videolink. Accordingly the Crown, which had served notices under s67 Evidence Act, proposed to proceed to trial partly by adducing evidence of what Mr Scherer had said not only to the police officer in the statement as assisted by Mr le Pivain but to others at relevant times. Objection was taken. Evidence was tendered on that question and submissions were made. The trial judge, Phegan DCJ, gave judgment rejecting the tender of evidence. The Crown now appeals. 
     
      
    8 In the court below the Crown relied on a number of provisions of the Evidence Act. The appeal was conducted on a rather narrower basis, and the only relevant sections of the Evidence Act are s65 and cognate parts of the Act. Section 65 is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        (1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. 
         
        (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was:  
         
          
          (a) made under a duty to make that representation or to make representations of that kind, or 
           
          (b) made when or shortly after the asserted fact occurred and in circumstances that make it unlikely that the representation is a fabrication, or 
           
          (c) made in circumstances that make it highly probable that the representation is reliable, or 
           
          (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made. 
          
         
        (3) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made in the course of giving evidence in an Australian or overseas proceeding if, in that proceeding, the defendant in the proceeding to which this section is being applied:  
         
          
          (a) cross-examined the person who made the representation about it, or 
           
          (b) had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine the person who made the representation about it. 
          
         
        (4) If there is more than one defendant in the criminal proceeding, evidence of a previous representation that:  
         
          
          (a) is given in an Australian or overseas proceeding, and 
           
          (b) is admitted into evidence in the criminal proceeding because of subsection (3), 
           
          cannot be used against a defendant who did not cross-examine, and did not have a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine, the person about the representation. 
          
         
        (5) For the purposes of subsections (3) and (4), a defendant is taken to have had a reasonable opportunity to cross-examine a person if the defendant was not present at a time when the cross-examination of a person might have been conducted but:  
         
          
          (a) could reasonably have been present at that time, and 
          
         
        (b) if present could have cross-examined the person. 
         
        (6) Evidence of the making of a representation to which subsection (3) applies may be adduced by producing a transcript, or a recording, of the representation that is authenticated by:  
         
          
          (a) the person to whom, or the court or other body to which, the representation was made, or 
           
          (b) if applicable, the registrar or other proper officer of the court or other body to which the representation was made, or 
           
          (c) the person or body responsible for producing the transcript or recording. 
          
         
        (7) Without limiting subsection (2) (d), a representation is taken for the purposes of that subsection to be against the interests of the person who made it if it tends:  
         
        (a) to damage the person’s reputation, or 
         
          
          (b) to show that the person has committed an offence for which the person has not been convicted, or 
           
          (c) to show that the person is liable in an action for damages. 
          
         
        (8) The hearsay rule does not apply to:  
         
          
          (a) evidence of a previous representation adduced by a defendant if the evidence is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or 
           
          (b) a document tendered as evidence by a defendant so far as it contains a previous representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation. 
          
         
        (9) If evidence of a previous representation about a matter has been adduced by a defendant and has been admitted, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of another representation about the matter that:  
         
        (a) is adduced by another party, and 
         
          
          (b) is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the other representation being made. 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 Section 67 is as follows -  
     
      
       
        
        (1) Sections 63 (2), 64 (2) and 65 (2), (3) and (8) do not apply to evidence adduced by a party unless that party has given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence. 
         
        (2) Notices given under subsection (1) are to be given in accordance with any regulations or rules of court made for the purposes of this section. 
         
        (3) The notice must state:  
         
          
          (a) the particular provisions of this Division on which the party intends to rely in arguing that the hearsay rule does not apply to the evidence, and 
           
          (b) if section 64 (2) is such a provision—the grounds, specified in that provision, on which the party intends to rely. 
          
         
        (4) Despite subsection (1), if notice has not been given, the court may, on the application of a party, direct that one or more of those subsections is to apply despite the party’s failure to give notice. 
         
        (5) The direction:  
         
          
          (a) is subject to such conditions (if any) as the court thinks fit, and 
           
          (b) in particular, may provide that, in relation to specified evidence, the subsection or subsections concerned apply with such modifications as the court specifies. 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 The dictionary of the Evidence Act contains this definition -  
     
      
       
        
         
        4 Unavailability of persons. 
         
        (1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if:  
         
        (a) the person is dead, or  
         
          
          (b) the person is, for any reason other than the application of section 16 (Competence and compellability: judges and jurors), not competent to give the evidence about the fact, or 
           
          (c) it would be unlawful for the person to give evidence about the fact, or 
           
          (d) a provision of this Act prohibits the evidence being given, or 
           
          (e) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or to secure his or her attendance, but without success, or 
           
          (f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the party seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success. 
          
         
        (2) In all other cases the person is taken to be available to give evidence about the fact. 
        
       
      
    11 The Crown submitted to the trial judge that Mr Scherer’s statement was admissible because he was unavailable and the statement fell within s65(2)(b) and (c). Objecting, counsel for the respondent submitted that the Crown had not shown that Mr Scherer was unavailable and that, because of the circumstances in which the statement had been brought into existence, it did not fall within s65(2)(b) or (c).  
     
      
    12 The evidence about the unavailability of Mr Scherer may be summarised as follows. As the Crown knew, Mr Scherer’s visa was due to expire not long after the day on which the trial was first due to commence. The Crown knew that if the trial were postponed and a fresh date fixed, Mr Scherer would have to return to Australia to give evidence. He departed from Australia on 10 September 2007, but before he did so, Senior Constable Ross had a number of conversations with him. He said that there were about six such conversations, including on 21 June, 9 and 18 August 2007. Senior Constable Ross informed Mr Scherer about the progress of the matter. Mr Scherer gave him to understand that he was willing to return to Australia for the trial. The evidence of these matters was contained in summary form in an affidavit by Senior Constable Ross sworn on 26 March 2008. The affidavit did not mention whether the two had spoken about whether or how Mr Scherer’s air fares, accommodation and sustenance would be provided for if he should return to Australia for the trial. When Mr Scherer left Australia, Senior Constable Ross knew his intended residential address in France, his email address and his mobile telephone number. He also knew how to get in touch with Mr le Pivain, who remained in Australia. The new trial date was allocated and Senior Constable Ross was informed about it in October or November 2007. He informed Mr Scherer by email of the trial date. That would have been by 19 December 2007 at the latest. On 31 January 2008 Senior Constable Ross wrote a letter to Mr Scherer. The contents of the letter were not put into evidence, but presumably called for a response. There was no response. On 3 March 2008 Senior Constable Ross called the number of Mr Scherer’s mobile telephone. He received a message to effect that it was no longer connected. On 19 March 2008 Senior Constable Ross telephoned Mr le Pivain, who told him that Mr Scherer had changed his residential address and telephone number. He also said that he had received an email from Mr Scherer informing him that he would not be returning to Australia because he had just started a new job in Nantes and that he, Mr Scherer, had tried unsuccessfully to email the New South Wales Police to give them this message.  
     
      
    13 The respondent and Davis were called for trial on 31 March 2008. Davis pleaded guilty and the respondent pleaded not guilty. This application began. The evidence and submissions ranged over three days. At the end of the first day his Honour suggested to the representative of the Crown that some attempt be made to get in touch with Mr Scherer overnight to ascertain whether he might be able to return to Australia at short notice.  
     
      
    14 On the afternoon of 31 March 2008 a solicitor in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions sent Mr Scherer a letter by email saying this - 
     
      
       
        
        I am writing to you about the robbery trial in Australia in which you and your friend, Mr le Pivain, are witnesses. I am the lawyer who has the case for the prosecution. 
         
         
        I understand that you cannot come to Australia at present because of your new job. Would you please think about the following and let me have your answers immediately as I must tell the court tomorrow morning: - 
         
         
          
          1. Are you able to come to Australia to give evidence at a time in the near future? When will that be? 
          
         
         
          
          2. If you cannot come to Australia would you be able to give evidence in France at a video link facility if we arrange this for you. It would mean that you would have to be at the facility on the day that it is arranged and because the time difference between France and Australia you would be giving evidence after midnight.  
          
         
        
       
      
    15 Mr Scherer responded with an email containing this paragraph -  
     
      
       
        
        I’m sorry to tell you that because of my professional situation, I’ll not be able to be present at the trial. Moreover, I will be travelling all over France for my job during this period. Thus it’s impossible for me to escape from my professional needs. 
        
       
      
    16 At the commencement of proceedings on 1 April 2008 the representative of the Crown informed his Honour about the emails sent and received. The evidence continued. Senior Constable Ross, who had begun to be cross-examined on 31 March, continued to be cross-examined. Mr le Pivain and a police officer were examined and cross-examined. At the conclusion of proceedings his Honour again drew attention to the unsatisfactory state of affairs. The application was adjourned to 2 April 2008. Overnight the Crown made a further attempt to obtain a satisfactory response from Mr Scherer. It sent by email a letter in French, the English translation of which is as follows - 
     
      
       
        
        Thank you for your email yesterday. I understand that you cannot come to Australia for the trial because of work commitments. 
        
       
       
        
        However, would those commitments permit you to attend a facility in Nantes (or, if not available, in Paris) to give your evidence by videolink. It would require you to be there in the early hours and the following dates and times are proposed: - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Thursday 3 April 2008 at 01:00 hrs (1am) or 05:00hrs (5am). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Monday 7 April 2008 at 02:00hrs (2am) or 06:00hrs (6am). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Would you please let us know urgently by return email if you are able to attend and the dates and times you are available. We will pay your travel expenses and reasonable accommodation costs if you are required to travel from your home city overnight. 
        
       
      
    17 At the commencement of proceedings on 2 April his Honour was informed that the email had been sent but that no response had been received. The representatives made their submissions. His Honour took time to consider the matter and gave judgment on 3 April 2008. 
     
      
    18 By s5F(3A) Criminal Appeal Act the Crown may bring an appeal of the present kind if the ruling appealed from eliminates or substantially weakens the Crown case. The only evidence identifying the respondent as the man who took Mr Scherer’s wristwatch is what I have described as the critical part of his statement, extracted earlier in this judgment. In my opinion his Honour’s ruling that that evidence was inadmissible substantially weakens the Crown case. It seems to me, therefore, that the Crown has standing to bring this appeal. 
     
      
    19 The principal attack in this Court was on his Honour’s statement of the test for admissibility of evidence under s65(2)(b) and (c). It is necessary first to say something more about the evidence and the submissions below. In giving judgment his Honour considered the case put forward by the defence which was said to throw doubt on the quality of Mr Scherer’s evidence. The police officer who interviewed Mr Scherer was Constable Steinmetz. She spoke English. The only other participants in the conversation as a result of which Mr Scherer made his statement were Mr Scherer himself and Mr le Pivain. They both spoke fluent French. Mr le Pivain was fluent in English, but although Mr Scherer could speak some English he was not fluent in the language. 
     
      
    20 Mr le Pivain gave evidence. He said that Mr Scherer spoke to him in French when he telephoned him and asked him to come to the police station to help. He said that the constable was asking questions in English. He was translating them into French for Mr Scherer to answer, to ensure that he understood what he was being asked. He said that he was translating all the time “in both way”. I take that to mean that Mr le Pivain was translating Constable Steinmetz’s questions into French and Mr Scherer’s answers into English. As he translated Mr Scherer’s answers Constable Steinmetz typed them into her computer and displayed the answers on the screen. Mr le Pivain and Mr Scherer read them. Mr Scherer was asking Mr le Pivain what a certain sentence or a certain word meant and Mr le Pivain was explaining in French. Mr le Pivain said - 
     
      
       
        
        So I explaining and translate bit by bit all the time, so then he can confirm it was correct. 
        
       
      
    21 He said that the whole statement was taken by that method. 
     
      
    22 Constable Steinmetz gave evidence. She described how the questions were asked and answered and the statement made. Her description did not differ significantly from Mr le Pivain’s.  
     
      
    23 The defence representative drew attention to the code of practice for crime current in the New South Wales Police Service at the time of these events. Certain selected pages of the printed practice were tendered and became exhibit 1. The exhibit contains a complete table of contents but only selected pages thereafter. According to the table of contents a section entitled “Questioning suspects” commences at page 48 and ends with a subsection commencing at page 68. Of those pages, only pages 50 to 53 inclusive were included in the tender. That is unfortunate, because according to the table of contents, the portion on page 48 immediately following the heading “Questioning suspects” is entitled “General”. It is followed on page 49 by a part called “Cautioning”. It seems possible that these parts may say more than the heading about identifying the persons to whom the code of practice is intended to apply. At first impression, none of the material seems to have any application, since Mr Scherer was not a suspect. Part of what follows may throw some doubt on that conclusion, however. Under the heading “Interpreters” on page 50 appears the following -  
     
      
       
        
        It is policy to provide people who have inadequate language skills or physical disabilities which impede communication with access to accredited interpreters.  
        
       
       
        
        Use an interpreter if the person (suspect or  
        witness 
        ) you are interviewing: 
        
       
      
    § is unable to communicate in English 
     
      
    § has a limited understanding of English 
     
      
    § is more comfortable communicating in their own language 
     
      
    § is deaf, hearing impaired or speaking impaired 
     
      
    § is a child and the appropriate adult or support person requires one wants one.  
     
      
       
        
        NB: Just because someone can speak English to do everyday tasks does not mean they can cope with the added stress of a police interview. If in doubt, get an interpreter. 
        
       
       
        
        For someone in custody, defer any investigation until an interpreter arrives. If it is not reasonable practical to obtain an interpreter, or the urgency of the investigation (having regard to the safety of others) makes it unreasonable t defer if the custody manager will arrange for a telephone interpreter (see Telephone Interpreters below) and defer any investigation until it is arranged. If this, however, is not reasonably practical, or the urgency of the investigation (having regard to the safety of others) makes it unreasonable to defer if the investigation does not have to be deferred. 
        
       
       
        
        Use properly accredited professionals. Do not use someone known to the suspect or a member of the suspect’s family to interpret during an interview. 
        
       
       
        
        If you require an on site (fact to face) interpreter contact the Community Relations Commission (CRC) on phone: 1300 651 500 (24 hours a day). 
        
       
       
        
        Advise if the case is of a sensitive nature (eg. sexual assault or incest), to ensure an interpreter of appropriate sex, culture or religious background is provided. 
        
       
       
        
        If someone is hearing or speech impaired do not interview them without an interpreter unless they agree in writing. Conduct the interview by showing them written or typed questions and allowing then to write or type their answers. 
        
       
       
        
        Many countries have more than one official language, eg: in Czechoslovakia, both Czech and Slovak are spoken. Accordingly, when requesting an interpreter, ask for one who can speak the dialect of the person needing  
        one. (emphasis is added) 
        
       
      
    24 Constable Steinmetz said that she had taken statements from victims of crime before. She was not aware of any police guidelines about taking statements from witnesses or victims whose first language was not English. 
     
      
    25 As his Honour observed, the reasons put forward on behalf of the defence why the statement did not fall within s65(2)(b) or (c) were “largely concerned with the mechanism chosen by the police officer, Constable Steinmetz, to take the statement”. His Honour said this about Constable Steinmetz - 
     
      
       
        
        …she had no knowledge of the police Code of Practice in which there are specific provisions addressing the use of interpreters in circumstances where a person being interviewed has a limited understanding of English. Even at the time she gave evidence in these proceedings, Constable Steinmetz had still not heard of those provisions. It goes without saying that she did not make any attempt to comply with the procedures laid down in the Code and employ the assistance of a properly qualified interpreter. 
        
       
      
    26 In view of the scope of the Code as described in the heading to which I have referred, there must be considerable doubt whether there was any relevant Code governing the questioning of witnesses who were not suspects.  
     
      
    27 His Honour went on to consider the quality of the services provided by Mr le Pivain, and referred to Crown submissions to the effect that he had understood English, that he had understood his role and that he had materially assisted in the process in obtaining the statement. 
     
      
    28 His Honour continued -  
     
      
       
        
        However, even if the value of his role is acknowledged and there is no doubt that without his assistance it would have been extremely difficult, if not impossible to take statement, this is not simply a question of whether it is more likely than not that the statement was reliable. The representation has to have been made in circumstances where fabrication was unlikely or that make it highly probable that the representation was reliable. 
        
       
      
    29 Unfortunately, his Honour never came to any conclusion about the quality of Mr le Pivain’s translation or how, if his Honour did, he took into account what he took to be the failure of Constable Steinmetz to follow an applicable code of practice. 
     
      
    30 His Honour went on to consider whether the “circumstances” in which a statement was made might for the purposes of subs (2)(b) and (c) include related circumstances such as Mr Scherer’s identification to Constable Jarvis of the respondent as the one who taken his watch. His Honour conducted an exhaustive review of cases in which the section has been considered, namely R v Mankotia [1998] NSWSC 295, R v Polkinghorne [1999] 108 A Crim R 189, Conway v R (2000) 98 FCR 204, Williams v R (2000) 119 A Crim R 490, R v Kazzi (2003) 140 A Crim R 545 and R v Ambrosoli [2002] NSWCCA 386. 
     
      
    31 His Honour concluded - 
     
      
       
        
        I am satisfied that the wording of s65 imposes a heavy onus on the Crown in this case to satisfy the Court that there was no risk of either fabrication or unreliability and that, procedures were available to members of the Police Service, which could have been resorted to in this case without any serious jeopardy to the conduct of the police investigation. There was no evidence forthcoming from the Crown to suggest otherwise. There was a risk in the procedures adopted by Constable Steinmetz that crucial parts of the evidence of Mr Scherer would be lost in translation and therefore the requirements of the relevant subsections in s65 in those circumstances were not met. The Crown is not entitled to the benefit of subs (2) of s65. 
        
       
      
    32 The last passage has been extracted verbatim. The reference to available procedures is obviously erroneous and may be a mistranscription. Perhaps his Honour intended to say that the Crown had to prove that the procedures to which he referred were unavailable. 
     
      
    33 There are several deficiencies in his Honour’s judgment. First, it was never made clear how his Honour’s decision to reject the tender of the evidence was informed by any conclusion his Honour drew about the asserted failure of Constable Steinmetz to follow the supposedly applicable code of practice. There is no obvious connection between the merits of a method not chosen and the statement that actually resulted. His Honour’s real concern should have been with the efficacy of the method undertaken, not with a method that was not. 
     
      
    34 Secondly, his Honour expressed no clear view, and perhaps no view at all, about the efficacy of Mr le Pivain’s services as a translator. 
     
      
    35 Finally, his Honour misstated the test he had to apply. Section 65 does not oblige the Crown to satisfy a court that there is “no risk of either fabrication or unreliability” in the production of a statement. None of the cases referred to by his Honour puts the test so high. The words of subs (2)(b) and (c) are plain: for para (b) it must be made to appear unlikely that the representation is a fabrication; for para (c) it must be made to appear highly probable that the representation is reliable. The risk of which his Honour spoke that “crucial parts of the evidence of Mr Scherer would be lost in translation” may have existed. Whether, on the other hand, such a risk materialised does not appear from his Honour’s findings, and it is far from clear whether any such finding would have been available on the evidence.  
     
      
    36 Moreover, his Honour did not explain how any deficiency in Mr le Pivain’s translation could bear on the question of fabrication. Although the link between an inaccurate translation and the reliability of the resulting statement is readily understood, it is not clear how such an inaccuracy could make it appear more likely that any part of the statement had been fabricated. The thrust of the critical passage was the identification of the respondent as the man who stole the watch. Mr Scherer had no apparent interest in falsely identifying the respondent. Moreover, the respondent was by common consent, present at the time of the robbery. It was put for the respondent on appeal that fabrication would include more than a deliberate falsehood, for example a mistaken conclusion or a wrong assumption, created or exacerbated, perhaps, by errors of translation. I do not accept that, if such an argument is ever available, it is available here. The passage as I have said, was about the identification of one of only two people. That was done by a description of head and face. If the evidence of Constable Jarvis was relevant, it was also achieved by an identification of trousers. The appearance of the respondent was distinctly different from that of Davis. 
     
      
    37 Because of the view I have formed about these matters it is unnecessary to deal with questions about the unavailability of Mr Scherer. In any event there will be further evidence bearing on that question, and no doubt further submissions, when the trial is called on in the District Court. Neither is it necessary to deal with other submissions made in this Court by counsel for the respondent about the adequacy of hearsay notices and other matters.  
     
      
    38 There is, however, one submission that I must consider, namely that Mr Scherer’s statement was not first hand hearsay, as contemplated by s65, but hearsay on hearsay and as such incapable of being saved. I have summarised above Mr le Pivain’s description of the method employed to give Mr Scherer an understanding of Constable Steinmetz’s questions and Constable Steinmetz an understanding of Mr Scherer’s answers. The process may not have been exactly the same as in a smooth translation in court from one language to another and back again, but it was, I think, of that kind. See Gaio v R (1960) 104 CLR419. Moreover, when the statement was printed and read to him, Mr Scherer signed it. He thereby made the document his own. In my opinion the submission should be rejected. 
     
      
    39 I would set aside his Honour’s order rejecting the tender of Mr Scherer’s statement. 
     
      
    40 PRICE J: I agree with Barr J.

     JUDGMENT 
      
      
     application for leave to appeal against sentence 
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the reasons for judgment of Simpson J in this matter. Regrettably I do not share her Honour’s opinion as to the appropriate resolution of the appeal. In my opinion, although leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    2 Simpson J has outlined the findings of fact made by the sentencing judge. Critical to those findings is that the offence involved a degree of discussion and planning, in particular the selection of the target store and the obtaining of weapons. Five offenders were involved. The applicant took a primary role by entering the store to identify whether it was safe to enter and whether the premises were protected by closed circuit television. She was followed by two other co-offenders, one who was armed with a knife, the other with a shortened firearm. The gun was pointed at the store owner’s stomach as money was demanded. The planning of the offence extended to the organisation of false number plates for the getaway vehicle. 
     
      
    3 There is no doubt that the applicant has a strong subjective case. She was aged 17 at the time of the offences and was in a relationship with Pilon, one of the co-offenders. That relationship was, as Simpson J points out, marked by violence. It may be readily concluded that he was the dominant partner. 
     
      
    4 The applicant advanced three prospective grounds of appeal. Simpson J rejects the first ground, a conclusion with which I agree for the reasons her Honour gives. 
     
      
    5 The second ground relates to questions of parity. Each of the co-offenders was sentenced after pleading guilty to offences of demanding property in company with menaces. The sentences imposed were significantly less than the sentence received by the applicant. The disparity is explained by the fact that the co-offenders pleaded guilty to an offence which carried a maximum penalty of 14 years. The charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty and was sentenced carries a maximum penalty of 25 years. It is of significance that by reason of her plea of not guilty the applicant was not dealt with in the Children’s Court, as were two of her juvenile co-offenders. Furthermore, she was not entitled to the benefit Pilon received by reason of his assistance to authorities. In my opinion the sentencing judge was correct in concluding that the principles of parity were not relevant in the present case: see Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295. 
     
      
    6 With respect to ground 3 in my opinion this was a serious offence. It is true that the evidence disclosed that the applicant has good prospects of rehabilitation, has established a new relationship and has given birth to a second child. However, as Simpson J relates, the sentencing judge was aware of the applicant’s strong subjective case. In my opinion his Honour had appropriate regard to subjective matters but was correct in concluding that a strong subjective case cannot displace the need to impose a sentence which both appropriately punishes the offender and adequately provides for personal but, more particularly, general deterrence. In my judgment these considerations lead inevitably to the conclusion that the sentence imposed was not excessive. 
     
      
    7 In my opinion although leave to appeal should be granted the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    8 SIMPSON J: On 7 March 2007 the applicant was arraigned in the District Court in Dubbo on an indictment containing two counts: one of attempted robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, and one of unauthorised possession of a shortened firearm. She entered a plea of not guilty to each charge, a jury was empanelled, and a trial commenced. On 15 March 2007, after the close of the Crown case, and after the trial judge (Marien DCJ) declined to permit a defence of duress to be left to the jury, the applicant changed her plea to one of guilty to each charge. This was done on what was called a conditional basis in the light of the decision concerning the defence of duress. The applicant was duly and formally convicted. The judge issued a certificate pursuant to s 5(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 certifying that the case was a fit one for appeal, but, in the circumstances, this is of no further relevance.  
     
      
    9 On 17 August 2007 Marien DCJ sentenced the applicant, on the attempted robbery charge, to a term of imprisonment for 3 years, made up of a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 17 August 2007, and expiring on 16 February 2009, with a balance of term of 18 months, expiring on 16 August 2010. On the firearms charge he sentenced the applicant to a fully concurrent fixed term of imprisonment for 6 months. Because the applicant was under the age of 18 at the time of the offences he directed, pursuant to s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, that the non-parole period be served in a Juvenile Detention Centre. By s 50(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (“the Sentencing Procedure Act “) the applicant was entitled to release at the expiration of the non-parole period, and his Honour directed accordingly. 
     
      
    10 The applicant filed a notice of intention to appeal against the convictions, and an application for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed. Each was listed for hearing in this Court on 28 July 2008. 
     
      
    11 After some argument, the appellant abandoned the appeal against the convictions. She maintains her application for leave to appeal against the sentences. This judgment, therefore, is concerned only with the sentences – in truth, only with the sentence imposed in respect of the major count. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    12 On the applicant’s plea of guilty an agreed statement of facts was produced. However, for the purposes of these reasons, it has been necessary also to have regard to evidence given in the trial. In relation to some of this evidence, certain findings of fact were made by the sentencing judge; in respect of some factual issues, he considered the evidence to be too uncertain to permit satisfactory findings of fact to be made. What follows as an outline of the relevant facts is largely drawn from the findings made by his Honour.  
     
      
    13 The offences were committed in the late afternoon of 29 November 2005 at a general store in Coonabarabran, a small town in the central west of NSW. They followed a degree of discussion and planning, for example, in the selection of the target store, and in the obtaining of the weapons. The store is operated by Mr and Mrs Lee, who were present behind the counter, with their 11 year old daughter. Also present was their 14 year old son. 
     
      
    14 Five offenders were involved. A co-offender to whom I will refer as BT drove a motor vehicle which belonged to another co-offender, Deek Pilon, from Dubbo to Coonabarabran. Also present were co-offenders to whom it is best to refer as SS, JT, and Deek Pilon, as well as the applicant. The offences were prosecuted on the basis that the applicant was part of a joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    15 The applicant entered the store. She had with her a mobile telephone, which she intended to use to let the co-offenders know if it was safe to enter, and also whether the premises were protected by closed circuit television. Pilon and SS then entered the store. SS was armed with a knife. Pilon was armed with the shortened firearm, the subject of the second count. He pointed it at Mr Lee’s stomach, and demanded that Mr Lee give him money. Mr Lee asked him to repeat what he had said. Both men then left the store and departed from the area in the motor vehicle. It seems that BT and JT had remained with the vehicle. The motor vehicle had previously been fitted with false number plates, previously stolen by Pilon. All four male co-offenders were in the vehicle at this time; the applicant was not. BT stopped the vehicle in bushland where the offenders discarded the false number plates and replaced them with the vehicle’s correct, ACT registered, plates. They changed their clothing, some of which they also discarded. They returned to Coonabarabran and picked up the applicant and travelled to Gilgandra, a short distance away, where they refuelled but failed to pay for the fuel. During part of this journey the applicant was the driver of the vehicle. 
     
      
    16 The vehicle was subsequently stopped by police, but the occupants were not then arrested or charged. That occurred late in the afternoon of the following day.  
     
      
       
      The trial 
       
      
    17 Initially the applicant’s trial was fixed as a joint trial with similar charges against Pilon. (BT and SS were juveniles, and pleaded guilty and were dealt with in the Children’s Court.) His Honour recorded that JT was not charged. On the morning the trial was due to commence, Pilon negotiated a plea to a lesser charge (demand money with menaces whilst in company) to which he entered a plea of guilty. He also agreed to give evidence in the trial of the applicant. He did so, as did BT and JT. The cross-examination of these witnesses reveals that the applicant did not in any significant way dispute the above synopsis of the events; the only defence she sought to put forward was one of duress. Cross-examination of Pilon in particular suggested that he had a history of violent, overbearing, and intimidating behaviour towards the applicant, with whom he was in a sexual relationship current at the time of the offences. He denied all such suggestions. It was when the trial judge declined to allow the defence of duress to go to the jury that the applicant changed her plea. Although duress has finally been abandoned as a defence to the charges, the applicant nevertheless persists in relying on the facts and circumstances she then put forward in support of that defence in mitigation of her criminality. 
     
      
    18 The applicant gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings. She was just 17 years of age at the time of the offences. She had been in a relationship with Pilon for some time, a relationship that, on her evidence, was marked by violence directed by him against her. She said that she had been under some pressure from Pilon. She said that they had both illegally used a prescription drug, OxyContin. Perhaps the most serious instance of this was an occasion when, she said, she was pregnant, and Pilon jumped over her stomach causing her to miscarry. She gave some specific instances of the violence she attributed to Pilon. 
     
      
    19 She gave an account of the offences which varied in some respects from that given by one or more of the co-offenders. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    20 The applicant was born on 1 September 1988. She was just 17 years and 2 months at the time of the offences, almost 19 at sentencing. She had no prior criminal history. Although she gave evidence in the sentencing proceedings, it was limited to an account of her relationship with Pilon, and directed to explaining the circumstances in which she came to be involved in the offences. This account, as will become apparent, was largely rejected by Marien DCJ. 
     
      
    21 Also before the Court was an extremely favourable report from officers of the Department of Juvenile Justice. This repeated her explanation for her involvement, but also recounted expressions of “extreme guilt, embarrassment and remorse” on the part of the applicant, something which appears to have been endorsed by the applicant’s mother. 
     
      
    22 The report was prepared in July 2007. By that time the applicant had ceased her relationship with Pilon and had established a relationship with another man with whom she lived, with her parents, in Dubbo. She also had a daughter, then 8 months of age, and was pregnant. 
     
      
    23 She appears to have had a relatively successful educational history and had been offered a nursing scholarship upon completion of her school certificate. She wished to take up this opportunity after the birth of the child with whom she was then pregnant. 
     
      
    24 She has some health problems which do not appear to be major, although not insignificant. The (joint) authors of the report accepted that it was the applicant’s involvement with “a negative peer group” that drew her into her single episode of criminality. They considered it unlikely that she would commit further offences. They wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [she] has removed herself from this particular peer group and concentrated on raising her daughter in a stable environment. It is her goal to be a positive role model for her children. Indeed, she presents as a confident young mother and has shown responsibility in addressing her drug problems and has had the encouragement and support of her family throughout this time. She looks forward to one day completing the necessary training which will enable her to fulfil her aspirations of becoming a nurse … it is to be noted that the offence occurred some 19 months ago and since this time [the applicant] has removed herself from negative peers, addressed her drug issues and has not come to the attention of police as a result of further offending behaviour. [The applicant] has made significant positive changes to her life since these offences were committed … it is this Officer’s assessment that [the applicant] has demonstrated and possesses the necessary skills and maturity to remain offence free and contribute as a worthwhile member of the community.” 
        
       
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    25 The Remarks on Sentence were comprehensive and careful. Marien DCJ recorded the facts that had been put before him. He took a deeply unfavourable view of the applicant. He made quite extensive reference to the evidence given by the applicant, finding it to have been: 
     
      
       
        
        “… unsatisfactory to say the least. It was at times contradictory, inconsistent and patently implausible.” 
        
       
       
      He gave detailed reasons for this conclusion, on a number of occasions contrasting evidence given by the applicant with evidence given by the co-offenders in the trial. Although he did not say so explicitly, it may be inferred that, where there was conflict in the evidence, he preferred that of the co-offenders to that of the applicant. 
       
      
    26 His Honour then noted the applicant’s age, and extracted a portion of the Juvenile Justice Report which included her version of the events, and some of the matters I have mentioned above. He accepted that what was there recorded demonstrated “real insight” into the gravity of the offence. His Honour then noted the principles relating to the sentencing of juvenile offenders, but a little while later said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view this was an adult crime committed by the offender at a time when she was proximate to the age of her majority of 18. Whilst the principles applicable to sentencing a young offender are relevant here and I do take them into account and will apply them, they will not be given as much weight as would be given in a case where the relevant offence was committed as a result of immaturity, or as a result of a spontaneous act with little planning.” 
        
       
      
    27 He noted the applicant’s prior good character and that the offence was “entirely uncharacteristic behaviour” on her part; he accepted that “to a certain extent” she was led into the criminal enterprise by Pilon. Nevertheless, he repeated that she fully and freely participated in the enterprise. 
     
      
    28 Correctly, in the circumstances, he gave limited value to the pleas of guilty, saying that the allowance made in that respect would be “at the lower end of the range” identified in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    29 He accepted that she was remorseful and contrite and has gained considerable insight into her behaviour. 
     
      
    30 His Honour then turned to the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders but concluded that considerations of parity were not applicable by reason of their pleas of guilty, and, were pleas to lesser charges. He rejected a submission that the sentence ought to be suspended. He proceeded to impose the sentences I have outlined above. 
     
      
       
      The grounds of the application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    31 It is convenient at this point to set out the grounds of appeal the applicant advances. They are three in number, and formulated as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour erred in failing to find that the applicant was acting under duress. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 2 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the principle of parity. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3 
        
       
       
        
        The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
       
      Ground 1: duress 
       
      
    32 There is one short sharp answer to this ground. Marien DCJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am clearly satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on all the evidence before me that the offender freely and voluntarily participated in the serious attempted armed robbery on 29 November 2005. Although given the opportunity to do so she did not state in her evidence that Pilon ever threatened her to participate in the robbery. In effect, she said that because of a prior history of violence, which she described, between herself and Pilon, she believed that if she did not participate in the robbery some harm would come to her from Pilon.” 
        
       
      
    33 This finding is death to the first ground of the application, and extremely so in view of the judge’s assessment of the evidence given by the applicant. It is amply supported by the sentencing judge’s careful account of the reasons for coming to that view. He described her evidence as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… unsatisfactory to say the least … contradictory, inconsistent and patently implausible.” 
        
       
      
    34 This was followed by specific and detailed examples of evidence given by the applicant that his Honour did not accept, which, in some instances, he contrasted with evidence given by the other witnesses. 
     
      
    35 There is, though, in this, one matter of some concern. It is apparent, both from the Remarks on Sentence and his questioning of the applicant during her evidence, that the judge disbelieved her, and that this was, in part, because of what he perceived as contradictory conduct in the applicant’s continuing relationship with Pilon in the face of what she asserted to be his abusive treatment of her.36 The complexities of abusive relationships are well known, if not so well understood. It is not at all uncommon for the weaker, more vulnerable party (usually, but not always, the female) to suffer violence and abuse, but feel unable or unwilling to terminate the relationship, usually through a warped belief that she (or he) loves the perpetrator, notwithstanding the unloving treatment. 37 The sentencing judge set considerable store on evidence given by the applicant that, on the day of the offences, Pilon had been “all right” – ie not violent – and therefore concluded that she was not under duress.38 It seems to me that this represents rather too literal an approach. While that evidence certainly would undermine a defence of duress to the charges, it is nevertheless of some relevance in relation to the proper assessment of the applicant’s criminality. A person’s resolve may be weakened by persistent violence or ill treatment, such as to impact upon the assessment of culpability. His Honour may not have appreciated this subtlety. It is to be remembered that the final ground asserts error in failing to find that the applicant was, in the commission of the offence, acting under duress – not that her culpability was mitigated by her being overborne or rendered vulnerable by a historical course of conduct.39 In this respect, the judge made express, clear and definite findings of fact, based upon a measured assessment of the evidence of all witnesses. 
     
      
    40 There is no basis for this Court to disturb these findings of fact, nor the assessment of the applicant’s credibility made by his Honour. That means, inevitably, that the first ground of the application must fail.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: parity 
       
      
    41 Some information concerning the manner in which the co-offenders were treated was before this Court. SS pleaded guilty in the Children’s Court in Dubbo to a charge of demanding property with menaces whilst in company. By s 99 of the Crimes Act such an offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. He also pleaded guilty to a charge of unauthorised possession of a shortened firearm, which carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    42 In the Children’s Court a total sentence of 14 months with a non-parole period of 3 months was imposed. Operation of the sentence was suspended.  
     
      
    43 SS appealed against the severity of the sentence to the District Court then was re-sentenced by Woods ADCJ to a total term of 10 months with a non-parole period of 3 months, again suspended. 
     
      
    44 SS was 17 years of age at the time of the offences and had no criminal record. Woods ADCJ accepted that he had become involved in the offences “through peer pressure”. 
     
      
    45 BT was also dealt with in the Children’s Court, on 25 September 2006. He also pleaded guilty to demanding property in company with menaces and was sentenced to 12 months with a non-parole period of 3 months, which was also suspended. BT had provided significant assistance at an early stage, having assisted police in locating clothing and the firearm that had been discarded by the offenders. However, he had a substantial criminal record, with offences both before and after the commission of the present offence. He was 16 years of age at the time of the offences. 
     
      
    46 As mentioned above, Pilon pleaded guilty to one count of demanding property with menaces in company and also one count of unauthorised possession of a shortened firearm. He also was sentenced by Woods ADCJ, to a head sentence of imprisonment for 16 months with a non-parole period of 8 months. His plea of guilty was entered on the day fixed for trial. It was, accordingly, afforded limited weight. However, he had given significant assistance to authorities, not least of which was the evidence he gave against the applicant. Pilon was 19 years of age at the time of the offences, the only adult of the group. He had some, although apparently, limited, criminal history. He had spent a total of 254 days in custody referable to the present offences. That equates to approximately 8 ½ months. It is plain from the judgment that Woods ADCJ began with a head sentence of 2 years, which he then reduced, by reason, predominantly, of assistance to authorities, to the 16 months that he ultimately imposed. He found, pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that special circumstances existed justifying the division of the sentence into roughly equal terms. 
     
      
    47 Parity arguments largely depend upon equivalence or substantial equivalence in the relevant objective and subjective circumstances. The difficulty confronting the applicant here is that, by reason of her plea of not guilty she was not dealt with in the Children’s Court, as she might have been had she taken the course adopted by her two juvenile co-offenders. She was not entitled to the benefit Pilon received by reason of his assistance to authorities. And each of the co-offenders had negotiated pleas to a lesser charge – in each case a charge that carried a maximum penalty of 14 years. The charge to which the applicant pleaded guilty carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. For these reasons, Marien DCJ held that the principles of parity, as explained in Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; 154 CLR 606 and Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; 189 CLR 295 did not apply. 
     
      
    48 There is, nevertheless, a marked disparity between the sentence imposed upon her – a non-parole period of 18 months – and the approximately 8 ½ months that Pilon served, and this, in my opinion, may be taken into account in the consideration of the last ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 3: manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    49 I have above mentioned the report prepared by the Department of Juvenile Justice which was very positive. The applicant was reported to have ceased her use of drugs and alcohol. She was considered unlikely to commit further offences, having removed herself from the peer group with which she had been involved and with whom she became involved in the offences. She had, at the time of the report, given birth to one child and was pregnant with a second. She had established a relationship with another man, the father of the second child. She had been offered a nursing scholarship, which she proposed to take up.  
     
      
    50 The sentencing judge was well aware of all this material, and referred to it extensively. His Honour stated all sentencing principles accurately and comprehensively. 
     
      
    51 Nevertheless, I have come to the conclusion that, in all of the circumstances, and in particular in the light of the highly positive report, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive, and this Court ought to intervene. In particular I view with concern the observation that the applicant’s offences were committed at a time when she was “proximate to the age of majority at 18”. As I have noted above, the applicant was 17 years and 2 months at the time; and she had never previously committed any offence. This was an entirely uncharacteristic course of conduct, committed in the midst of a relationship that drew the applicant into what the Juvenile Justice officers called “a negative peer group”. The evidence of rehabilitation was powerful. It is not going too far to say that, on the evidence, rehabilitation was complete. I cannot escape the conclusion that the sentencing judge overlooked, or gave inadequate weight to, these circumstances.  
     
      
    52 Against the possibility of re-sentencing the Court received an affidavit sworn by the applicant on 22 July 2008. By the time she swore the affidavit her second child, a boy, had been born and was aged 6 months. Her first child, a daughter, was aged 20 months. The daughter remained in her custody until her incarceration and thereafter was cared for by the applicant’s mother, who lived in Dubbo. The applicant is an inmate in a facility at Emu Plains, some distance away. She has had little contact with her daughter, to the extent that, when she did visit, the daughter no longer recognised her. Her son has remained in her care whilst in custody but has, accordingly, been unable to form any bonds with his sister. 
     
      
    53 I have come to the view that the very favourable evidence of rehabilitation requires that this Court make an order that will see the applicant’s immediate release. I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) leave to appeal granted, appeal allowed; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) in respect of the charge of attempted robbery, the sentence imposed at first instance be set aside, and the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 3 months, made up of a non-parole period of 11 months, commencing on 17 August 2007 and expiring on 16 July 2008, with a balance of term of 16 months, expiring on 16 November 2009; 
        
       
       
       (iii) the applicant be released forthwith.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: In October 2005 Ms Georgia Chant was living with the offender. She was fifteen years of age and in year 10 at Barrenjoey High School. He was twenty-five and a drug user. On 9 October he should have been in prison serving a sentence of periodic detention. Instead he was at his home with Ms Chant. He used some heroin and took some Murelax tablets in her presence. She then made the fateful decision to ask the offender to give her some of the drugs so she could try them. The offender gave Ms Chant what she requested and she took both drugs. 2 As a result of those actions, the accused was charged with, and later pleaded guilty to, an offence of supplying a prohibited drug to a child under the age of sixteen. That is an offence under the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act carrying with it a maximum period of imprisonment of eighteen years. The Magistrate imposed a sentence of imprisonment of twenty months with a non-parole period of fifteen months. Both the Crown and the offender appealed against that sentence to this court. 3 It is best to deal early in these remarks with a very important issue which fundamentally affects the outcome of these appeals. It concerns the well-known rule to be found in De Simoni v The Queen (1981) 147 CLR 383 that an offender should not be punished for a more serious offence than that of which he has been convicted. The statement of facts tendered at the Local Court and also tendered before me reveals that, tragically, Ms Chant died as a result of taking the drugs given to her by the offender. It is appropriate that I express my sympathy to Ms Chant’s family and her friends. 4 The issue as to whether I could take the death of Ms Chant into account in deciding the appropriate sentence is one which attracted some submissions from the Crown and Mr Barber who appeared for the offender, before the Crown reluctantly conceded that Ms Chant’s death was a matter which I should disregard when dealing with a charge of supplying a prohibited drug to a person under the age of sixteen. The reason that this is the appropriate way of proceeding is clear. If I were to take Ms Chant’s death into account, I would be effectively be sentencing the offender for manslaughter, an offence which carries a maximum penalty of twenty-five years imprisonment, as opposed to eighteen years for the present offence. The offender was not charged with manslaughter. In the course of her submissions the solicitor for the Director of Public Prosecutions correctly conceded, as a matter of law, that Ms Chant’s tragic death was irrelevant to the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case.5 In the Local Court Mr Barber appeared for the offender and the prosecution was conducted by the police. Mr Barber told me that, after having some discussions with the police prosecutor, he drafted a statement of facts which, later, with the agreement of the police, was to form the basis of the material on which the Magistrate would sentence the offender. So we have the remarkable situation where Mr Barber drafted a statement of facts containing information which he later says is irrelevant. In the Local Court the prosecution actually tendered that statement of facts, but when the matter came to this court and the prosecution was taken over by the Director of Public Prosecutions it was conceded, correctly of course, that I can have no regard to Ms Chant’s death. 6 Those people who have observed this prosecution from its inception would be justifiably concerned at the way that the matter has proceeded, and in particular Ms Chant’s family and friends might have a justifiable sense of grievance when they reflect on the way in which her death has been treated. However the legal conclusion is clear. I will sentence the offender on the basis that Ms Chant’s death is not a factor which can influence me in deciding the outcome of either of these appeals. 7 The offender is now twenty-eight years old. He was, until I revoked his bail, living with his mother on Scotland Island. His parents separated when he was very young, with his mother having two significant relationships after that. Drug use has been a factor in the termination of both of those relationships, drug use by the offender’s stepfather on one occasion, and the offender’s own drug use on another. The offender is a gifted dancer who was recruited by the Australian Ballet Company while still at school, and then offered a scholarship to study overseas. However he could not take up that offer because he suffered injuries when he was hit by a car, which affected his ability to dance at a professional level for some time. He managed to find prominent work in television and film before commencing work at a local fish market where he met Ms Chant.8 The offender has been using drugs for many years. He has attempted to overcome his addiction on a number of occasions. He is currently on a biodone program, but, even so, has continued to use heroin on irregular occasions since the events of 9 October 2005. He is currently an apprentice stone mason and a reference from his employer was tendered attesting to his commitment and capabilities. 9 It is suggested in some of the material presented to me that what prompted the offender to commence using drugs was that the offender had been sexually assaulted whilst on a dancing trip to the United States of America, while the offender was still in high school.10 Dr Jacmon suggests that the offender found that the heroin gave him some relief from the stress of having been sexually assaulted and also from the physical pain he was enduring after the car accident. The offender’s decision to commence using heroin was perhaps one which he was less able to think about than if he had not been sexually assaulted or injured. That matter might have significant impact on a sentence regarding the offender’s use of drugs but it has little relevance, if any, to the offender’s decision to supply drugs to a fifteen year old girl with whom he was living. Indeed, more than most, he knew full well the problems which heroin use causes and the dangers which it presents, dangers of addiction and even death. Yet he was prepared to supply drugs to Ms Chant even with that knowledge. That was a serious criminal decision which must be punished in a significant way. 11 It is important to remember and indeed emphasise the difference between a jurisdictional limit and a maximum penalty. The proper approach of the Local Court when sentencing for matters to which a jurisdictional limit applies, and of course the proper approach of the District Court when dealing with an appeal from the Local Court is this; the court should look at the maximum penalty, ignoring the jurisdictional limit, and decide the appropriate penalty. Having made that decision the court then looks at the jurisdictional limit to see whether the penalty which has been provisionally determined can be imposed. If the provisional penalty exceeds the jurisdictional limit, then the sentence which the court imposes must be the jurisdictional limit. If the provisional penalty is lower than the jurisdictional limit then the provisional penalty is the sentence which the court imposes. 12 These matters should not be controversial, but it may well be that they are sometimes overlooked. Thus, in deciding the appropriate penalty and thus deciding the outcome of these appeals, I must take into account that the maximum penalty of eighteen years imprisonment is reserved for the worst case of offence of supply to a person under the age of sixteen and remember that this maximum penalty invites a comparison between the worst possible case and the case before me, in that regard the maximum penalty providing me with a yardstick. 13 In this case the maximum penalty is significant indeed, demonstrating quite clearly the concern which the legislature has about offences of supplying to a person under the age of sixteen and suggesting the need for those sentencing for that offence to impose appropriately severe, and even perhaps harsh sentences.14 Another matter of concern in the conduct of this case needs to be raised at this stage. In submissions at the Local Court and repeated in this court, Mr Barber suggested that his client was entitled to an “Ellis” discount. When asked about the differences between this case and the case of R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, Mr Barber relied on what he said was the circumstance that, without his client’s admissions to police, he would never have been convicted of this offence. In response the Crown sought to tender statements in addition to those already tendered. I do not know their contents because, on learning that the Crown wished to tender those documents, Mr Barber withdrew completely any suggestion that, without the offender’s admissions to police, he would not have been convicted. I can only surmise that, when making his original submission, both to the Local Court and to this court, he was unaware of the additional statements, because if that were not the case it might be thought that Mr Barber was attempting to mislead both the Local Court, and me as well. That would of course would have been seriously improper. 15 Mr Barber made much of the circumstance that his client was being dealt with for an isolated act of supply. The Court of Criminal Appeal has held that, for those convicted of supplying a prohibited drug where the offender is trafficking to a substantial degree, a sentence of full-time custody is required unless there are exceptional circumstances. He submits that his client was not trafficking to a substantial degree and so a full-time custodial sentence is not required. However those Court of Criminal Appeal decisions do not concern the offence of supplying to a person under the age of sixteen, a comparatively recent offence introduced into the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. There is no Court of Criminal Appeal decision regarding the circumstances in which a sentence of full-time custody can be expected for an offence of that type. I am satisfied that it would be a rare case indeed where an adult convicted of supplying heroin to a person under the age of sixteen was able to receive a sentence of anything other than full-time custody. In any case, the Crown submitted to me that the reason the offence was isolated is that Ms Chant died on the first occasion on which the offender supplied her with heroin. The Crown said that it would be naïve to find that, had Ms Chant survived, the offender would have declined to supply her with heroin when she next asked for it. I accept that submission. 16 The offender has a significant criminal history characterised by his failure to take advantage of leniency repeatedly offered to him. I have already referred to the circumstance that the offender should have been in custody, serving a sentence of periodic detention, on the evening that he committed this offence. He was also, at the same time, subject to a suspended sentence, and bonds under s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 17 It is fortunately rare to find an offender breaching so many different forms of conditional liberty by the commission of a single offence. These are very serious matters of aggravation indeed. Nor has the offender ceased committing offences. He has told others that he has continued to use drugs on occasions and was dealt with for an offence of shoplifting in September 2007. These offences are particularly important when deciding the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation.18 Mr Barber suggested that his client was remorseful but there was no evidence from the offender himself in that regard. The pre-sentence report notes that the offender expressed his extreme regret and that he feels responsible for Ms Chant’s death. Dr Jacmon’s report said that the offender is devastated over Georgia’s death. I accept that the offender is remorseful because his act led to Ms Chant’s death but I very much doubt that he would have had any remorse at all if she had not died. 19 When I look at s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act I see that I have to decide whether the offender has shown remorse for “the offence.” This is another area where s 21A introduces completed unwarranted technicalities in the sentencing process. The problem is, of course, that the offender has shown remorse for the death of Ms Chant, but that is not something encompassed by “the offence”. I will deal with this appeal on the basis that the offender has shown remorse at the death of Ms Chant, but not for the simple act of supplying drugs to her. 20 The offender is also entitled to a discount because of the utilitarian nature of his plea of guilty. Having regard to the history of the proceedings I am not satisfied that that plea was entered at the earliest opportunity. I consider that the offender is entitled to a discount of twenty per cent to reflect his plea of guilty and when it was entered. 21 It is a matter of some concern that the prosecution process appears to have moved remarkably slowly. Because of the limited nature of the material tendered to me I cannot be precise, but I understand that the offender could, and perhaps should, have been charged with this offence soon after it was reported to police. Although the offender’s rehabilitation is far from complete, it does appear that he has made some progress in the meantime, and I have had regard to that aspect of delay when considering these appeals.22 Not only has he been able to demonstrate some rehabilitation but he has been left in a state of suspense for a considerable period of time, that only being compounded by this Crown appeal. It is clear that the Magistrate made no finding of special circumstances. Whilst there are some matters which might be suggestive of a finding in the offender’s favour, the history of the offender’s failure to take advantage of leniency on earlier occasions is such that I agree with the Magistrate that there is no warrant for extending any period of eligibility for parole at the expense of the non-parole period. Indeed the non-parole period which I shall shortly announce is the shortest which I consider appropriate in the circumstances of this case.23 Mr Barber submitted that a suspended sentence was appropriate, but when regard is had in particular to the various breaches of conditional liberty, a sentence of full-time custody is required. To submit that a suspended sentence should be imposed for an offence which represented a breach of another suspended sentence is to make a rather unattractive submission.24 The Crown submission was that this case should result in the imposition of a sentence at the jurisdictional limit of the Local Court. The Crown submission was that this case was one which should, if it had been dealt with at first instance in the District Court, have resulted in a sentence of more than two years six months. It has to be noted that that submission is somewhat inconsistent with the prosecution decision to have the matter dealt with in the Local Court in the first place, but in any case I do not accept the Crown’s submission that had I been dealing with this matter at first instance, rather than as an appeal from the Local Court, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment of more than two years six months.25 Despite the obvious Crown submission regarding the isolated nature of this act of supply, which I have indicated earlier I do accept, the fact remains that the offender did supply heroin to Ms Chant on a single occasion; that that was at her request, and I am simply unable, when formulating the appropriate sentence, to take into account as an aggravating feature the fact that that act of supply caused Ms Chant’s death. In those circumstances I do not consider that the Magistrate’s determination was in any way lenient, but neither do I consider that the offender’s appeal should be allowed either. 26 Indeed I am satisfied that the Magistrate’s sentence was entirely appropriate in the circumstances of this case. Both appeals are therefore dismissed and the sentence of the Magistrate is confirmed. That sentence commenced on 18 August 2008, and the offender will be released to parole on 17 November 2009.

      1623/07 REGINA (COMMONWEALTH) v Daniel WILKIE 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT (On admissibility of evidence relating to International Book; see transcript p 24) 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: A preliminary ruling is sought directing the exclusion from evidence of testimony relating to alterations in the reserves of which can be linked to what was known as the international book. In the circumstances I do not propose to delay matters by sketching the background, some of which can be found in a judgment earlier delivered when I rejected an application by the accused for a permanent stay of prosecution.  
     
      
    2 This trial, as I there noted, is focused upon alleged alterations in the reserves of insurance in respect of approximately eighty files, and I note the information that two only of those files apparently relate to what within FAIG was referred to as the international book. As I understand the accused’s contention, his objection is founded upon two bases. The first is that the matter concerning the international book alterations represents an issue which has been determined in favour of the accused at a previous trial presided over by Howie J.  
     
      
    3 In the judgment on the stay application I describe some circumstances concerning that trial and I will not repeat at length what was said there. In support of this basis of contention, senior counsel exemplified a situation which might arise if there was an attempt pursuant to s 65 of the Evidence Act to tender evidence given by a witness at the previous trial and the handicap that may be visited upon the accused in the event that material was then elicited in re-examination with which the accused could not conveniently or appropriately deal. The second basis was the submission that the probative value of this evidence was not in any event high and the discretion vested by s 137 of the Evidence Act was the subject of appeal. It suffices for present purposes to observe that the trial before Howie J was about a Crown allegation that what purported to be re-insurance was financial re-insurance. The trial concluded in the acquittal of the accused as a result of a direction by his Honour. For present purposes I have had reference to the judgment of 14 November 2005, which led to the directed verdicts. From that I am able to observe that the key ingredient which was absent, and thus led to the failure of the prosecution, was an inability of the Crown to prove a circumstance namely that there was an oral agreement between FAIG and the re-insurer that the former would not make any claim under the re-insurance. That seems to me obviously to be quite a different proposition from an assertion that the agreements about which such a term was not able to be proved were not true re-insurance. 
     
      
    4 It is also significant in my view that the current trial is focussed upon activity in the early days of January 1998 concerning the report of the operations of the holding company for the half year concluding on December 31, 1997 whereas the trial before Howie J dealt with a different period that concluding in mid-1998. Senior counsel for the accused has brought attention to the circumstance that some evidence may be sought to be tendered concerning activity by the accused in December 1997 but the circumstance that there might be some overlap in evidence does not to my mind demonstrate that there has been an issue already determined.  
     
      
    5 The next question is whether it would be nevertheless unfair to the accused to permit the tender of such evidence. I do not perceive that it would be unfair and discharging my duty of making a balance under s 137 I would rule against the claim being advanced by the accused for exclusion of this evidence. The probative value lies in the entirety of the reductions in January 1998 and there is no outweighing prejudice in allowing testimony about that part as represented in two particular files.

      JUDGMENT - Application to exclude s 18(1) TI Act 1979 evidentiary certificates – alleged failure to state facts 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: By Notice of Motion dated 4 July 2008 Khaled Cheikho sought in paragraph 9 the following order: 
     
      
       
        
        “(9) All evidentiary certificates issued pursuant to s 18(1) and 61(1)  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 
         be excluded as being irrelevant or otherwise inadmissible hearsay, on the basis that the certificates fail to state relevant facts within the meaning of ss 18 and 61, respectively.” 
        
       
      
    2 By agreement between the parties, the scope and reach of paragraph 9 of the motion has been narrowed. The nature of this will become apparent after when I have indicated the basis on which the present application is now made. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    3 On 9 April 2008 Mr Paul O'Brien, company secretary of SingTel Optus Pty Limited, provided an evidentiary certificate in relation to the execution of a warrant that had been issued under s 9 of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. The particular warrant had issued on 3 June 2004. It had been addressed to a named subscriber at the address in Punchbowl occupied at that time by Khaled Cheikho. The service number was 0297073250.  
     
      
    4 The Crown proposes to rely at trial on interceptions made in connection with this service during the relevant period, which commenced in the middle of the year 2004. In addition, the Crown proposes to rely upon the evidentiary certificate of Mr O'Brien dated 9 April 2008.  
     
      
    5 Omitting formal parts, the certificate is in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        “I, Paul O'Brien, the company secretary of SingTel Optus Pty Limited (""Optus""), being a carrier, certify pursuant to s 18 of the  
        Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act  
        1979 (""the Act"") the following facts which I consider are relevant to acts or things done by or in relation to employees of Optus in order to enable the execution of a warrant issued under s 9(1) of the Act: 
        
       
       
        
        1. A true redacted copy of a warrant issued on 3 June 2004 by the Attorney General authorising the interception of telecommunication services is annexed and marked with the letter 'A' (the warrant). 
        
       
       
        
        2. Optus was informed of the issuing of the warrant on 3 June 2004. 
         
         
        3. A certified copy of the warrant was received by an employee of Optus on 3 August 2004. 
         
         
        4. Between the period commencing on 3 June 2004 and ending on 7 September 2004, Optus employees did acts and things of a professional and technical nature that were necessary to enable the listening to and recording at the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) of the communications conducted using telecommunication service 0297073250 as they passed through the Optus network within one or two seconds of the communication being sent from the computer terminal. 
         
         
        5. Each communication passing over the telecommunication service specified in the warrant was transmitted directly to ASIO, without at any time being recorded or listened to by any Optus employee.  
         
         
        6. The equipment used by employees of Optus to facilitate the interception of communications enabled the recording by ASIO of the following information in relation to each communication: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          - the time and date of the communication; 
           
          - the direction of the communication, and 
           
          - the content of the communication.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 The certificate is dated 9 April 2008 and is signed under the signature of Paul O'Brien, company secretary.  
     
      
    7 (The title to the legislation was changed in 2006, but s 18 has remained in the same form as it had been under the TI Act 1979.) 
     
      
    8 The certificate I have identified became the focus of the attack made by Khaled Cheikho in relation to its validity or otherwise. There were other relevant certificates placed before me in evidence (Exhibit “B”). They will stand or fall depending on the fate of the arguments addressed to the certificate dated 9 April 2008. For these reasons it will be seen that the challenge stated in the notice of motion has been now confined by agreement to certain certificates issued under s 18 of the TI Act 1979. It is further confined to certificates issued on behalf of one carrier, namely Optus (the certificates of Paul O'Brien). Finally, it is further confined to those certificates that fall into the category of the ones collected together in Exhibit “B”.

    9 Section 18 of the TI Act 1979 (and the later legislation) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Evidentiary certificates 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The Managing Director or secretary of a carrier may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out such facts as he or she considers relevant with respect to acts or things done by, or in relation to, employees of the carrier in order to enable a warrant to be executed.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) A document purporting to be a certificate issued under subsection (1) and purporting to be signed by the Managing Director or secretary of a carrier is to be received in evidence in an exempt proceeding without further proof and is, in an exempt proceeding, conclusive evidence of the matters stated in the document.  
        
       
       
        
        (3) The Director-General of Security or the Deputy Director-General of Security may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out such facts as he or she considers relevant with respect to acts or things done: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in order to enable, or in connection with enabling, a warrant issued under this Part to be executed; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in connection with the execution of a warrant issued under this Part.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (4) The Director-General of Security or the Deputy Director-General of Security may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out such facts as he or she considers relevant with respect to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) anything done by an officer or employee of the Organisation in connection with the execution of a warrant issued under this Part; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) anything done by an officer or employee of the Organisation in connection with:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the communication by a person to another person of; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the making use of; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) the making of a record of; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iv) the custody of a record of; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (v) the giving in evidence of;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        information obtained by the execution of such a warrant.  
        
       
       
        
        (5) A document purporting to be a certificate issued under subsection (3) or (4) by the Director-General of Security or the Deputy Director-General of Security and to be signed by him or her is to be received in evidence in an exempt proceeding without further proof and is, in an exempt proceeding,  
        prima facie  
        evidence of the matters stated in the document.  
        
       
       
        
        (6) In subsections (1) and (2), a reference to the Managing Director or secretary of a carrier includes a reference to the Managing Director or secretary of a body corporate of which the carrier is a subsidiary.  
        
       
       
        
        (7) For the purposes of this section, the question whether a body corporate is a subsidiary of another body corporate is to be determined in the same manner as the question is determined under the  
        Corporations Act 2001  
        .” 
        
       
       
      Submissions on behalf of Khaled Cheikho 
       
      
    10 Mr Waterstreet provided both written and oral submissions on behalf of Khaled Cheikho. The essential submission is that the certificate does not certify facts within the meaning of s 18(1) of the legislation. Mr Waterstreet argued that the relevant employee of the carrier is not entitled to certify whatever he wishes. Rather, he is constrained only to certify facts relevant to acts or things done by employees of the carrier. As a consequence, the certificate relied on by the Crown is defective in that it purports to certify something that employees did not do and, secondly, does not certify facts, but instead makes general assertions and/or conclusions. The thrust of Mr Waterstreet's attack centres on the contents of paras 4, 5 and 6. He argues that para 4 states conclusions and is accordingly illegitimate; para 5 states facts which were not carried out by employees, and are therefore mere surplusage; and para 6 of the certificate states a conclusion, rather than facts.  
     
      
    11 A general proposition advanced by Mr Waterstreet was that when the predecessor section to s 18 was introduced, it was stated, according to the Explanatory Memorandum, to be for the following purpose: 
     
      
       
        
        “This provision is designed to protect the identity of Telecom employees engaged in such activity (that is, intercepting).” 
        
       
      
    12 This ""purpose"" was fleshed out in more detail, but to like effect in the Second Reading Speech of the then Attorney-General Mr Bowen (Hansard House of Representatives, 9 May 1985, page 1980.) 
     
      
       
        
        “Strict proof of actions taken by Telecom employees would require those employees to give evidence in Court. Telecom management has been advised that employees are unwilling to give such evidence because public identification of their involvement in narcotics interception would cause fear for their own safety, that of their families and that of their fellow workers. 
        
       
       
        
        ...It would be contrary to the public interest for the lawful interception of telecommunications to be produced or prejudiced. 
        
       
       
        
        ...The government proposes that evidence of acts performed by Telecom employees to enable the execution of an interception warrant be given by certificate signed by the Managing Director of Telecom.” 
        
       
      
    13 In these circumstances, Mr Waterstreet argued that the amendments were not aimed at facilitating proof for the prosecution, but rather at protecting the identities of those necessarily involved in the interception of telecommunications. It was to protect employees, not to protect methodology. 
     
      
    14 In support of his arguments, Mr Waterstreet referred the Court to a decision of the English Court of Appeal in Jones and Massey v Cook (1990) 22 HLR 319. Mr Waterstreet argued that this case provided a useful illustration and analogy of the manner in which a conclusive certificate could go beyond its proper ambit of proof and contravene the section enabling its production.  
     
      
    15 Mr Waterstreet argued, finally, that while s 18 permitted facts to be certified, it did not allow conclusions to be stated. Counsel drew an analogy between cases involving averments and the situation with conclusive evidentiary certificates. He referred the Court to CEO of Customs v El Hajje 218 ALR at 457. 
     
      
       
      The Crown response 
       
      
    16 Mr O'Donnell of counsel put the arguments for the Crown. He emphasised, firstly, that the task of the certifier is to make up his mind as to which matters he considers relevant with respect to acts or things done by, or in relation to, employees of the carrier in order to enable a warrant to be executed. This involved a much broader reading of the section than Mr Waterstreet's arguments had allowed. Mr O'Donnell submitted, however, that this broader reading of the section emerged directly from its literal terms.  
     
      
    17 Secondly, Mr O'Donnell argued that the history of the legislation and its stated ""purpose"" do not limit its operations. It has operation, according to its terms, which are clear and unambiguous. The certificate complies with subs (1) of s 18. It is, therefore, to be received in evidence without further proof and is conclusive evidence of all the matters stated therein (subs (2) of s 18).  
     
      
    18 Mr O'Donnell examined in detail each of the impugned paragraphs of the certificate. Counsel asserted that, upon examination, all the matters certified were well within the purview of the section.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    19 I have given consideration to Mr Waterstreet's submissions and examined the certificate, and the relevant legislation in the light of those submissions. I have come to the conclusion, however, that the challenge to the certificates cannot succeed.  
     
      
    20 The first matter to be considered is the purpose and scope of the legislation as reflected by the terms of s 18 of the TI Act. This is a matter I considered in my earlier decision R v Baladjam [No 17]. At para 69 I said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of the legislation was, as is commonly accepted by both counsel, to protect the identity of the carrier's employees engaged in enabling the execution of warrants by police and other agencies. It was designed to save those employees from having to give evidence in court. It was intended to provide for a certificate going to formal matters of technical evidence only, and not to any issue before the Court. (See Explanatory Memorandum and Second Reading Speech).” 
        
       
      
    21 I also said (when examining the certificate in that case, the certificate being in identical terms to the present): 
     
      
       
        
        “The certificate itself bears out these matters fully. First, it annexes the warrant and records when the carrier was notified of its issue. It also records when it was received by Optus. These are plainly matters of formality only. Secondly, it records 'acts or things done' by employees to enable the warrant's execution. They are technical matters, not described in any detail, which demonstrate no more than that those technical steps were such as were 'necessary' to enable 'the listening to and recording' at ASIO of the communications conducted using the service 02-9707 3250 as they passed through the Optus network.” 
        
       
      
    22 Mr Waterstreet has argued that the purpose of the legislation is to protect the employees, not the methodology involved in the interception. I cannot accept this as a correct statement of the object of the legislation. The protection of the Optus employees is plainly important. But it is achieved by permitting conclusive evidentiary certification by the employer of matters considered relevant by him to the methodology. That is how the protection of the employees is secured.  
     
      
    23 It is, of course, permissible to have regard to the language of the section itself in identifying the scope and purpose of the legislation. Indeed, this will, on occasions, be of as much, if not more, value than paying heed to secondary sources. In this regard, the language of the section makes it plain that reception of a s 18(1) certificate signed by the company secretary of a carrier is, in exempt proceedings, conclusive evidence of the matters stated in the certificate. This means that the effect of the legislation is to preclude a challenge to the matters stated within the certificate issued under s 18(1) of the legislation. In that regard, I note the remarks of Latham J in R v Khazaal at para 9. This is a restricted judgment at present, but I see no harm in setting out the relevant paragraph in this decision. Her Honour said (dealing with this legislation): 
     
      
       
        
        “There are sound policy reasons for such an approach. The certificate of the company secretary of a carrier is directed to those essentially mechanical acts that are performed by the carrier's employees on the communication network, so that a warrant can be executed, that is, so that the signals being transmitted across the network can be diverted to the holder of the warrant. The certificate obviates the need to call the employees of a carrier in order to prove each and every step undertaken by them in order to 'capture' the communications caught by the warrant. In the object sense of such a conclusive evidentiary certificate, the prosecution would be put to pointless trouble and expense calling witnesses to give technical evidence of no relevance to the real issues in the proceedings.” 
        
       
      
    24 I respectfully agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    25 In my opinion, the fact that the protection of employees was an important feature of the policy considerations involved in the decision to create s 18(1), does not stand in the way of other legislative purposes, provided they are obvious from and consistent with the Act as a whole. It was clearly the view of Parliament in enacting s 18(1) that matters of a technical nature could and should be conclusively proved by the procedure created by the legislation. Here, unusually, the actual technical processes appear to be of interest to the accused, although ordinarily they would not be of the slightest interest. The interest only arises however, from a sense of “forensic chagrin” that the lawyers for Khaled Cheikho have experienced as a consequence of being deprived of a possible challenge to the legitimacy of the warrants (see my remarks in R v Baladjam [No 17] at para 83). This element of ""forensic chagrin"" is not aimed at any issue likely to arise in the trial. It is focused for present purposes on the admissibility of the material captured by virtue of the relevant warrants. Given more precisely, it is focused on the validity of the warrants. As I presently understand it, apart from these issues, the argument has no other place or role to play in the trial.  
     
      
    26 Secondly, the language of s 18(1) itself must mean the challenge cannot succeed. The language of s 18(1) makes it perfectly plain that the facts to be certified are those that the certifying officer considers ""relevant"". The certificate is conclusive not only as to the facts certified: It is equally conclusive as to the certifier's decision that those are facts relevant to ""acts or things done by, or in relation to, employees of the carrier in order to enable a warrant to be executed"". The expression ""carried out by, or in relation to, employees of the carrier"" is at itself odds with the primary submission made in para 3 of the written submissions. There counsel had argued that: 
     
      
       
        
        “The relevant employee of the carrier is not entitled to certify whatever he wishes, but rather is constrained only to certify facts relevant to acts or things done by employees of the carrier.” 
        
       
      
    27 This is too narrow a construction for two reasons. It ignores the fact that it is for the secretary of the carrier to decide what is relevant. In addition, the expression in the legislation I have set out is broader than that contained in the para 3 written submission. (“carried out by, or in relation to”). 
     
      
    28 Thirdly, an examination of paras 4, 5 and 6 of the certificate demonstrates that the certified facts readily falls within the ambit of s 18(1). While it is true that paragraph 4 does not give much technical detail, it does focus on the passage of time involved as the communications passed through the Optus network to ASIO. It links that passage of time to the ""acts and things of a professional and technical nature"" done by the employees to enable the relatively instant passage of the communications to the warrant holder. It is easy to see why Mr O'Brien thought this was a relevant matter to the nature of the actions of his employees in enabling the warrant to be executed. It is plainly of considerable relevance to the concerns of Khaled Cheikho's lawyers. The problem is it conflicts with their hope or expectation that the communication did not occur in that way. But whether I think it relevant or not, the crux of the matter is that it appeared relevant to the certifier. This is what he says in his certificate and it is, by virtue of s 18(2) ""conclusive evidence of the matters stated in the document"". The fact that reams of highly technical material are not included to explain how it was that the transmission occurred virtually instantly is, in my view, neither here nor there. Both the relevance of the fact of instant passage, and the means taken by employees to secure that, are conclusively proved by the certificate.  
     
      
    29 The facts stated in para 5 plainly fall within the ambit of the legislation. The statement ""each communication passing over the telecommunication service specified in the warrant was transmitted directly to ASIO"" plainly answers the description of ""acts or things done by or in relation to employees of Optus in order to enable the execution"" of the warrant. The remaining words have been attacked as mere surplusage. This is not a fair description. Once again, Mr O'Brien was entitled to consider it relevant to acts or things done by his employees as to whether the communications were recorded to or listened to by those employees. It is, in any event, a fact with respect to acts performed by the employees to enable the execution of the warrant. At the very least it is a fact considered relevant by Mr O'Brien with respect to the actions of the employees taken to enable execution of the warrant.  
     
      
    30 Finally, the statements in para 6 are plainly matters relevant in the manner called for in s 18(1) of the Act. In any event, they are, once again, matters that Mr O'Brien considered relevant to acts or things done by, or in relation to, employees of the carrier in the relevant sense.  
     
      
    31 There is nothing in either of the two authorities referred to by Mr Waterstreet that warrants any different conclusion. As I observed during argument, the example appearing in Jones and Massey v Cook fell to be decided in terms of the legislation involved there and the language of the certificate issued. It was a very clear situation of the certificate transgressing, in the sense that it purported to interfere with the statutory role to be performed by the Court. That is not the case here. As to El Hajje, I considered this in my earlier decision R v Baladjam [No 17]. It concerned an averment provision. I do not consider that it has any useful analogy to the present situation (see R v Baladjam [No 17] paras 85 and 86).  
     
      
    32 For these reasons, I decline to make the orders sought.

      JUDGMENT - Application to set aside ASIO search warrants – ASIO Act 1979 s 25 – alleged failure to comply with requirements of Act – general warrants 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: By notice of motion dated 4 July 2008 Khaled Cheikho had sought to exclude material obtained as a result of the execution of certain warrants. These were warrants issued pursuant to s 25 Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (ASIO Act). The motion sought exclusion based on an irregularity, namely a failure to specify in the warrants ""the relevant matters that were important in relation to security"". The arguments on behalf of Khaled Cheikho were presented by Mr Peter Lange of counsel. The Crown, represented by Mr Geoff Bellew SC, opposed the making of the order sought in the notice of motion and, for present purposes, opposed the primary order that the warrants themselves be quashed, it being submitted by the defence that they were invalid for the same reason as stated in the notice of motion. Arguments concerning the validity of the warrants have, by agreement, replaced the s 138 application for the time being. The latter aspect of the application must now await the outcome of the primary submission. 
     
      
       
      The Warrants 
       
      
    2 Three warrants were tendered in evidence. They became Exhibit “A” on the voir dire. There is one aspect of them that is confidential, and I will not trespass upon that aspect in this judgment.  
     
      
    3 For all intents and purposes, the warrants are identical, although they are addressed to separate premises in Condell Park, Wiley Park and Lakemba respectively. These were premises occupied by Mr Elomar, Khaled Sharrouf and Hasan. 
     
      
    4 It will be sufficient to set out certain details from the first warrant in Exhibit “A”. As I have said, the terminology in the remaining two warrants is virtually identical.  
     
      
    5 The first warrant identifies the premises to be searched 1 Gallipoli Street, Condell Park NSW 2200. It also identifies Mohamed Ali Elomar as the occupant. The warrant continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. I am satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that access by the Organisation to records or other things on the subject premises, including vehicles, will substantially assist the collection of intelligence in accordance with this  
        Act 
         in respect of a matter (the security matter) that is important in relation to security. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Pursuant to s 25(4), I hereby authorise the organisation to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) enter the subject premises listed above; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) search those premises for the purpose of finding records or other things relevant to the security matter and, for that purpose, opening any safe, box, drawer, parcel, envelope or any other container in which there is reasonable cause to believe that any such records or other things may be found. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) inspect or otherwise examine any records or any other things found in the premises, and to make copies or transcripts of any record so found that appears to be relevant to the collection of intelligence by the organisation in accordance with the  
          Act 
          ; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) remove and retain for such time as is reasonable any record or other thing so found for purposes of inspecting or examining it, and, in the case of a record, for the purpose of making copies or transcripts of it, in accordance with the warrant; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) do anything reasonably necessary to conceal the fact that anything has been done under the warrant; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) do any other thing reasonably incidental to the above.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 The warrant further states the Attorney-General's satisfaction that there is reasonable cause to believe that data ""relevant to the security matter"" may be accessible by using a computer or other electronic equipment found on the premises. The Organisation is authorised, pursuant to subs 25(5) to use any computer or other electronic equipment found in the premises for the purpose of obtaining access to any such data relevant to “the security matter”. It also authorises the use of any computer or other electronic equipment to inspect and examine any data to which access has been obtained, and to convert any such data that appears to be relevant to the collection of intelligence by the Organisation in accordance with the Act into documentary form and to remove any such document. The warrant authorises the Organisation to do any other thing reasonably incidental to any of these matters. 
     
      
    7 The use of “any force” that is necessary to do the things specified in paragraphs 3, 5 and 6 of the warrant is specifically authorised by paragraph 7. Entry under the warrant is authorised to be made “at any time of the day or night”. The warrant is to remain in force for the period of 28 days from its date of issue. The warrant is signed under the hand of the then Attorney General. 
     
      
       
      The Legislation 
       
      
    8 The ASIO Act 1979 is a long and complex piece of legislation. I will, however, refer to certain sections to enable an understanding of its framework.   
     
      
    9 Section 17 is an important section. It sets out the functions of ASIO. It is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “17 Functions of Organisation 
        
       
       
        
        (1) The functions of the Organisation are: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) to obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) for purposes relevant to security and not otherwise, to communicate any such intelligence to such persons, and in such manner, as are appropriate to those purposes; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) to advise Ministers and authorities of the Commonwealth in respect of matters relating to security, in so far as those matters are relevant to their functions and responsibilities. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ca) to furnish security assessments to a State or an authority of a State in accordance with paragraph 40(1)(b); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) to advise Ministers, authorities of the Commonwealth and such other persons as the Minister, by notice in writing given to the Director-General, determines on matters relating to protective security; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) to obtain within Australia foreign intelligence pursuant to section 27A or 27B of this Act or section 11A, 11B or 11C of the  
          Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 
          , and to communicate any such intelligence in accordance with this Act or the  
          Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 
          . 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) It is not a function of the Organisation to carry out or enforce measures for security within an authority of the Commonwealth.” 
        
       
      
    10 Section 18 deals with the power to communicate intelligence on behalf of ASIO. (It has been discussed by me in an earlier decision (see R v Baladjam [No 24]. The Act provides for special powers to be conferred on ASIO in Division 2.  These extend to, and include the power to issue search warrants under s 25, and computer access warrants under s 25A. The power to use listening devices is contained in s 26, and lawful tracking devices are permitted under ss 26A, 26B and 26C. There are other powers conferred on the Organisation in the same Division, but I need not presently specify these for the purposes of this decision.  
     
      
    11 Section 31 requires the Director-General to destroy records obtained under a warrant where there is satisfaction that the record or copy is not required for the purpose of the performance of functions or the exercise of powers under the ASIO Act. Section 34 requires the Director-General to furnish to the Minister in respect of each warrant issued under the Division, a report in writing on the extent to which the action taken under the warrant has assisted the Organisation in carrying out its functions.  
     
      
    12 Division 3 contains special powers relating to terrorism offences, including the issue of questioning and detention warrants (I will make no comment on these detailed provisions as they are not directly relevant to the present issue).  
     
      
    13 Part IV of the Act provides for the furnishing by ASIO of security assessments. There are also provisions for the review of security assessments. Secrecy provisions are enshrined in s 81. Finally, reference may be made to Part V, which deals with the employment of ASIO staff issues relating to the identity of employees and certain matters relating to offences (see s 93). 
     
      
    14 I will return now to the section dealing with search warrants. Section 25 is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        25. Search warrants 
          
        
       
       
        
        Issue of search warrant  
        
       
       
        
        (1) If the Director-General requests the Minister to do so, and the Minister is satisfied as mentioned in subsection (2), the Minister may issue a warrant in accordance with this section.  
        
       
       
        
        Test for issue of warrant  
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Minister is only to issue the warrant if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that access by the Organisation to records or other things on particular premises (the  
        subject premises 
        ) will substantially assist the collection of intelligence in accordance with this Act in respect of a matter (the  
        security matter  
        ) that is important in relation to security.  
        
       
       
        
        Authorisation in warrant  
        
       
       
        
        (3) The warrant must be signed by the Minister and must authorise the Organisation to do specified things, subject to any restrictions or conditions specified in the warrant, in relation to the subject premises, which must also be specified in the warrant.  
        
       
       
        
        Things that may be specified in warrant  
        
       
       
        
        (4) The things that may be specified are any of the following that the Minister considers appropriate in the circumstances:

          (b) searching the subject premises for the purpose of finding records or other things relevant to the security matter and, for that purpose, opening any safe, box, drawer, parcel, envelope or other container in which there is reasonable cause to believe that any such records or other things may be found;

          (ii) in the case of a record-making copies or transcripts of it, in accordance with the warrant;  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) any thing reasonably necessary to conceal the fact that any thing has been done under the warrant;

        (7) The warrant must:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) authorise the use of any force that is necessary and reasonable to do the things specified in the warrant; and

        Statement about warrant coming into force  
        
       
       
        
        8) The warrant may state that it comes into force on a specified day (after the day of issue) or when a specified event happens. The day must not begin nor the event happen more than 28 days after the end of the day on which the warrant is issued.  
        
       
       
        
        When warrant comes into force  
        
       
       
        
        (9) If the warrant includes such a statement, it comes into force at the beginning of the specified day or when the specified event happens. Otherwise, it comes into force when it is issued.

      Submissions on behalf of Khaled Cheikho 
       
      
    15 The primary submission made by Mr Lange is that the warrants in question (Exhibit A) are nothing more than “general warrants”. For that reason, if the Court accepts that they are general warrants and nothing more, they should be held to be invalid and must therefore be quashed.  
     
      
    16 Mr Lange points to the precise identity between the language of the warrants and the statute. He complains, however, in particular that the warrants do not in any way limit the object of the search. Secondly, they do not specify or identify the security matter, which justifies the issue of the warrant. They have the effect, counsel argued, of permitting the seizure of anything at all in the sole discretion of the executing officers.  
     
      
    17 In terms of legal principle, Mr Lange's submissions began by reiterating the common law's well-known historical aversion to general warrants. He referred to Entick v Carrington (1765) 2 Wils. KB 275. In rejecting the legality of general warrants, Lord Camden CJ stated (292): 
     
      
       
        
        “This is the first instance of an attempt to prove a modern practice of a private office to make and execute warrants to enter a man's house, search for and take away all his books and papers in the first instance, to be law, which is not found in our books. It must have been the guilt or the poverty of those upon whom such warrants have been executed that deterred or hindered them from contending against the power of a Secretary of State and the Solicitor of the Treasury, or such warrants could never have passed for lawful till this time.” 
        
       
      
    18 Mr Lange reminded the Court that the Entick principle that a person is entitled to be free from arbitrary search ""was hard fought for in our constitutional history"". (New South Wales v Corbett (2007) 230 CLR 606, 630 (at 95) per Callinan and Crennan JJ.) Mr Lange argued that there is a tension between the power to search a person's residence, and a person’s right not to have property interfered with, or perhaps his or her right to privacy. This tension has led to the imposition of a requirement of particularity in respect of search warrants issued in aid of investigations (New South Wales v Corbett 632 at (104) per Callinan and Crennan JJ).  
     
      
    19 By way of analogy, Mr Lange took the Court to cases involving the predecessor to s 3E Crimes Act 1914, namely s 10 Crimes Act 1914 (repealed). This section conferred a power to execute search warrants. Although the provision did not specify that the warrant had to be particularised in any respect, judicial commentary was unanimous in declaring that a warrant issued pursuant to that legislation required specificity, both as to the offence investigated and the objects sought during the search. (Trimboli v Onley [No 1] (1981) 56 FLR 304 per Powell J.)  
     
      
    20 More recently, the Supreme Court of New South Wales has held that search warrants under the Search Warrant Act 1985, which do not expressly regulate the content of the warrant, are also subject to the requirement of particularity (Douglas v Blackler (2001) NSWSC 901 per Taylor AJ).  
     
      
    21 Mr Lange's submissions embraced other areas where search warrants had been involved. They extended, for example, to Royal Commissions (MacGibbon v Warner (1997) 98 A Crim R 450 at 453 per Priestley JA. In particular, reliance was placed upon the following passage in Priestley JA's decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “General warrants have been condemned by the courts for centuries. They have been regarded as instruments, which facilitate the abuse of executive power. They are invalid at common law. It is true that it is open to State Parliament to pass laws authorising the use of such warrants, but courts will not read legislation as taking such a drastic step unless it is very clear in its meaning and effect: Indeed, it has been said in recent cases in the High Court similar to the present that the intention of Parliament to change the common law must be made 'unmistakably clear' ( 
        Coco 
         (1994) 179 CLR 427 at 437) or expressed with 'irresistible clearness' ( 
        Bropho v WA 
         (1990) 171 CLR 1 at 19.” 
        
       
      
    22 Mr Lange argued that there was no limitation in the warrants under consideration in the present application in respect of the reason for the search, nor, perhaps more importantly, the subject of the search. Counsel repeated that the manner in which the search was to be conducted was left entirely to the discretion of those executing the warrant. Mr Lange referred to a comment critical of this type of situation appearing in the judgment of Fullerton J in Way Out West Adult Shop Pty Limited v Kraus (2008) NSWSC 87 at para 25. Her Honour was there concerned with a possible ambiguity in relation to the description of premises in a police search warrant issued in connection with allegations of serious offences relating to the possession of pornographic films. Her Honour (commenting on a passage in Hill J's decision in Carbone v National Crime Authority (1994) 52 FCR 516 at 521), said: 
     
      
       
        
        “While his Honour was referring to ambiguity in the description given to documents to which a search warrant might be directed, the same consequences will obtain where ambiguity or imprecision in the description of premises to be entered and searched...is of such a kind that the person to whom the warrant is directed either cannot resolve the ambiguity at all or cannot do so without recourse to his or her subjective or esoteric knowledge of the investigation, the person suspected of having committed the offence to which the warrant refers, or to other circumstances surrounding the issue of the warrant.” 
        
       
      
    23 Finally, Mr Lange submitted that the fundamental departure from the requirements of the common law was such that the subject warrant should be quashed. Mr Lange accepted that the legislature might, in theory, justify the issue of warrants in broad terms, but argued that there was nothing in s 25 of the ASIO Act that suggested this was the intention of the legislature. 
     
      
       
      Submissions on behalf of the Crown 
       
      
    24 The Crown did not put in issue the “ancient principles” referred to by Mr Lange in his reference to Entick's case. Nor did the Crown submit that such principles did not have an application in contemporary circumstances relating to police investigation warrants. Rather, the Crown submitted that the issue here was whether the statutory conditions, which governed the issue of the warrants, had been complied with. The Crown argued that the legislation precisely prescribed the test for the issue of the warrants. It precisely prescribed the form of authorisation required and, more importantly, prescribed the very things that may be specified in the warrant.  
     
      
    25 Against that background, the Crown examined the form of the warrants in question. It was submitted that each had been drafted specifically to conform with the provisions of s 25 of the ASIO Act. Importantly, there was nothing within the terms of that section which required that the warrants be issued with respect to the commission or suspected commission of any criminal offence. (Mr Lange unequivocally accepted this proposition and did not argue to the contrary.)  
     
      
    26 The Crown drew particular attention to the width and nature of ASIO's functions as set out in s 17 of the ASIO Act. The Crown did not accept that the object of the search was limitless, or that it was left to the discretion of the executing agents to decide the extent of the warrant. Mr Bellew argued that the legislation did not require the specification of the security matter. Secondly, it was sufficient in those circumstances for the warrant to describe the search of the premises in terms of para 3(b) of the warrant. The reach of the power to inspect, examine and make copies of records was similarly limited when paras 3(b) and (c) were properly construed. The Crown pointed especially to the provisions of s 25(4)(e), namely that the Minister was entitled to specify in the warrant that ""anything reasonably necessary to conceal the fact that anything had been done under the warrant"". In fact, this had been specified in para 3(e) of the warrant and again, in relation to computer records, in 5(c) of the warrant.  
     
      
    27 The Crown referred to McHugh J's decision in Ousley v The Queen, 192 CLR 69 at 111 where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “But given the history of the common law on this subject matter, it seems safe to proceed on the assumption that when a legislature specifies what must appear in a warrant, it intends its statement to be exhaustive of the matters that the warrant must disclose.” 
        
       
      
    28 The Crown also referred me to the observations of Gummow J in the same case where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Lord Wilberforce pointed out in  
        Inland Revenue Commissioners v Rossminster Limited 
         that any inquiry into the form of search warrants at common law was of limited assistance where the form of the warrants in question is prescribed by statute. The matter is one of statutory interpretation, giving proper weight to the precept that a legislative intention to interfere with fundamental rights by the Commission of what otherwise would be tortious or criminal acts must be clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language.” 
        
       
      
    29 (Reliance was also placed upon remarks to similar effect by Murray J in Ibbotson v Chaney (1998) 19 WAR 404.) 
     
      
    30 Mr Bellew repeated, when examining earlier cases relied on by Mr Lange, that the legislation in question here does not require the stipulation of an offence or offences. Nor does it require that an occupier's notice be served. In those regards, it can be contrasted with s 3E of the Crimes Act (Cth) and its predecessor. It is proper to infer, counsel argued, that these omissions represent a deliberate intention on the part of the Parliament that such procedures, even by analogy, would not be required. Such a conclusion also emanated from the general nature of the ASIO Act itself and its concern with the gathering of intelligence, often in covert circumstances, rather than with the investigation of criminal behaviour.  
     
      
    31 The Crown took me to various passages in the speeches of their Lordships in R v RIC Ex Parté Rossminster at 997, especially per Lord Wilberforce; at 1008 per Lord Diplock, and 1005 per Viscount Dilhorne. Mr Lange's reply to this particular analysis was that the legislation under consideration there differed markedly from s 25 of the ASIO Act.  
     
      
    32 Finally, Mr Bellew referred to a number of ""safeguard"" provisions in the ASIO Act. These included ss 31, 32 and 34. In addition, there were the function sections in s 17, the specific limitations in s 24 upon those who are able to exercise authority under the warrants, and the provisions of ss 25(2) and (3). The request for the issue of a warrant must specify the facts and other grounds upon which the Director-General considers it necessary that the warrant be issued. (S 28.) The Crown argued that these matters provide a regime of safeguards which effectively act as a counter balance to the absence of a legislative requirement for specificity to the extent that this was asserted on behalf of Khaled Cheikho.  
     
      
    33 The Crown submitted that what was required to be disclosed on the face of the statutory warrants necessarily depended upon the terms of the statute which governed its issue. The warrants here had been drafted precisely in conformity with the terms of s 25. There was nothing in that section of the ASIO Act which required the two matters of particularisation submitted on behalf of the accused. And, in the light of the terms of the statute, no such requirement was imposed by the general law. The Crown asked the Court to dismiss the application. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    34 The question to be decided is: Are the search warrants valid?  
     
      
    35 If the answer to this were to be determined purely by the application of common law principles relating to the validity of a police search warrant, there would undoubtedly be a legitimate view that the warrants in question were flawed. There is, for example, no offence stated in the warrants. Secondly, the objects to be searched for are not related to the commission of a criminal offence. Thirdly, it appears to be the situation that the person asked to carry out the search would not know from the contents of the warrants the proper boundaries of the search to be undertaken in answer to the dictates of the warrants.  
     
      
    36 In a situation involving legislation not dissimilar to s 10 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) the High Court, in a well-known passage in George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 110) addressed the impact of the will of Parliament on common law principles as follows: - 
     
      
       
        
        “A search warrant thus authorizes an invasion of premises without the consent of persons in lawful possession or occupation thereof. The validity of such a warrant is necessarily dependent upon the fulfilment of the conditions governing its issue. In prescribing conditions governing the issue of search warrants, the legislature has sought to balance the need for an effective criminal justice system against the need to protect the individual from arbitrary invasions of his privacy and property. Search warrants facilitate the gathering of evidence against, and the apprehension and conviction of, those who have broken the criminal law. In enacting s 679, the legislature has given primacy to the public interest in the effective administration of criminal justice over the private right of the individual to enjoy his privacy and property. The common law has long been jealous of the prima facie immunity from seizure of papers and possessions: see Holdsworth, a  
        History of English Law 
        , vol 10 (1938), pp. 668-672. Except in the case of a warrant issued for the purpose of searching a place for stolen goods, the common law refused to countenance the issue of search warrants, at all and refused to permit a constable or government official to enter private property without the permission of the occupier:  
        Leach v Money 
         (30);  
        Entick v Carrington 
         (31). Historically, the justification for these limitations on the power of entry and search was based on the rights of private property:  
        Entick 
         (32). In modern times the justification has shifted increasingly to the protection of privacy: see Feldman, The Law Relating to Entry, Search and Seizure (1986), pp 1-2. 
        
       
       
        
        State and Commonwealth statutes have made many exceptions to the common law position, and s 679 is a far-reaching one. Nevertheless, in construing and applying such statutes, it needs to be kept in mind that they authorise the invasion of interests which the common law has always valued highly and which, through the writ of trespass, it went to great lengths to protect. Against that background, the enactment of conditions which must be fulfilled before a search warrant can be lawfully issued and executed is to be seen as a reflection of the legislature’s concern to give a measure of protection to these interests. To insist on strict compliance with the statutory conditions governing the issue of search warrants is simply to give effect to the purpose of the legislation.” 
        
       
      
    37 The legislation in question, of course, dealt with conventional search warrants facilitating the gathering of evidence for use in criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    38 Here, as well, the issue does not fall to be decided by the application of common law principles. As Gummow J observed in Ousley v R (at 545) an inquiry into the form of search warrants at common law is really of limited assistance in a situation where the form of the warrants is prescribed by the language of a statute. The matter becomes one of statutory interpretation, giving proper weight to the need to construe the language of the section strictly. As Murray J observed in Ibbotson v Chaney (at 404): 
     
      
       
        
        “At common law, general warrants which were judged to be expressed with insufficient particularity were held to be invalid and devoid of legal effect. But as I have mentioned, when a warrant is authorised by statute, that general proposition is replaced by a process of statutory construction. The validity of a warrant will be measured by whether it mirrors the ambit of statutory power. If it may have a wider operation, the Courts may say it is struck down because it is expressed too generally, but in truth the conclusion thus expressed is that the warrant is invalid because on its face it might authorise an interference with private rights which is outside the ambit of the statutory power. Whilst the Courts will interpret the terms in which that power is granted strictly, if the conclusion mentioned above is not reached, the warrant will be held to be valid no matter how large the power conferred or how unpalatable it may be thought to be. It is no part of the Court's function to strike down a statutory instrument which may not be held to be invalid upon the ground discussed above so as to frustrate or impede the carrying out of the object and scheme of the statute.” 
        
       
      
    39 (Murray J was in dissent on the ultimate decision. His views, however, were generally the same as the other members of the Court.)  
     
      
    40 In the present matter, the issue is whether the form of the warrants accords with the statute. The correct approach may also be expressed by asking whether the statute permits the warrants to be in their present form. The contemporary approach to statutory construction has been stated by the High Court in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 335 at 381 per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ. The primary purpose of statutory construction is ""to construe the relevant provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute"". There is nothing in the nature of search and seizure provisions which calls for a departure from this general principle: See Hart v Commissioner of Australian Federal Police (2002) 124 FCR 384 at (64). Indeed, in Hart's case, the Full Court commented that there is no requirement that the Court approach the task of statutory construction ""armed with a prima facie hostility to the invasion of privacy that is necessarily involved in the exercise of investigative powers. Privacy is but one of the interests to be taken into account in construing legislation authorising the exercise of such power"".  
     
      
    41 What then is the general focus of the ASIO Act 1979? What does it tell us about the ambit and scope of s 25 of the Act? The first important matter to be noted about s 25 itself is that it is not, in terms, concerned with the investigation of criminal behaviour. It is concerned with the gathering of intelligence related to security. The test for the issue of the warrant is highly specific. The Minister is only to issue the warrant if he or she is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that access by ASIO to certain material on the subject premises ""will substantially assist the collection of intelligence in accordance with this Act in respect of a matter (the security matter) that is important in relation to security"". The importance of the nature of this test is that it reinforces that the search is designed to assist the collection of intelligence in accordance with the ASIO Act in respect of a particular matter that is important in relation to security. It has nothing to do with the collection of evidence for a criminal investigation or prosecution. Of course, ultimately material collected during the search may become the evidence, or part of the evidence, in a criminal trial. But the warrant is not issued with that purpose in mind. It can only be issued, as the section makes plain, where the Minister is satisfied there are reasonable grounds for believing that material will substantially assist the collection of intelligence in respect of a matter that is important in relation to security.  
     
      
    42 ""Intelligence"" is not defined in the Act. However, the broad scope and notion of the term may be well understood by reference to the functions of the organisation as expressed in s 17 and the definition of ""security"" appearing in s 4. ""Security"" means: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) the protection of, and of the people of, the Commonwealth and the several states and territories from: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) espionage 
           
           
          (ii) sabotage 
           
           
          (iii) politically motivated violence 
           
           
          (iv) promotion of communal violence 
           
           
          (v) attacks on Australia's defence system; or 
           
           
          (vi) acts of foreign interference;  
          
         
         
        whether direct from, or committed within, Australia or not; and 
         
         
        (b) the carrying out of Australia's responsibilities to any foreign country in relation to a matter mentioned in any of the subparagraphs of paragraph (a).” 
         
         
        
       
      
    43 ""Politically motivated violence"" is defined in s 4 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) acts or threats of violence or unlawful harm that are intended or likely to achieve a political objective, whether in Australia or elsewhere, including acts or threats carried on for the purpose of influencing the policy or acts of a government, whether in Australia or elsewhere; or 
         
         
        (b) acts that: 
         
         
          
          (i) involve violence or are intended or are likely to involve or lead to violence (whether by the persons who carry on those acts or by other persons); and 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) are directed to overthrowing or destroying, or assisting in the overthrow or destruction of, the government or the constitutional system of government of the Commonwealth or of a State or Territory; or 
          
         
         
        (ba) acts that are terrorism offences; or 
         
         
        (c) acts that are offences punishable under the  
        Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act 
         1978, the  
        Crimes (Hostages) Act 
         1989 or Division 1 of Part 2 or Part 3, of the  
        Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Act 1992 
         or under Division 1 or 4 of Part 2 of the

          (ii) threaten or endanger any person or class of persons specified by the Minister for the purposes of this subparagraph by notice in writing given to the Director-General.” 
          
         
         
        
       
      
    44 ""Promotion of communal violence"" means activities that are directed to promoting violence between different groups of persons in the Australian community so as to endanger the peace, order or good government of the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    45 “’Acts of foreign interference’ means activities relating to Australia that are carried on by or on behalf of, are directed or subsidised by or are undertaken in acts of collaboration with, a foreign power, being activities that:

          (i) are carried on for intelligence purposes; 
          
         
         
          
          (ii) are carried on for the purpose of affecting political or governmental processes; or 
          
         
         
          
          (iii) are otherwise detrimental to the interests of Australia; or 
          
         
         
        (b) involve a threat to any person. 
         
         
        
       
      
    46 “Attacks on Australia's defence system’ means activities that are intended to, and are likely to, obstruct, hinder or interfere with the performance by the defence force of its functions or with the carrying out of other activities by or for the Commonwealth for the purpose of the defence or safety of the Commonwealth.”  
     
      
    47 Thus, it will be seen that the definition of ""security"" is very wide indeed. The notion of gathering or collecting intelligence in accordance with the Act ""in respect of a matter that is important in relation to security"" is accordingly very wide. By way of contrast, the range of possible dissemination of intelligence is very narrow (see s 18(1) and (2); and especially s 18(3). It is also of importance to note that the issue of a search warrant under s 25 can only be contemplated where the Director-General of Security requests the Attorney-General to do so. The position and importance of the role played by the Director-General can be seen from ss 7 and 8. These sections emphasise that the Director-General is to be above ministerial or political manipulation. This can also be seen from ss 20 and 21. Section 20 requires the Director-General to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the work of the Organisation is limited to what is necessary for the purposes of the discharge of its functions, and to keep the Organisation free from influences or considerations irrelevant to its functions. Section 21 requires the Director-General to consult regularly with the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives for the purpose of keeping him or her informed on matters relating to security. 
     
      
    48 Although it is the Director-General (or his authorised delegate) who may request the issue of a search warrant, it is only the Attorney-General who may issue the warrant. Such a requirement may be contrasted with the traditional search warrant legislation where warrants are to be issued by Magistrates, Judges or other functionaries. Here it is only the first legal officer of the Commonwealth to whom falls the responsibility of deciding whether the test for the issue of a warrant contained in s 25 has been made good. The test for the issue of the warrant enshrines the need for the Minister's satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds for believing that access to the records or other things on the subject premises will “substantially assist” the collection of intelligence. The test requires, however, that this satisfaction focus on ""a matter (the security matter) that is important in relation to security"". The very language suggests not merely the width of the section, and the importance and high standard of the test, but further that the security matter itself may well be a matter, if revealed, that might pose a threat in relation to security, within the broad meaning of s 4 of the definition.  
     
      
    49 The next matter to note is that sub-ss (3) and (4) of s 25, contain first, the statutory command as to what is to appear in the warrant, and, secondly, those matters then that may consequently be specified in the warrant.  
     
      
       
        
        The ""command"", as I have called it, is in these terms: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “(3) The warrant must be signed by the Minister and must authorise the Organisation to do specified things, subject to any restrictions or conditions specified in the warrant, in relation to the subject premises, which must also be specified in the warrant.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    50 By way of contrast, subs (4) confers on the Minister a discretion to select from the things that may be specified in the section, those that he considers ""appropriate in the circumstances"". There then follows the list of matters set out earlier in this decision. Importantly, there is no requirement to specify in precise terminology the nature of ""the security matter that is important in relation to security"" that has led to the issue of the warrant. Sub-section 4(e) is also important because it gives the Minister the power to specify in the warrant ""any thing reasonably necessary to conceal the fact that any thing has been done under the warrant"". The ability to specify this matter lends support to the proposition that there is no requirement to specify in the warrant itself the precise nature of the security matter that has led to the issue of the warrant, and in connection with the collection of intelligence, is necessary to substantially assist security.  
     
      
    51 Sections 4(a) and 5 of s 25 contain a list of other ""things"" that may be specified in a warrant.  
     
      
    52 Sub-sections (7), (8), (9) and (10) deal with the authorisation of entry, the commencement of a warrant period, and its duration. 
     
      
    53 Other sections of the Act provide guidance to the scheme of the Act as a whole. They also provide assistance in understanding the matters to be specified when a s 25 search warrant is issued. I have already referred to s 18 which is a very important section. Other sections may be mentioned. Section 25A is based largely on the s 25 scheme. It deals, however, with computer access warrants. The statutory test for issue is identical, as are the list of things that must or may be specified in warrant.  
     
      
    54 Section 26 enables the Minister to issue a Listening Device warrant. The language of s 26(3),(4) and (5) does not suggest that the “intelligence relevant to security” mentioned there needs to be disclosed in the warrant. Moreover, the statutory test for the issue of a Listening Device warrant is at a lower threshold than that provided for in s 25(2). The same comments may be made in relation to tracking devices for persons or target objects (ss 26B and 26C), and the issue of warrants for inspection of postal or delivery service articles (ss 27 and 27AA). 
     
      
    55 It may be inferred that the primary reason why ss 25 and 25A pose a threshold test that requires satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds for believing that access to records on the subject premises will substantially assist the collection of intelligence in respect of “a matter (the security matter) that is important in relation to security” is that the warrant does reflect a considerable invasion of property and privacy. In addition, the “subject premises” may not be the home or office of a person who is suspected of committing, for example, a terrorist offence. But there must be, before issue, reasonable grounds for belief that records of the relevant kind are located there. The test for issue is stringent, but, by way of contrast, the section does not require that the “security matter” be precisely identified in the warrant. 
     
      
    56 On the other hand, the Listening Device warrants, to take an example by way of comparison, require only that the Minister, before issue, be satisfied that the warrant “is likely to assist the organisation by carrying out its functions of obtaining intelligence relevant to security”. Of course, the Minister must also be satisfied in terms of the section that the person against whom the warrant is directed is, for example, “engaged in …activities prejudicial to security”. 
     
      
    57 Listening Device warrants also reflect a significant invasion of privacy, but here, as well, there is no requirement that the matter specified in the warrant must identify the precise nature of the activities prejudicial to security. Nor is there a requirement to specify in the warrant the nature of the intelligence to be obtained, or the identification of the security matter to be addressed by the likely range of intelligence sought to be captured by the listening device. 
     
      
    58 Finally, mention may be made of special warrants issued in an emergency situation (s 29), the obligation to destroy certain records obtained under a warrant (s 31) and the requirement that the Director-General furnish to the Minister in respect of each warrant issued under the Division a report in writing on the extent to which the action taken under the warrant has assisted the Organisation in carrying out its functions (s 34). (The last section was referred to in argument as ""a safeguard"". It clearly has that role to play, but it will be seen that it has a broader role in enabling the Minister to assess the utility and functionality of each warrant he has issued, having in mind no doubt the stringent test he has applied, as required by the statute, in determining to issue the warrant or warrants in the first place.)  
     
      
    59 The foregoing analysis demonstrates that the ASIO Act represents a very special statutory framework. Section 25 of the Act contrasts markedly with statutes enabling search warrants to issue for the purposes of investigation into criminal offences. The legislation as a whole highlights the very different nature of a search warrant issued for intelligence gathering purposes, related as it is, to the protection of a substantial aspect of national security.  
     
      
    60 It is now necessary to turn to the warrant itself. The particular warrant relates to premises at Condell Park. The purpose of this part of the analysis is to examine the complaints made by Mr Lange and to determine whether those complaints justify a conclusion that the warrant has been issued otherwise than in accordance with the statute. The two complaints are themselves quite specific. First, the ""security matter"" is not defined or specified in the search warrant. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, there was no limitation in the warrant going to the subject matter of the search. (Carbone v National Crime Authority (1994) FCR 516 at 522F, 524G). 
     
      
    61 As to the first complaint, it is clear from the form of the warrant that the Minister has stated his satisfaction that there are reasonable grounds for his satisfaction that the warrant should issue in terms of s 25. The Minister identifies a matter ""a security matter"" that is important in relation to security, but he does not say what it is. In my opinion, the legislation does not oblige him to reveal the precise nature of the security matter. This, for reasons I will explain, is critical to the rejection of both Mr Lange's arguments.  
     
      
    62 First, the precise nature of the security matter is not one of the ""things"" that either ""must"" or ""may"" be specified pursuant to the terms of sub-ss (3), (4), (4)(a) or (5). Secondly, there are clear reasons, related to the protection of national security, why the precise nature of the security matter should not be revealed on the face of the warrant. It is obvious that such a precise statement may, in many cases, be injurious or even destructive of national security. At the very least, it would or could thwart or hinder the effective gathering of intelligence. (See again, the provisions of s 18 of the ASIO Act). Further, the fact that the Minister may specify matters to conceal the fact that anything has been done under the warrant, lends support to the proposition that the security matter itself does not have to be revealed on the face of the warrant. Finally, having regard to the terminology of s 25 and the purposes of the entire legislation represented by the ASIO Act 1979, such a result or view of the section is both permitted and dictated. This interpretation is perfectly understandable, and completely in conformity with every aspect of the legislation. The consequence of this finding has ramifications for Mr Lange's second argument. I turn to it now.  
     
      
    63 Once it is accepted that the security matter does not have to be precisely specified in the warrant, it must follow that the description of the objects that are to be searched for, as being records et cetera ""relevant to the security matter"", is permissible and does not represent a description invalidating the warrant. That this is permissible appears also from the terminology of ss 4(b) and 5(a). This interpretation is aided, not hindered, by the text of s 25A dealing with computer access warrants. Mr Lange's argument pointed to different terminology where it appears in s 26(3)(b). Counsel argued that the change in terminology supported his argument generally. The particular provision in s 26(3)(b) enables the Minister to issue a listening device warrant where, inter alia, the Minister is satisfied that the use by ASIO of a listening device would be, or be likely to, assist ASIO ""in carrying out its function of obtaining intelligence relevant to security"". While it is true that this phrase is more general than that appearing in s 25, I do not consider that it takes Mr Lange's argument any further. The more specific reference in s 25 is, nevertheless, a general reference. It does not require a precise statement in the warrant beyond that which has been used here.  
     
      
    64 The consequence of the view I have formed in relation to Mr Lange's first argument means, however, that the objects of the search are in fact specified in the warrant. While it is true that the specification is fixed on ""the security matter"" which itself is not precisely identified, nevertheless the records (and other items) which are to be searched for are precisely identified by reference to ""the security matter"". If this be the intention of legislature, as I perceive it to be, the consequences asserted by Mr Lange are in fact inconsequential for validity purposes. 
     
      
    65 Mr Lange has argued that the search is to be conducted in accordance with a completely unfettered discretion on the part of the searching officer. Is this so? I do not consider it is. First, as I have said, the objects to be searched for are specifically related to ""the security matter"" mentioned in that part of the warrant where the Minister states his satisfaction. The phrase is carried through to encompass the objects of the search in the body of the warrant. Secondly, the Act itself contains a very specific authority-giving section, whereby only those officers, employees and other persons nominated and approved by the Director-General may exercise, on ASIO's behalf, the authority conferred by a warrant or warrants (s 24(1) and (2).) The latter sub-section states: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The authority conferred by a relevant warrant or relevant device recovery provision may be exercised on behalf of the Organisation only by the Director-General or an officer, employee or other person approved under subs (1).” 
        
       
      
    66 This section not only limits the identity of those who may be chosen to execute a warrant. It highlights the fact that they are handpicked by the Director-General or his delegate for that precise purpose. It is to be assumed that those persons who are authorised to conduct the search will, subject to the prohibitions in s 18 (relating to the unlawful communication of intelligence), be well aware of the precise nature of the security matter that is at the heart of the warrant.  
     
      
    67 It is true, however, that the occupier of the premises will not, from the face of the warrant, know the nature of the security matter. It is true that a Court exercising a supervisory role over the manner of the search will not know the precise nature of the security matter, until he or she is informed by appropriate confidential means of its nature. These consequences appear to me to be part and parcel of the intention of the legislature. I consider that they are fairly spelt out from the terms of s 25 in the light of the legislation as a whole. Matters of the kind relied on by Mr Lange would have been, at the time of Entick's case, sufficient to bring down a warrant at common law. But 250 years have passed since that time, and it must now be accepted that, in appropriate circumstances, Parliament has the power to curtail the content of warrants where it considers that it is appropriate to do so. In my view, the intention of Parliament, as appearing in the ASIO Act 1979, permits the warrant to stand in the form appearing in Exhibit “A”. The contents of the warrant precisely accord with the terms of s 25 of the ASIO Act 1979. The legislature, taken as a whole, permits that situation without raising the prospect of invalidity.  
     
      
    68 In these circumstances, I decline to order that the warrants in Exhibit “A” be quashed. I also order that the notice of motion 4 July 2008 be dismissed.

    1 HIS HONOUR: On 28 May 2008 I gave a preliminary decision (R v Baladjam [No 19] in relation to the defence application to exclude ""Melbourne evidence""). This was an application that had been brought principally by Mr Dalton SC on behalf of Mr Elomar, although it was supported by Ms Yehia, Mr Buscombe and Mr Waterstreet on behalf of their clients. Overall, it was supported by all accused.  
     
      
    2 In the ultimate, I allowed much of the Melbourne evidence, although I considered that, at trial, pseudonyms might be used to avoid prejudice and directions might be given to limit the use of certain aspects of the evidence where that course was warranted.  
     
      
    3 During the course of the application, there had been an important preliminary argument raised by Mr Dalton. Senior counsel argued that evidence of a statement or act by one person could not be admitted against the accused generally to prove the existence and nature of the conspiracy unless that evidence was itself evidence of a statement or act done pursuant to the conspiracy, or at least in connection with it. Mr Dalton had argued that this conclusion emerged from a consideration of ss 57(2) and 76(1)(c) of the Evidence Act 1995. A number of the conversations scrutinised for that purpose of the argument involved statements by one Benbrika, a Melbourne man, who was not alleged to be a co-conspirator in relation to the conspiracy charged against the present defendants.  
     
      
    4 As my judgment makes clear, I was unable to agree with the submissions advanced by Mr Dalton in relation to his preliminary point. It will be helpful to reproduce in this decision some parts of my earlier decision. I set out below paras 107 to 114 of that decision.  
     
      
    5 Paragraphs 107-114 of R v Baladjam [No 19]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The correct starting point is to examine the evidence to determine whether, if it were accepted, it could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding. The test of relevance will extend not only to the elements of the offence in the light of the plea but to facts that are themselves relevant to the facts in issue. ( 
        Smith v The Queen 
         [2001] 206 CLR 650 at (6) per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ). This test is often best approached by seeking to identify the purpose for which the tender is sought by the Crown, or the basis on which the Crown says it will advance the Crown case. The Crown wishes to tender evidence of the conversation as relevant to prove the existence and nature of the conspiracy, and as relevant to the accuseds’ intention in undertaking activities in furtherance of the conspiracy. The Crown wishes to argue that these activities took place in the context of the accused generally receiving advice and inspiration from Benbrika, he being a person who supported and promoted violent jihad as part of his preachings in relation to the theology of Islam.  
        
       
       
        
        Further, the Crown argues that these activities were undertaken in the context where there was a sharing between Benbrika, and others who reflected his view, of religious material, excluding extremist material. Indeed, the Crown will endeavour to prove that, at least in one instance, there was a sharing of information contained in instructional material held by one of the Melbourne group. Importantly, part of the context, according to the Crown case, is that there is evidence of actual facilitation where some of the Melbourne group assisted the Sydney group in relation to attempts to obtain large quantities of laboratory equipment. Finally, the Crown case is that, if it be the defence position that the various actions alleged to be in furtherance of the conspiracy were actions taken on an innocent basis, the Melbourne evidence (including the conversation) is relevant to rebut this as a hypothesis consistent with innocence, and relevant to support the position contended for by the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        Applying the  
        Evidence Act 
         test of relevance to the conversation, in the light of the manner in which the Crown will contend that the Melbourne evidence generally may be used in the trial, it will be seen that it is the relationship itself between Benbrika and the accused that brings about a situation where the conversation may properly be regarded as relevant. The relationship is one evidenced by the duration, frequency and content of the association between Benbrika and many of the accused on the other. It is that relationship, being one of religious and spiritual guidance, that makes relevant the fundamentalist attitudes expressed both publicly and privately by Benbrika. The relationship is one of spiritual guidance in connection with his views on the dictates of Islam. To Benbrika, jihad is a fundamental precept of his religion. This he makes clear in the interview in the 7.30 Report on the ABC in August 2005. He is an admirer and supported of Osama bin Laden. He does not tolerate other religions. Benbrika is what sections of the media have loosely described as “a fire brand cleric”. Tacitly, he appears to approve of the September 11 destruction of the Twin Towers and the loss of American civilian lives. He is reluctant to ascribe blame to Al-Quaeda, but if they were the perpetrators, their actions were justified. 
        
       
       
        
        It is clear that the relationship does not prove by itself the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. Nor does the conversation. The conversation, and indeed, the relationship, are but part of an overall circumstantial case that includes the actions of the Sydney accused themselves in ordering laboratory equipment, ammunition and other materials arguably connected with preparation for a terrorist act or acts. It includes as well their possession of extremist material supporting jihad. The nature of the association, in my opinion, is relevant as a circumstantial fact, in proof of the existence and scope of the conspiracy. The accused are men with strong religious views about their faith. They hold strong views about events relating to Muslims in the Middle East and elsewhere. They are disconcerted by the attention paid to them by police and other authorities. They look to Benbrika as a religious leader.  
        
       
       
        
        The conversation may also be relevant (although I make no decision at this stage) as part of an act done in furtherance of the conspiracy. The conversation, after all, occurred as part of a wider discussion, which included aspects of religious guidance in the context of Islamic history. It occurred in the context of references to Islamic history including military action, warfare and martyrdom. It included the discussions referrable to a plan to organise an order for the supply to the Sydney accused of a large volume of laboratory equipment. The ordering of the laboratory equipment is alleged by the Crown to be an overt act within the conspiracy. Indeed, the general relevance of evidence relating to that act (including discussion about it) is, subject to some arguments about exclusion under s 137, not seriously put in issue by the accused. Whether the conversation might be relevant in this further way, I shall put to one side. The application of the co-conspirator’s rule will normally be considered at the close of the Crown case. 
        
       
       
        
        I return, however, to the primary basis on which the evidence of the conversation is sought to be adduced by the Crown. It is, as I have said, in the context of the relationship between Benbrika and the Sydney accused. It is in the context of his providing spiritual guidance over an extended period of time. The fact that the spiritual guidance is, on a number of occasions, focused on guidance about religious matters that do not extend to the waging of jihad is beside the point. It is the nature of the relationship that makes the evidence of Benbrika’s public and private espousal of violent jihad relevant to the facts in issue, and especially to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. 
        
       
       
        
        The conversation is not an admission by Sharrouf, Hasan or anyone else present on the February occasion. In so far as the evidence might be capable of reflecting on the state of mind of Hasan and Sharrouf, it is not tendered at this stage as an admission against them or, for that matter, against any of the other men. As to the state of mind of Sharrouf and Hasan, it is no more than a piece of circumstantial evidence. Indeed, as presently minded, I would think that the admission of the evidence might properly be accompanied by a direction indicating that it is not to be relied upon as an admission and that it is not being tendered for any hearsay purpose. If s 60 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         requires that a limitation be imposed on the tender of the evidence, that can be achieved pursuant to s 136 of the  
        Evidence Act 
        . The question of directions, however, is essentially one for the future. I intend to indicate no more than that directions of the kinds I have in have mentioned (and others as well) may well be appropriate when further consideration is given to the issue.  
        
       
       
        
        For the moment, I am content to state that, in my opinion, the evidence is at least relevant as going to proof of the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy in the way I have indicated. It needs to be borne in mind that the essential nature of the Crown case suggests that Benbrika, Joud (and perhaps others in Melbourne) were facilitators, in a general sense, of the objects of the Sydney conspiracy. One aspect of Benbrika’s position was to facilitate it especially by the provision of a wide range of spiritual guidance and inspiration. The Melbourne men provided material to the Sydney group and, at least in one instance, it is to be inferred, they provided or passed on instructional material or information (the Joud material) to them. The Crown case, as I have said, suggests that an appropriate inference may be drawn from Benbrika’s many communications with Sharrouf, his visits to Sydney, their visits to him, his giving of sermons and religious instructions (both publicly and privately) to them, that his extremist views were of value to the Sydney conspiracy. In this latter regard, the Crown case, in connection with the Melbourne men, likens the identified aspects of the Melbourne link to the extremist and instructional material found and seized from the Sydney men themselves. In that sense, it is material which points, at least, to the existence of the alleged conspiracy but particularly to its connection with violent extremism and violent jihad. The conversation presently under discussion fits into that category.” 
        
       
       
       
       
      Mr Dalton's present submissions 
       
      
    6 Essentially, Mr Dalton has made two submissions in the present application. These are:  
     
      
       
      (a) This Court ought to reconsider its analysis of legal principle in  
      R v Baladjam [No 19] 
       and, as a result, accept and apply the defence interpretation of the law (rejected in that judgment) to both the ""Melbourne material"" and to the conversations under challenge in the present application; or 
       
       
      (b) in the alternative, the Court should hold the conversations now under consideration in the present application should be distinguished from the ""Melbourne material"" on the basis that the ""Melbourne material"" was relevant to the existence and scope of the conspiracy because it related to the obtaining of spiritual guidance and inspiration. Further, a distinction might appropriately be made, in that the material in the present application generally falls within the description of an “admission” within the meaning of the  
      Evidence Act 
        
      1995 
       ( 
      R v Horton  
      (1998) A Crim R 306).  
       
      
    7 Mr Dalton (and the other legal representatives) have gone to considerable trouble to prepare three large folders of evidence. The first is described as annexure 1 (Exhibit “A”). Generally, it contains a broad range of conversations involving one or more of the accused (and sometimes other persons). These are, generally speaking, taken from the Crown case statement. Annexure 2 (Exhibit “B”) is a large folder containing material generally not found in the Crown case statement, but reflecting the product of listening device material. The third folder, annexure 3 (Exhibit “C”) relates to computer content and other material allegedly found in the possession of the accused. It will be the subject of later separate submissions and does not require specific attention at this stage. 
     
      
    8 Ms Yehia for Mr Hasan provided the Court with an additional folder (Exhibit “D”). It contains product that the Crown propose to rely on at trial, although there is some overlapping between Mr Dalton's material and that contained in Exhibit “D”. Counsel for other accused have either provided me with similar material, or have indicated that, in due course, there will be applications to exclude particular pieces of evidence appearing in the folders or elsewhere in the Crown brief material. 
     
      
    9 As I understand it, it is the joint application of all counsel to support Mr Dalton's preliminary point argument, as modified and enlarged by his submissions on the present application. In addition, there will be arguments from individual counsel to suggest that particular conversations are not admissible, or that they should be excluded under s 137.  
     
      
    10 The purpose of this present decision is to identify Mr Dalton's overall preliminary point and to adjudicate upon its validity or otherwise. This will leave for future discussion or decision any individual arguments about particular conversations, both as to their admissibility and/or exclusion. 
     
      
       
      Mr Dalton's preliminary point - Identification of the Issue 
       
      
    11 It may be helpful if I set out at this point several of the actual conversations sought to be relied upon by the Crown at trial. Those conversations will, I think, give content to Mr Dalton's argument and to the Crown's response. Several illustrations will suffice to make the point. The first appears at paragraph 29 of the Crown case statement (CCS). On 24 October 2004 at 5.50pm, a conversation involving Moustafa Cheikho and another person was recorded on a listening device. At the time it appears they were watching videos or material on the Internet. There was speculation as to who was responsible for the atrocities of September 11, 2001. During this conversation, Moustafa Cheikho said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, when they came, when they came and took my computer, guess what? It was a screen saver, the American flag, the Jewish flag with Twin Towers in the background being burnt.” 
        
       
      
    12 And later: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Male: 
         What bomb is it? 
        
       
       
        
        MC: 
         There's these American poofs man. ...it kills man when I see what they do to kids man. 
        
       
       
        
        Male: 
         Shanker, you like this kind of stuff man? 
        
       
       
        
        MC: 
         Come see this man. Come see this...remember this one there? They blew up a car and this was an American in it. They tied him up to the car and they drove around the whole of Falluja, and they kicking him and bashing him.” 
         
        
       
      
    13 And later: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        MC: 
         You know if they're training...and you die while you were training, you die a martyr.” 
        
       
      
    14 And later: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        MC: 
         God willing next week when they capture these Australians so they can chop their heads off.” 
        
       
      
    15 The Crown alleges that the accused Touma was present during this conversation.  
     
      
    16 On 20 November 2004 at 11.59am there was a telephone conversation between Moustafa Cheikho and another person during which George Bush and Condoleezza Rice were discussed. Moustafa Cheikho said, when told that Condoleezza Rice was in hospital: 
     
      
       
        
        “She's in hospital? God is the greatest...good, God willing they all die. God willing they don't man, God willing they'll die from the mujahideen. Just like that grab every single one of them, just like that they're killed with style.” 
        
       
      
    17 Another example relates to a telephone conversation on 1 April 2005. There was a telephone conversation between Khaled Sharrouf and Moustafa Cheikho. During this, the participants discussed burning CDs, which depicted ""slaughtering"" in Iraq. Later that day at 4.55pm, there was a telephone conversation between the two men during which Sharrouf warned Cheikho not to drive because ""there are pigs outside, I saw them now"".  
     
      
    18 A final example relates to a telephone conversation between Sharrouf and another person during which there was a discussion about a television program on terrorism. This happened on 21 October 2004 at 7.11pm. Sharrouf said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Let the people accept that we're this but we're doing it for a proper cause, you know.” 
        
       
      
    19 It will be seen that each of these examples involves a statement by one accused to another, or to another person. Mr Dalton accepted that these individual statements might be admissible against the particular person who uttered them as an admission. Provided that they were relevant, and not otherwise excluded, they might be brought into evidence in this way, but admissible only against the person who made the statement. Mr Dalton argued that the statements could not be admitted as evidence against the other accused as evidence going to the proof of the existence and scope of the conspiracy. Mr Dalton argued that, if the evidence were used in this way (as the Crown submitted it should be, and as my earlier judgment suggested it could be) that this would circumvent the scope of the hearsay rule and erode the protections otherwise afforded by the provisions of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    20 Why is this so? Because, Mr Dalton argued, the statements do not answer the description in s 87(1)(c). This section is concerned with determining whether a previous representation made by a person may also be ""taken to be an admission by a party"". The Court is to admit the representation if it is reasonably open to find that the representation was made by the first person “in furtherance of a common purpose that the person had with the party, or one or more persons including the party”. (See my discussion in R v Baladjam [No 19] at paras 71 to 86.) The conversations could not, Mr Dalton said, be described in this way. 
     
      
    21 Mr Dalton's point is similar to that he argued in the earlier matter. It focuses, however, in a more precise fashion on two particular aspects. They are:  
     
      
       
      (a) the wide definition of ""admission"" and its component parts in the  
      Evidence Act 
       Dictionary; and 
       
       
      (b) the ""protection” afforded to parties in a conspiracy case by virtue of the terms of s 87(1)(c). In particular, the protection is said to be a limitation against statements by one conspirator (admissions) being used as evidence of admissions by another, unless the statements be in furtherance of, or pursuant to the conspiracy.  
       
      
    22 As to the first aspect, the definition of ""admission"" and its components is contained in my earlier decision at paras 81 and 82. I will not repeat them here. Mr Dalton's point is, however, that an admission ""is not confined to a confession"" - the expression is wide enough to capture an out of court statement (""a previous representation"") made by a defendant in a criminal proceeding where it is one that is adverse to that person's interest in the outcome of the proceedings (R v Horton; R v Esposito (1998) 45 NSWLR 442). 
     
      
    23 The first aspect, Mr Dalton argued, gave considerable illumination to the second. Thus, the “protection” afforded by s 87(1)(c) could be identified in the following way: Where a previous representation made by one person could reasonably be found to be made by that person ""in furtherance of a common purpose"" with a number of other persons, including the defendant, it could be admitted into evidence as an admission by that defendant. In terms of the section, it could be used, not only as an admission against the first person, if he were a party to the proceeding, but it could ""also be taken to be an admission"" by the other defendant.  
     
      
    24 But, Mr Dalton argued, the real thrust of s 87(1)(c), its true ambit of protection, lay in the proposition he next enunciated. Mr Dalton argued that, if the representation were not one done or uttered ""in furtherance of the common purpose"", it could not be admitted against the other defendant or defendants in the trial.  
     
      
    25 It may be helpful if I set out here the following paragraphs from Mr Dalton's written submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “17. Simply to assert evidence is being used to prove the existence and scope of a conspiracy cannot be used as a tool to circumvent the hearsay rules when obviously the line of reasoning involved in the use of that evidence demonstrates the representation is being used to achieve this end by seeking to prove the fact intended to be asserted in that statement by the maker. 
        
       
       
        
        18. In reality, when all pretext is peeled away, the evidence is really being sought to be used as an admission, firstly, against Sharrouf and then as an admission against the other alleged co-conspirators.” 
        
       
      
    26 (In these paragraphs, Mr Dalton was dealing with the final illustration I gave above, namely, the statement by Mr Sharrouf on 21 October 2004.) 
     
      
    27 The written submissions continue: 
     
      
       
        
        “Subject as said to consideration of s 137 the statement would appear available as exception to the hearsay rules by way of admission pursuant to s 81, given it is a previous representation made by a person who is a party, adverse to that person's interest in the outcome of the proceeding; adverse because it suggests Sharrouf is saying he and the others are deliberately involved in terrorist activities and they believe they are doing so for a legitimate purpose. This, it would seem, is available against Sharrouf to help prove the existence of the conspiracy, the participation of Sharrouf and others, and that they are involved with a deliberate intent for what they believe is a legitimate purpose consistent with the Crown case.  
        For it thereafter to be admissible against the others, s 87(1)(c) must be satisfied 
        . (My emphasis).” 
        
       
      
    28 Mr Dalton made two further points. First, even if the Crown purported to have the evidence admitted as limited simply to the existence and scope of the conspiracy, such statements would in any event be admissions (within the meaning of the Evidence Act) and accordingly could not be admitted against the co-accused except in accordance with s 87(1)(c). Since, in the main, such statements could not be said to be ""in furtherance of a common purpose"", they could not be admitted in terms of the relevant section. Secondly, Mr Dalton argued that the statements were not relevant as to the existence and scope of the conspiracy in any event. The mere expression of extremist views or sympathies would not show the existence and scope of the conspiracy. (This submission was by no means consistent with the written submission referred to in para 27 above). What in reality would be occurring, counsel argued, is that the evidence would be being used as a de facto admission against those present and, by the extension of their alleged association through the period charged, an admission against everyone else as to their like intent (paras 24 and 27 of the written submissions). 
     
      
       
      Crown response 
       
      
    29 In the course of its submissions, the Crown examined in detail, by way of illustration, a number of the of conversations set out in this decision. The first basis upon which each statement is to be led is that it is admissible, together with other evidence, as circumstantial evidence to prove the nature and scope of the conspiracy. In that regard, the Crown submitted the evidence was not tendered for a hearsay purpose and was admissible against all accused. The Crown accepted that, if ultimately the Crown were unable to prove the participation of individual defendants in the alleged conspiracy, the evidence would fall by the wayside, so far as that particular accused is concerned. Indeed, if the Crown could not satisfy the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the alleged conspiracy existed and was in place, the Crown case would fail. The Crown qualified its principal submission by suggesting that some of the statements may, in the ultimate, be admissible on a further basis, namely to prove the participation of all the accused in the conspiracy, that is, as representations made in furtherance of the conspiracy. The appropriate time for the determination of that question, however, would be at the conclusion of the Crown case.  
     
      
    30 Secondly, the Crown examined each statement as to whether, and on what basis, it would be admissible against the person who made the statement. For example, the statement by Moustafa Cheikho - ""you know if they're training...and you die while you were training, you die a martyr"". The Crown said that this statement would be admissible against Moustafa Cheikho, not to prove the truth of the statement, but as evidence of his state of mind. For that reason, the Crown submitted that the statement was not caught by the hearsay rule in s 59, it was precisely permitted by s 72 and, although it arguably might fall within the description of a previous representation, it was not tendered for a hearsay purpose, and was accordingly admissible, in any event, under s 60 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    31 The Crown took a second example, the reference by Moustafa Cheikho on 24 October 2004, to the description of an American who was tied up to a car and then driven around Falluja while being beaten and assaulted. Once again, the Crown submitted that this was both relevant and admissible as reflecting upon Moustafa Cheikho's state of mind. It was not intended as a hearsay statement to prove that the event occurred. It was simply tendered to show the approval of the speaker to the situation described in the evidence. It was relevant to an attitude or state of mind that was itself relevant to the proof of the ingredients of the offence, as against that accused. More precisely, it was relevant as a circumstantial fact going to Cheikho’s state of mind which, together with other evidence, would tend to demonstrate he had, when carrying out or being involved in overt acts pursuant to the conspiracy, the intention or intentions necessary to prove the offence against him. 
     
      
    32 Finally, the Crown referred to the illustration where Khaled Sharrouf had warned Moustafa Cheikho not to drive because ""there are pigs outside, I saw them now"". The Crown submitted that this was relevant, on the secondary basis, to show the state of mind of both Sharrouf and Cheikho in relation to the need to counter diligent surveillance by the authorities. It would not be tendered to show there were police outside, nor to show that Sharrouf had seen them. Rather, it would be tendered against Sharrouf and the other man simply to show his or their state of mind. As to the first basis of the tender, together with other evidence, it would be relevant as circumstantial evidence, and admissible against all conspirators because of its capacity to reflect upon the existence and scope of the conspiracy. It was capable of reflecting upon the existence of the conspiracy because, taken together with other evidence, it showed a need to be wary of surveillance by the authorities. It also had the capacity to reflect upon the scope of the conspiracy because counter-surveillance was, according to many aspects of the Crown case, a fundamental and integral part of the agreement between the nine men. (See R v Baladjam [No 4] at [16]). 
     
      
    33 Overall, the Crown submitted that the provisions of the Evidence Act relied upon by Mr Dalton did not, in any significant way, change the existing law. Further, they did not qualify or modify the Ahern principles. (Ahern v The Queen (1988) 165 CLR 87). 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    34 In R v Baladjam [No 19], I set out and discussed at considerable length a number of the recent authorities in relation to the admission of evidence in a criminal conspiracy case. The leading principles were essentially derived from Ahern v The Queen. It may be helpful if I summarise the principles as follows:  
     
      
       
      1. In conspiracy cases a clear distinction is to be made between the existence of a conspiracy and the participation of each of the alleged conspirators in it.  
       
       
      2. The fact of the agreement to engage in a common enterprise can seldom be proved by direct evidence and must, in almost all cases, be proved as a matter of inference from other facts, that is to say, by circumstantial evidence. 
       
       
      3. For this purpose, evidence may be led which includes the acts or declarations of one alleged conspirator made outside the presence of the others, provided such evidence is not led to prove against the others the truth of any assertion or implied assertion made by the actor or the maker of the statement. It may take the form of evidence of separate acts or utterances from which the fact of combination might be inferred. Led in that way, it is not hearsay and is not dependent upon some circumstance to take it outside the hearsay rule. 
       
       
      4. If a combination be proved, there are then circumstances in which evidence of the acts and declaration of other participants, outside the presence of the individual, may be led against him, not of separate facts from which, when combined with other facts an inference of combination may be drawn, but as evidence of his own participation.  
       
       
      5. Evidence of the acts or declarations of others led for this purpose will be led to prove the truth of the assertion or implied assertion contained in those acts or declaration.  
       
       
      6. Led in this (second) way the evidence will not be excluded as hearsay. This is because of the co-conspirators' rule.  
       
       
      7. The co-conspirators' rule states that when two or more persons are bound together in the pursuit of an unlawful object, anything said, done or written by one in furtherance of the common purpose is admissible in evidence against the others. The combination implies an authority in each to act or speak on behalf of the others. The analogy is that of partnership. 
       
      
    35 These, then, are relevantly for present purposes, the Ahern principles. It was on the basis of those principles that the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Masters, Richards and Wunderlich made its statements in 1992. I have set them out in full at paragraphs 51 to 53 of my earlier decision. The passage at page 460G of the decision,, however, bears repetition in relation to the present discussion. There, it will be recalled, the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In conspiracy cases, the Crown must establish both the existence of the conspiracy and the participation of each particular accused in that conspiracy; there is a clear distinction to be made in relation to the admissibility of evidence to establish each of those two issues:  
        Ahern v the Queen 
         (1988) 165 CLR 87 at 93. That distinction becomes of special importance where the conspiracy is alleged to have been between the accused and persons not standing trial with them. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to establish the existence of the conspiracy, evidence is admissible of acts done or statements made by persons other than the particular accused even if he were not present - not (so far as the statements are concerned) to prove the truth of what was said, but in order to establish from the fact that the acts were done or the statements were made, the inference that the agreement which constituted the conspiracy charged had been entered into...that evidence is direct evidence, not hearsay ( 
        Ahern v The Queen 
         at 93); and it is admissible for that purpose even if the acts were done or the statements were made before the particular accused joined or became a participant in that conspiracy, for it does not depend in any way upon any acknowledgment or acceptance of the truth by the accused of the statements so made. 
        
       
       
        
        In order to establish that the particular accused participated in that conspiracy, there must first be reasonable evidence of that participation - that is, evidence independent of those acts and statements by other persons - which is admissible in the ordinary way against that accused:  
        Ahern v The Queen 
         (at 100). Once the judge has decided that there is such reasonable evidence in the case against that accused...the acts and statements by other persons in the conspiracy will become admissible against that accused, not only as establishing the existence of the conspiracy, but also, if they were done or made in furtherance of the conspiracy, as establishing his participation in it:  
        Tripodi v The Queen 
         (1961) 104 CLR 1 at 67;  
        Ahern v The Queen 
         at 100, 103;  
        R v Davidovic 
         (1990) 51 A Crim R 197 at 201-202.  
        
       
       
        
        It has not always been made clear in the cases just what constitutes an act done or a statement made 'In furtherance of the conspiracy'. In  
        Tripodi v The Queen 
         (at 7), the distinction was drawn between such actions and statements and something said which is no more than a narrative statement or account of some event, which has already taken place. Statements made in furtherance of the conspiracy, it was said, will usually be 'Directions, instructions or arrangements or...utterances accompanying acts'. 
        
       
       
        
        The expression itself - 'made in furtherance of the conspiracy' - suggests to us that a distinction should also be drawn between those acts or statements which form the conspiracy itself (that is, the acts or statements by which the agreement was made) and those which are done or made subsequently in furtherance of, or in carrying out, that conspiracy once the agreement had been made. The reference in  
        Tripodi 
         to 'arrangements' was (we believe) intended to be arrangements made in order to carry out the conspiracy, not to the formation of the conspiracy itself. Such a distinction is not one, which will always be easy to make. It is certainly rare that there is direct evidence of the Acts or statements which themselves form the conspiracy.” 
        
       
      
    36 Before passing to a final evaluation of the preliminary point, I will briefly address the submission made by Mr Dalton concerning Horton's case. In that case the appellant Horton had been charged with murdering one Michael O'Hara Fitzgerald. The Crown's case was that Ms Horton had stabbed the deceased in the chest following a drunken disputation. A police officer attended the scene within minutes of the stabbing. He spoke to the victim, who was near death. The victim indicated that he had been stabbed by the appellant. The police officer then asked the appellant what had happened. She replied ""he fell on the knife"". The appellant was arrested and later charged. At trial the appellant gave evidence. She said she was a chronic alcoholic and she had been drinking heavily on the day, indeed the days, leading up to the death of the deceased. The thrust of her evidence was that she had no recall of events, and had been in any event unable to form a criminal intent, particularly in light of her intoxication through alcohol.  
     
      
    37 The trial judge had to determine whether to admit the appellant's statement ""He fell on the knife"" in response to the question ""What happened?"" The trial judge held that the answer given to Constable Evans was an ""admission"" within the meaning of s 424A of the Crimes Act. The problem was that, if it were properly categorised as an ""admission"" (equating to that expression as defined in the Evidence Act 1995,) it ought to have been excluded. This was, firstly, because the conversation had not been tape-recorded as required by the legislation. Secondly, and importantly, the appellant had not acknowledged in the course of an electronically recorded interview, following her arrest, that she had made an earlier admission in terms of the answer alleged to have been made at the scene of the stabbing.  
     
      
    38 The trial judge, however, had held that although an ""admission"" was involved, there was a reasonable excuse for the absence of any tape recording. He admitted the evidence, but did not limit its use under s 136 of the Evidence Act. The Court of Criminal Appeal held that if the statement were an ""admission"", the fact that there was a reasonable excuse for it not being taped in the first place would not have of itself permitted the tender of the evidence. This would have been because of the second procedural failure. This had the consequence that his Honour would have erred in law in admitting the evidence of the admission.  
     
      
    39 Against that background, Wood CJ at CL l, with whom Sully J and Ireland J agreed, held that the expression in the Crimes Act, in fact, equated to the definition in the Evidence Act. His Honour held that the broad definition of an ""admission"" in the Evidence Act included not only inculpatory, but extended to exculpatory statements that were relied upon as adverse to the defendant's interest. In the particular instance, the appellant's statement that ""he fell on the knife"" flew in the face of her statement that she was completely intoxicated, and was clearly a representation made that was adverse to her interests.  
     
      
    40 Mr Dalton SC (and in this regard he was supported by Mr Button SC) relied on Horton's case to argue that statements made by, for example, Moustafa Cheikho were previous representations ""adverse to the interests of"" Moustafa Cheikho. The Crown, however, had argued that the particular statements in the examples given were not tendered to prove the existence of any fact represented by the statements. Rather, they were simply statements evidencing a particular state of mind or intention. The Crown argued that, since the statements were not being tendered for a hearsay purpose on the first basis, and were not being tendered to prove anything other than the state of mind of the accused on the second basis, they did not constitute admissions for the purposes of the Evidence Act. 
     
      
    41 This is not an easy question to resolve. There are commentaries that highlight the continued uncertainty over the issue. At common law the position was that a statement made by a party, adverse to his or her interests, was admissible. If admitted, it was received in evidence as proof of the truth of the contents of the statement. It was then the function of the jury to decide whether it was an admission and to assess the weight to be given to it. 
     
      
    42 Section 81 of the Evidence Act makes an admission an exception to the hearsay and opinion rules. The Act defines an “admission” in the Dictionary. Both “representation” and “previous representation” are also defined. Are those definitions, however, to be read in the light of the hearsay rule, as expressed in s 59? The hearsay rule is itself expressed in quite narrow terms. It requires an answer to this question: is the representation tendered to prove the existence of a fact the person (party) intended (my emphasis) to assert? There is obviously a difference between the fact which the representing party intended to assert, and the inference as to that intention a tribunal fact would draw from the statement. 
     
      
    43 Horton’s case provides a good example of the conundrum. What did Ms Horton intend to assert as a fact when she said “He fell on the knife”. Arguably, it was not the fact that she was perfectly sober. That was an inference that the tribunal of fact might have drawn from the words she used, but that, as I say, is arguably a different matter. Viewed in that way, Ms Horton’s statement may not have been an admission within the meaning of s 81 of the Act. It might, more accurately, have been described as no more than an objective fact – the words she used – in proof of, or relevant to, her capacity to form an intent. 
     
      
    44 Two points in response may be made. First, the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Horton’s case is binding on me. That decision determined that Ms Horton’s remarks were an admission, even though they were exculpatory, and should have been excluded. Secondly, it might be argued, perhaps faintly, that the language of s 59 ought not be imported into the definition of “admission” and “previous representation”. Fortunately, at least for the present, I do not have to resolve this rather difficult question. It may emerge again, however, because it is not entirely clear to me that the Crown has altogether abandoned the use of the evidence as an admission. It may well have done so, in the light of the submissions referred to at paras 29-32 of this decision. I would not, however, require the Crown to make a final election on this point until this decision (and others related to the same point) have been available for reflection and consideration. 
     
      
    45 The Crown’s real response to the point is that s 87(1)(c) does not, in any event, do the work attributed to it by Mr Dalton’s preliminary point. Mr Dalton also urged me not to dwell, as it were, over-long in the shadowy realms of academic conjecture. For the purposes of the argument, I will, for the moment, assume the statements under discussion here are capable of being described as “admissions”. If Mr Dalton’s argument succeeds, so be it. He will have successfully persuaded the Court to limit the admission of statements that are not “in furtherance of a common purpose”. (I should add that Mr Dalton’s argument was essentially “once an admission, always an admission”. In Horton’s case, it might be observed, Wood CJ at CL contemplated that, had the trial judge limited the evidence under s 136, it would not have retained this character). If Mr Dalton’s primary argument, as to the meaning of s 87(1)(c) is not successful, however, it will be simply academic as to whether the statements are or are not capable of being viewed as “admissions”. The Crown’s ultimate decision as to how to use the statements, if they are permitted, is a separate matter. 
     
      
    46 I have given careful thought both to Mr Dalton's original submissions and to the written and oral submissions he has made on the present application. This consideration has not led me to alter the conclusion expressed in my earlier decision. It is a fundamental aspect of Mr Dalton's argument, although he did not express it in these terms, that s 87(1)(c) has “obliterated” the legitimacy of proving the fact of a conspiratorial agreement by the use of circumstantial evidence not tendered for a hearsay purpose. In my opinion, there is nothing in s 87(1)(c) which warrants this construction being given to the legislation.  
     
      
    47 In general terms, s 87 of the Evidence Act is dealing with ""admissions made with authority"". It appears in that part of the legislation dealing with admissions. It is concerned to widen, or at least to make certain, the scope of the admissions section to make admissible admissions properly made by one person on behalf of another. For example, s 87(1)(a) deals with the situation where it is open to find that a person had actual authority to bind another by admission. Section 87(1)(b) takes, by way of further example, the position of an employee, and it furthers the common law by enabling an admission by that person to be available against his employer, where it is reasonably open to find that the representation was within the scope of the person's employment.  
     
      
    48 Section 87(1)(c) encompasses the criminal charge of conspiracy but it is not, by any means, confined to that situation. It embraces admissions in the context of civil proceedings where a lawful common purpose is involved. It extends, however, to a criminal case where an unlawful common purpose is involved. Even so, the section, however, does not address in its terms that specific problem in conspiracy cases where the fact of combination is itself an essential ingredient of offence. It does not impact upon the resolution of the specific problem in conspiracy cases, arising from the fact that combination is an ingredient of the offence. This is an important aspect of Ahern's case: in a conspiracy charge, there must be independent proof of the fact that a particular person is connected with the conspiracy, and the Court must be reasonably satisfied about that matter before allowing the act or statement to be admissible as an act in furtherance against the others.  
     
      
    49 As I have said, this added requirement in a criminal conspiracy case is not dealt with at specifically in s 87(1)(c) of the Evidence Act. Nor is it dealt with in any other provision of the legislation. In the same way, s 87(1)(c) simply does not concern itself with the issue of evidence admissible against all the alleged conspirators, being evidence of a circumstantial kind directed to the establishment of the existence and scope of the conspiracy. The principles relating to the admission of such evidence were dealt with by the High Court in Ahern's case at page 93 and are reflected in propositions 1, 2 and 3 set out above. The Evidence Act, of course, allows for the reception of evidence as provisionally relevant in s 57(1). But that section does not otherwise touch on the admissibility or otherwise of evidence going to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. Importantly, for present purposes, s 87(1)(c) does not, in its terms, concern itself with this aspect of the evidence in a conspiracy case by requiring that evidence of this kind must be in furtherance of the conspiracy. The section, in fact, has nothing to say as to the admissibility or otherwise of circumstantial evidence tendered for a non-hearsay purpose to show the existence and scope of the conspiracy. The proposition that such evidence is admissible against all the conspirators remains completely untouched by s 87(1)(c).  
     
      
    50 This is so for at least three reasons. Firstly, as I have indicated earlier, the section is dealing with ""admissions"" (verbal or otherwise) made by one person in circumstances where they will be “taken to be” an admission by a defendant or defendants in criminal proceedings. The fundamental control point is that, in one sense or another, it must be reasonably open to find that the admitting party had authority to make the admission on behalf of the defendant or defendants. In the context of the criminal law, this fits neatly and precisely into the basis of admissibility discussed by the High Court in Ahern at page 94, and known generally as the co-conspirators' rule. The section has nothing to do with, and has nothing to say as to, the admissibility or otherwise of circumstantial evidence tendered on a non-hearsay basis in proof of the existence and scope of the conspiracy. Secondly, there is nothing in the language of the section (or for that matter in the ALRC reports) that would justify a conclusion that Parliament intended to obliterate the well established principles going to the admission of evidence limited to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. Thirdly, as I indicated at para 85 of my earlier decision, the Court of Criminal Appeal, in a decision binding upon me, has held that s 87(1)(c) reproduces the existing common law relating to representations made by co-conspirators in furtherance of a common purpose. (R v Macraild Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 December 1997 – BC 9707215). 
     
      
    51 After my decision had been reserved, Mr Dalton sent me further submissions on the 6 August 2008. These are quite lengthy and makes reference to a number of decisions in Australia and elsewhere. Neither the submissions nor the authorities lead me to change my view of the relevant law in relation to the evidence under discussion. I do not propose to address these matters at length, but will confine my remarks to the following. 
     
      
    52 First, the Canadian case of Guimond v R (1979) 44 CCC (2d) 181 is not really in point. It is concerned with the principles under pinning a decision for a separate trial in a conspiracy situation. The position where one of the conspirators has made a complete confession (evidence which is only admissible against him and not against the other) is so far removed from the present discussion as to be of no utility. Secondly, and by way of contrast, R v Dinh [2000] NSWCCA 536 is directly in point. It establishes the continued operation of the Ahern principles, post the introduction of the Evidence Act 1995. It also emphasises, when properly examined, that evidence of the kind here is admissible, in a limited way, as circumstantial evidence supporting the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. The activities of the other conspirators were held admissible against Mr Dinh although he did not join the conspiracy, or at least arguably had not so, until very late in the piece. Finally, Dinh’s case answers one of Mr Dalton’s arguments by emphasising that, in fact, there will be very few conspiracy trials where a separate trial is warranted. (Wood CJ at CL had ordered a separate trial for Dinh, but when the matter came before the second trial judge, Dunford J, he had a better appreciation of the evidence likely to be led at the trial, and concluded that Dinh should be jointly tried with the others). 
     
      
    53 Thirdly, the real point where Mr Dalton and I part company on this issue is in relation to his continued insistence that the evidence in question here is properly described as evidence of a confessional nature (admissions). In my opinion, it is not, and it is not tendered for that purpose either against the other conspirators on the first basis, or against the individual, on the second. It is true that the Crown intend to use the evidence as evidence going to the state of mind of the individual accused, but it is not evidence of the truth of any of the statements he or others have made. More significantly, it is not to be used against the other conspirators, otherwise than for a non-hearsay purpose. 
     
      
    54 With all due respect, I would conclude that Mr Dalton, in his arguments, has simply failed to accept and recognise to the distinction drawn in Ahern between evidence going to the existence and scope of the conspiracy and, by way of contrast, evidence of acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy. 
     
      
    55 Finally, Mr Dalton attempted to argue from an analysis of R v Masters, that his principal proposition had some validity. This was somewhat at odds with his original submissions where he had argued that Masters had, in effect, been “altered” by the provisions of the Evidence Act. In any event, I have made a careful analysis of Masters’ case in my earlier decision. There is nothing in Mr Dalton’s submission that leads me to alter the conclusions I drew and expressed in that earlier decision. Section 87(1)(c) simply does not create or extend the “protection” that is at the heart of Mr Dalton’s argument. 
     
      
       
      The specific conversations 
       
      
    56 I do not propose to address each of the examples set out earlier in this judgment in any detail. It will be sufficient to analyse two of them to make the points necessary to establish my view of the admissibility of the evidence.  
     
      
    57 The first, for convenience's sake, will be once again the conversation involving Moustafa Cheikho and another person (in the presence of Touma) on 24 October 2004. In my view, the observation made by Moustafa Cheikho regarding training and dying while training as a martyr is admissible as against all the accused. It is admissible as a piece of circumstantial evidence, which together with many other facets of the evidence in the Crown case, is relevant to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. It is relevant in this way to shed light on whether there was a combination of some kind between the men and, if so, the nature of that combination. Secondly, it is admissible to show the state of mind of Moustafa Cheikho. It is not relied upon to prove the truth of the matters stated by the accused but is an objective fact (what he said), relevant to bring to bear on his actions, his association with the others and his possession of extremist material. 
     
      
    58 The second illustration occurs in the same conversation. This is where Moustafa Cheikho expresses a desire that when the Australians in Iraq are captured, they will be killed by decapitation. Once again, this is evidence admissible against all of the accused which, when taken with other evidence in the Crown case, points to the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. It is also admissible against Moustafa Cheikho as to his state of mind. In neither case, is the evidence tendered for a hearsay purpose. 
     
      
    59 In both illustrations, in the case of the first basis of admissibility, the evidence will in due course have no force against the other conspirators unless each of them are shown to be participants in the alleged conspiracy. As to the second basis of admissibility in each case, if it is ultimately demonstrated that the statements may be seen as part of an act or actions in furtherance of the conspiracy, they will, in due course, be held to be admissible against the other conspirators as showing their participation in the act or acts in furtherance. This will only occur, of course, if there is independent evidence which enables the Court to conclude it is reasonably open to find that the other defendants were parties to the conspiracy. Thirdly, the evidence may be relevant against the individual accused to rebut any suggestion that the overt acts were carried out innocently and without a terrorist purpose. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    60 This is, in effect, the third decision I have given in relation to the principles of evidence that are relevant to the proof of the conspiracy charge. Whether I be right or wrong, the point has now come where the defendants must, subject to any avenue of appeal, accept that these are the principles that will guide the reception of evidence in the forthcoming trial. It will now be necessary for the Crown to re-evaluate its position, determine the extent of the evidence of the present kind it proposes to lead, and to make its final decision regarding whether or confirming that the evidence is not to be used by way of an admission. This will require the Crown to determine whether it will ask for a limitation of use under s 136, and to determine whether or not a direction should be given to the jury at the time the evidence is given. Equally, the moment has now come for the defence to accept that the general body of evidence is admissible on the various bases I have outlined in my three decisions. This means that I expect the defence to co-operate with the Crown so that the evidence may be presented in a compact, coherent and intelligible way. There is a need for the defence to co-operate with the Crown so that the course of the evidence, and the directions that are to be given, are fully agreed before the jury is empanelled. 
     
      
    61 The final matter I wish to address is the underlining proposition in Mr Dalton’s submissions that there is, in some way, an element of unfairness in these individual “extremist” statements being admissible against all the other accused. I cannot agree with the proposition. The rules of evidence that govern the admission of evidence in a conspiracy case are now well settled. In general, they allow for the admission of evidence of statements by one conspirator that is relevant, not to prove the truth of what is stated, but simply relevant to the existence of a possible conspiracy, and relevant to shed light on the nature of that conspiracy. There is nothing unfair about this. There is nothing new about this. The evidence is not to be used for a hearsay purpose, and its limitation in this way is made perfectly clear to the jury. The co-conspirators rule itself goes much further than that. It enables, in the stipulated circumstances, anything said or done by one conspirator in furtherance of the common purpose to be admissible in evidence against the others, even though they were not there or took no part in that particular action. Moreover, evidence of this kind is not limited in any way. The authorities do not suggest that this is unfair, but rather it is a consequence of or derives from the nature of the combination itself. 
     
      
    62 It is, of course, always necessary to have regard to ss 135 and 137 to determine whether there is an intrusion of unfair prejudice in relation to the tender of any particular piece of evidence. But beyond that, I reject any suggestion that there is anything unfair arising from the proper and careful application of the Ahern principles.

      JUDGMENT - Application by ASIO to set aside calls for production of material made on 13 May 2008 – Legitimate forensic purpose – s 18 Telecommunications (Interception) and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: By notice of motion dated 4 June 2008, the Commonwealth of Australia and the Director-General of Security (ASIO) have sought an order in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The call for production of five categories of material made pursuant to s 36 of the  
        Evidence Act 1995 (Cth) 
         on 13 May 2008 to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on behalf of Khaled Cheikho be set aside on the grounds that there is no identified legitimate forensic purpose.” 
        
       
      
    2 Khaled Cheikho is one of nine men accused of conspiring with each other to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. Pre-trial applications in relation to the charge have been heard and determined by the Court over the last five months. The Court is presently dealing with a number of issues relating to subpoenas issued on behalf of various of the accused. This application relates to one of those issues.  
     
      
    3 Originally, Khaled Cheikho’s lawyers issued a subpoena on 13 May 2005. The subpoena was addressed to ASIO and sought five categories of material in its schedule. For reasons related to security, Khaled Cheikho then sought to make an oral call for production of the material referred to in the schedule to the subpoena. This call was made on the same date as the subpoena, namely, 13 May 2008, and it was made, by agreement, in substitution for the call under the subpoena. The five categories of material listed in the call were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Any and all documents and/or records relied upon by Mr Paul O'Sullivan in order to draft the certificate, including schedules, purportedly issued by Mr O'Sullivan pursuant to s 18  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 
         1979 and dated: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) 31 August 2005; 
           
          (b) 3 June 2004; 
           
          (c) 6 September 2004; and 
           
          (d) 3 March 2005. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. Any and all correspondence between the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (""ASIO"") and SingTel Optus referring to the making and/or contents of the certificates referred to in paragraph 1. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Any and all correspondence between ASIO and SingTel Optus referring to the making and/or the contents of the certificates issued by Paul O'Brien pursuant to s 18(1)  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 
         1979 in respect of warrants issued by the Attorney-General under section 9A  
        Telecommunications (Interception) Act 
         1979 on: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) 31 August 2005; 
           
          (b) 3 June 2004; 
           
          (c) 6 September 2004; and 
           
          (d) 3 March 2005. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        4. Any internal memoranda recording the contents of telephone conversation between Optus and ASIO in which any of the matters referred to in paragraphs 1/3 were recorded. 
        
       
       
        
        5. Any and all internal memoranda recording conversations between officers and employees of ASIO, including Mr O'Sullivan, concerning the making as well as the contents of the certificates referred to in paragraphs 1 and 3.” 
        
       
       
      Background 
       
      
    4 At the outset, it is convenient to note certain aspects of the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) (""TI Act""). First, Part 2-2 of the TI Act permits warrants to be issued to the Director-General of Security by the Attorney-General authorising ""interception of certain telecommunications"". Secondly, s 18(1) permits evidentiary certificates to be created by an officer of a carrier with respect to acts done by employees of a carrier in order to enable such warrants to be executed. Thirdly, s 18(2) makes such certificates ""conclusive evidence"" of the matters stated in them in certain proceedings, described as ""exempt proceedings"". (There is no dispute to the proposition that the present proceedings are ""exempt proceedings"".) Finally, Part 3 of the TI Act provides for the issue of two types of warrants referred to in ss 9 and 9A of the Act as ""telecommunication warrants"" and ""named person warrants"" respectively.  
     
      
    5 At trial, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions will seek to tender as evidence material obtained under the TI Act warrants referred to in the call dated 13 May 2008. The Director-General prepared an evidentiary certificate, and he or his officers arranged for s 18 TI Act evidentiary certificates to be given to the carrier concerned (Optus) for the purpose of the Commonwealth's preparation of the Crown case. The certificates intended to be relied upon by the prosecution for the purpose of the trial, especially that issued by the company secretary of Optus, were issued in substitution for earlier evidentiary certificates. The Crown does not seek to rely upon the earlier certificates of either the Director-General or the company secretary of Optus at trial, but does intend to rely upon the later certificates. I shall refer to these as the “live” certificates. 
     
      
    6 The various certificates, both live and revoked, are in evidence before me (Exhibits “A” – “D” inclusive). There is no need for me to set out the detail of these certificates for the purposes of this decision. Both the earlier and later certificates are in relevantly indistinguishable terms to the certificates recently considered by Latham J in R v Khazaal on 16 July 2008, and at least two of the certificates are the very certificates I considered in R v Baladjam [No 17] on 27 May 2008. In fact, the arguments presented before me in relation to the principal issue arising on this notice of motion are precisely the same arguments as were addressed by Latham J in R v Khazaal. (Latham J set aside the subpoena issued on behalf of Mr Khazaal, holding that no legitimate forensic purpose had been established, and that Mr Khazaal had not shown it was ""on the cards"" that the material sought would demonstrate that the company secretary of Optus did not turn his mind to the matters purportedly certified.) 
     
      
       
      Legitimate forensic purpose 
       
      
    7 The solicitor for the accused has identified, by letter dated 29 May 2008, the forensic purpose for the issue of the subpoena. The essence of the claim may be seen from the following paragraphs of the letter: 
     
      
       
        
        “With regard to your recent inquiry as to the legitimate forensic purpose of these subpoenas, we draw your attention to s 18(1) of the  
        Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 
         1979 (Cth) which provides that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'The Managing Director or secretary of a carrier may issue a written certificate signed by him or her setting out such facts as he or she considers relevant with respect to acts or things done by, or in relation to, employees of the carrier in order to enable a warrant to be executed.' 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        We advise that it is plain from a perusal of the material already disclosed that the secretary of Optus did not in fact turn his mind to the contents of evidentiary certificates which he signed. We believe the material sought in the above subpoena will establish this and we will subsequently argue that the relevant certificates should not be admitted into evidence.” 
        
       
       
      Principles to be applied - legitimate forensic purpose 
       
      
    8 The term ""legitimate forensic purpose"", in relation to subpoenas, has two aspects, as Simpson J said in R v Saleam (No 2) (1999) NSWCCA 86 at (11)): 
     
      
       
        
        “Before access is granted, or an order to produce made, the applicant must (i) identify a legitimate forensic purpose for which access is sought; and (ii) establish that it is 'on the cards' that the documents will materially assist his case.""  
        
       
      
    9 See also R v Saleam (No 1) (1989) 16 NSWLR 14 at 18(C); Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court v Tastan (1995) 75 A Crim R 498 at 504; Carroll v The Attorney General (1994) 70 A Crim R 162 at 181-182; Attorney-General v Chidgey (2008) NSWCCA 65 at (64) (68 and 81 to 86; Alister v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 404).  
     
      
    10 As these authorities show, the onus falls on the subpoenaing party to establish that the subpoena has a legitimate forensic purpose. It is not sufficient to show that the material caught will simply include relevant documents. A statement of the legitimate forensic purpose must be precise and a fishing expedition can ""never be allowed"" (Alister at 414). A fishing expedition will include an endeavour to ascertain whether or not there is an issue that the subpoenaing party may be able to exploit, or to check whether or not some fact or facts exist (Attorney-General v Chidgey at (81 to 86)). In particular, it is not legitimate simply to subpoena documents if all the party is doing is trying to get hold of documents to see whether they may assist him in his case or to see whether he or she has a defence. (See my earlier decision R v Baladjam [No 28] at paras 41 and 60). 
     
      
    11 As to the second aspect of the identification of a legitimate forensic purpose, it is then necessary for the subpoenaing party to persuade the Court that the documents sought will assist in the achievement of that purpose. The expression ""on the cards"" comes from Gibbs CJ in Alister's case. In Attorney-General v Chidgey, the Court disapproved of a number of more recent statements of the test as expounded by individual judges both in New South Wales and elsewhere. The ""on the cards"" test is a relaxation of the test applicable in civil cases. It is a more appropriate test in criminal proceedings because it recognises that an accused person may be on trial for his or her liberty (Alister at 456; R v Saleam (No 1) at 17-18). Normally, where a subpoenaing party cannot establish that a subpoena under challenge was issued for a legitimate forensic purpose and, in criminal proceedings, that it is on the cards the documentation sought will materially assist his or her case, then the subpoena will not be regarded as valid and may be set aside (Principal Registrar of the Supreme Court v Tastan at 508).  
     
      
    12 (See also paras 41-59 of Regina v Baladjam [No 28] where the authorities are also relevantly gathered together). 
     
      
       
      Legitimate forensic purpose - submissions on behalf of Khaled Cheikho 
       
      
    13 As I have indicated earlier, the submissions on behalf of Khaled Cheikho are generally the same as those addressed to Latham J in R v Khazaal. The background detail was identified by me in my earlier decision (R v Baladjam [No 17]). The precise legitimate forensic purpose asserted on the defendant’s behalf has been identified in the relevant paragraphs of the letter from Mr Cheikho's lawyers. The nub of the argument is that the secretary of Optus did not turn his mind to the relevance of the facts certified and that, if this be so, the preparation will form the basis for the ultimate exclusion of the relevant certificate or certificates. There are two strands to the argument, although they are interrelated.  
     
      
    14 First, there is the argument based on the ""similarities"" between the documents emanating from the Director-General and those emanating from the secretary of Optus. Mr Lange (who argued the matter for Khaled Cheikho) said that the ""similarities"" compel the conclusion that, at the very least, it is on the cards that the certificates were not the subject of consideration by the secretary of the carrier but, rather, were provided to him for signature by the Organisation. It will be suggested that there is an inference to simply sign the draft certificates without turning his mind to the matters of relevance. The second strand of the argument picks up the change in terminology between the ""revoked"" certificates and the ""live"" certificates sought to be relied upon in the present trial. This is said to be particularly so in relation to the certificates of the carrier. Once again, Mr Lange submitted that this change of wording demonstrated and gave weight to the suggestion that the secretary of the carrier did not turn his mind to the question as to whether the facts certified were facts relevant to acts or things done by employees of the carrier. Counsel argued that it might be inferred from the change of wording that the certificate was, in fact, provided by ASIO and that it was not the product of the secretary's own consideration.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    15 I have carefully read the submissions provided by Mr Lange, and those provided on behalf of the Commonwealth. I have also carefully read Latham J's decision in R v Khazaal. In my view, not only can it not be said that Latham J's decision was in error: I would unhesitatingly say that it is plainly correct, and that I agree with it in all respects. Her Honour's reasoning is compelling in relation to the point at issue in the present application. I would merely add some observations of my own.  
     
      
    16 First, it is clear that the relevant certificate or certificates of Mr O'Brien are those that might be described as the ""live"" certificates. These are the certificates the prosecution will rely on at trial. On their face, those certificates are conclusive as to the legality of the interceptions. They are also conclusive, as Latham J observed, as to the certifier's consideration that the facts set out were relevant to the acts or things done by, or in relation to, Optus employees. That is the very matter stated by Mr O'Brien in the document upon which the Crown will place reliance at trial. In my opinion, there is nothing to suggest that this statement ought not be taken at its face value and given the weight it naturally bears. Indeed, this is one of the matters, which is certified conclusively by Mr O'Brien in terms of the certificate.  
     
      
    17 The underlying issue is - did Mr O'Brien turn his mind to all the necessary matters? He certificates conclusively that he did so in the document to be relied on at trial, and there is no external collateral basis to show that he did not so. In my opinion, essentially for the reasons given by Latham J, the ""similarities"" argument does not undermine the relevant validity of the certificates.  
     
      
    18 Secondly, the ""revocation"" argument does not establish a legitimate forensic purpose. The underlying question raised by Mr Lange's submission is - does the revocation suggest a cover up for an illegality? It is, of course, possible that there may have been an illegality, but leaving aside for the moment the question as to who may possibly have committed an offence in such a situation, the change in terminology in the ""live"" certificates suggests a positive and persuasive inference that, at least in relation to those certificates, Mr O'Brien certainly turned his mind to the relevant matters. This inference stands squarely against that contended for by Mr Lange in his submissions.  
     
      
    19 Thirdly, the cases relied upon by Mr Lange as analogously helpful do not, in my opinion, provide much assistance to the argument. I agree with Latham J that the decision of the Full Federal Court in Williams v Minister for Justice (2007) 239 ALR 689 may be distinguished. It involved as Latham J noted, a precondition to the exercise of an administrative decision. By way of contrast, s 18 of the TI Act is concerned simply with the proof of a matter of evidence. Williams involved clarification of the legal principles relating to the review of an administrative decision. At issue was legislation, which required the Minister for Immigration to hold a certain opinion about a person's conduct before being entitled to issue a document likely to lead to the person's extradition. The Minister simply had no power to issue the relevant notice if he did not have, in one manner or another, details of, or a summary of, the person's conduct. It was plain, from the material the Minister relied on to form his opinion, that he did not have such details or summary. In effect, he acted in a vacuum, and thus failed to satisfy the mandatory statutory conditions necessary to enable the discretion to be exercised.  
     
      
    20 This seems far removed from the present situation. Here, the Optus executive was entitled to form his own views about matters that were relevant in terms of his employees' actions in enabling the interception, (there were no statutory preconditions to the exercise of the power, nor were there any matters of limitation beyond those stated or necessarily implied by the language of s 18 of TI Act). 
     
      
    21 Mr O'Brien has conclusively certified that the particular matters are relevant. Certainly, they give every appearance of being relevant, indeed highly relevant, to the particular aspects the accused would like to challenge. Viewed in that light, the issue of the subpoena is properly seen as more in the nature of a disgruntled attempt to see if there might be more than meets the eye to the certificates. There is no reasonable basis, however, for thinking that Mr O'Brien did not consider that the certified matters were relevant, and his certificate proves conclusively that they were. 
     
      
    22 None of the matters sought to be relied on by Mr Lange in his argument, support the proposition that Mr O'Brien did not consider the appropriate range of relevant matters in terms of the certification. Rather, it appears quite clearly that he did give ample and proper consideration to the relevant matters in the “live” certificates. There is no suggestion he lacked the power or capacity to revoke the earlier certificates. Such a power clearly exists (s 33 Acts Interpretation Act (Cth) 1901).  
     
      
    23 Mr Lange also relied upon a series of taxation cases. A number of these invoked the well-known “Hickman principle” (R v Hickman: Ex Parte Fox and Clinton (1945) 70 CLR 598, 615 per Dixon J). There is no need for me to detail these decisions. They were relied upon by way of analogy, even though Hickman dealt with a privative clause, not an evidentiary certificate. Those decisions arose, however, within a very particular statutory context. The analogy, in my opinion, is so remote as to be of virtually no assistance at all.  
     
      
    24 The end result sought to be drawn from these cases, however, was to liken the present situation to the position where the Commission of Taxation had issued an assessment without turning his mind to the actual assessment or calculation of the taxpayer’s income. Mr Lange argued that the tax cases demonstrated that a conclusive evidentiary certificate would not stand in such a situation, and that this would be so even where a “malicious” certification had not been demonstrated. Of course, at issue here is not an application to set aside the warrants – although that is contemplated – but a question as to legitimate forensic purpose. 
     
      
    25 In my view, however, Mr Lange’s analogy breaks down at the precise point he argues that there is “well and truly” available an inference that the certifier in the present matter did not turn his mind to the facts he certified. I simply do not agree with this proposition. I have no doubt the belief is genuinely held by Mr Lange, but it is, in my view, not one reasonably available as an inference from the matters on which reliance has been placed. To adopt (and to adapt) the words of Brennan J in Alister v The Queen here the party believes and hopes that documents exist that may advance his position, but there is an absence of “reasonable grounds” so as to lead to a belief that the material exists. 
     
      
    26 In its reply submissions, the Commonwealth noted, however, that the authority of the decisions to which the accused made reference (the tax cases) had very recently been fundamentally undermined by the decision of the High Court in Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris Corporation (2008) HCA 32. This led to a flurry of additional written submissions on both sides, as to whether the Futuris decision achieved the result argued for by the Commonwealth. That point, however, is so remote from the present decision, for the reasons, I have given, that I will not attempt to resolve in any definitive or detailed way the differing submissions of the parties in that regard. It is simply not necessary for the purposes of my present task. It is an interesting, but in the end, unnecessary diversion. 
     
      
    27 This much, however, may be said: in 1995 the “Hickman principle” was considered by the High Court in a situation where the Tax Commissioner had issued assessments on an alternative basis to different taxpayers in respect of the same income (Deputy Commissioner of Taxation v Richard Walter Pty Limited (1995) 183 CLR 168). The Commissioner’s actions, however, were not found to be wanting in validity. In the following year, the Federal Court (Spender, Burchett and Hill JJ) applied the Hickman principle, in reliance on Richard Water Pty Limited, to a sales tax issue. (Darrell Lea Chocolate Shops Pty Limited v Commissioner of Taxation (1996) 72 FCR 175). There, the Commissioner had issued assessments to the appellant in circumstances where the assessments were necessarily wrong, and were known to the Commissioner to be wrong. The Commissioner was held to be unable to issue assessments based on facts he knew to be wrong. It was, on that basis, an exercise that was not “bona fide”. The assessments were set aside. 
     
      
    28 In Commissioner of Taxation v Futuris, the Commissioner was accused of breaching the Hickman principle, and acting without bona fides. The Commissioner was asserted to have engaged in “double counting” when issuing assessments. The High Court rejected the challenges and held that there was no jurisdictional error involved in the assessment process. The Commissioner had acted within jurisdiction. Two points were made for relevant purposes: first, a lack of bona fides was equated with “conscious maladministration” of the legislation (majority decision at [25] and [52]. Second, Dawson J (in Richard Walter Pty Limited) had rejected the application of the Hickman principle to the particular tax assessment, (Dawson J at p 222) either directly or by analogy. In Futuris, the majority adopted the reasoning and remarks of Dawson J. (Futuris at [58 to [70]). The scope of the Hickman principle will only apply to tax assessments where a jurisdictional error has occurred involving conscious maladministration. Otherwise in general litigation the evidentiary certificate will prevail. 
     
      
    29 This brief analysis emphasises that Mr Lange’s use of the Hickman principle has no real value to the present issue, even by way of analogy. This is so because here Mr Lange does not assert “conscious maladministration” but merely inadvertence to matters within the statutory ambit. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    30 I am not satisfied that Mr Lange has established a legitimate forensic purpose for the production and access to the documents captured by the call. Nor am I satisfied that it is ""on the cards"" that the documents, if produced, will materially assist his client's case. No matter how the argument is dressed up, it seems clear to me that what is involved here is nothing more than a fishing expedition. The accused's reliance on a similarity in wording between the certificates, and his further reliance on the revocation of the earlier certificates, do not justify or permit the call for any of the five categories of material listed in the subpoena of 13 May 2008. I am perfectly satisfied that the call must be rebuffed by the application of the principles involved in the body of authority set out earlier in this decision.  
     
      
    31 The Commonwealth placed before the Court an alternative argument: It submitted that, in any event, all the documents captured by the call were the subject of valid claims for privilege, and that access to the documents should be refused on this basis. It has not been necessary for me to determine this alternative claim. In view of the decision I have reached on the principal matter, I consider that it is undesirable that I express any opinion in relation to the secondary argument.  
     
      
    32 The orders I make are:  
     
      
       
      1. I make order 1 in the Notice of Motion dated 4 June 2008; 
       
       
      2. I order that ASIO be excused from producing the documents referred to in each of the five categories set out in the subpoena and call of 13 May 2008.

      JUDGMENT - Application to remove fixed glass screen from dock area – prejudice – ability to have fair trial – directions to cure prejudice 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application made on behalf of all the accused. It seeks an order for the removal of the fixed glass screen at the front of the dock in the Trial Court. The substance of the argument has been presented by Mr G Turnbull SC and Mr A Djemal of junior counsel. They are the counsel for the accused Mirsad Mulahalilovic. Their arguments, however, encompass the interests of all accused.  
     
      
    2 The Sydney West Trial Court Complex is a ten-court facility located within the Parramatta Justice Precinct. The complex is modern and attractive, as are all the courtrooms. The complex was opened in February 2008. The Trial Court is located on the third level. It is known as Courtroom 5. It is the largest courtroom in the complex and is a specially designed ""high security"" courtroom. It is able to house approximately 40 lawyers, 30 members of the public, 15 jurors, court officers, court reporters and judicial staff. 
     
      
    3 The dock is conventionally placed on one side of the courtroom. It is appropriately described as a glassed-in room to the side of the court. It accommodates up to ten accused, as well as four Corrective Services officers.  
     
      
    4 A detailed description of it is contained in the affidavit of Trisha Randhawa (Exhibit 3). Miss Randhawa gave the following description: 
     
      
       
        
        “8. I estimate the width of the dock at 2 metres, the length at 10 to 12 metres and the height in excess of 2 metres. It is recessed into the courtroom wall facing the jury and a glass screen extends from the roof to the dock edge completely blocking the dock from the rest of the courtroom. The glass door three-quarters of the way along the front of the dock allows access, when opened into the courtroom proper. A door directly into the cell area opens from the rear of the dock. 
        
       
       
        
        9. The accused sit in two rows to one side of the dock and four Corrective Services sit in two rows on the other side of the dock adjacent to the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        10. The jury will be looking straight at the dock through the glass screen. Mr Graham Turnbull of Senior Counsel has sat in the jury box. I am informed by him and verily believe that the height of the seats in the dock means that the accused and others are visible from the shoulders up. The accused in the back row are occasionally obscured... 
        
       
       
        
        11. The view of a juror will therefore be downward into a dock where the accused are partially and, at times, totally obscured. 
        
       
       
        
        12. At all times the accused sit beside a group of Corrective Services officers, sitting as a group. Outside the dock Corrective Services officers are placed around the courtroom, usually two at the front of the dock and two each at each of the rear exits. The officers are in uniform and carry the usual appointments.” 
        
       
      
    5 Miss Randhawa gave further evidence in her affidavit about the manner of communication between the lawyers and their clients in the courtroom situation. Adjacent to the dock is a booth with a full glass door placed to the accused's side of the dock. A phone is available in the booth to the lawyer. The accused must rise from his seat and move to an intercom at the end of the dock. The intercom speaker broadcasts into the dock as a whole and can be heard by all in the dock, including Corrective Services officers. Any reply must be through the speaker and is generally audible to all in the dock area, including Corrective Services officers.  
     
      
    6 Miss Randhawa described the process of speaking to the accused and receiving instructions as visually distracting and practically cumbersome. It does not allow any real degree of confidentiality. Miss Randhawa further described the problem that arises because instructions can usually only be arranged in the Parramatta cells during the lunch hour and between 4pm and 5pm. Only two clients can be seen at a time. The problem this raises is that only short instructions, momentary advice or brief explanations are possible in the courtroom itself. This complaint, it was suggested, could be overcome if the dock were an open one, rather than fully enclosed.  
     
      
    7 Miss Randhawa also pointed to the problems of the accused attempting to obtain the attention of their lawyers. This is usually done by way of tapping on the glass or by way of ""histrionic waving"". Provision of documents to the accused in court is by way of an opening in the front of the dock to seated Corrective Services officers who check the document is not contraband and then distribute it to the relevant accused. This process is also cumbersome and is clearly evident to the jury.  
     
      
    8 Other complaints included the fact that the sound system in the dock is sometimes broadcast into the courtroom and that, on occasions, proceedings in the courtroom cannot be heard by the accused through the speaker systems. These complaints I would describe as teething problems. They are clearly important, but I have no doubt that appropriate manipulation of the speaker controls will largely address this problem.  
     
      
    9 The final matters mentioned by Miss Randhawa were these: There are occasional problems with the air conditioning in the dock area. (I might add this is not uncommon throughout the building generally). The accused complain of a feeling of ""dislocation"". Many parts of the public gallery cannot see all of the accused. Even counsel at the bar table cannot see all the accused. (I might add that this ""problem"" infects the bench as well. The particular layout means that it is not possible to see all the accused at any one time from the bench.)  
     
      
    10 The real gist of Miss Randhawa's complaint (made on behalf of all the accused) is that they and their lawyers have expressed a strong concern that the dock, with its complete glass barrier, creates a highly prejudicial impression that they are too dangerous to be afforded the usual open dock facility with its attendant access to their lawyers.  
     
      
       
      Evidence from the Attorney General’s Department 
       
      
    11 Mr Kerry Marshall, the Director of the Asset Management Branch of the NSW Attorney-General's Department provided the Court with an affidavit (Exhibit “A”). Mr Marshall described in considerable detail the evolving policy of the Department in relation to courtrooms generally and dock areas in particular. The Department has a number of standard designs in relation to docks and these include partially secure docks and high security docks. Mr Marshall explained that, for the last ten years, it has been the policy of the Department to increase the security of docks in New South Wales, primarily because of the number of attempted escapes from docks. (Mr Marshall did not indicate whether any attempts had been successful or how many there have been.)  
     
      
    12 This policy has led to the development of new dock designs. It has been said that these dock designs were developed in conjunction with key stakeholders, including the judiciary, the Department of Corrective Services, courts and tribunal staff, police, members of the legal profession including Legal Aid, the DPP and others. 
     
      
    13 (I would only comment that, so far as I am aware, none of the judges of the Supreme Court, who generally preside over the most serious criminal trials in New South Wales, were consulted about the provision of the enclosed dock in the new Parramatta complex. Certainly, as the designated trial judge, I had no say in the design of the dock area in Court 5.)  
     
      
    14 Interestingly, Mr Marshall points to the fact that the preferred standard design for all docks in New South Wales is now a ""flexible dock"". A dock of this kind can be seen in all the courts on the other levels of the Parramatta Trial Complex. A flexible dock is one, which combines a fully enclosed high security glass dock, with an open dock attached to the front of the enclosed glass dock. This flexible design means that any dock is able to function as a high security dock when necessary. I understood Mr Marshall to mean by this that, where an accused creates a disturbance or difficulty in the courtroom, he may be, if it is necessary, ""banished"" into the enclosed dock area at least for a time.  
     
      
    15 Mr Marshall made it clear that Courtrooms 5 and 6 on level 3 in the Sydney West Trial Court Complex were intended to function as ""high security"" courtrooms. Both courtrooms, however, are larger than the other courtrooms in the complex and are designed to accommodate multi-accused trials. There was not, however, sufficient room to build a double dock, that is a flexible dock, in either of Courtrooms 5 and 6. (I should mention that Courtroom 6 is not presently functioning as a courtroom. It is being used by the Commonwealth DPP as its ""office"" or “preparation area” for the purpose of the trial to be held in Courtroom 5.)  
     
      
    16 Mr Marshall said that the Department prefers high security docks enclosed with a full height glass screen ""because it is the most open and transparent design"". The Department, he said, considers the most important design feature of a fully enclosed dock is the safety and security of persons in the dock, DCS officers and court staff. One of the key factors in this regard is the stability of the glass screen, such that it cannot be shattered or damaged by a person seated in the dock. The Department has found that installing a sliding glass window in a full height glass dock adversely affects the stability of the glass. That is why the Department's current preferred design standard for docks is the flexible dock, rather than a fully enclosed glass dock with a window or door built into it. As I have said, this was not possible on level 3 because there was not sufficient room to build a double dock.  
     
      
    17 Mr Marshall placed before the Court the full performance brief for the Criminal Trial Court Complex. The Court was also provided with a project brief for the complex. This was a brief provided to the architects who designed the complex. Finally, the Court was given the Parramatta Justice Precinct Trial Courts Security Design Guide. These documents, although criticised by the defence in some regards, generally support the propositions advanced by Mr Marshall in his affidavit.  
     
      
       
      The evidence for the Department of Corrective Services 
       
      
    18 Mr Michael Hovey, the Senior Assistant Superintendent within the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services, provided an affidavit addressing the issues in the application. He gave evidence that each of the accused men is classified ""AA"" within the Department's categories of classification. This is the maximum-security classification that can be given to a person in custody. It is given to: 
     
      
       
        
        “Male inmates who, in the opinion of the Commissioner of Corrective Services, represent a special risk to national security (for example, a perceived risk that they may engage in, or incite other persons to engage in, terrorist activities) and should at all times be confined in special facilities within a secure physical barrier that includes towers, or electronic surveillance equipment.” 
        
       
      
    19 Mr Hovey said that prior to the commencement of trial, he assessed the level of security that would be required for the Department to manage the security of the accused during the trial. Part of this assessment including his consideration of potential security risks during the trial, including the escape or attempted escape of one or more of the accused from custody; the passing of contraband to one or more of the defendants; the occurrence of a disturbance within the Court and a threat to safety of the defendants by a member or members of the public. Mr Hovey said that, when an inmate is moved outside the confines of a correctional centre, the risk of an incident such as an escape or the passing of contraband increases. He was influenced in the present matter by the fact that there were nine accused. He considered that this factor presented different security issues compared to the trial of a single accused. Finally, he had regard to the fact that each of the men was classified “AA” and was, therefore, a maximum security inmate considered by the Commissioner of Corrective Services to be a risk to national security ""who should at all times be confined in special facilities within a secure physical barrier"".  
     
      
    20 It must be said, however, that the risk to national security apparently emerged from the classification itself, rather than from any adverse activities of the accused since they have been in custody. (I might mention that they have now been in custody for nearly three years).  
     
      
    21 Mr Hovey said that the primary function of the Department's officers, in the event of a security breach, is to maintain the security of the inmates. Any incident within the court area itself is the responsibility of the New South Wales Sheriff's Office. The role of the Department's officers present on the floor of the courtroom is to provide an immediate response function to assist in evacuating the defendants from the dock area in the event of a security incident. Mr Hovey said, however, that in the event of a security issue in the courtroom, the Department's officers present in the court would assist in a secondary way by protecting the judge, the lawyers, the jury, witnesses and the public, if required to do so.  
     
      
    22 Mr Hovey described to the Court the high level of security involved in transporting the accused to and from Silverwater gaol each day. There is no need for me to detail this for the purposes of the decision. It is sufficient to note that there is a mandatory full strip search of the defendants at the commencement of the day and in the court cells in the evening before they are transported back to Silverwater.  
     
      
    23 Mr Hovey firmly supported the retention of the glass area in the dock. He said that, in the event of a serious incident in the courtroom, the Department's current strategy is one of containment and swift removal of the accused. That can be easily done because the dock itself is securely contained. This is clearly a valid consideration.  
     
      
    24 Mr Hovey also said that, by reason of the high security dock, the Department's security presence in these proceedings has been lower than he would otherwise have considered necessary. For example, during the committal hearing in Penrith, there were eighteen officers of the Department present in the courtroom. By contrast, the nine defendants at the Sydney West Trial Court Complex have been managed by no more than ten officers being present. Mr Hovey said that he regarded the secure dock at Court 5 as an important part of the Department's security strategy in the court.  
     
      
    25 Finally, Mr Hovey expressed the concern that if the glass were removed from the dock, he would need to reassess the security strategy. He thought control of the illegal passage of items to the nine accused would be made more difficult if the glass were removed. Secondly, the short distance between the public area and the dock could not be secured quickly enough in the event of a security incident if only ten officers of the Department were present. For that reason, he said that he would have to consider a significant increase in the number of security staff positioned in front of the dock area if the glass were removed. I took Mr Hovey to mean by this that the prejudicial effect of a significant increase in the number of Corrective Services officers would be higher, in his view, than any prejudicial effect represented by the screen itself.  
     
      
       
      The Report of Associate Professor David Tait 
       
      
    26 Professor Tait provided a report dated 3 August 2008 (Exhibit 1). He is a social scientist with a PhD in Social Administration from the London School of Economics. He is currently employed as an associate professor in the Law Faculty at the University of Canberra. His primary role at present is as a research leader on major national projects about courts. Many of these involve the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Institute of Judicial Administration and Prosecutors. One area involved in Professor Tait's position as a research leader is the question as to how juries respond to particular forms of evidence, particularly new forms of evidence in relation to terrorism trials. In turn, the research is looking at how well crafted judicial instructions could address some of the issues. Professor Tait frankly conceded, both in his oral evidence and in his report, that there is very little in the way of current studies available to examine an issue such as the present, particularly in relation to the likely impact of the screen on a jury. Consequently, he was confined to three essential methods in his report. These were reviews of academic literature, summaries of judicial opinion and case comparison between courtroom configurations. Of course, Professor Tait brought to bear his own experience in relation to all these areas. He conceded, however, that none of the three methods employed would generally be regarded as would be reliable as randomised, controlled tests.  
     
      
    27 For these reasons, fairly conceded by Professor Tait himself, I do not think a great deal of weight can be given to his report. There is simply not enough objective independent data upon which to draw guidance. Nevertheless, Professor Tait suggested that jurors might be more likely to consider defendants guilty if the dock were set behind a glass screen. Secondly, he spoke of the difficulties likely to be encountered by the defendants and their lawyers, in terms of communications, where there is a fully installed, inflexible glass screen. 
     
      
    28 Professor Tait did address (between pages 5 and 7 of Exhibit 1) security issues and challenges from a design point of view. He addressed the question of ""how the presumption of innocence is represented"" by suggesting that jurors tend to show more sympathy for defendants who are similar to themselves on a range of dimensions. Anything that makes the accused look different from other people in the room could potentially lead to prejudice. He thought that restraint of any kind, including a dock, could be seen as one of these. As I say, however, there is very little in the way of empirical evidence to give guidance to Professor Tait's views. Common sense would suggest that a jury might be startled, at least at first instance, upon encountering an accused person behind a completely enclosed glass wall.  
     
      
    29 The second part of Professor Tait's methodology was not, it must be said, particularly helpful. This was basically concerned with the situation in the United States where the dock has been abolished altogether. That is not the position in New South Wales and is unlikely to be so for the foreseeable future. Little, if any, weight can be given to that circumstance. 
     
      
    30 The final part of Professor Tait's evidence compared the situation in a number of courtrooms. These were the Cook County Court in Chicago, the International Criminal Tribunal For the Former Yugoslavia, the Nuremberg War Crimes Trial, and, finally, the Melbourne County Court Ceremonial Courtroom. This is the courtroom in which Bongiorno J is presently presiding over a trial which relates to an allegation of terrorist behaviour brought against twelve accused (R v Benbrika). 
     
      
    31 It is perhaps salient to mention at this point that the issue of the court configuration became a critical one in the trial before Bongiorno J. His Honour had to make a decision which balanced security issues in the courtroom against the likely prejudice generated by a dock which was restricted by a Perspex screen. There were other issues as well, but the principal one went to the issue as to whether the security measures adopted in the courtroom were likely to prejudice a fair trial for the accused. His Honour described the situation as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “At the back of the Court there is a dock consisting of two rows of seats in a wooden enclosure. In front of each row of seats is a slightly curved wooden barrier about .87 metres high. At present, superimposed on the dock is a Perspex structure, which not only isolates the dock and its occupants from the body of the Court, but also serves to create a number of small cells in the dock itself, each containing two seats bolted to the floor. Each cell is surrounded on three sides by the Perspex screen, which sits on the floor and rises to a height of 1.8 metres. There are also a number of computer screens positioned at regular intervals in front of the accuseds' seats. The height of the Perspex screen effectively prevents conversation, particularly private conversation, over the wooden dock wall, as would, and does, occur in any ordinary courtroom. At present, the position of the Perspex screen in front of each seat in the dock means that, for a person of average height or above, the occupant's knees are jammed hard against the Perspex, necessitating frequent postural adjustment to achieve even a moderate degree of comfort.” 
        
       
      
    32 Counsel for the accused argued that the Perspex screens were burdensome, oppressive and likely to prejudice a fair trial. At para 12 of his Honour's decision (R v Benbrika & Ors (Ruling No 12) 2007 VSC 524, Bongiorno J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As far as the screens themselves are concerned, I am satisfied that they have the effect contended for by Mr McMahon. They cut the accused off from the courtroom in such a way as to render the accuseds' presence hardly more real than if they appeared by a video link. The presence of the computer monitors also does not assist in this regard, although it is really the Perspex screens themselves, which create the effect. Although I am satisfied that the accused can generally hear the proceedings going on in the courtroom, their capacity to communicate with each other is severely restricted and they cannot communicate with their lawyers unless those lawyers actually enter the dock area. As far as the presence of the prison officers is concerned, the perception created by such a large number of them is that the accused are people who warrant being guarded in such a fashion to prevent their escape or to prevent other undesirable activity.” 
        
       
      
    33 Bongiorno J held that the situation was such as to materially diminish the accuseds' right to the presumption of innocence. His Honour considered that the situation could only be improved by the removal of the Perspex screen surrounding the dock and by a restriction of the number of uniformed prison officers in the courtroom at any one time.  
     
      
    34 As I have indicated, I do not think that great weight can be given to Professor Tait’s report, if for no other reason than that his opinions, though interesting and reflecting his own experience and reading, are not based on empirical surveys of tests conducted in this country. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the parties 
       
      
    35 Mr Turnbull SC made the oral submissions on behalf of the accused. I should say that it was particularly appropriate that Mr Turnbull presented these submissions. Senior counsel have agreed, many months ago, to take part in a number of discussions which addressed a range of ""teething problems"" related to this courthouse. Some of those were touched upon in judgments I gave in early March 2008. There is no need for me to repeat them here. Many of the teething problems have been addressed and others are to be shortly addressed when further building and cabling work is to be carried out during a brief recess in the hearing of preliminary arguments. As I say, Mr Turnbull has had a significant role in helping to resolve matters of the kind I have identified. 
     
      
    36 Mr Turnbull's essential complaint is that one specific problem has simply not been addressed: This is the presence of the glass screen separating the accused from the courtroom proper. It is Mr Turnbull's contention that the presence of this glass screen will produce irreparable prejudice, will impinge in a practical way on the presumption of innocence and prevent the accused from getting a fair trial. Mr Turnbull makes the point that, so far as the evidence indicates, this is the only courtroom in New South Wales at present with a fixed glass screen between the courtroom and the accused, creating in effect a separate room where the accused are enclosed. Mr Turnbull has argued that no matter the range of directions that might be given, the jury will inevitably think that the accused are highly dangerous, violent and hence likely to be guilty of the offence charged. 
     
      
    37 There is a secondary aspect to Mr Turnbull's argument related to the disconnection of the accused from the trial itself and the problem this has caused for enabling proper communication and access between the accused and their lawyers. Mr Turnbull suggested that the easiest way to solve all these problems is simply to remove the screen.  
     
      
    38 Mr Lloyd of counsel presented the arguments for both the State of New South Wales and the Commissioner of Corrective Services. At the outset, Mr Lloyd challenged the Court's absolute power to make an order for the removal of the glass screen in the present matter. Mr Lloyd accepted that there is authority to suggest the Judge has absolute authority within the courtroom in relation to matters of security affecting all persons in the courtroom, including the accused. Mr Lloyd also accepted that the Court has the power, and indeed the duty, to prevent an unfair trial (Jago v District Court (1989) 168 CLR 23). Mr Lloyd argued, however, that the ""problem"" identified here did not relate, as it had done in other cases, to the removal of special security measures that had been introduced into the courtroom in circumstances specifically related to the trial of a particular accused. It could not be said, counsel argued, that the glass screen in front of the dock here has been put in place for this trial or for these accused. It is no more than an ordinary and permanent feature of the courtroom. 
     
      
    39 In those circumstances, Mr Lloyd argued that, where a courtroom, or a feature of the courtroom, was, by reason of its inherent design, found to be prejudicial to such an extent that prejudice could not be removed by appropriate directions, the trial judge could order that the trial be moved to another place. Mr Lloyd argued that it was by no means clear that the “absolute authority” in the trial judge extended to a power to order that a courtroom be structurally redesigned where the contention was that the inherent design features of the trial court raised an obstacle to a fair trial. 
     
      
    40 Mr Lloyd's principal contention, however, was that there was no inherent prejudice in the presence of the glass dock itself. Mr Lloyd sought to distinguish the situation in R v Benbrika by pointing out that the Perspex dock in that case had been introduced specifically for that particular trial. They were not part of the overall courtroom design. They were, in effect, special security measures which had been introduced to meet the exigencies of the particular trial. 
     
      
    41 By way of contrast, Mr Lloyd argued, having regard to the evidence of Mr Marshall, that the design of Courtroom 5 represented best practice in contemporary court design. The nature of the dock did not represent a response to this particular trial or to the particular accused. Rather, the courtroom had been designed for general multi-accused trials and would be used for this purpose in the future, irrespective of the nature of the charges brought against the accused. 
     
      
    42 Mr Lloyd made somewhat different submissions on behalf of his second client, the Department of Corrective Services. In this regard, Mr Lloyd argued that there was a need for high security. This arose, as Mr Hovey's affidavit indicated, principally because of the classification of the accused as ‘AA” remand inmates. Secondly, he said the use of the glass dock in Courtroom 5, a specially designed high security courtroom, allowed for the trial to be conducted without the use of excessive Corrective Services presence. 
     
      
    43 At a practical level, Mr Lloyd conceded that there might need to be some improvement for the method of communication between the accused and their lawyers. But beyond this, he submitted that directions from the trial judge would be sufficient to avoid prejudice, and would enable a fair trial to take place. 
     
      
    44 The Crown submissions were made by Mr Geoff Bellew SC. Senior counsel for the Commonwealth DPP accepted that issues of security were necessarily the province of the Department of Corrective Services and, within the courtroom, the Sheriff's Office. However, Mr Bellew submitted that the current presentation of the dock would not give rise to any degree of prejudice, but, if it did, appropriate directions could be given to ameliorate the situation. Finally, in relation to the practical problems of access between the lawyers and the accused, the Crown suggested that there would be ways and means, apart from the removal of the screen, by which these problems could be addressed. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues - Background considerations 
       
      
    45 Before coming to a resolution of the issues, it may be convenient if I say something about the background of this trial. It will be necessary to say something firstly about the circumstances which have led to the case being heard at Parramatta. Secondly, it will be necessary to say something about the nature of the trial itself.  
     
      
    46 As to the first matter, I gave a decision in this matter on 18 March 2008. At that time, there was a concerted application by both the prosecution and the defence to change the venue from Parramatta to Sydney. Originally, it had been proposed that the trial would take place in the Darlinghurst Court complex at Sydney. The courtroom which was considered for that purpose was old and in many respects, antiquated. It would have been necessary to spend approximately $600,000 to provide for its modernisation. The major amount of the expenditure would have been necessary to address technology and security issues. As might be expected, the prospect of this massive expenditure led to discussions between the New South Wales Government and the Commonwealth Attorney General's Department with a view to seeking funding from Commonwealth sources for the purpose of transforming the Darlinghurst complex. Unfortunately, this proposal did not result in any agreement between the parties. Moreover, an important intervening event emerged which played a major part in rendering the Darlinghurst complex unsuitable.  
     
      
    47 In late June 2007, the Department of Corrective Services, which had been involved in extensive discussions concerning the Darlinghurst Supreme Court as a possible venue, determined that the complex was simply unsuitable from a security point of view. This determination became fixed in concrete, at least in political terms.  
     
      
    48 It was against that background that, in the middle of 2007, the New South Wales government contemplated, and ultimately determined, that the Sydney West Trial Courts, when completed, might provide a suitable venue, indeed the only venue which could be considered as an available option. A number of submissions emerged from the Crown and the defence opposing the suggestion that the trial be held at Parramatta. Many of these concerns were addressed in my decision of 18 March 2008. One important consideration was the distance between Sydney and Parramatta. It was feared that this would prove inconvenient, difficult and taxing for the lawyers involved, simply because of the distance between Parramatta and Sydney CBD. There were other arguments advanced as well which related to the proposed courtroom and the court complex itself. Many of these submissions were largely anticipatory and were based on assumptions about the plans of the proposed premises then available.  
     
      
    49 As I have said earlier, the complex opened in February 2008. The building was not fully operational for some months, although it is now operating with the District Court using a number of the trial courts. The Drug Court is also in occupation and the building is fully staffed by Sheriff's officers and the Registry. Leaving to one side the ""distance argument"" between Parramatta and Sydney, the complex has proved quite satisfactory for the legal practitioners involved. Many of the concerns contained in the written submissions simply vanished by the wayside. For example, the defence have now a very attractive and effective work location, probably unsurpassed by any other court complex in the State, on level 2. I addressed the situation in a general way at paragraph 24 of my earlier decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “Overall, the Court complex is extremely impressive. The level of finishes it possesses, the services it is to provide and its extensive range of amenities make it, plainly enough, a most attractive and efficient Court complex. This is not to say that, like all knew buildings, it does not or will not have teething problems. They may need to be addressed as they arise from time to time. But as I say, it is a most attractive and efficient complex. It is fully air conditioned, it is light and airy and it is clear that considerable professional care has gone into its planning and detail.” 
        
       
      
    50 I have made earlier reference to the fact that there were and are ""teething problems"". These included, for example, the inadequacy of the courtroom in its original layout to cater for the number of lawyers, their working materials and the like. The problems also extended to the fact that, even when the courtroom was reassembled to provide sufficient accommodation for the number of lawyers, it was necessary to carry out extensive and expensive cabling works to make sure the sound systems operated adequately around the whole courtroom. As I have said, these problems have been, or are to be addressed, before the commencement of the trial proper.  
     
      
    51 One problem, however, identified in the original written submissions was the issue involving the dock area. In plain terms, this was identified as a problem by the submissions made on behalf of all of the accused well prior to the completion of the building. In my March 2008 decision, I indicated that this problem should be addressed separately and I did not deal with it at that time.. It is as a consequence of the postponement of that issue that the present application has been made.  
     
      
    52 It is fair to say that the practitioners, myself and other interested persons have had the opportunity over the last six months of to observe the regime imposed on the accused by virtue of their presence in an enclosed dock. In particular, it has enabled the Court to consider over a long period of time the impact that the present structure is likely to have on a jury selected to judge the facts in the trial.  
     
      
    53 As to the trial itself, the first thing to be noted is that it is likely to be lengthy. No real estimate has been put upon it at this stage, but it could take nine months or more. I am hopeful that when a number of presently contemplated discussions between the parties are held, there will be a more reliable estimate of the length of the trial. But, by any reckoning, it will be a very lengthy trial.  
     
      
    54 The charge against the accused is that between about 8 July 2004 and 8 November 2005 the accused did conspire with each other to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. Section 101.6 of the Criminal Code Act (Cth) makes it an offence to do an act in preparation for or planning a terrorist act. The offence of conspiracy is set out at s 11.5 of the Criminal Code Act. The combined effect of these sections highlights the seriousness of the charge. The maximum penalty is one of imprisonment for life.  
     
      
    55 The nature of the charge against each of the accused is described in the Crown case statement. The prosecution case is that each of the conspirators considers himself to be a devout Muslim. Each held certain beliefs in common relating to their interpretation of the Muslim faith. These common beliefs included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Islam throughout the world was under attack and there was a religious obligation to come to the defence of Islam and other Muslims; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) jihad was the primary means by which this religious obligation should be fulfilled; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) a significant and legitimate aspect of the fulfilment of this obligation was violent jihad, which involved the application of force and violence, including in certain circumstances the killing of 'infidels', that is persons who do not have the same fundamentalist beliefs.” 
        
       
      
    56 The trial will involve evidence of the finding of a large volume of material supporting extremist views at the premises of each accused upon the execution of search warrants. This extremist material was in the form of electronic media, including videos, DVDs, CDs and material from websites downloaded and saved on each of the accused's computer or computers.  
     
      
    57 The evidence will also include the views expressed by a number of the accused in relation to topics connected with the activities of terrorists throughout the world. There will, for example, be views attributed to some of the accused approving of the September 11, 2001 atrocities; there will be views approving the slaughter of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. There will be views about the beheading of hostages, and views of an extremist kind about Australian politicians, the Australian Government, and the involvement of Australia in overseas activities against Muslims.  
     
      
    58 Against the background of this type of evidence, the Crown will submit that the jury will be entitled to infer beyond reasonable doubt that the accused entered into an agreement to obtain the capacity or capability to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. This in turn will involve evidence suggesting that the accused, or some of them, obtained or attempted to obtain chemicals and other relevant materials which could be used in the construction of an explosive device or devices. It will also include the obtaining, or attempted obtaining, by some of the accused of weaponry and ammunition. It will also extend to include the covert activities by many of the accused in relation to some of these activities, displaying a high level of planning to avoid detection. The evidence will extend to the acquisition and use of mobile telephones in false names, the use of coded SMS messages and the use of false names and other techniques to avoid physical monitoring. Finally, mention should be made of an association between the accused and a Melbourne group who are said, on their own account, to be involved in terrorist activities in that State. One of those was Abdul Nacer Benbrika, an Islamist who had publicly declared his support for militant or violent jihad. The Crown case will be that Benbrika provided spiritual guidance, extending to the support for extremist notions, to a number of the Sydney accused.  
     
      
    59 The description I have given of the nature of the Crown case, general though it be, will highlight, I think, that the trial will involve areas where prejudice or bias could be encountered. At the very least, it could be expected that all members of the community would look unfavourably upon terrorist activities, extremist Muslim positions and approval by Muslims to the commission of atrocities against Americans and Australians involved in overseas battlefields. The handling of the jury pool, the selection of the jury and the conduct of the trial by jury will place a heavy burden on the Court to ensure that these men obtain a fair trial.  
     
      
    60 Each of the accused has pleaded not guilty to the charge. This means that each accused has the presumption of innocence in his favour. It also means that the Crown must prove its case beyond reasonable doubt. The tribunal of fact will be required to make up its mind as to whether the Crown has discharged the burden of proof in an atmosphere that is free from prejudice and bias. The task of the Court will be to oversee the proper fulfilment of these obligations and to give directions, wherever necessary, to ensure that prejudice and bias play no part in the evaluation of the guilt or innocence of the accused. Against this general background, it is now necessary to address the issues in a determinative fashion. I do not propose to go to every argument raised by counsel. I trust that that will not be regarded as a lack of respect or appreciation for the diligence with which the thorough and careful submissions have been prepared on all sides. Similarly, I will not dwell on a detailed analysis of the authorities brought to my attention by counsel. Most of those cases turned upon their own particular characteristics. 
     
      
       
      Resolution – Final determination 
       
      
    61 The first point relates to the Court's power to make the orders sought. It is not in dispute that a trial judge is entitled to have and to exercise full control of the course of the proceedings in a criminal trial (R v Smith (1982) 2 NSWLR 608 at 613). Nor is it in dispute that the authority of the presiding Judge in respect of security matters relating to the courtroom is ""absolute"". This statement does not deny that there may be necessarily some limitations on such a power. As Mr Lloyd argued, it would hardly be within the power of a Court to order the demolition of a court because of a concern that there were problems with the accused receiving a fair trial. Such a situation, however, does not arise in the present matter where the issue is a relatively simple one: Should the Court remove a permanently fixed glass screen which is embedded in a non-structural wall? I have been informed that the cost of the works would be in the vicinity of $10,000 (although this seems, at first blush, rather a high estimate) and that the work would take two to three days to complete allowing for painting and making good the surrounds. This is not a major piece of building work, although I have no doubt it would be regarded as relatively inconvenient and perhaps relatively expensive. The cost would, however, pale into insignificance against the costs of the measures that have been promised (and partly carried out already) in relation to solving other teething problems in the courtroom. I also accept that where an appropriate case manifested itself, the Court might simply direct that the proceedings be held in another courtroom. From a practical point of view, that would not be possible in the present matter. There is no other suitable courtroom available. For these reasons, I am satisfied that I have the power to make the order sought.  
     
      
    62 I turn then to the real question underlying the application. Will the continued presence of the fixed glass screen so affect the presumption of innocence that the jury will be unable to judge the accused fairly? This is a difficult question and one that I have not found easy to resolve. My mind has fluctuated back and forward between the various alternatives during argument. In the end, I have decided that I should accede to the application and that I should direct that the screen be removed.  
     
      
    63 The first reason is, admittedly, one of first impression. I acknowledge that my own impressions of the situation should not be determinative of the issue, but I must confess that when I first saw the fixed screen dock, I was immediately concerned about its impact on the jury. Similarly, when I first saw the accused in the fixed screen dock, I was rather taken aback by the apparent separation of the accused from everybody else in the courtroom. The immediate impression was that they were separated in that way because they posed a threat to people in the courtroom.  
     
      
    64 It is fair to say that, as the months have passed, this impression has eased to a large degree. It may be that I have simply become used to the situation. There is, however, the world of difference between the reaction of an experienced trial judge (if I may call myself that) and the reaction of 15 people from the general community who come to judge a criminal trial as the tribunal of fact. Some of the jurors may have been in a criminal trial before. If so, they will find a marked contrast between the present situation and their previous experience. Even jurors who have not been in a criminal trial before are likely to be startled by the presence of a completely separated dock. 
     
      
    65 It is part and parcel of the training of a Judge to remove bias from his own mind before embarking on a trial, whether it be criminal or civil. It is part of the training and armoury of a Judge that he is able to put such matters out of his mind altogether before embarking upon an adjudication between citizens, or presiding over an adjudication between the State and a citizen in a criminal trial. Members of the community would, I think, find this more difficult to achieve. Not impossible, but difficult nonetheless.  
     
      
    66 I move then from questions of first impression to the principal arguments advanced on behalf of the parties. Here, I think that Mr Lloyd's arguments demonstrated a subtle sense of conflict between the differing approaches of his two clients. The Department's position is that the entire complex, including the multi-accused Courts, has been planned after considerable consultation and consideration. The Department's policy reflected a preference for what was described as ""a flexible dock"". Docks of this kind are to be found on all other levels of the court complex, save for level 3. Doing my best to read between the lines of the policy (it is not always an easy task) I discerned that the preference of the Department would have been for a flexible dock in each of Courtrooms 5 and 6. Space, however, did not allow a double dock (as it was described) to fit into the available space, or spaces, on level 3. It was essentially for that reason that the flexible dock policy was not adopted for the multi-accused courtrooms. The Department's second argument was based on the proposition that the fully screened dock in Courtroom 5 represents a permanent feature and should not be changed, even if there were no justification for a permanent screen in any particular trial. The corollary to this second argument is that the Department says that Courtroom 5 is not an “AA” classification courtroom. Nor is it an “ AA” classification dock. It is simply the dock that has been built in accordance with the Department's present policy, and based on considerations of the available space within the courtroom itself.  
     
      
    67 The views of the Department of Corrective Services, however, appear very clearly from Mr Hovey's affidavit. He has candidly indicated that his Department is more than happy with the fully screened dock because each of the men is classified “AA”, and is therefore a maximum security inmate considered by the Commissioner to be a risk to national security. Such a person ""should at all times be confined in special facilities within a secure physical barrier"". This of course was not the only factor that led to Mr Hovey's satisfaction with the present situation, but it was plainly an important one.  
     
      
    68 The subtle conflict I have referred to resides in the fact that the Attorney General's Department does not consider this an “AA” security courtroom containing a dock that has been built with that classification in mind, whereas Corrective Services sees it as perfectly properly fulfilling that function. Indeed, the fact that it does fulfil that function is an important factor in the Corrective Services Department satisfaction with the security issues in the courtroom at the present time.  
     
      
    69 It is not necessary for me to resolve this apparent area of ""subtle conflict"". It is sufficient simply to address the concerns of each Department, or at least evaluate the principal argument addressed on behalf of each Department.  
     
      
    70 So far as the suggestion that each of the accused represents a risk to national security, this appears to arise principally, if not entirely, from the classification itself. No evidence has been placed before me to suggest that, during the last three years, there has been any serious incident or activity involving any of accused that would enliven a conclusion that there is a risk to national security. Of course, it might be said that they have been incarcerated, restrained and subject to such stringent security measures that it is unsurprising that anything untoward has occurred. Whether this be so or not, the fact remains that I have not been provided with any material to suggest that, during their time in prison, the accused have been a risk to national security otherwise than by virtue of the charge each is facing. It is of course not appropriate, in the present context, to consider the range of activities that are alleged in the charge against the accused. Each has pleaded not guilty and is entitled to the presumption of the innocence.  
     
      
    71 In addition to these observations, I have not been made aware of any other matter involving the accused prior to their arrest that would involve an arguable risk to national security or to security generally. I am, of course, aware that at the time of his arrest Omar Baladjam was allegedly involved in a violent incident involving firearms. But apart from that, I am not aware of any other matter involving either Baladjam, or any of the other accused, that would enable me to say that any of the men pose an actual risk to national security. I have observed on occasions some of the accused acting in a moderately disruptive way while they have been in the dock. This, however, has been relatively minor and does not, in any sense, equate to a risk to national security. There have been no “incidents”. 
     
      
    72 I turn then to the arguments advanced on behalf of the Attorney General’s Department. Accepting that a flexible dock, but nevertheless a high security dock, is the preferred option of the Department in building new criminal courts or refurbishing old ones, the argument based on that policy does not especially advance the Department's contention. Mr Marshall's affidavit makes it plain that a flexible dock was not put in Courtroom 5 because it simply could not be fitted there. Secondly, the argument based on the proposition that the glass wall is a permanent feature does not carry with it the weight that might attach if under consideration were a substantial structure, difficult to remove and only capable of removal at considerable expense. 
     
      
    73 In any event, the decision I must make, although it may properly take into account the two views I have ascribed to the respective Departments, cannot be bound by those views in a determinative fashion. I have to give proper weight to those views. But, importantly, I have to balance those views against the ability of the accused to obtain a fair trial. I now turn to that consideration. This is the fundamental one for present purposes.  
     
      
    74 My general view is that the presence of the fixed screen will make it more difficult for the accused to get a fair trial. I consider that the sense will inevitably be conveyed to a jury of 15 that these men do represent in fact a risk to the community, to people in the courtroom and perhaps to national security itself. The screen plainly separates them from the jury and everybody else in the courtroom. Images of other trials in far distant countries will inevitably present themselves to members of the jury when they first see the situation of the accused behind a fixed screen. The problem caused by the presence of the fixed screen will be exacerbated by the secondary problems arising from the difficulty of communication between client and lawyer. This will inevitably lead to an observation by the jury that, on a very regular basis, communication is significantly limited by the presence of the screen. Observations of this kind are likely to feed into the overall sense, principally caused by the presence of the screen, that these are dangerous people.  
     
      
    75 I need to temper these remarks in some small way. Overall, the courtroom presents a very light and airy appearance. It is not dungeon like nor old fashioned in any respect. The dock is of a very modern design and it contains, for example, very comfortable and pleasantly designed seating for the accused. In general, the dock area and its amenities contrast very favourably with other accommodation for accused people in criminal courts in Sydney, and especially country areas. Nevertheless, it will probably be quite apparent to the jury that the accused are in custody, and that there is a significant Corrective Services presence associated with their custodial situation, even while they are in the dock. It might be said that each of those last matters are capable of evincing prejudice. I accept that is so, but I am perfectly satisfied that the usual directions to the jury, if they become necessary, will enable that situation to be addressed. It is not a situation out of the ordinary. 
     
      
    76 I am less comfortable with the proposition that directions will cure the problems associated with the fixed screen. I do not entirely accept Mr Turnbull's forceful submissions that directions in relation to that topic simply would not work. I think that a carefully crafted direction would have the capacity to alleviate the type of prejudice that is likely to be evinced by the presence of the fixed screen. Generally, I take the view that juries pay heed to the trial judge's direction. But I do not feel entirely comfortable, or by any means satisfied, that directions regarding the presence of the fixed screen would be sufficient.  
     
      
    77 This level of uncertainty is reinforced when I consider the other likely prejudices that might operate on the jury's mind in the forthcoming trial. First, there are the charges against the accused themselves. Secondly, there is the nature of the evidence to be adduced during the trial and its summation in the Crown opening. The very nature of this evidence will hardly endear the accused to members of the jury. Nevertheless, this is a common situation in a criminal trial, and juries generally respect the directions of the trial judge in relation to the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof, and the need to keep an open mind until the conclusion of all the evidence and addresses. But here there will be a number of added prejudices. There is the prejudice arising from the fact that it is a trial involving Muslim men said to be involved in terrorist activities. The accused, so far as I can gather, will choose to dress in clothing that reflects their Islamic culture and religion. A number of the accused are bearded and this too, as I understand it, is a reflection of spiritual values in Islamic culture. Their dress and appearance may present them as “outsiders”. The accused have refused to stand when the Judge comes into the courtroom or when he leaves. I assume that a similar attitude will be taken to the situation when the jury come into and leave the courtroom. I am not concerned to be critical about the accused in relation to any of these matters. Their dress, appearance and behaviour in terms of courtesy, is entirely a matter for them. But all these are additional matters of prejudice or possible prejudice that are likely to be present throughout the trial.  
     
      
    78 In my opinion, the presence of the glass screen is but one more layer of prejudice (perhaps one that is more significant than any of the others), and it is an aspect of prejudice that can be avoided altogether by relatively simple and comparatively inexpensive means.  
     
      
    79 I accept that the circumstances of this case are quite different from those adjudicated upon by Bongiorno J in R v Benbrika. The fundamental principles, however, are the same. It is my view that those principles, in the circumstances of the present matter, dictate the same result. I do not dispute the right of the Attorney General's Department to require that its multi-accused courtroom should be equipped with a fixed dock. I make no comment on that policy or on the appropriateness of that situation for any other trial that may take place in this courtroom, or for that matter anywhere else in the State. My concern is with this courtroom, this trial and the ability of these men to get a fair trial. I am satisfied, however, that there is a real risk to the fairness of this trial if the dock remains as it is.  
     
      
    80 I propose to direct that the fixed dock be removed for the purpose of this trial. I leave it to the relevant parties involved in the application to discuss the nature and timing of its removal.

      JUDGMENT - Application to exclude evidence of statements made by Khaled Sharrouf – hearsay rule (s 59 Evidence Act 1995); s 61 of Evidence Act (competency); ss 90, 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: This is an application on behalf of Khaled Cheikho seeking, pursuant to s 61 of the Evidence Act 1995, to exclude statements made by Khaled Sharrouf on various dates between 19 August 2004 and 6 November 2005. Exhibit “A” on the voir dire is a schedule of all those statements. Originally, there were some 214 statements, although a number of these have now been eliminated on the basis that the Crown will not press them at trial. There remains, however, a very substantial number of statements to be considered.  
     
      
    2 Section 61 of the Evidence Act 1995 is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “61 Exceptions to the hearsay rule dependent on competency 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) This Part does not enable use of a previous representation to prove the existence of an asserted fact if, when the representation was made, the person who made it was not competent to give evidence about the fact because he or she was incapable of giving a rational reply to a question about the fact. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) This section does not apply to a contemporaneous representation made by a person about his or her health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (3) For the purposes of this section, it is presumed, unless the contrary is proved, that when the representation was made the person who made it was competent to give evidence about the asserted fact.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    3 The original submission filed on behalf of Khaled Cheikho made the following statements by way of introduction: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown, in seeking to prove the commission of the offences charged, relies upon various statements made by the co-accused Khaled Sharrouf. Some of those statements will presumably be relied upon as admissions against Mr Sharrouf himself. It will presumably be argued also that such statements are made in furtherance of the conspiracy and, accordingly, are admissible against the accused, Khaled Cheikho, pursuant to section 87(1)(c)  
        Evidence Act 
         1995. It is submitted that any such statements may not be admitted, since they violate the rule against hearsay.” 
        
       
      
    4 The submission proceeded on the basis that there was already (and would be further) material before the Court to demonstrate that Mr Sharrouf had been suffering from a mental illness during the period of the alleged conspiracy. The submission then addressed the “probability” that Mr Sharrouf's mental state was such that he would not have been capable of giving rational replies to questions about the facts asserted in the statements allegedly made by him. 
     
      
       
      Background – Sharrouf is found unfit 
       
      
    5 On 25 June 2008 I found that Khaled Sharrouf was, at that time, unfit to be tried. This was on the basis that medical and psychiatric evidence placed before me established that the accused Sharrouf was currently suffering from schizophrenia. It was against that medical background that I found he was unfit for trial. I pointed out in the decision (R v Khaled Sharrouf [No 2], paragraph 23) that the finding was confined to an assessment of his mental health situation at that precise point of time in June 2008. The finding expressly said nothing about his condition at any earlier point of time. A finding that a person is unfit for trial is not to be equated with a finding that a person was not, at an earlier point of time, competent to give evidence about a fact because he or she was incapable at that time of giving a rational reply to a question about that fact. 
     
      
    6 Against the background of the finding of unfitness, counsel for Khaled Cheikho undertook to provide the Court with evidence that would tend to show that Mr Sharrouf had been incompetent, in the sense provided for in ss 13(3) and 61.1 of the Evidence Act. This was the foreshadowing of an application on behalf of all the remaining accused. In effect, the accused sought to take forensic advantage of Sharrouf’s mental and psychiatric condition. 
     
      
    7 On 1 July 2008 Dr Olav Nielssen provided a report in relation to the contemplated application under s 61 of the Evidence Act 1995. In preparing his report, Dr Nielssen had been supplied with medical reports from Mr Sharrouf's general practitioner, Dr Alsayed, those reports running from 2 October 1999 to 25 October 2005. Dr Nielssen also had the medical records of a treating psychiatrist Dr Ishrat Ali. These were dated between 12 September 2002 and 27 October 2005. There were other medical records and documents, including copies of notes made by a psychologist, Natasha Langovski. I gather that these related to examinations in June 2004.  
     
      
    8 Dr Nielssen had been asked to give an opinion as to his perception of Mr Sharrouf's mental state during the period of the alleged conspiracy, that is the period 8 July 2004 to 8 November 2005. He, of course, had not been, in a professional sense, personally involved with Mr Sharrouf until mid-September 2005. The opinion, however, was stated in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The medical records confirm that the diagnosis of the chronic mental illness schizophrenia was made by a psychiatrist in 2002 and that Mr Sharrouf received treatment with antipsychotic medication from that time. When Mr Sharrouf was assessed by Ms Langovski in June 2004, he reported that symptoms of schizophrenia were present all the time and were only partly relieved by treatment with antipsychotic medication. When I interviewed Mr Sharrouf on 19 September 2005 I found him to have a significant communication disorder that was thought to be due to symptoms of a disabling form of schizophrenia. Hence in my opinion Mr Sharrouf was significantly affected by symptoms of schizophrenia during the period of the conspiracy. 
        
       
       
        
        From the information provided by his wife and an examination of the prescription records, it seems likely that Mr Sharrouf received consistent treatment with antipsychotic medication for at least part of the sixteen months prior to 8 November 2005. However, on the basis of the history provided to Ms Langovski, his symptoms were only partly responsive to treatment. Moreover it looks as though Mr Sharrouf was receiving prescriptions for the amphetamine-like appetite suppressants Duramine and Dospan from his general practitioner during 2003 and 2004, which are likely to have exacerbated symptoms of schizophrenia.  
        
       
       
        
        The presence of acute symptoms of schizophrenia and the effect of chronic schizophrenia on all aspects of Mr Sharrouf's intellectual function is likely to have had a significant impact on his perception of the events and the reliability of any statements he made in the period between 8 July 2004 and 8 November 2005.” 
        
       
      
    9 The Court was also provided with a report from the treating psychiatrist Dr Ishrat Ali. This is dated 15 July 2008. Dr Ali said he first saw Mr Sharrouf on 12 September 2002 when he was referred to him by the GP Dr Alsayed of Lakemba. Dr Ali said he had seen Mr Sharrouf on ""several occasions"" since then. Dr Ali prescribed medication. He said that Mr Sharrouf's symptoms showed some progress, but fluctuated. This was as a result of his taking medications irregularly. Later on his medication was changed to Zyprexa. This last time he saw Mr Sharrouf was on 27 October 2005. At that time, Dr Ali said his patient's symptoms were ""under control"" and he was on both Avenza (an antidepressant) and Zyprexa (an antipsychotic). Dr Ali expressed his current opinion in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “As a result of his illness and its symptoms his judgment and ability to do things will be affected from time to time. This is because of the following reasons: 
        
       
       
        
        1. He will have hallucinations and delusional ideas which could affect his judgment and ability to appreciate the consequence of some of his actions. 
        
       
       
        
        2. As people with schizophrenia often have difficulty in making decisions, he will be more susceptible than a normal person to be influenced by the suggestions of other people. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His judgment will be clouded by his delusions. 
        
       
       
        
        As a result of that his competency was reduced, especially during the period from 2004 to October 2005."" 
        
       
       
      A preliminary “comment” 
       
      
    10 I understand that there are other clinical notes and records that have not as yet been tendered before the Court. In addition, the Crown has not yet responded to the evidence filed on behalf of Khaled Cheikho. I determined however, that the Crown need not make an immediate decision about calling evidence at this time, because of an important preliminary point taken on the Crown's behalf. I will turn to that important preliminary point in a moment. It is appropriate, however, to note that I am by no means in a position to make any final decision in relation to the s 61 application because the evidence is not complete, nor has there been any opportunity to test the evidence at this stage. I will simply observe, in an entirely preliminary fashion, that the material filed thus far hardly could be said to establish, as it must do, that Mr Sharrouf was not competent to give evidence about any particular fact he may have asserted in any of the statements under challenge. The general nature of the observations made both by Dr Nielssen and Dr Ali highlight that there may be a real question over the reliability of any statements of fact asserted by Mr Sharrouf in the relevant period. It would seem, at first blush, they scarcely do much more than that.  
     
      
    11 The fact that an accused person, who has, for example, allegedly confessed to committing a crime, may have been, at the time of the confession, suffering from some form of unsoundness of mind or psychiatric disorder may, depending upon the circumstances, be of importance in considering the evidentiary value of the confession. It may, in some circumstances deprive it of all evidentiary value (Jackson v The Queen (1962) 108 CLR 51). The fact of mental illness does not, however, necessarily make evidence of the confession inadmissible (Sinclair v The King (1946) 73 CLR 316). This is because an insane person is not necessarily an incompetent witness. Persons who are intellectually handicapped or who suffer from disease or disorder of the mind are by no means necessarily incapable of telling, or admitting, the truth (R v Michael John Parker (1990) 19 NSWLR 177). Nor, it might be observed, are such persons necessarily incapable of giving a rational reply or making a rational remark about a particular situation. Here, of course, we are not concerned, as will be apparent, with confessions, but with statements of a much lower content and effect. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The Crown's preliminary point 
       
      
    12 The matter raised by the Crown plainly had practical consequences for the procedural aspects of the s 61 application. I shall identify the preliminary matter. The Crown pointed to the provisions of s 61(2) which I have set out above. By that time there had arisen a fairly clear agreement between the Crown and the lawyers for Khaled Cheikho concerning the nature of the material in the statements that would, in fact, be sought to be excluded. The Crown indicated that it did not intend to place any of the ""objected to"" portions of Mr Sharrouf's statements before the jury as evidence of the truth of those statements. In other words, it was not proposing to rely upon any of the statements for a hearsay purpose. The Crown submitted that the evidence would be sought to be used in two ways. First, as direct and non-hearsay evidence adduced, in connection with other circumstantial evidence, relevant to, and in proof of, the existence and scope of the alleged conspiracy. Secondly, the evidence would be tendered, not to prove the truth of anything stated by Mr Sharrouf, but simply as material going to or capable of reflecting upon his intention, knowledge or state of mind. If Sharrouf remained a party to the proceedings, the evidence would not be tendered against him as an admission, at least at this stage. Thirdly, if Mr Sharrouf were severed from the indictment, evidence of his actions and words would still be relevant on the basis that the Crown would seek to prove that he was one of the conspirators. But again, the particular evidence would not be sought to be used as an admission or for any hearsay purpose.  
     
      
    13 The Crown's preliminary point was that, as a consequence, there was no real legal basis for the s 61 application. The essential argument postulated that none of the statements were relied upon to prove the ""existence of an asserted fact"" as referred to in s 61 of the Evidence Act. Accordingly, s 61(1) had no application. Alternatively, the Crown submitted that if s 61(1) were engaged at all in relation to any of the statements, they each fell within the specific exemption provided under s 61(2).  
     
      
    14 Mr Waterstreet, who presented the arguments for Khaled Cheikho, made two specific responses. First, he argued that both ss 72 and 61(2) of the Evidence Act ought be read down and not applied literally. Counsel submitted that the common law concerns with the erosion of the hearsay rule ought apply to the interpretation of these sections of the Evidence Act. In addition, Mr Waterstreet argued that ss 135 and 137 of the Evidence Act ought be applied so as to exclude the evidence. This was on the basis (as argued in subsequent written submissions) that statements by Mr Sharrouf might properly be regarded as inherently unreliable, and that it would be unfairly prejudicial, both to him and to the other accused, if the evidence were to be admitted. The unreliability was said to derive directly from his mental condition.  
     
      
    15 These submissions were picked up by Mr Dalton on behalf of Mr Elomar. Mr Dalton accepted that concerns relating to the credibility or reliability of a witness whose evidence was sought to be excluded under s 137 had no place to play in the s 137 exercise, having regard to recent decisions of the Court of Criminal Appeal. (Those decisions, and the general thrust of the section, had been examined by me in earlier decisions, R v Baladjam [No 3] and R v Baladjam [No 8]). Mr Dalton submitted that an inherent weakness based on, for example, mental illness, might nevertheless be taken into account when assessing the issue of ""unfair prejudice"". In so doing, Mr Dalton submitted that the Court might consider matters going to the weight or reliability of the evidence that could not adequately be dealt with or addressed before the jury. Counsel pointed to a number of aspects that, in the present matter, might go to unfair prejudice. These included:  
     
      
       
      - The jury would either not have psychiatric evidence before them, or 
       
       
      - If they did, it would introduce an unnecessary and confusing side issue into the trial 
       
       
      - It would be difficult for the jury to assess the evidence for themselves 
       
       
      - The jury would not have the advantage of being able to see Mr Sharrouf in order to form an assessment of him 
       
       
      - There would be no way for the defence to test Sharrouf's ""evidence"".  
       
      
    16 Mr Dalton submitted that to allow this body of evidence before the jury would mean that, in relation to a number of the statements, there would be conversations between two people, neither of whom were before the jury or present as witnesses. For these reasons, Mr Dalton joined in Mr Waterstreet's argument about s 137. Mr Dalton also submitted that, to the extent that Sharrouf's statements might be seen as admissions, they should be excluded under s 90 of the Evidence Act 1995. In particular, it would be unfair to the other accused because they would have no ability upon the question of the admissibility of these conversations to challenge the truth of such utterances insofar as they were not in fact representative of Mr Sharrouf's state of mind, but rather an outcome of his mental illness.  
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    17 The first issue requires a determination of the purpose for which the Crown proposes to tender the evidence. The various statements by Mr Sharrouf are not to be tendered to prove the truth of anything he said, but to reveal the nature of the relationship between himself and the other accused. It will be relied upon to prove the level of the association between Sharrouf and the other accused. Its tender will show the depths and dynamics of that association. The evidence is to show, as well, the nature of the things that were discussed between the other accused and Sharrouf. On occasions, it will also be relevant to show topics that were not openly discussed between them. In this latter regard, the Crown will allege that a significant aspect of the alleged conspiracy was the need to avoid detection and adopt counter-surveillance techniques. Naturally, these were at a fairly unsophisticated level, according to the Crown case, but reticence on a particular subject may, in certain circumstances, speak, if not volumes, at least well above a whisper.  
     
      
    18 In a conspiracy case, the fact of association between people, the nature of the association, the common beliefs and topics they discuss between themselves, may all throw light on the question as to whether there is a combination for an unlawful purpose. The actions of the alleged conspirators may only be properly understood in the light of the extent and dynamics of the relationship. So too, in a particular case, where the defendants assert that their actions are completely innocent, considerable light may be thrown upon such a proposition by evidence demonstrating the nature of their relationship and the extent their common interests and association. 
     
      
    19 All this is, in my opinion, relevant to the first point at issue. It may readily be accepted that the evidence the Crown seeks to lead is relevant to facts in issue in the trial, or, at least, to facts relevant to facts in issue. In my opinion, that is clearly the situation. 
     
      
    20 This conclusion leads to the second issue: The Crown does not seek to rely upon the statements of Mr Sharrouf for the purposes of any fact they may assert. Indeed, in the main, the statements do not assert, in any event, facts of this kind. If that be the situation in general terms, then s 61 has no application to the general body of statements the Crown intends to adduce. Although it will be necessary for me to examine individual statements and to comment on their relevance and the way in which they are to be used, generally I accept that the statements are admissible as falling outside the hearsay rule, and that s 61(1) can have no application to them.  
     
      
    21 The third issue arises as an alternative to the first and second. This is the proposition that the evidence, in any event, is properly categorised as an exception to s 61(1) of the Act. In this area, this is so because of the exception created by s 61(2) of the Act. On this point, I accept the submissions of the Crown in preference to those of the accused. Section 72 of the Evidence Act (which is in identical terms to the relevant portions of s 61(2) of the Act) relevantly provides for an exception to the hearsay rule. Although there may have been some controversy at common law, at least in the mind of learned academic writers, the common law had, in general terms, accepted the admissibility of out of court statements tending to prove the maker's knowledge intention or state of mind where that knowledge intention or state of mind is a fact in issue, or a fact relevant to a fact in issue (Walton v R (1989) 16 CLR 283 at (9), (24) and (31); Kamleh v R [2005] 79 ALJR 541; [2005] 213 ALR 97; [2005] HCA 2).  
     
      
    22 In Walton, a murder case, evidence was led as to statements made by the deceased to witnesses to the effect that she was going to meet the accused at a time relevant to when she died. The prosecution led the evidence to prove the intention or state of mind of the deceased. There was also evidence that the accused had said that he was going to meet the deceased. Mason CJ said (at 288): 
     
      
       
        
        “The hearsay rule applies only to out of court statements tendered for the purpose of directly proving that the facts are as asserted in the statement. Generally speaking, evidence of out of court statements relied on for another purpose is not excluded by the rule. Thus, evidence of a relevant out of court statement is admissible evidence of the maker's knowledge or state of mind when he made the statement in a case where such knowledge or state of mind is a fact in issue or a fact relevant to a fact in issue...similarly, a person's statements or declaration or an accepted means of proving his intentions in circumstances where it is material to prove what those intentions were. As Mellish LJ remarked in  
        Sugden v Lord St Leonards  
        (1876) 1 PD 154 at 251: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'Wherever it is material to prove the state of a person's mind or what was passing in it, and what were his intentions, there you may prove what he said.' 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The point is that the making of the statement is itself evidence of the author's intentions at the time the statement was made. Evidence of the making of the evidence may be given by the author himself, or, in the case of an oral statement, by any person who heard it made.” 
        
       
      
    23 In the same case, Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (at 300): 
     
      
       
        
        “That evidence may, of course, take the form of conduct on the part of the person whose state of mind is in question from which the state of mind might be inferred. But it might also take the form of statements made by the person or by another from which a similar inference might be made.” 
        
       
      
    24 And later: 
     
      
       
        
        “As we have said, not all conduct involving an assertion, express or implied, is treated as hearsay and held to be inadmissible in evidence. If it were, the available evidence in many cases would be seriously depleted. The distinction to be drawn is that to which we have referred, namely the distinction between evidence of conduct which, even though it may contain an assertion, is tendered as a relevant fact or a fact relevant to a fact at issue and is therefore admissible and evidence of conduct which has no probative value other than as an assertion and is therefore not admissible.” 
        
       
      
    25 Deane J (who was in dissent) relevantly observed at (31): 
     
      
       
        
        “I agree that evidence of a relevant out of court statement is admissible to prove the maker's knowledge or state of mind in a case where that knowledge or state of mind is itself a fact in issue or provable...as a fact relevant to a fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    26 In a recent decision of the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong Mr McHugh NPJ (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) made a number of illuminating remarks on the hearsay position at common law. (The decision may be found under the following citation: Oeng Hengky Wiryo v HKSAR (2007) HKCFA 8, 9 February 2007). His Honour, after explaining the emergence and rationale for the hearsay rule said at paras 39 and 40: 
     
      
       
        
        “39. To determine whether the hearsay rule has been breached, it is necessary to determine the purpose for which evidence of an out of court statement is tendered. An out of court statement made in the absence of a party is not necessarily inadmissible. As long as its contents are not relied on to prove a fact recited or asserted, it will be admissible if it tends to prove a fact in issue or a fact relevant to a fact in issue. As Mr Justice Ferguson explained in ' 
        Hearsay Evidence 
        ' (1927) 1 ALJ 195 at 196 in a passage cited with approval by Gleeson CJ and myself in  
        Kamleh v The Queen  
        (2005) 79 ALJR 541 at 544: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'The hearsay rule does not forbid the proof of what somebody said out of court. What it does forbid is the proof of a fact by telling what somebody said about that fact out of court, a very different matter. Whether the evidence in any particular instance is admissible or not depends upon the question what fact it tends to prove.' 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        40. In  
        Subramaniam v Public Prosecutor  
        (1956) 1 WLR 965 at 970, in a passage that has come to be regarded as a classic statement of the hearsay rule, the judicial committal of the Privy Council said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'Evidence of a statement made to a witness by a person who is not himself called as a witness may or may not be hearsay. It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement. It is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement, but the fact that it was made.'“ 
          
         
        
       
      
    27 McHugh J gave examples of situations where evidence of out of court statements will not constitute hearsay. Thus, evidence as to what is said by a party or person out of court will be admissible to prove that person's state of mind where it is a relevant issue. Indeed, evidence as to what is said to a party or a person out of court will also be admissible to prove that person's state of mind where it is a relevant issue. His Honour noted that the classic example of this situation occurred in Subramaniam itself where the judicial committee held, contrary to the ruling of the trial judge, that the hearsay rule would not be infringed by evidence of threats made by terrorists to the accused. The evidence had been tendered to prove that the accused had acted under duress in having illegal possession of ammunition. McHugh J then dealt specifically with both Walton's case and Kamleh v The Queen. 
     
      
       
        
        “44. Evidence that a person had said that he or she was intending to meet somebody or to do something may be evidence of conduct that is relevant to an issue and therefore admissible because a statement of intention is admissible to prove that the person did the intended act. In  
        Walton v The Queen 
        ...a majority of the High Court of Australia held that, where the accused had said that he was going to meet the deceased, evidence that the deceased had told a witness that she was going to meet the accused was admissible to prove that she had in fact met him. As Wilson, Dawson and Toohey JJ said (at 300): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'Her intention at that time was relevant because it might be inferred that she acted in accordance with her intention.' 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        45. Evidence of an out of court statement may also be admissible to prove a person's knowledge of facts for the purpose of establishing that that person was in a place at a particular time. From proof of that fact and other evidence, it may be possible to infer that another person was also at that place at that time. In  
        Kamleh 
        , the High Court of Australia unanimously held that no breach of the hearsay rule occurred where, on the trial of the accused for murder, the prosecution tendered evidence that Z had told another person that the television set in the murdered person's apartment had been turned up to its highest volume immediately before the killing. Evidence of this conversation was tendered to prove that the accused was also present at the killing. To that end, the prosecution proved that, when the bodies of the deceased were found, the television was in fact turned up to full volume. Hence, Z's knowledge of this fact indicated that he was present in the deceaseds' apartment that night. Moreover, his presence also tended to prove that the accused was present in the apartment at that time because the accused had claimed that he was always in Z's presence at relevant times on the night of the murder.” 
        
       
      
    28 Finally at 53, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The purpose of this extended discussion of hearsay cases is to show that, in a variety of contexts, out of court statements may be admissible in evidence, whether or not they were made in the presence of a party affected by its admission and to show that inferences may properly be drawn from those statements both to prove a fact in issue or to provide a factual foundation for inferring a fact in issue. In some cases, the out of court statement may be used alone or in conjunction with other facts or statements to disprove a fact.” 
        
       
      
    29 Whatever may have been the situation at common law, the position in this State is now made clear by the terms of s 72 of the Evidence Act. In R v Clark (2001) 123 A Crim R 506 at 577 (147), Heydon JA (with whom Bell J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second question is the operation of exclusionary rules. The only relevant exclusionary rule was the hearsay rule (s 59). So far as the impugned evidence was hearsay, it was rendered admissible by s 72 that provides: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          'The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation made by a person that was a contemporaneous representation about the person's health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind.' 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        The appellant submitted that in 'dealing with the admissibility of evidence under s 72, some restrictions must apply, otherwise such a broad interpretation would abrogate the use of the hearsay rule (see notes 72.1, Odgers, Uniform Evidence Law (Fourth Edition 2000).)' That passage opposes: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘the potentially wide interpretation which could be given to the terms “knowledge” and “state of mind”...to include “belief” or “memory”...[Such] an interpretation will effectively abrogate the hearsay rule as contained in s 59.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        That suggested vice is not inherent in the construction of s 72 which is to be applied in rendering admissible the evidence of the deceased's statements to prove her state of mind in this case. The appellant was unable to suggest any other relevant construction of s 72."" 
        
       
      
    30 In Kamleh v The Queen, Gleeson CJ and McHugh J in their joint judgment said at (23), after discussing Walton's case: 
     
      
       
        
        “There being no challenge to  
        Walton 
        , it is unnecessary to pursue the significance, if any, of the difference in the majority reasoning. It may be noted that, in those Australian jurisdictions where the  
        Uniform Evidence Act  
        applies, it is now provided by a statute that the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a representation made by a person being a contemporaneous representation about the person's intention.” 
        
       
      
    31 In the same decision Kirby J said at (28): 
     
      
       
        
        “Because in this appeal there was no direct challenge to the reasoning of Mason CJ in  
        Walton 
         and because the residual common law rule has been overtaken in four Australian jurisdictions by the  
        Uniform Evidence Acts 
        , I would not struggle in this instance to resolve the point concerning the statement of intention of Mr Zappia.” 
        
       
      
    32 (His Honour went on to hold that the prosecution case against the appellant was compelling, and his conviction was inevitable on the admissible evidence. No miscarriage of justice was involved.) 
     
      
    33 These statements, emanating from judges of high stature, fly directly in the face of Mr Waterstreet's submission. The written submissions suggested, somewhat audaciously, that Kirby J's remarks were ""incorrect"", although the submission made no reference to the remarks of the Chief Justice and McHugh J. Secondly, the oral submissions suggested that more weight be given to the obiter remarks of Levine J in R v Polkinghorne (1999) 108 A Crim R 189, 193 at (25) where his Honour had expressed some doubts about the extent of s 72 of the Evidence Act, having regard to the common law position. In my opinion, there is no warrant for giving s 72 of the Evidence Act a narrower interpretation than is conveyed by the plain and perfectly clear language used. The remarks of Levine J in R v Polkinghorne understandably reflect no more than the cautious response of a mind attempting to come to grips with the new legislation after years of immersion in the common law. The decision of Grove J in R v Barbaro and Rovere (2000) 112 A Crim R 551, 559 at 42 is dealing with a specific problem and does not warrant or justify a narrow reading of the section.  
     
      
    34 Similarly, the decision of R v Hannes (2000) 158 FLR 359, 441-2 at (480) needs to be seen in the context in which the particular point was decided. There, Studdert J made it clear that the document sought to be tendered by the defendant at trial was a self-serving statement. No matter how the argument was presented, the real purpose of the tender was not to show the state of mind or intention of Mr Hannes, but rather it was to persuade the tribunal of fact that the fictitious Mr Booth really existed.  
     
      
    35 Finally, there is little point in my attempting to analyse and dissect the remarks of the members of the High Court in Kamleh v The Queen. It is true that some misgivings were articulated concerning the decision of Mason CJ in Walton. But as I have said, the Evidence Act has overtaken the common law situation in a very clear manner. The real concern expressed by some members of the High Court, and academic writers, is that, in Walton, the intention evidence may have been used directly to show that the accused’s intention had been carried out. As I will endeavour to show in the present matter, that concern simply does not arise in connection with the Sharrouf statements.  
     
      
    36 This discussion has taken me some distance away from the section under consideration. I shall conclude this part of the decision by making a few brief comments about the operation of s 61 of the Evidence Act. Those remarks may be appropriate at this point, and helpful in understanding an examination of a number of the particular statements made by Mr Sharrouf. As I have said, these will be examined shortly.  
     
      
    37 The Evidence Act assumes that some previous representations will be admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule contained in s 59 of the Act. The thrust of s 61 is to focus, first, on representations of this kind that are sought to be tendered to prove an asserted fact (""I was at X's house when the shooting occurred""). Secondly, the section prohibits the use, for example, of an admission of this kind when the representor was ""incompetent"" i.e. incapable at the time of the statement of giving a rational reply to a question about ""the fact"". (The fact intended to be asserted). (See Cox v State of New South Wales (2007) NSWSC 471 per Simpson J at (11)-(17) for an analogous situation in the civil law.) The section applies, of course, not only to admissions, but to all previous representations where a fact has been asserted.  
     
      
    38 Thirdly, there is a presumption about competency. The onus falls on the person asserting lack of competence to prove that, at the time the representation was made, the representor was not competent to give evidence about the asserted fact. Since this may require an examination of a person's competence at an earlier and particular point of time, it is a difficult onus to discharge, although the level of proof is merely on the balance of probabilities. Fourthly, the section excludes from its ambit contemporaneous representations made by a person about his or her health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind (""I am intending to go to Melbourne""). Thus, in a given situation, a witness might be unable to give evidence about his earlier state of mind (incapable of giving a rational reply about that fact), but, if relevant to the issues, an out of court statement he or she made on that very topic at the earlier point of time may be admissible. This situation arises from the combined operation of s 13, s 61 and s 72 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    39 Since the introduction of the Evidence Act, evidence has been allowed in under s 72 of the Act dealing with intention (R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at para 29) and in R v Clark on ""state of mind"". (See also Ung [2000] 112 A Crim R 344 for a case that “straddles” both the common law and the Evidence Act). These cases stand directly in the way of the submissions filed on behalf of Khaled Cheikho. In the present case, statements which, by their very terms, are capable of reflecting Mr Sharrouf's state of mind, knowledge and intention, are relevant, on a non-hearsay basis, together with other evidence, in relation to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. The fact that the words were used, and the words themselves, are relevant on this basis They are admissible in this way against all the accused. They are also, however, relevant to his own actions and to the intentions and state of mind underlying those actions. The Crown does not, however, rely on these statements as to the truth of any fact intended to be asserted by Sharrouf. Indeed, the majority of statements do not assert any facts at all. If Mr Sharrouf is granted a separate trial, evidence of his statements and actions will remain nonetheless relevant in the present trial, on the basis that the Crown alleges that he was at all times a co-conspirator in relation to the alleged conspiracy.

    41 I have elsewhere described the nature of the Crown case. The Crown alleges that there is a combination between these men. It is necessary to examine carefully, for the purposes of the Crown case, the actual association between them. This will involve not merely evidence of what they do and where they go together. There will be a considerable body of surveillance evidence to demonstrate those matters. It will also involve analysing what they say to one another, what they say about one another, and what they say to third parties about themselves and one another. In respect to these last matters, the words actually spoken will be more important than the facts, if any, described in those conversations.  
     
      
    42 The words used will often convey approval, disapproval, dissatisfaction or pleasure. The conversations may embrace matters of everyday experience. They may embrace matters involving religious notions. They may involve matters of a political kind.  
     
      
    43 As I say, the Crown needs to prove a combination between the men and it needs to prove a combination of a very specific kind, namely that contemplated by the charge in the indictment. The general complaint by the defence that there are simply too many conversations sought to be relied on, and that virtually any conversation may be relevant to the Crown case, is met by the proposition that the Crown is entitled to adduce in evidence conversations that are relevant to the fact of combination, to the nature of the combination and, ultimately, to the asserted purpose underlying the activities of each of the accused said to be in connection with the combination. Of course, I do not suggest that the Crown should necessarily lead evidence of every conversation that is capable of being relevant in this way. The trial will never end if the Crown takes such a position. It is partly for that reason that I have suggested that there be a meeting between the Crown and the defence in an endeavour to limit, circumscribe and delineate the scope of the evidence to be led in the trial.  
     
      
    44 To return to the conversations and the relevance of those to the Crown case: Factors relevant to the existence of the combination in the present matter, according to the Crown case, include the level of association, the type of association and the nature of common interests shared between those associating. Once again, the words used in conversations can often demonstrate the level and dynamics of the association quite apart from the truth of the matters discussed in those conversations. An obvious example is in the area where the discussions are about the need for covert behaviour to avoid surveillance. Another area of obvious relevance is the continued discussion about sharing material recorded from television programmes or downloaded from computers. The very talk of sharing of commonly admired material is relevant both to the existence of the combination and to the nature of the activities carried out pursuant to the combination. As I have said in earlier judgments, the defence case is likely to be that the Crown has simply misunderstood and overreacted to a number of innocent activities. The defence case will identify that young Muslim men are very concerned with world affairs and political behaviour in this country. The defence case will be that many of the alleged ""overt acts"" are quite capable of an innocent explanation, against the background of these well-motivated and justified Muslim concerns. In this respect, also, the evidence of association, type of association, level and dynamics of association are relevant to rebut the defence case and to establish the Crown case beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    45 It may be said that the Crown case begins with evidence of individual accused carrying out activities that might be said to have a suspicious content. For example, the purchasing of laboratory equipment, chemicals, ammunition and the like. The Crown case then focuses upon the fact that many of these activities are being carried out in an extremely covert and secretive way. There are, for example, false names, false mobiles and a high level of counter-surveillance activity.  
     
      
    46 The Crown case asks: What does all this behaviour point to? The evidence then descends to a considerable amount of detail involving surveillance, telephone intercepts and listening device material. As I have indicated, this will often show what the accused are doing both individually and together. It will also focus, however, on what they say about what they are doing either singly or collectively. Once again, evidence of their actual words (what they say to each other) is just as relevant as their conduct as being capable of reflecting in a circumstantial way, the final conclusion the Crown will ask the jury to draw when all the material is assembled together to present a final landscape. In addition, the fact that certain of their activities are not mentioned in their conversation will give an indication that those particular activities are themselves intended to be covert and secretive. This is, for example, the position on the ""training camps"" in remote parts of New South Wales.  
     
      
    47 Finally, there is the material that is found in the possession of the accused either at their homes, in their motorcars (or vehicles associated with them), or on their computers. According to the Crown case, this material shows a surprising degree of commonality. The Crown case is that the nature of the material is capable of reflecting once again upon the existence and scope of the combination. It is also available to rebut a suggestion that the activities of the accused in buying or acquiring, or attempting to acquire, laboratory equipment, chemicals and ammunition is entirely innocent.  
     
      
    48 I have, of course, simply been addressing the Crown case. I have been viewing the material from the perspective of the Crown. It is necessary to do this in order to identify the purpose for which evidence is to be led, and to understand the nature of the evidence in terms of its relevance under s 55 of the Evidence Act. I do not wish to suggest from this analysis that I agree with the Crown case. The accused are entitled to the presumption of innocence. This recitation of the Crown case is not intended to convey my acceptance of any of the facts asserted in the Crown case. The tribunal of fact in this matter is the jury to be assembled later in the year. As the trial judge, my concern at this stage is merely to adjudicate upon the admissibility of evidence, and to determine whether evidence should be led before the jury or excluded.  
     
      
       
      The illustrations in Exhibit “A” 
       
      
    49 There were approximately twelve illustrations in Exhibit “A”. These were examined at considerable length in the debate between the parties. I have been invited to comment on each of these with a view to establishing a template for the reception or rejection of the remaining conversations in Exhibit A. In particular, my task is to determine whether those statements fall outside of s 61 of the Evidence Act on either or both of the bases identified by the Crown. In my opinion, all of the twelve illustrations are admissible as statements by Khaled Sharrouf relevant to the existence and scope of the conspiracy. They are not tendered for a hearsay purpose, that is to prove the truth of any fact that may be asserted by them. Consequently, they fall outside of the control factor represented by s 61(1) of the Act. They are, in any event, each statements that may accurately be described as ""contemporaneous representations"" about Khaled Sharrouf's feelings, intentions, knowledge or state of mind. For this reason also, they do not fall under the control factor in s 61(1). 
     
      
    50 I will not examine them each in detail. I will simply comment on four or five of the illustrations. Illustration 4 has Khaled Sharrouf speaking to Hasan. He tells Hasan to put on the TV. He tells Hasan to watch channel 2. He says: 
     
      
       
        
        “It's very good, on for an hour but I forgot to tape it.” 
        
       
      
    51 This shows, obviously enough, a close association between the two men. It shows, by virtue of the words used, an association with shared interests where one appears to be keen to have the other watch a show on television that reflects a common interest. The words suggest an association where one will tape a programme for the other so that the shared interest can be mutually enjoyed. It reflects on both the level and dynamic of their association. All this emerges, however, from the words used. The Crown does not intend to prove that they did each, in fact, watch the same programme on that night. The Crown does not intend to prove that Khaled Sharrouf forgot to tape the programme. Those matters would be quite irrelevant in any event. What is relevant is the nature of the association because it is capable of reflecting upon whether, having regard to the activities of the two men, there is a combination between them for a particular purpose. The evidence is purely circumstantial and not, in any sense, confessional. The words used show, objectively, that there is a bond of association between them. The evidence is capable of being relevant to the depth of the association in the way I have indicated. In addition, it may be properly described as a contemporaneous representation about Khaled Sharrouf's feelings, intention, knowledge or state of mind. Given the context of the conversation, the expression ""I forgot to tape it"" may be properly said to be a contemporaneous representation. But it is, in any event, a statement tendered for a non-hearsay purpose.  
     
      
    52 Illustration 7 has Moustafa Sharrouf asking if they took a certain folder that he had something in. Sharrouf says, ""No, they didn't."" Moustafa said to burn it and Khaled said, ""Why are we talking on the phone? Did Izzydeen call you yet, he is going to Melbourne tonight."" 
     
      
    53 Once again, the Crown does not seek to prove that Mr Atik was going to Melbourne tonight, at least not by virtue of this conversation. What is sought to be proved is the association between Khaled Sharrouf and Atik. The words display a knowledge of the movements of the Melbourne associate. In any event, the statement is a contemporaneous representation as to Khaled Sharrouf's knowledge of Atik's movements. That is the relevance of the material. It is not relevant that Atik went to Melbourne on that night (as opposed to any other night). 
     
      
    54 Illustration 8 has Khaled Sharrouf saying to another man that ""Abdul Rakib and Khaled were there all morning at his house, they woke him at 9am and stayed until 2pm"".  
     
      
    55 Again, the evidence is not tendered to prove that these facts occurred. The fact that they were said evokes the proposition that Sharrouf approved of these people being at his house during this extended period.  
     
      
    56 Illustration 11 occurs in the context of a discussion regarding a programme on terrorism. During the course of this conversation he says to the other person, ""Let the people accept that we're this, but we are doing it for a proper cause."" The Crown does not seek to tender this as some type of admission by which Sharrouf confesses to being a terrorist or a person who espouses terrorist notions. The Crown suggests that the statement itself is relevant, in a non-hearsay manner, to go in proof, together with other evidence, as to the existence of a conspiracy. Secondly, given that there is an association between Sharrouf and a number of the other defendants, the statement is admissible as a contemporaneous representation of his state of mind. 
     
      
    57 Illustration 12 has Khaled Sharrouf asking Moustafa Cheikho if he was “at the feast prayers today”. Cheikho said he was. Sharrouf said he looked for him but couldn't see him or Khaled Cheikho, but could only see Hasan. 
     
      
    58 The words used themselves are capable of saying something about the association between the three men. It is an association that involves a religious and communal overtone. It is one where the words demonstrate the men expect to see one another at such functions and are disappointed if they do not associate on those occasions. In addition, it is a contemporaneous representation as to the state of mind or knowledge of Sharrouf. 
     
      
    59 Finally, I will mention illustration 15. Here, Moustafa Cheikho speaks to Khaled Sharrouf. The latter tells the former that he is having problems with his computer and that Omar has agreed to help fix it. They discuss arranging a meeting. Cheikho ""doesn't know if he can go”, they discuss where they can go, swimming. Sharrouf speaks of downloading “thousands of cassettes”.  
     
      
    60 It is clear that the words used themselves are capable of saying something quite probative about the nature of the relationship between Sharrouf, Moustafa Cheikho and Omar. The words portray an association that involves meeting together, swimming, sharing cassettes and arranging for computer problems to be fixed amongst themselves. In addition, the statements are contemporaneous representations of knowledge, intention and state of mind. 
     
      
    61 I appreciate that endless debate could occur in relation to each of the individual calls. The length and complexity of Mr Waterstreet's written submissions show that this is so. My analysis clearly allows that, with the exception of perhaps seven or eight conversations, the whole of the material in Exhibit “A” is admissible on either or both of the two bases I have identified. I will leave it to the parties to determine the final selection of material to be presented before the jury.  
     
      
    62 I shall now turn to consider whether any of the material should be excluded on any other basis. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Exclusion of evidence on other bases 
       
      
    63 There remains only to consider the possible exclusion of Mr Sharrouf's statements under s 135, 137 and s 90 of the Evidence Act. Section 135 of the Evidence Act is in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        135 General discretion to exclude evidence 
        
       
       
        
        The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a part, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    64 Section 137 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        137 Exclusion of prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings 
        
       
       
        
        In a criminal proceeding, the Court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.” 
        
       
      
    65 ""Probative value"" is defined in the dictionary to the Evidence Act in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Probative value of evidence means the extent to which the evidence could rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue.” 
        
       
      
    66 Section 137 requires a balancing by the trial judge of the probative value of the evidence against the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. If that balancing process results in a finding that the probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, the Court is constrained to refuse to admit the evidence. No element of discretion applies. 
     
      
    67 The section requires the Court to consider first, the probative value of the evidence. Secondly, the Court must examine the probative value of the evidence relative to its prejudicial effect to the extent that it could or would be unfair. (See R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101; Papakosmos v R (1999) 196 CLR 297; R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326; R v E M (2003) NSWCCA 374; R v Yates (2002) NSWCCA 520 at (252)). 
     
      
    68 In R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 182 at 199 (116), Wood CJ at CL (with whom Sully and Howie JJ agreed) pointed out that the prejudice to the defendant of which each of ss 135 and 137 speak is not the simple fact that the evidence may advance the Crown case or weaken the defence case. Rather, it means damage to the defence case in some unacceptable way, for example, by provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves. There must be more than a hypothetical risk of it being unfairly prejudicial in this way - the risk must be a real one: R v GK (2001) 53 NSWLR 317 at 324.  
     
      
    69 It is now well settled that it is not open to a trial judge, in assessing the probative value of any piece of evidence (for the purposes of s 137 of the Evidence Act) to evaluate the reliability or credibility of the witness who gave the evidence (R v Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 at 47 to 65; R v Lodhi (2007) NSWCCA 360 at 174-177; R v Sood (2007) NSWCCA 214 at 26-43, and R v Mundine (2008) NSWCCA 55 at 33. In the last mentioned case Simpson J (at 33) with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Grove J agreed said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That is, 'probative value' is not to be determined by the weight that might be given to any piece of evidence. What is to be considered is the role that piece of evidence, if accepted, would play in the resolution of a 'disputed' fact - or the contribution it might, if accepted, make to that resolution. Apart from anything else, to make the assessment of probative value on the basis of the perceived credibility or reliability of the witness through whom it is given, or perceived weakness in the evidence, would be to attempt to anticipate the weight the jury would attach to it, a task to be undertaken by the jury when all the evidence is complete.” 
        
       
      
    70 See also R v SJRC [2007] NSWCCA 142 where the Court of Criminal Appeal held that a Judge had erred in rejecting evidence under s 137 because he thought it was ""ambiguous"".  
     
      
    71 Mr Dalton, however, submitted that the following passage from Simpson J's decision was apposite. Her Honour had said at para 44: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although it is not open to a Court performing the balancing exercise set by s 137 to take into account, on the assessment of probative value questions of the weight of the evidence, that is not so when assessing the issue of asserted 'unfair prejudice'.” 
        
       
      
    72 Both the situation in Mundine itself, and that demonstrated by an earlier decision of her Honour (R v Cook [2004] NSWCCA 52), are instructive in understanding Simpson J's remarks.  
     
      
    73 In Cook the accused had been charged with a sexual offence involving violence against a female. The Crown had sought to lead evidence that, following the offence, the accused visited another female at her home. This was a woman with whom he had previously been in a relationship but in respect of whom there was in existence an AVO restraining him from contacting her. While he was at this woman's home, the police arrived and the accused hid himself in the ceiling. At trial the Crown had sought to rely on this behaviour as evidence of consciousness of guilt.  
     
      
    74 The dilemma posed for the accused was that, if that evidence were called, he would be forced to provide an explanation for his conduct. If he did not, the jury might well draw an inference that his conduct, in hiding when the police approached, showed a consciousness of guilt of the offence with which he was charged. The true explanation for his behaviour, on his case, was that he was well aware that he was guilty of a different offence, namely one of breaching the AVO relating to the second woman. But giving that explanation before the jury would expose to the jury his criminal history and, more prejudicially, would disclose that the AVO related to sexual violence towards a female, the very charge he was facing in the instant trial.  
     
      
    75 The ""dilemma"", as I have described it, could simply not be solved other than by excluding the evidence under s 137. Its probative value was plainly outweighed by the prejudice that would inevitably flow to him if the true circumstances were revealed. Unusually, directions would not have been sufficient to correct the situation. Indeed, they probably would have made it worse. It will be seen, accordingly, that in Cook's case it was not the unreliability of the evidence that led to the unfair prejudice. The unfair prejudice arose as a kind of collateral damage arising from the case the accused would have been forced to present before the jury.  
     
      
    76 In Mundine, two woman had separately identified the accused as the person who had broken into their home and assaulted them. A remark made by a police officer to the first woman prior to the identification process involving her raised the prospect that she may have thought the photographic array comprised people all of whom were known to the police as ""local offenders"". To cross-examine her on that matter, however, might have conveyed the impression to the jury that the accused had a criminal history for the very kind of offence with which he had been charged.  
     
      
    77 The second woman, it was thought, may have been prompted by the first woman prior to her separate act of identification. The exclusion of the first identification, however, would have made cross-examination of the second woman's position difficult, if not impossible. It would have revealed that there had been an earlier identification by the first victim, a fact otherwise unknown to the jury.  
     
      
    78 Therein lay the possible unfair prejudice. It was not the unreliability of the evidence. Indeed, the Court of Criminal Appeal made it clear the trial judge had been in error in purporting to find the identification evidence unreliable and the section thereby engaged. It was in that context that her Honour made the remark relied upon by Mr Dalton. It appears in her Honour's judgment at paragraph 44, as I have said. Having observed that questions of the weight of the evidence could be taken into account on the issue of asserted ""unfair prejudice"" her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the voir dire, Ms Vollmer (the first victim) was cross-examined about the possible effect on her of words 'local offenders'. And Ms Lanz was cross-examined about the possible effect on her of knowing that Ms Vollmer had made an identification. Both vigorously denied any such effect. The cross-examination had little, if any, impact.” 
        
       
      
    79 Simpson J thought that similar responses might be expected at trial. Further, if the offending words were excised, it probably would have made little difference. Her Honour observed ""either way there was no unfair prejudice"". Accordingly, the Court found that the probative value of the evidence of each witness, leaving aside considerations of reliability or credibility, was quite high. With respect to the evidence of the first victim, the danger of unfair prejudice was assessed to be very low indeed. In that regard Simpson J saw the evidence as highly probative and not likely to be weakened by attack at trial. The risk of collateral unfair prejudice was consequently “very low indeed”. Simpson J also took into account the ability to delete certain words from the evidence, and the Court’s ability to give directions, both being practical counters to unfair prejudice. 
     
      
    80 It will be seen from these illustrations that prejudice of an unfair kind may arise in varying contexts and often unexpectedly. These two cases well make the point. But, for present purposes, there is no suggestion that potential unreliability (for example, relating to identification evidence) is to be ignored in relation to the first part of the exercise, but then brought to bear on the second part so as to lead to some kind of automatic exclusion. Probative value, however, may be taken into account when assessing the issue of asserted ""unfair prejudice"", but the unfair prejudice of this kind will normally be of a collateral kind, as it was in the two cases under consideration. It will not normally arise simply because a particular category of evidence is or may be unreliable. Her Honour’s remarks are not intended to convey the impression that, for example, the credibility of evidence is to be ignored in the first part of the test and then given full and free rein in the second. Of course, in an exceptional case absolute unreliability or a total lack of credibility may lead to exclusion. But this would be a rare situation (see for example, R v Blick). Normally, the task of evaluation of the weight of the evidence is left to the jury. 
     
      
    81 How then are these principles to be applied to the present situation involving Mr Sharrouf? The medical evidence which I have set out earlier does not, on its face, suggest that any particular statement by Mr Sharrouf was infected, at the time, by incompetence. Rather, it suggests, at best, that there may be a question mark as to the reliability of anything said or done by him, in a general sense, during the period of the conspiracy. The medical evidence is, I must say, very general and very non-specific. On the other hand, he has been suffering from schizophrenia, it would seem, for a number of years. If he were a witness at trial, and those matters were before the jury, it might well call for the need to give a warning about unreliability based on his mental condition. Mr Scragg will recall in the case of R v Taylor, I gave the jury such a direction at counsel's insistence in the case of a witness Rebecca Mills. In a recent case in the ACT, Connolly J gave a similar direction where an alleged victim of crime was suffering from Alzheimer's disease which may have affected the reliability of his identification of the accused (R v Ivan Djerke (2006) ACTSC 104 (10 October $2,006)). I am sure that this situation arises not infrequently. And it is often necessary that such a direction should be given. This is a very different question than the one posed by s 61 of the Evidence Act. It is also a very different situation from the issue posed by ss 135 and 137 of the Act where exclusion is sought. In this case the issue is simply one of potential unreliability. That is a matter that ordinarily will be addressed by appropriate directions and warnings, not by exclusion under s 137. Again, it is for the tribunal of fact to assess the reliability of the evidence. 
     
      
    82 Mr Dalton identified several areas of asserted unfair prejudice in his written submissions. I would not consider that the mere fact that the jury may not have the advantage of seeing Mr Sharrouf either in court or in the witness box would necessarily be a determinative matter. Nor do I consider that the fact that his statements would not be tested in cross-examination would necessarily involve unfair prejudice (R v Suteski (2002) 56 NSWLR 182 at 201 (26) per Wood CJ at CL). They are obviously relevant matters, but not necessarily decisive. Indeed, directions could be given about each of those matters.  
     
      
    83 What does concern me, however, is the very matter I raised with counsel during oral submissions in the course of discussion. If there is, at the very least, some issue as to the reliability of any statements made by Mr Sharrouf during the period of the conspiracy, how could a reliability warning be given to the jury unless there were evidence about his medical condition before them? I appreciate that the Crown takes a prima facie position that none of the statements by Mr Sharrouf, given both their inconsequential nature and the medical evidence, warrant a reliability warning. My initial reaction is that that may be too inflexible a position for the Crown to take.  
     
      
    84 On the other hand, the prospect of psychiatric evidence being introduced during the trial (assuming it could be, notwithstanding the credibility rule and other problems going to the issue of relevance) would be likely to create a side issue that could be extremely diverting, and quite unnecessary in such a long trial. For these reasons, I consider that the Crown should give serious consideration as to whether some type of agreed statement can be worked out so that, if reliability remains an issue, material can be placed before the jury by agreement. This is not to be taken as an invitation to the defence to try and “stymy” the Crown case by insisting on agreed facts that could not reasonably emerge from the type of evidence that has been placed before me. This is an area where some sensible and genuine compromise is necessary. I appreciate the fact that a final decision about these matters might have to await the determination as to whether Mr Sharrouf is to have a separate trial or not. That is to occur on or about 15 September 2008. I see no reason why the parties cannot have sensible discussions, between now and that time, to address this issue.  
     
      
    85 I am not satisfied that, at the present time, the exercise required under either ss 135 or 137 of the Evidence Act requires exclusion of the evidence. I will revisit the issue, however, after 15 September, and after the parties have had an opportunity to confer on the issues I have raised.  
     
      
    86 In those circumstances I shall defer a decision on the s 137 argument until after 15 September 2008.  
     
      
    87 The final matter relates to s 90 of the Evidence Act. I am not satisfied that that section has any application to the present matter. This is because the Crown does not propose to tender Mr Sharrouf's statements as admissions and is prepared to accept, as I understand it, a limitation on the use of the evidence to make it clear to the jury that such statements are not admissions. Secondly, I doubt that they are admissions in any event. I have touched upon this here and in earlier decisions, and there is no need for me to repeat those earlier observations. Finally, s 90 of the Evidence Act is a residual discretion and the occasion for its utilisation in the present matter, even assuming that there were admissions involved, has not been established. The section has been described as a “safety net” that has operation only after applying the more specific provisions of the Act (EM v R [2007] 239 ALR 204; [2007] HCS 46 at [109] per Gummow and Hayne JJ) provided the concerns I have raised in connection with ss 135 and 137 are addressed – if they can be – I see no scope whatsoever for s 90 to be called in aid. The circumstances of Mr Sharrouf’s mental condition may, at best, raise an issue about the reliability of his utterances, but that is well removed from a valid suggestion that either he, or the accused, will not receive a fair trial. Nor can it be said the use of the evidence at trial would be unfair. In my opinion, for these reasons also, the circumstances do not trigger s 90 of the Evidence Act.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: This is an appeal against a verdict under s 22 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“the Act”). 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    3 On 21 January 2006 the appellant was arrested and charged with an offence of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm, and, in the alternative, an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    4 On 30 August 2006, following an enquiry pursuant to s 12 of the Act, Robison DCJ found that the appellant was unfit to be tried (s 14). In accordance with the requirements of s 14, he referred the appellant to the Mental Health Review Tribunal (“the Tribunal”). On 8 December 2006 the Tribunal determined, on the balance of probabilities, that the appellant would not, within the 12 months following the finding of unfitness, become fit to be tried. The Tribunal therefore (as required by subss 16(3) and (4)) notified the District Court and the Director of Public Prosecutions (“the DPP”) of its determination. 
     
      
    5 The DPP having decided that further proceedings would be taken, a special hearing into the charges was, by s 19 of the Act, required to be conducted. That special hearing commenced on 26 March 2007 before Nicholson DCJ. Allegations in the same terms as those originally charged were made, in the alternative, under s 33 and s 35(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 (both since repealed and re-enacted in different language). On 28 March 2007 Nicholson DCJ delivered a verdict, under s 22 of the Act, that, on the limited evidence available, the appellant committed the principal offence alleged (the s 33 offence). By s 22(3)(c) such a verdict is subject to appeal to this Court in the same manner as a verdict in an ordinary trial of criminal proceedings. It is that verdict that is the subject of the present appeal and judgment. 
     
      
       
      The special hearing 
       
      
    6 By ss 21A and 21B of the Act, a special hearing is to be conducted by judge alone unless an election is made by the accused person, the prosecutor, or an Australian legal practitioner representing the accused person, to have the issues determined by a jury. No such election having been made, the special hearing proceeded before Nicholson DCJ sitting without a jury. S 21B(2) of the Act requires that a determination given by a judge in a special hearing must include the principles of law applied and the findings of fact upon which the judge relied in coming to the verdict. 
     
      
    7 There was little, if any, dispute about the facts. Most of the evidence was given in the form of written statements of witnesses, who were not required for cross-examination.  
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    8 Given the limited nature of the issues, the facts may be stated succinctly. 
     
      
    9 In the early afternoon of 21 January 2006, a Saturday, the appellant was in a shop in a shopping centre at Bankstown. She was holding a knife. A young woman (“the complainant”), dressed in traditional Moslem clothing, was in front of her. The appellant appeared angry and determined. Holding the knife slightly above her head, she pointed it at the complainant’s head. The complainant ran from the shop. The appellant followed her, continuing to hold the knife aloft, and still pointing it at the complainant’s chest area. The complainant asked the appellant what was wrong, and if she was “ok”; the appellant did not reply, but thrust the knife towards the complainant in what was later described as a hesitant manner. The complainant sought to defend herself. The appellant stabbed the complainant in one finger, and in the top of her forearm. The appellant pulled the knife back and ran from the store, pursued by several bystanders who had witnessed the incident. She was driven away in a motor vehicle by her boyfriend, (Gary Beman, who appears to have been in the vicinity because he had been alerted that the appellant was behaving in a way that gave rise to concern). Mr Beman disposed of the knife by throwing it in a river. The appellant was arrested a few hours later. A police officer asked her if she had stabbed the woman at the shopping centre. She said that she had. The police officer asked her why. The appellant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I wanted to stab a Moslem. I went in and found a Moslem and stabbed her, I’ve had enough of Moslems, that’s why.” 
        
       
      
    10 The detective asked why she had an antipathy against Moslems. The appellant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m related to a Moslem and I hate them, I’ve had enough of them.” 
        
       
      
    11 A little while later the appellant was formally interviewed. She was accompanied by Ms Laura Conejo. She retracted her admission; she agreed that she had made the admission, but said that it was untrue. She then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What happened was I had a knife and I went and bought one and because this guy in the first place, he told me to stab this woman and I went and got a knife, and then I … and I went up to her and I stabbed her and, and I just freaked out and he told me …” 
        
       
      
    12 The appellant then said to Ms Conejo: 
     
      
       
        
        “So scared. Fuckin’ James, you idiot. I hope he kills himself … I can’t believe that James would tell me to do something like that, to stab a, a beautiful woman like, why you know? Why? Why stab her? Why? You know what I mean? Why in the first place would want to, would want to stab a person, all because of this guy James in, the first place going with him, I didn’t know, and I was that scared, cause he had a knife, he was gunna pull it out on me and everything. If you don’t do it, and now he’s got away with it now and I, that’s not fair.” 
        
       
      
    13 At the time of the events in question, s 33 of the Crimes Act was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whosoever:  
         
         
        maliciously by any means wounds or inflicts grievous bodily harm upon any person, or 
        
       
       
        
        maliciously shoots at, or in any manner attempts to discharge any kind of loaded arms at any person,  
        
       
       
        
        with intent in any such case to do grievous bodily harm to any person, or with intent to resist, or prevent, the lawful apprehension or detainer either of himself or herself or any other person, shall be liable to imprisonment for 25 years.” 
        
       
      
    14 The sole issue litigated in the special hearing concerned whether the Crown had proved, to the requisite (criminal) standard, that the appellant had, at the time of her conduct, the intention necessary to sustain a conviction under s 33. Relevantly, that intention is an intention to cause grievous bodily harm. The determination by Nicholson DCJ involved an express finding that the Crown had proved, to the requisite degree, that the appellant had such an intention. 
     
      
    15 It was not in dispute that the appellant’s statements, if taken at face value, amply justified an inference that the appellant did have that intention. However, counsel for the appellant pointed to other evidence, concerning the appellant’s mental health, that were, they argued, capable of undermining that conclusion. No evidence, medical or otherwise, was called in her case.  
     
      
    16 The statements of the witnesses included the following. Gary Beman was the appellant’s boyfriend, who had driven her from the scene (although it is not suggested that that was by pre-arrangement or that he was involved in the appellant’s conduct). Relevantly to this issue, Mr Beman said that the appellant had been diagnosed “with some type of mental illness”, and that she had told him that “she hears voices in her head”. 
     
      
    17 Ms Melissa Cole, a residential care worker at a facility in which the appellant lived stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The appellant] in the past two weeks appears to have been withdrawn and distant from our activities and conversations. I have noticed when working that [the appellant] displays these traits and I have difficulty in getting her to perform and involved in simple tasks. When I have conversations with [the appellant] she refers to herself in the third person.” 
        
       
      
    18 Ms Despina Liamakeros described herself as a carer engaged in numerous houses in the Bankstown area, including that occupied by the appellant. Her statement included the following paragraph: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The appellant] has issues with Lebanese Moslem people. Some days [the appellant] wakes up thinking she is a Lebanese Moslem person. Sometimes she eats Lebanese food and would wear a scarf around her head to imitate traditional Moslem clothing. [The appellant] has said in the past, ‘I want to have sex with Tony so I can have a Moslem baby.’” 
        
       
      
    19 Maria Chirinos, also a carer, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … [the appellant] suffers from schizophrenia. [The appellant] goes to medical centres frequently and self medicates on prescribed drugs because as she has told me ‘I hear voices and I want to stop the voices telling me what to do’. As far as I know [the appellant] has not been consistent in taking her medication.” 
        
       
       
      The determination of the judge 
       
      
    20 In conventional form, and in compliance with the requirements of s 21B(2), Nicholson DCJ stated the principles of law and the findings of fact which led him to his decision. It is the manner in which he went about this that gives rise to the challenge to his verdict.  
     
      
    21 The grounds of the appeal are stated as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) … that the special hearing judge erred by misdirecting himself in respect of the requisite specific intent; 
        
       
       
        
        (2) … that [the verdict] was unreasonable and/or it cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    22 Having regard to the limited nature of the issues in dispute, it is unnecessary to deal in detail with the reasons of Nicholson DCJ. He correctly directed himself as to the elements of the s 33 offence. These he stated as: 
     
      
    · that the appellant maliciously wounded the complainant; 
     
      
    · that, at the time she did so she intended to cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    23 There was no dispute that the complainant had been wounded; nor, as emerged during the oral argument on the appeal, was there any dispute that the appellant had acted “maliciously”. Nicholson DCJ reminded himself that “malicious”, for relevant purposes, meant: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the accused’s acts were deliberate, unlawful and intended acts.” 
        
       
      
    24 He also directed himself, for the purposes of the first element, that he could not find that the appellant had committed the act unless satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant had intended some injury or injuries, although not necessarily precisely those that were inflicted. In reaching that conclusion, Nicholson DCJ explicitly referred to the evidence concerning the appellant’s psychiatric condition (limited though it was). 
     
      
    25 His Honour then went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “50. For the purpose of assessing the accused’s intent, it is also important to remember she had the knife, it was raised when the complainant was at [the shop]. Had the complainant not turned, I am satisfied the knife was aimed towards the complainant’s rear, although which specific part I cannot tell. The knife was above the complainant’s shoulder in height. Her shoulders, the nape of her neck and her upper back were all within the target area. That area houses the lungs, heart and several vital arteries. Any injury to that area was likely to compromise one or other of those organs or vessels. Until the complainant turned, all that area was vulnerable and undefended. 
        
       
       
        
        51. I am satisfied the accused has mental health issues.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour then spelled out, at some length, some instances of behaviour on the part of the appellant that illustrated the nature of the appellant’s “mental health issues”. With reference to what the appellant had said about “James” and the circumstances that led her to her behaviour, the transcript records his Honour as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “54. The evidence is silent as to who James is – and whether he exists in reality or only in the accused’s mind. However, what appears as inevitable from this conversation is that the act of stabbing was willed by the complainant (sic – appellant) whether as a consequence of being instructed so to do or on her own account. The reasoning causing the willed act is obscure. 
        
       
       
        
        55. That evidence, taken with earlier admissions, her act in coming armed with a knife, her three actions in raising a knife as though to stab and doing so on two occasions, satisfies me the accused clearly intended to stab the complainant. Further I am satisfied she intended to stab the complainant with sufficient force to penetrate through the skin into the red flesh of her victim. The fact that her hand was raised three times, first to areas of the upper back and nape of the neck and aimed then two times at the chest, satisfies me the accused was determined to injure the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        57. I am satisfied she retained that intention when she stabbed the complainant on the two other occasions. In those circumstances I am satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused intended to inflict grievous bodily harm or really serious injury.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour then proceeded to the finding I have already mentioned. 
       
      
    27 The appellant’s written submissions commence by extracting and quoting s 21B(2) of the Act, requiring that a determination by a judge following a special hearing include the principles of law and the findings of fact the basis of the determination. It was observed that the provision is mandatory and failure to comply with it gives rise to error: R v Zvonaric [2001] NSWCCA 505; R v Minani [2005] NSWCCA 226; 63 NSWLR 490 were cited as authority. 
     
      
    28 So much is uncontroversial. In Hawkins v The Queen [1994] HCA 28; 179 CLR 500, the High Court held that evidence of mental illness is relevant to the question whether the act of an accused is done with the specific intent charged. 
     
      
    29 The complaint that is now made is that Nicholson DCJ failed to take that circumstance into account in this respect. 
     
      
    30 It was acknowledged that Nicholson DCJ did make a finding (to which I have referred above) that the appellant was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the stabbing. What was argued was that, on analysis of the decision, it could be seen that his Honour took the evidence of mental illness into account when considering whether the Crown had proved that the appellant had acted maliciously, but failed to do so when considering whether it had also proved that the appellant had acted with the specific intention of causing grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    31 I do not accept this criticism. It involves too clinical a dissection of the reasoning process of Nicholson DCJ. It overlooks the express finding, in the second last sentence of paragraph 54, that the act of stabbing was a “willed” act. It is of significance that that followed the opening words of paragraph 50, when, his Honour turned his attention to the question of “specific intent”; and his reasoning concerning the manner in which the appellant held the knife, directed at the complainant’s vital organs. 
     
      
    32 Further, the actual evidence of mental illness was not of the kind which could realistically advance the question of whether the appellant had formed the necessary intent. Mr Beman’s evidence was that she had “some type of mental illness” and heard “voices in her head”; Ms Cole gave only vague evidence of apparent withdrawal by the appellant. Ms Chirinos did give evidence that the appellant suffered from schizophrenia and heard voices. None of these witnesses was expert and none could or did give any evidence concerning the impact of what they described on whether the appellant could or did form the necessary intent. 
     
      
    33 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    34 The second ground of appeal is that the conviction was unreasonable, and is in many respects similar to the first – that is, to the question of whether the evidence was sufficient to establish an intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Having regard to the evidence to which I have just referred, as well as the evidence to which Nicholson DCJ referred, I am satisfied that this ground of appeal ought to be rejected. 
     
      
    35 I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    36 HISLOP J: I agree with Simpson J.

   JUDGMENT1 Geoffrey William Leonard is currently standing trial before a jury for an offence under s 474.22 of the Commonwealth Criminal Code. The Commonwealth prosecution alleges that the accused used a carriage service, namely the Internet, to make available child abuse material. Because of admissions made by Mr Leonard the only issue is whether the material which has been published and which has been put before the jury fits the definition of child abuse material. That term is defined in s 473.1 of the Criminal Code as follows: 
     
      
      “Child abuse material means, 
       
       
      (a) Material that depicts a person, or a representation of a person who: 
       
       
      (i) Is, or appears to be under 18 years of age, and 
       
      (ii) Is, or appears to be a victim of torture, cruelty, or physical abuse, 
       
       
      and does this in a way that reasonable persons would regard as being in all the circumstances offensive.” 
      
    2 The relevant material which the Crown says establishes the offence because it is child abuse material consists of reproductions of what two brothers said to police during the making of formal police statements. To put the matter in context those statements alleged offences of child sexual assault by Mr Leonard. He was convicted, I believe after pleading guilty although it does not matter, of a number of offences and has served time in custody. Upon his release from custody he began operating a website. The website consists of a large volume of material, some of which has been tendered before the jury, and contained within that material are extracts from the statements to which I have earlier referred. Consistent with a non-publication order made by an earlier judge Mr Leonard did not name the makers of the statements and edited the statements in such a way as to remove from them material which would tend to identify the boys involved. So the material that the Crown says establishes the offence, because it is child abuse material, is Mr Leonard’s reproduction of those two police statements.3 I mentioned before that Mr Leonard conducted a website and that the relevant material appears on that website. I mentioned also that there is much material on the website. Some part of it has been tendered before the jury. Exhibit three consists of 124 printed pages of a document headed, “Punished For Love” written by the offender. Contained within that document are the relevant police statements. Exhibit four is a document of 68 pages, although much of it is in very small type, entitled “Last Throw of the Dice”. It also has the relevant police statements in it.4 The material in exhibit three and exhibit four has been summarised by the offender in exhibit A and exhibit B. He makes the submission at the end of the Crown case that there is no case to answer. The major aspect of his submission is that he has an implied freedom of political expression and that the relevant material was published by him in the course of a genuine political comment regarding such things as whether it should be an offence to have sexual contact with a person under the age of sixteen. Mr Leonard, the material establishes, has a firm belief or at least says he has a firm belief, there should be no age of consent. Mr Leonard says that because he is entitled to promote that view by way of political comment then the criminal law is not able to punish him for publishing the relevant material, that is the two statements made to police, because that publication by the accused was done in the course of that political comment.5 He refers of course to the decision of the High Court in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997) 189 CLR 520. Of course as is well known that was a defamation case. Mr Leonard was unable to assist me with any authority where the implied freedom of political communication was considered in the course of a criminal prosecution. The Crown was not aware of any such case either. However there is an authority which is of assistance to me to which the Crown referred. 6 One of Mr Leonard’s earlier applications to this Court was that he be granted a permanent stay, and one of the reasons he sought such an order concerned the implied immunity for political communications established in Lange. He lost that application in this court and appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. So the authority to which I refer is very important because it concerns this precise case. 7 The Court of Criminal Appeal considered Mr Leonard’s arguments about the effect of Lange and rejected them. There is really nothing more that needs to be said. Not only do I agree with what Spigelman CJ wrote, with the agreement of the other members of the Court in Leonard v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 197, but whether I agree with it or not I am bound by it.8 The next aspect that the accused relies on concerns the meaning of the term “physical abuse”, part of the definition of child abuse material. Mr Leonard says that the material cannot be child abuse material because it does not contain depictions of physical abuse. The relevant material contains descriptions by the two boys of sexual assaults committed upon them by the accused but there is no suggestion that he was violent towards them. The issue of consent was not at issue and so the statements do not even indicate whether these things were done with or without the boys’ consent.9 The accused submits that for there to be physical abuse there must be some form of battery and because there is no such battery described in the relevant material, the material cannot be child abuse material as that term is defined in the Criminal Code. This is another matter considered and rejected by the Court of Criminal Appeal when Mr Leonard appealed to that Court after this Court refused to grant him a permanent stay. Once more, nothing more needs to be said. At[18] to[24] of the judgment, Spigelman CJ deals with this issue. Once more, it does not matter whether I agree with him, although I do, because I am bound by what he says.10 The final matter that Mr Leonard raises is this. It would have been noted from what I said before regarding the definition of child abuse material that the jury has to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the depiction is in all the circumstances offensive. When I say depiction, consistent with the definition I mean a depiction of a person who appears to have been the victim of physical abuse.11 Mr Leonard says that because these are purely factual descriptions they are not pornographic or erotic in any way, and therefore they cannot be regarded as offensive. Of course, at this stage of the proceedings, I have to take the Crown case at its highest and doing that, I am satisfied that it is certainly open to the jury to regard the relevant material as fulfilling the definition of child abuse material, in particular insofar as it requires them to consider what a reasonable person would find as being offensive.12 Of course, that is not to say that the issue as to whether the material is erotic or pornographic is irrelevant to the decision the jury has to make but I am satisfied that it is open to the jury to look at the material and to consider that the definition of child abuse material is satisfied. Indeed, many situations could be imagined where non-erotic and non-pornographic material fit that description. The very terms the definition of child abuse material make it clear that the depictions do not have to be pornographic or erotic for the definition to be satisfied. 13 As the Court of Criminal Appeal said in the case of Leonard whether a publication is offensive or not is quintessentially a jury question. The jury, as representatives of the community, will apply community standards in deciding what reasonable persons would regard as offensive. I am satisfied that it is open to them to find that the material does satisfy the definition of child abuse material. 14 For those reasons I decline to direct a verdict of acquittal.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Barr J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: Following a trial by jury in the District Court, the applicant, Justin Speechly, was convicted of and sentenced for the offence of malicious wounding with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. Hughes DCJ sentenced him to imprisonment for a non-parole period of six years and a balance of term of four years and eight months, a total sentence of ten years and eight months. He appealed against his conviction and sought leave to appeal against the sentence. Before the appeal was called on for hearing he abandoned the conviction appeal. 
     
      
    3 On 22 December 2005 the complainant, Jacob Hurinov, went to the Quakers Inn Hotel at Quakers Hill. At 3:25am on 23 December he left the hotel. A courtesy bus dropped him at an intersection not far from where he lived. There he saw the applicant and his half-brother, Thomas John Irving. He did not know them but had seen them at the hotel. He thought that they might be lost and went over to see whether he could help them. They repaid his kindness by launching a vicious assault upon him. The applicant punched him. Irving took hold of his T-shirt. Mr Hurinov managed to break free, leaving his T-shirt in Irving’s hands, and ran away. The two chased him and caught him near the house of a neighbour of Mr Hurinov, Mr Derbyshire. Mr Derbyshire gave evidence of what he saw. The applicant and Irving punched Mr Hurinov and knocked him to the ground. As he lay there the applicant kicked him in the head and upper body while Irving pinned him down and punched him in the face. Mr Hurinov appeared to lose consciousness but the two attackers continued to kick and punch him. Mr Derbyshire intervened and told them to stop. They did so briefly. Those events attracted the attention of another neighbour, Mr Subra. He heard Irving say to the applicant, “Let’s finish the job” or “Let’s do the job properly”. They renewed the attack. Irving stole Mr Hurinov’s wallet from his pocket as he lay still on the ground. Both began kicking him again. They ran away but the police, whom the neighbours had summoned, caught and arrested them. Mr Hurinov’s wallet was found in Irving’s pocket. 
     
      
    4 Mr Hurinov was taken to hospital. He was very badly hurt. There were grazes and swelling all over the head and face. The right ear was partially torn away from the head. There was a fracture of the right lower jaw. His most serious injuries, however, were abdominal. There were tears of the transverse colon and mesocolon, necessitating the amputation of between 40% and 50% of the colon. Mr Hurinov had lost about 20% of his blood.  
     
      
    5 The charge was brought under s33 Crimes Act. The maximum period of imprisonment for the commission of such an offence is 25 years. The standard non-parole period is seven years. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was born on 30 March 1985, so he was 20 years old when he committed the offence and 22 years old when sentenced. He had been dealt with early in 2003 in the Children’s Court for possession of a prohibited drug. He had been given the benefit of a bond. In 2005 he had been fined in the Local Court for having had the custody of a knife in public place.  
     
      
    7 There are three grounds of appeal. The first two may be dealt with together. They assert that his Honour erred by placing too much weight on the standard non-parole period and in determining that the offence fell into the middle range of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    8 An attack was made upon his Honour’s express reasons for the finding that the attack fell into the mid range of seriousness or perhaps even slightly above it. Long passages of transcript of the debate on sentencing were extracted in the written submissions filed in this Court. It was submitted that it was thereby demonstrated that his Honour had come to his ultimate conclusion before considering aggravating or mitigating features under s21A Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    9 His Honour apparently thought that the prima facie relationship between non-parole and parole periods should be in the ratio 2:1, not 3:1, and on that understanding first sentenced Irving to a head sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years (the three year fixed term for the aggravated stealing offence running concurrently) and the applicant to a head sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. When the error was pointed out to his Honour he had the offenders brought back to Court, vacated their sentences and imposed the existing sentences in lieu. 
     
      
    10 The passages of transcript extracted in the written submissions clearly show this misunderstanding. They also show that his Honour was unfamiliar with the interplay between the provisions of s54B, s21A and s44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. During debate his Honour put a number of propositions which are now shown plainly to be incorrect. It was submitted by reference to those passages that the sentencing procedure had miscarried.  
     
      
    11 I do not think that the statements should be understood in that way or should be taken as necessarily representing his Honour’s final view. I think that the better view is that his Honour was putting matters tentatively as part of a process of working out the proper approach between the various bodies of law that applied in the context of seeking the assistance of the legal representatives. 
     
      
    12 His Honour’s conclusion about where the offences fell in relation to the mid range of seriousness was stated after a recital of the facts. His Honour might well have articulated his process of reasoning in more precise and conventional terms, but it sufficiently appears, in my opinion, that his Honour concluded that these were the relevant factors -  
     
      
       
        
        a.  
        the offence was opportunistic and unplanned; 
        
       
       
        
        b. the offence was committed in company; 
        
       
       
        
        c. the offence involved both offenders setting upon the victim late at night in a deserted suburban street; 
        
       
       
        
        d. initially, involved the Applicant (in company with Irving) punching the victim who then fled, whereupon both offenders chased and caught the victim; 
        
       
       
        
        e. both offenders then punched the victim who fell to the ground; 
        
       
       
        
        f. there the Applicant kicked the victim to the body, head and ear while Irving was pinning the victim down and punched him to the face; 
        
       
       
        
        g. thereafter both offenders relentlessly kicked and punched the victim to the head and body, continuing to do so even after the victim had been rendered unconscious; 
        
       
       
        
        h. after a brief interlude during which a neighbour had engaged the offenders in conversation, Irving stole a wallet from the pocket of the victim and then both offenders renewed their attack by continuing to kick the victim to the head and body as he lay unconscious on the ground; 
        
       
       
        
        i. the injuries thereby inflicted on the victim were very serious and included: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          i a partial thickness tear to the transverse colon requiring a laparotomy and removal of 40%-50% of the colon; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ii repair to a “couple” of tears to the medium sized blood vessels within the transverse mesocolon; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          iii the pre-operative loss of some 20% (1 litre) of the victim’s total blood volume into the peritoneal cavity, which blood loss came from the injuries to the transverse colon and transverse mesocolon; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          iv. an avulsion of the right ear requiring surgical repair to reattach the ear to the side of the head; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         v. a fracture to the right mandible; and  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          vi. abrasions to the right temple, left side peri-orbital swelling, swollen lips, superficial grazes with associated tenderness over the shoulders; and,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        j. the offence had not been provoked by any conduct on the part of the victim.  
        
       
      
    13 Those were all matters proper to his consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence. In those circumstances it would have been surprising, and in my view erroneous, for his Honour to have categorised the applicant’s offence as having any less than the mid range of seriousness. 
     
      
    14 It was submitted that his Honour failed to take account of subjective mitigating factors, though it was not entirely clear which factors were referred to. It is possible that the applicant’s level of intellectual functioning might have fallen for consideration. However, as his Honour observed, the assessment of his cognitive functions was incomplete at the time of sentence. 
     
      
    15 Like Irving, the applicant was under the influence of alcohol, but it could not have been suggested that that mitigated his criminality. He was without remorse.  
     
      
    16 I do not think that it has been demonstrated that his Honour placed too much weight on the standard non-parole period or in determining that the offence fell into the mid-range of objective seriousness. In my opinion these grounds of appeal have not been made good. 
     
      
    17 The third ground of appeal asserts that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by comparing his sentence with that imposed on Irving. The principles are not in doubt and need no restatement here: see Lowe v The Queen [1984] HCA 46. 
     
      
    18 It will be recalled that Irving stole Mr Hurinov’s wallet. As well as being charged with the malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm, like the applicant, he was also charged with the aggravated form of stealing from the person. The maximum penalty for that offence was 20 years’ imprisonment. Perhaps surprisingly in view of the facts I have related, the applicant was not charged with having committed that offence. His Honour sentenced Irving on the malicious injury charge to imprisonment for ten years and eight months and fixed a non-parole period of eight years. On the aggravated stealing charge he sentence him to a fixed term of three years concurrent with the non-parole period on the first count. To all intents and purposes he received no greater sentence than the applicant, notwithstanding his greater criminality. 
     
      
    19 Irving was born in November 1977, so he was 28 years old when he offended and 29 when sentenced. He and the applicant were born of the same mother. He had been dealt with in the courts on a number of occasions for offences involving stealing, breaking and entering, causing malicious damage and assault on persons. He had been imprisoned for assault. Notwithstanding those matters, as the sentencing judge observed, he had continued to commit offences. His Honour concluded that the record would not enable him to show leniency. I think that was an important point of distinction between Irving and the applicant who, although he could not claim to be a first offender, had a record which did not trouble his Honour. 
     
      
    20 A further point of distinction between the two offenders was their respective ages. Irving, the half-brother was an experienced man of mature years. The applicant had not long entered adulthood. This difference may explain why the applicant was prepared to join in the renewal of the attack on Irving’s invitation. 
     
      
    21 His Honour distinguished between the two offenders in adjusting for the applicant the relationship between non-parole and parole periods under s44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act because of the more favourable record of the applicant and because he had never been to prison before. His Honour might have added that the applicant had demonstrated a greater need than Irving for an extended period of time on parole to rehabilitate himself. This distinction between the two was correctly made, in my view, but I think that the circumstances otherwise distinguishing the two offenders and summarised above called for the imposition on the applicant of a head sentence less than that imposed on Irving.  
     
      
       
      
    22 In my opinion the Court should interfere and quash the sentence imposed on the applicant. It should substitute a head sentence somewhat shorter than that imposed on Irving. I would leave the non-parole period unchanged, two years shorter than that imposed on Irving. The two-year difference reflects the difference between their respective objective and subjective cases. In my opinion six years is the shortest time the applicant should have to serve without parole for such a remorseless, vicious and injurious attack on an innocent member of the public. I would fix a period during which the applicant was eligible for release to parole greater than one third of the non-parole period for the reasons I have summarised above. 
     
      
    23 I propose the following orders – 
     
      
    1. Grant leave to appeal against sentence and allow the appeal. 
     
      
    2. Quash the sentence appealed from and impose in lieu a sentence of imprisonment. Fix a non-parole period of six years commencing on 23 December 2005 and expiring on 22 December 2011 and a balance of term, during which the applicant will be eligible for consideration for release to parole, of three years, expiring on 22 December 2014.  
     
      
    3. Declare that the first day upon which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole will be 22 December 2011. 
     
      
       
      
    24 PRICE J: I agree with Barr J.

    1 IPP JA: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    2 BELL JA: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    3 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is an appeal by the State of New South Wales from a decision by Grove J to permit the release of Alexandria George Brookes, the respondent, under an extended supervision order pursuant to the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (“the Act”). 
     
      
    4 Under the Act the State may apply to the Court for a continuing detention order or in the alternative an extended supervision order, whether on a final or interim basis, in respect of the person who is “a sex offender” and who is either serving a sentence of imprisonment for “a serious sex offence” or an “offence of a sexual nature” (s 6 and s 14). In the present case the State made an application for an interim order which was granted by Fullerton J and later extended by Grove J. Application was later made for final orders. Grove J declined to make a detention order but ordered the release of the respondent under an extended supervision order which included various conditions. 
     
      
    5 At the time of the application the respondent was serving a sentence of 12 months imprisonment following his conviction for failing to comply with reporting obligations under the Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 2000 (“the Registration Act”). He was due to be released when his sentence expired on 21 February 2008. By the operation of s 5(2) of the Act a contravention of the Registration Act is deemed to be an “offence of a sexual nature.” The reporting obligations under the Registration Act were imposed upon the respondent as a consequence of his conviction on 20 September 2001 in respect of one count of aggravated indecent assault upon a child under ten years of age contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Accordingly, the respondent is “a sex offender” for the purposes of the Act. 
     
      
    6 Section 9(2) of the Act provides that an extended supervision order “may be made if, and only if, the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision.” Section 17(3) of the Act provides that a continuing detention order “may be made if and only if the Supreme Court is satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision and that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order.” 
     
      
    7 The primary judge provided the following account of the respondent’s background and criminal history [at [6]-[13]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The defendant was born on 13 September 1964. The earliest record indicating a possible proclivity for sexual misconduct by him is a note in a summary upon his exit from a treatment programme whilst in gaol in Queensland that between his ages of 8 or 9 until aged 15 or 16 he engaged in some form of sexual activity with a niece who was then aged between 3 or 4 until she was aged 11. The note about this was recorded in September 1995 when the defendant would have been aged about 31. No charge was ever laid alleging such behaviour nor is there any information that the niece reported any misconduct to anyone. The sole source is the defendant himself and he has, on occasions, sought to contradict the content of the note. There is ample material supporting express conclusions that the defendant is an unreliable and deceptive historian. It is, of course, conventional to give weight to statements against interest but as I shall later mention the defendant has handicaps and these would make me have reservations about measuring the credibility of statements by him against norms which I would apply to other community members. 
         
         
        The next record manifesting a sexual connotation is a note of a home visit by a departmental officer (I gather either probation or welfare) that the defendant’s mother had said that he had “sexually interfered with a young boy across the road” but that “the lad’s mother had not pressed charges”. There is no record of any investigation or charge about such a matter. 
         
         
        On 9 August 1986 the defendant was at a railway station and he was stopped by a bystander when he was taking a two year old child apparently heading towards the station toilets. The child was released. The defendant now disputes some detail of this event and the asserted intention which he harboured at the time. He has not been consistent in this regard and on some occasions has admitted sinister intent. Sometimes he has said that he was taking the child to spite the mother with whom he claimed to have had a relationship. This early assertion by the defendant was rejected in a statement by the mother of the child who described him as a complete stranger. In the light of the apparent brevity of the defendant’s actions with the child it was acknowledged by senior counsel for the State that it is difficult to know whether the offence committed by the defendant can be characterized as a sexual offence. For present purposes, it is convenient to assume that it is in that category. 
         
         
        He was charged with “abduct child with intent to deprive” and sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for 2 years with a non probation period of 12 months dating from 9 October 1986. With remissions which were then able to be acquired, he was released to parole (probation) on 7 July 1987.  
         
         
        This release was followed virtually immediately by the most serious by far of any offences which have been committed by the defendant. He and a former cellmate, Ferguson, hatched a plan to abduct the three children of an acquaintance of Ferguson’s. The defendant has varied his version about the planning being done before or after release from prison. Apart from adding a factor to the assessment of the defendant’s lack of credibility, nothing would turn upon this difference now. The two offenders took the children, boys aged seven and eight and a girl aged six, to Brisbane. Whilst there they subjected all three children to serious sexual assaults and, in an added incident of grossly disgusting behaviour, the offenders engaged in sexual behaviour with each other in the presence of these infants.  
         
         
        Queensland police arrested the defendant in a motel on the evening of 16 July 1987 which was therefore only ten days after his release from prison in New South Wales. Four days later, on 20 July 1987 he was convicted of a form of contempt in breach of Queensland bail legislation and for this he was sentenced to imprisonment for three months. 
         
         
        In June 1988 he was convicted of a series of offences arising out of his participation in the abduction and abuse of the three children and sentenced to an effective total term of 11 years imprisonment. 
         
         
        The defendant was released into the community on 5 January 1999. He was not subject to parole or other conditions as his sentence had been served in full. The next offence of a sexual kind was committed on 20 September 2001. In the interim and still in Queensland he was convicted of two offences, the first of being found in a dwelling house or yard and the second of using the telecommunications service in an offensive manner, for which he received a fine option order of 19 hours community service and a fine of $500 respectively. It follows that he was at unsupervised liberty for over two and a half years before committing what became his last offence involving actual sexual misconduct. 
        
       
      
    8 (His Honour’s chronology requires minor correction. In fact the last offence was committed on 21 January 2001 making the period at liberty two years. That change is of no consequence) (at [14]-[27]): 
     
      
       
        
         
        “On 21 January 2001 the defendant attended a church service in Bankstown with his mother and thereafter at a function which followed the service. Whilst he was there he invited a four year old boy to go to the toilet with him. The boy refused. The defendant then persuaded a nine year old boy to accompany him. Once inside the toilet block he took the child into a cubicle where the defendant pulled down the boy’s pants and pulled his penis twice. The boy began to cry and the defendant hugged him but the boy ran out of the block. The defendant was immediately arrested. 
         
         
        On 20 September 2001 he was convicted at Penrith District Court of indecent assault of a child under the age of ten years. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years and 6 months with a non parole period of 18 months. He had been in custody since his arrest and the sentence was directed to commence on 21 January 2001 and it would, in respect of the total term, expire on 20 July 2004. It can be noted that in his remarks on sentence Judge O’Reilly recorded his findings that the offence was impulsive and not planned, which was obviously a circumstance in marked contrast with the offences of 1987 of which his Honour was aware. His Honour added an observation that the defendant had said that he felt ashamed about this new offence and that he had “let down himself and his mother”. In structuring the sentence, O’Reilly DCJ expressly referred to the need for “at least two years post release supervision and treatment”.  
         
         
        The defendant was not granted parole and was simply released into the community once he had served the entirety of the full term of the imprisonment which his Honour ordered. There was no post release supervision and treatment offered or given to the defendant. 
         
         
        The offence on 21 January 2001 is the last offence by the defendant which involved sexual misconduct of any kind. There was a complaint in December 2007 by a cellmate of a sexual proposition, or at least a statement of desire, while the defendant was in custody but nothing appears to have come of this. Special rules of evidence recognize the unreliability of the testimony of prison informers claiming to have heard confessions of guilt, one reason for this being the possible advantage to be gained by the informer if evidence is concocted. Somewhat analogously this complainant may, for example, have wished to acquire a change in accommodation and in the absence of any confirmatory material, I would not place any great weight on this asserted circumstance. The cellmate was, of course, an adult. 
         
         
        Since his unconditional release from custody after service of the sentence for the offence on 21 January 2001 the defendant has been returned to custody twice. Although in terms of sentence for offence the defendant was, as I have described it, released unconditionally, he had by reason of his offending acquired obligations pursuant to the  
        Child Protection (Offenders Registration) Act 
         2000. At about the time of his release from custody on 20 July 2004 he was served with a notice of what was required of him under that statute. He was due to attend a New South Wales police station by 16 August 2004 in order to register his details. He failed to do so. He had not absconded and on 25 August 2004 he was arrested at Cardinal Freeman Centre at Granville where he had apparently sought and been granted, at least temporarily, some accommodation. He was charged under the lastmentioned Act and released on bail. 
         
         
        I consider that it is a matter of some significance as demonstrating a capacity for some insight that in October 2004 the defendant admitted himself to Cumberland Psychiatric Hospital as he considered himself to be a risk to himself and others. He was not unfamiliar with this institution and there are notes of his having been admitted to it on some seven occasions before 1986, all of which were before the first of the sexual offences which I have chronicled. 
         
         
        However, upon his discharge from hospital he did not return to Granville and went to other accommodation in Ashfield. He did not, as required, register a change of address. On 20 December 2004 he was arrested and bail was refused. On 12 January 2005 for breach of his reporting requirements he was sentenced at Parramatta Local Court to imprisonment for 8 months with a non parole period of 1 month. Given the length of that sentence, he would have been ordered by the Court to be released to parole after the expiry of the non parole period but six days after appearing in Court for sentence the Parole Board, exercising its powers under sentence administration legislation, resolved to revoke his parole in its entirety. Once again, the defendant served the total term and he was released without parole after total sentence expiry on 19 August 2005. Thus he neither received the benefit of supervision by a probation and parole officer nor was he subject to any conditions save those independently imposed upon him by the registration legislation. 
         
         
        During this liberty the defendant entered the mental health unit at Bankstown Hospital apparently because of an increase in suicidal ideation.  
         
         
        On 25 December 2006 the defendant went to Queensland and remained there beyond the permissible time that he could, without authorization, remain outside New South Wales pursuant to the registration regime. He further breached his obligations by failing to notify his change of address. Prior to his departure he had been living at Revesby in Housing Commission rental accommodation which he had himself organized whilst he was in custody.  
         
         
        In January 2007 while he was in Queensland the defendant formed an association with a woman Megan Porter. Ms Porter is described as both physically and mentally disabled and is assisted by carers who were identified by the defendant in evidence as Nick and Fiona. Given the clear breaches by the defendant of his obligations under the New South Wales registration laws, it is a little surprising that on 15 February 2007 the defendant was approached by Queensland police and he signed an acknowledgement concerning his obligations under parallel Queensland law but nothing seems to have been raised about his breach of New South Wales requirements. Of course it may have been that the actions of the Queensland police were triggered solely by the consequences of the convictions for which the defendant had served 11 years imprisonment in that State and the particular officers may not have been aware of his current New South Wales obligations. In any event, the defendant told them that he was returning to New South Wales in two weeks time and he stipulated that his destination was Foster House in Surry Hills. The defendant neither made arrangements to go to Foster House nor in fact went there but he did return to New South Wales and resumed residence at the Housing Commission premises at Revesby of which he was the tenant, and where he was arrested on 21 February 2007. 
         
         
        In testimony in the proceedings the defendant was cross examined about his intention to return to Queensland and statements which he had made to that effect. The documentary material includes copies of correspondence authored by the defendant in which he expresses passion for Ms Porter and a desire for a shared future with her. Although he claims family acquaintance, his association with her was brief. The statements of intent were made before the strictures of the Act and its consequences were explained to and appreciated by the defendant. He gave evidence that he now understood the scope of the restrictions upon him which would accompany release under supervision. The defendant’s ability for compliance cannot be tested while he is detained in prison. 
         
         
        He has remained in custody since 21 February 2007. On 23 May 2007 he was convicted of failing to comply with his obligations under the registration laws and sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 12 months dating from 22 February 2007 and which expired on 21 February 2008. He has remained in prison thereafter pursuant to a series of interim orders under the  
        Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 
         2006, the last of which was made by me and expires on Friday 16 May 2008 next. There is an “ultimate bar” against interim detention orders keeping the defendant longer than three months after expiry of his sentence. The relevant date upon which this has effect will therefore be 20 May 2008 (s 16 (3)).  
         
         
        As I have already observed, by reason of definition, the convictions of the defendant on 12 January 2005 and 23 May 2007 were, for the purposes of founding jurisdiction under the 2006 Act, classified as offences of “a sexual nature” but in respect of neither of them was there allegation of sexual misconduct of any sort and the gravamen of the offences were failures to inform authority of where he was or where he was going. The acceptable evidence is that the most recent offence involving sexual misconduct by the defendant was that which occurred after the church service some seven years ago. 
        
       
       
        
        It is not to be ignored that the defendant has a record of criminal behaviour other than sexual offending. He was first before a children’s court in March 1980, when he would have been aged 15, for the offence of arson for which he was committed to an institution. Save when he was restrained by a current imprisonment, his record shows frequent offending in a variety of crimes but it should be noted that, gauging the penalties imposed from time to time, it can be deduced that none of that offending approached anywhere near the high level of seriousness of his sexual crimes. 
        
       
      
    9 The primary judge received evidence from both psychologists and forensic psychiatrists. His Honour also received evidence with respect to the physical health of the respondent. A particular concern is that the respondent has a phaeochromocytoma. This is a small and rarely occurring tumour which secretes hormones which have neuropsychiatric effects. There was evidence before the primary judge that these hormones could affect a person’s level of aggression, irascibility, sexual drive and factors such as “sexually acting out.” The consequence of the condition is that the respondent may not be able to receive anti-libidinal medication until the tumour has been successfully removed. 
     
      
    10 His Honour was provided with evidence of treatment programs designed to deal with sexual offending behaviour which have been available to the respondent in custody. They include the CUBIT (Custody Based Intensive Treatment) program which is a group therapy program available within the NSW prison system. On each occasion he attempted the program the respondent failed. Unsurprisingly in light of this evidence his Honour concluded that the respondent is unsuited for that form of treatment and found that “there are better prospects of avoiding recidivist behaviour by him if he is individually treated.” His Honour found that suitable treatment was available in the community from Ms Howell, a psychologist. 
     
      
    11 There was evidence before his Honour of changes which had been made to the CUBIT program to make it more appropriate for individuals who have difficulties with group therapy. His Honour concluded that even with those changes, treatment under a CUBIT program would not be suitable for the respondent. His Honour was satisfied that the respondent’s most likely prospect of successful rehabilitation was if he was given individual treatment by Ms Howell.  
     
      
    12 Ms Howell gave evidence before his Honour. She provided detail of her proposed treatment program and confirmed that she would be available and willing to treat the respondent outside of custody. Ms Howell proposed a treatment regime which would be conducted in consultation with a treating psychiatrist. The problem which his Honour faced was whether, if the respondent was released under supervision, Ms Howell’s services would be available to him. The respondent could not afford to pay for them and no funding was available from any private source including a medical benefits fund or from a government body. 
     
      
    13 The Acting Executive Director of Offender Services and Programs with the Department of Corrective Services, Ms Booby, gave evidence. In an affidavit she deposed to a conversation which she had on 8 May 2008 with the Commissioner of Corrective Services. In the affidavit she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 8 May 2008, I had a conversation with the Commissioner of Corrective Services, Ron Woodham, in person, about the possibility of the Department of Corrective Services providing funding for the payment of Ms Howell’s treatment of Mr Brookes. The Commissioner said to me words to the effect of: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Commissioner: I delegate you to make a decision about whether or not the Department will pay for this treatment as a means of protecting the public.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Based on my knowledge of this matter and of Mr Brookes’ history, I have decided that the Department will not pay Ms Howell to provide the treatment for Mr Brookes that is outlined in her draft affidavit. 
        
       
       
        
        I have made this decision for the following reasons: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) I do not believe that the treatment plan outlined by Ms Howell in her affidavit will provide adequate protection for the community from the risk of sexual recidivism posed by Mr Brookes; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) I maintain the view, as expressed in my earlier affidavit at paragraph 43, that there is no community-based program which would be capable of treating Mr Brookes’ untreated high risk of re-offending; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the advice I have received from Mr Andrew Kaw, A/Clinical Co-ordinator of the Challenging Behaviour Management Team (“CBMT”), is that the treatment proposed by Ms Howell will not adequately address Mr Brookes’ personality disorders; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) I believe the preferable treatment for Mr Brookes’ personality disorders and risk of sexual recidivism is that outlined in my earlier affidavit at paragraphs 28 to 42; and 
        
       
       
        
        (e) although the Department has provided funding for private treatment in the community in relation to another serious sex offender, Mr Sleeman, there were special circumstances in that case. The special circumstances included: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) The fact that Mr Sleeman had Asperger’s Syndrome and at that time the Department’s custodial sex offender treatment program was unable to treat a high risk sex offender with Asperger’s Syndrome; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) The Department only intervened to pay for the treatment by Ms Howell when Mr Sleeman, already on parole and on a disability pension, became unable to afford to pay for the treatment. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I do not consider there to be equivalent special circumstances in Mr Brookes’ case to warrant payment by the Department for private sex offender treatment in the community.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 Having regard to this evidence his Honour concluded that “there are funds that can be made available for payment of treatment of the defendant outside custody.” His Honour said of Ms Booby’s evidence (at [79]-[80]):  
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Booby continued to depose that she has decided not to pay Ms Howell “based on my knowledge of this matter and Mr Brookes’ history”. The collateral issue before the Court is whether there are available funds and, as I have concluded on the above testimony, there is such an availability. Ms Booby added reasons for her intended decision. The reasons include her opinions that compliance with Ms Howell’s plan will not adequately protect the community and that her treatment will not address the defendant’s personality disorders. As Professor Greenberg and Dr Allnutt explicitly acknowledged, these matters are decisions to be made by the Court and the legislation casts the responsibility for such decisions on it and not upon the Department of Corrective Services.  
         
         
        I note that a further reason expressed by Ms Booby was that “there is no community based programme which would be capable of treating Mr Brookes untreated high risk reoffending”. That opinion implies that the statutory availability of an extended supervision order is virtually hypothetical and I would reject any inference that Parliament might have so intended. Ms Howell is in active practice and I would accord preference to her view as to treatment capability.” 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour further said (at [85]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Booby described an occasion when the Department did pay for external services, in fact provided by Ms Howell, but said that she did not consider “there to be equivalent special circumstances” to warrant payment in respect of treatment for the defendant. I am unaware of the source of a test requiring the demonstration of “special circumstances”. I do not accept that in a case where an order ought be made for extended supervision, the statutory intent to make that option available can be subverted by a bureaucratic decision, particularly if it is based upon an arbitrarily determined test, not to spend funds which are in fact otherwise available.” 
         
        
       
      
    16 Having made these findings his Honour proceeded to address the statutory questions. His Honour was satisfied to a high degree of probability that the respondent is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he is not kept under supervision. However, he said that he was “not satisfied that adequate supervision will not be provided by an extended supervision order. I am satisfied that adequate supervision will be provided by such an order” (at [86]). 
     
      
    17 His Honour then provided a summary of some of his principal reasons for reaching these conclusions. He said (at [87]-[92]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The defendant is now 20 years older than at the time of his most serious offending and seven years older than when he committed his last offence. It is true that the psychiatrists generally referred to “burn out” at an older age than the defendant but there is promise that he can restrain his criminal impulses in the two recent releases from custody without supervision during which he committed no offence involving any act of sexual misconduct. The likelihood of the absence of offence should increase if there is an application of supervision. There is a significant indication of the defendant’s capacity for obedience in his compliance with the registration requirement in Queensland when police approached him. The indication is that when direction is given he will comply. What he has not had in the past is that direction. It is a further sign of promise that the defendant does not adopt a posture of denial of offending. 
         
         
        Obviously the defendant must be treated. For the reasons above adumbrated I would discount the prospect of a satisfactory outcome from another attempt at CUBIT even in the altered format now adopted. The defendant’s reluctance to make a fifth try at custody based treatment is reasonable and he is willing to undergo the treatment offered by Ms Howell. As I have said, this is a form of individual treatment and it has never been offered over the last 20 years, most of which the defendant was held in custody. 
         
         
        It is now known that at least a partial explanation for some of the defendant’s behaviour may be derived from the side effects of the tumour which has now been removed. I accept that this is of minor consequence in the sense that it was likely to have been present only in recent years and although, inter alia, it was depositing hormones, it was not during this recent period that the defendant committed any offence other than in respect of his registration obligations. 
         
         
        The insertion of conditions which require discipline and the subjection of the defendant to supervision should create a situation which is novel in the sense that he has not in any practical way been on parole in the past. This should assist in many areas including those where compliance is required, especially with medication administration. I give weight to the circumstance that, through his counsel, the defendant expresses his contentment with the making of a supervision order. I am aware of the defendant’s statements of intention to appeal and sue (presumably for false imprisonment) but I am satisfied that those outbursts are manifestations of the defendant’s personality which I anticipate would be addressed in the course of Ms Howell’s treatment. I expect that he would receive some legal advice about such matters. 
         
         
        The expert assessments that the defendant is “institutionalized” provoke some comment. It can be suggested that that characteristic may result in his amenability to direction and to the requirements of a structure of supervision. Nevertheless the defendant has shown that he is not without some living skills as the arrangements which he made whilst a prisoner, for the Housing Commission to lease to him the residence at Revesby shows.  
         
         
        Section 11 specifies conditions which may be placed on a supervision order. The available conditions are not limited to those expressed. Counsel for the defendant has submitted a draft of conditions in his written submissions which I infer convey an indication of consent by the defendant and, importantly, an indication of intent to abide by them. The alternative prayer in the summons sets out conditions desired by the State in the event that a supervision order were to be made. I will draw upon all of these sources.” 
        
       
      
    18 Having made these findings his Honour ordered that the respondent be subject to extended supervision for a period of five years and imposed a number of obligations by way of conditions. The conditions include: 
     
      
       
        
        (j) The defendant is to participate in treatment and rehabilitation if it is made available by Ms Jenny Howell and he is to obey her reasonable directions including, but not limited to, requiring his attendance at consultations with other health, psychological or psychiatric practitioners; 
         
         
        (k) The defendant must accept any psychiatric treatment offered by the Community Forensic Mental Health Service and comply with any requirement to receive any medication directed by them including anti-libidinal or psychiatric medication which has been prescribed by a qualified practitioner; 
         
         
        (l) The defendant must comply with reasonable requests of the Community Forensic Mental Health Service to attend for consultation and examination including providing material for pathology testing and undergoing medical imaging; 
         
         
        (m) The defendant is, when practicable after release from custody and in any event within one month thereof, to consult a general practitioner and consent to the disclosure of medical information between that practitioner, the Community Forensic Mental Health Service and any treating psychologist or psychiatrist. 
        
       
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    19 The appellant challenged both his Honour’s finding with respect to funding and the orders which he made. It was submitted that his Honour erred in finding that funding would be available for treatment of the respondent by Ms Howell. It was further submitted that, even if funding may be available, his Honour could not make an order which required the appellant to provide that funding so that the respondent could be treated. It was further submitted, albeit without elaboration, that his Honour was in error to provide for the release of the respondent even though he could not presently receive anti-libidinal medication. 
     
      
    20 A similar problem to that confronting the Court in the present case was considered by this Court in Winters v Attorney-General of NSW [2008] NSWCA 33. However, as I will explain there is a significant factual difference between the circumstances applying to Mr Winters and those of the present respondent. 
     
      
    21 In Winters the primary judge found that having regard to the evidence before the court, community based one-on-one treatment would not be available to Mr Winters. The State Government had not made provision for its funding and the evidence was that there was no present intention to change that position. The primary judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As it happens the lack of community based treatment is material to my decision to make a detention order. However, the fact that it is not available to Mr Winters is as a result of two factors. Firstly, as a matter of policy the government has presently determined that it will not support one-on-one counselling in the community other than in extraordinary circumstances. Secondly, Mr Winters’ personal impecuniosity means that he cannot meet the cost of treatment from his own resources.” 
        
       
      
    22 The evidence in Winters confirmed the necessity for treatment if Mr Winters was to be safely released into the community. Because the evidence established that no source of funding was available the finding that treatment was not available was inevitable. Because the primary judge was satisfied that Mr Winters could only be released if treatment was available, to provide for his release on condition that such treatment was received would be futile. A failure to comply with the requirement of an order would be an offence. In this Court, Mason P concluded that it would be unjust “to make a direction that the appellant attend upon Ms Howell unless the Court were satisfied that the State was itself intending or required to take the necessary steps to enable performance to take place, ie agree to the funding” [28]. His Honour concluded that the Act does not empower the Court to make a direction about participation in a particular treatment or rehabilitation program “unless it is one that is available to the offender.” His Honour concluded that if treatment could not be funded it would not be available and accordingly the Court must disregard any prospect of community based treatment when making its decision. Such a requirement would be “both an injustice and a futility” [32]. 
     
      
    23 Giles JA observed that the Act does not state that the Government must make funds available to ensure that any condition provided by an extended supervision order is met. His Honour concluded that “courts should not make orders knowing that they are likely to be futile, nor should they seek to compel indirectly what can not be compelled by a direct order. Where a third party must do something to make the order effective, whether the third party will do it cannot be ignored, and no less when the third party is the Government.” The order contemplated by the legislation is an order which can be put into effect and it is to that order which the decision in relation to adequacy of supervision must relate. However, his Honour allowed for the prospect that a decision not to fund a particular necessary condition may be unreasonable and acknowledged the possibility that a decision which was unreasonable may attract consideration of whether or not the proceedings were an abuse of process (see [69]). 
     
      
    24 Hodgson JA observed that when legislation authorises a court to make orders which require action by the State, evidence that the State would not do what was required of it to make the order effective is not admissible. The Court will assume that the Executive would perform the function that by passing the legislation the Parliament has indicated it should perform. However, where an obligation has not been imposed by the Parliament his Honour concluded that it would not be appropriate to assume that the Executive will do what the Court believes to be appropriate. With respect to the Act his Honour said that the terms of s 11(d) do not limit the treatment or rehabilitation programs which may be specified in an order and do not disclose an intention that the Court should be able to formulate any such program as it chooses and to assume irrebuttably that the Executive would provide such a program. His Honour said that “If a program is proposed which on its face seems to be one which should reasonably be supported by the Executive … then in my opinion the Court may assume that the State will provide it, but only as a rebuttable presumption of fact” [122]. 
     
      
    25 Hodgson JA recognised that the Court has a discretion to decline to make any order. He suggested that “this discretion could perhaps be exercised if the Court considered to be sufficiently unreasonable a failure by the Executive to make provision which would give effect to appropriate conditions of a supervision order” [124]. His Honour said (at [125]-[128]): 
     
      
       
        
        “That there is such a discretion is suggested by the use of the word “may” in s17(1), (2) and (3), by the form of s17(2) and (3) specifying conditions precedent that must be satisfied before an order “may” be made, and by the terms of s17(4), in particular s17(4)(a). The safety of the community is not a matter relevant to the conditions precedent in s17(2) and (3), so must go to the exercise of a discretion. Of course, the terms of s17(4)(a), particularly when combined with the new s3 which makes the safety and protection of the community the primary object of the Act, provide very powerful grounds for exercising this discretion in favour of making an order, once the conditions precedent are satisfied; but there is in my opinion a discretion not to make an order.  
         
         
        The Act provides for detention of offenders beyond the expiration of the sentence imposed as being appropriate in respect of their offending, and discloses an intention that effective supervision should be provided where this is adequate, and that continued detention should be ordered only where supervision would not be adequate. In those circumstances, for the Executive to seek to secure the continued detention of an offender, while making inadequate provision for effective supervision which would have enabled the offender’s release, might be considered unreasonable and might justify an exercise of discretion against the granting of an order.  
         
         
        I note that in  
        Fardon v Attorney General (Queensland) 
         [2004] HCA 46, (2004) 223 CLR 575, in which the High Court of Australia upheld the constitutional validity of the similar Queensland legislation, Gleeson CJ said this at paragraph [19]:  
         
         
          
          [19] The Act is a general law authorising the preventive detention of a prisoner in the interests of community protection. It authorises and empowers the Supreme Court to act in a manner which is consistent with its judicial character. It does not confer functions which are incompatible with the proper discharge of judicial responsibilities or with the exercise of judicial power. It confers a substantial discretion as to whether an order should be made, and if so, the type of order. If an order is made, it might involve either detention or release under supervision. The onus of proof is on the Attorney-General. The rules of evidence apply. The discretion is to be exercised by reference to the criterion of serious danger to the community. The Court is obliged, by s 13(4) of the Act, to have regard to a list of matters that are all relevant to that criterion. There is a right of appeal. Hearings are conducted in public, and in accordance with the ordinary judicial process. There is nothing to suggest that the Supreme Court is to act as a mere instrument of government policy. The outcome of each case is to be determined on its merits.  
          
         
         
        If the Supreme Court was bound to make an order for continued detention, whenever the Executive made no provision for appropriate supervision, it could be said that the Supreme Court was a mere instrument for Government policy.  
         
         
        On the other hand, decisions about how to allocate resources for the rehabilitation of offenders and the protection of the community are decisions for Parliament and/or the Executive and not for the courts.” 
        
       
      
    26 Hodgson JA ultimately concluded that having regard to the evidence in that case, the primary judge was entitled to draw the inference that funding for Ms Howell’s services would not be provided. It followed that any presumption that the State would fund the necessary treatment was effectively rebutted. 
     
      
    27 As I have earlier indicated there is a significant difference between the evidence in the present case and the evidence in Winters. In Winters the Court accepted that the Department did not have funds which could be allocated to provide one-on-one counselling for Mr Winters in the community. In the present case Ms Booby’s evidence was that funds could be made available and that she had been delegated authority to make a decision as to whether they should be provided. For reasons substantially related to her conclusion that treatment of the respondent by Ms Howell would not be appropriate she made a decision not to authorise the available funds to be provided. The primary judge concluded that funds were available and if Ms Booby chose to release them the necessary treatment could be provided. 
     
      
    28 Ms Booby made her decision at a time when the evidence considered by the primary judge in relation to the prospective effectiveness of the contemplated treatment was not available. In light of that evidence and with the benefit of detailed submissions his Honour reached a conclusion different to that reached by Ms Booby. As I have related his Honour concluded that the respondent is unsuited for group therapy treatment and “there are better prospects of avoiding recidivist behaviour by him if he is individually treated.” His Honour was satisfied that if the respondent was released Ms Howell would provide him with “appropriate treatment.” 
     
      
    29 Before an extended supervision order can be made the Court must be “satisfied to a high degree of probability that the offender is likely to commit a further serious sex offence if he or she is not kept under supervision” (s 9(2) of the Act). Conditions may be imposed on the order. In the present case his Honour did not provide that the respondent must be treated by Ms Howell as a condition of the order. Instead his Honour provided that the respondent must accept such treatment “if it is made available.” His Honour recognised that it would not be made available unless Ms Howell was adequately compensated. If the State does not fund Ms Howell’s services the effect of his Honour’s order will be that the respondent is released without any obligation for treatment. However, no question of the order becoming futile could arise.  
     
      
    30 This is not a case where the Court has impermissibly intervened to dictate the decision which falls within the exclusive province of the Executive or the Legislature. The evidence clearly indicates that the respondent requires treatment in order to protect the community. Ms Booby having indicated that funds could be provided to fund Ms Howell’s services, the Court is entitled to expect, that the primary judge having decided that the respondent should be released under supervision, Ms Booby will, in the responsible exercise of the discretion given to her, decide to release the necessary funds. In the language of administrative law any other decision would be irrational. The Court must assume that the Executive will not make an irrational decision. 
     
      
    31 The State further submitted that given the difficulties which the tumour creates for the respondent accepting anti-libidinal medication it was not open to his Honour to provide for the respondent’s release. His Honour gave careful consideration to this issue as one of the many issues which required resolution. To my mind his Honour did not err by providing that anti-libidinal medication should be administered if and when the respondent is able to accept it. Although no doubt the medication would provide extra assurance that the respondent would not offend, the evidence did not require a conclusion that the respondent should only be released if it could be administered. 
     
      
    32 In my judgment the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is a Crown appeal with respect to the sentence imposed on the respondent Ronald Schultz. The appeal was heard on 11 August 2008 when the court unanimously ordered that it should be dismissed and indicated that its reasons would be published at a later date. These are my reasons for joining in that decision.  
     
      
    2 The respondent pleaded guilty to three offences as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count one: Impose upon the Commonwealth between 28 September 1984 and 24 October 1984 in a total sum of $377.60 being a breach of s 29B  
      Crimes Act  
      1914 (Cth). 
       
       
      Count two: Defraud the Commonwealth between 25 October 1984 and 23 May 2001 in the sum of $130,858.79 being a breach of s 29D of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1914 (Cth). 
       
       
      Count three: Dishonestly obtain financial advantage from a Commonwealth entity between 24 May 2001 and 28 November 2006 in the sum of $67,266.77 being a breach of s 134.2(1)  
      Criminal Code  
      1995 (Cth). 
       
      
    3 In relation to each offence the respondent was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
      Section 29B offence – released without passing sentence pursuant to s 20(1)(a)  
      Crimes Act  
      1914 on self surety of $200, to be of good behaviour for 3 years from 16 April 2008. 
       
       
      Section 29D offence – sentenced pursuant to s 20(1)(b)  
      Crimes Act  
      1914 to 18 months imprisonment to commence on 16 April 2008 and to be released after 6 months upon entering into a recognizance on self surety of $200, to be of good behaviour for 2 years from 15 October 2008. 
       
       
      Section 134.2(1) offence – sentenced pursuant to s 20(1)(b)  
      Crimes Act  
      1914 to 2 years and 3 months imprisonment to commence on 16 April 2008 and to be released after 6 months upon entering into a recognizance on self surety of $200, to be of good behaviour for 2 years from 15 October 2008. 
       
      
    4 Each charge relates to a continuous course of conduct, although the relevant legislation was amended during that course of conduct. The maximum penalty for a breach of s 29B of the Crimes Act was 2 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $20,000. The maximum penalty for a breach of s 29D was originally imprisonment for a term of 5 years and/or a fine of $50,000. However, the maximum penalty changed in 1986 to imprisonment for 10 years and/or a fine of $100,000. It changed again on 7 April 1997 when the maximum fine became $110,000. Section 29D was repealed on 23 May 2001 and replaced by s 134.2(1) Criminal Code 1995. An offence against that provision carries a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment and/or a fine of $66,000. 
     
      
    5 The offences all concern the receipt by the respondent of age pension payments made in the name of his mother, Elsie Schultz. Mrs Schultz was entitled to the pension and lodged an authority with the Department of Social Security in 1978 which had the effect of appointing the respondent as her “payment nominee”. In accordance with that authority her age pension payments were thereafter paid into a bank account controlled by the respondent. Mrs Schultz passed away on 6 July 1982. However, payments of her pension continued to be made throughout the period of the respondent’s offending. 
     
      
    6 On 28 September 1984 an “entitlement review” form in the name of Elsie Schultz was lodged with the Department of Social Security stating that she resided at 139 The Kingsway, Cronulla and paid $20 per week in board and lodging to her son, the respondent, who resided at the same address. Thereafter a rent assistance form in her name was lodged with the Department of Social Security on 13 April 1989 which provided similar particulars. An income review form was lodged on 14 November 1989 in which it was stated that Mrs Shultz was paying $30 per week in board to the respondent. 
     
      
    7 As a consequence of the respondent’s deception he received $198,503.16 which was deposited into a bank account controlled by him over a 22 year period. When interviewed by the police the respondent confessed his wrongdoing and admitted that he had lodged the relevant false declarations with the Department. 
     
      
    8 The sentencing judge carefully reviewed the circumstances of the respondent’s offending. He also considered the respondent’s subjective case. In order to make reparation for the money received the respondent has been required to sell his house. He has repaid all amounts owing. As a result of these offences his marriage has failed. He now has significant health issues and suffers from pain in his shoulder, neck, back, right groin, right hip, both ankles and a knee. His pain is controlled by analgesics. It is apparent that he will require surgical intervention for some of his disabilities.  
     
      
    9 The sentencing judge received evidence from a psychologist indicating that the respondent exhibits depressive symptomology which has been present over a long period of time. The psychologist gave evidence that the respondent has suffered from a gambling problem during periods of his life. 
     
      
    10 The sentencing judge provided extensive and detailed remarks on sentence. Although a useful explanation of his Honour’s reasoning they went significantly beyond the purpose which remarks are required to serve. The fundamental objective of remarks on sentence is to explain to the prisoner in language that he or she can understand the reasons for the sentence which the court imposes. Although consideration must be given to all relevant issues it is unnecessary, and in many cases inappropriate, to discuss the detail of previously decided cases. 
     
      
    11 His Honour determined that having regard to the objective criminality of the offences and notwithstanding the respondent’s subjective circumstances a term of imprisonment was appropriate. His Honour determined that a term of periodic detention would not be adequate. As his Honour put it “in the scheme of things so extensive is his criminality, noting the significant amount of money that the offender received, the offending could only be met in my view appropriately with some form of full time custody to give proper recognition to the element of general deterrence.” 
     
      
    12 Notwithstanding the fact that the respondent had maintained his deception over many years and had made three false declarations to the Commonwealth his Honour classified the objective criminality as being less than an offence involving “deliberation and sophistication”. His Honour had in mind that greater criminality would be involved in an offence where false names, false accounts and false identities had been created.  
     
      
    13 His Honour accordingly determined to impose the prison sentences which I have identified. By the application of the provisions of s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act (Cth) his Honour made directions for the respondent to be released on recognizance at the expiration of 6 months of his sentences. The parties are agreed that by making release orders in relation to each sentence there was a technical non-compliance with s 20(1)(b). Only one recognizance was required. The parties are agreed that if the appeal were to be dismissed this Court should intervene to impose an appropriate direction. 
     
      
    14 The Crown does not challenge the head sentences. Although it was submitted that they are moderate it was accepted that in all the circumstances they were within the available range for these offences. However, the Crown challenged his Honour’s directions that the respondent be released on recognizance after only six months in custody. It was submitted that the requirement that the respondent serve only six months in fulltime custody was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    15 The Crown submitted that the manifest inadequacy was explained by his Honour’s failure to consider whether the custodial term should fall within “the generally accepted range of 60% to 66.6% and up to 75% in the worst cases (see Bernier (1998) 102 A Crim R 44; Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 427). In the respondent’s case the six months recognizance release order represents only 33.3% of the head term for count 2 and 22.2% of the head term for count 3. 
     
      
    16 The Commonwealth emphasised that the sentencing judge had made no reference to the “accepted range” in his remarks on sentence and provided no explanation as to why he considered it appropriate to depart to such a significant degree from that range. The Crown further submitted that if there is no “tariff” which dictates the minimum term set by means of non-parole period or recognizance release order, it must nevertheless be of sufficient length to ensure that the sentence reflects the criminality involved and does not inappropriately diminish the very important impact of general deterrence: R v Drazkiewicz (unreported, CCA, 23 November 1993 per Badgery-Parker J at p 7). It was submitted that although a minimum term is of benefit for the offender and is intended to assist his rehabilitation it must not be shortened beyond the lower limit of what might reasonably be regarded as appropriate punishment: The Queen v Shrestha (1990) 173 CLR 48 (per Brennan and McHugh JJ at 63). 
     
      
    17 The respondent submitted that there was no recognisable relationship between the head sentence and the period provided in relation to any recognizance release order. To support this proposition the Court was referred to Johnsson v R [2007] NSWCCA 192 where Grove J said (at [30]) “the convention requiring division of term where a non-parole period is specified does not govern the principles to be applied when recognizance release is ordered.” It was further submitted that there was a clear distinction between a recognizance release order and the release of a prisoner to parole (see R v Smith [2004] QCA 417 at [9]-[10]). 
     
      
    18 In relation to the sentence which his Honour imposed the respondent emphasised the sentencing judge’s findings that the offence was not the worst of its kind, was opportunistic and lacked deliberation, planning and sophistication. It was submitted that having regard to the nature of the offending and the subjective circumstances of the respondent a period of six months full-time custody was adequate to both punish him and deter others who might be tempted to commit a similar offence. 
     
      
    19 In the circumstances of the present case it is unnecessary to resolve the dispute as to whether there is or should be a recognised relationship between a head sentence and a period provided in a recognizance release order. However, given the circumstances when such an order is available and may be appropriate, the approach adopted in Johnsson has considerable merit. It allows the court sufficient flexibility to impose a sentence which can provide both adequate punishment but also encourage the offender’s rehabilitation. 
     
      
    20 In my judgment the term of full-time custody which his Honour provided was manifestly inadequate. I accept that an offence which involves planning and the creation of the fraudulent documents necessary to perpetrate the offence may in some circumstances be objectively more significant than the present offence. However, the respondent maintained his deception over many years. During the course of his criminal activity he created three false declarations and continued to exploit the weaknesses in the Commonwealth’s administrative processes to his financial advantage. To my mind his criminality was significant and, notwithstanding his subjective circumstances, required that he serve a custodial term significantly greater than six months. Social security fraud is notoriously difficult for the Commonwealth to police. When it is discovered a punishment must be imposed which marks out the offence as serious and sends a message to the community that anyone contemplating committing a similar offence can expect a significant period of full-time custody. 
     
      
    21 This matter comes before the Court as a Crown appeal for which the principles are well known: see R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [30]; citing Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295; Lowndes v The Queen (1999) 195 CLR 665, Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321. The Court has a lively discretion to refuse to intervene even if error has been shown. 
     
      
    22 In the present case the respondent is due for release on 15 October 2008 which was approximately 8 weeks from the day of the hearing of this appeal. There is evidence before this Court, which was accepted by the Crown as relevant to the Court’s discretion, which confirms that the respondent requires medical attention which is not available to him within the prison system. This may be a result of either or both the fact that he has received a relatively short period of full-time custody or the direction that he serve his prison term in the penal institution at Muswellbrook. In any event it is apparent that his period of custody has involved particular hardship. 
     
      
    23 The respondent is 61 years of age and has retired from his employment. In order to repay the Commonwealth he has sold his home and has little if any assets. If he is to re-establish himself successfully in society he will need to obtain employment suited to his physical limitations. This may require retraining and he will certainly be required to obtain skills beyond those he utilised during his working life when he worked on the New South Wales railways and at an oil refinery until limited by physical injury. 
     
      
    24 If this Court was to impose a further term of full-time custody appropriate to his offending it would involve unusual hardship. In my judgment that hardship would not in all the circumstances be justified. For these reasons I joined in the making of the following orders: 
     
      
       
      Orders: 
       
       
      1. The appeals are dismissed and the sentence on count 1 is confirmed. In relation to counts 2 and 3 the head sentence and release dates are confirmed. In lieu of the direction which was made by the sentencing judge the Court directs that the respondent be released at the expiration of 6 months of his sentence upon entering a recognizance pursuant to s 20(1)(b) himself in the sum of $200, to be of good behaviour for a period of 2 years from that date and to appear and receive sentence if so called upon at any time in respect of any breach within the relevant period. 
       
       
      2. A further direction is that he accept the supervision and guidance of an officer of the NSW Probation Service for a period of 2 years and obey all reasonable directions. He must report to the Probation Service within 7 days of his release. Date for release is confirmed as 15 October 2008.

   JUDGMENT1 The jury in this matter had been deliberating for some time, when they told the court officer that they had reached a verdict. The officer then told me. I asked for the court to be assembled. However within a very short time, indeed less than a minute, of me learning that the jury had reached a verdict I was also informed that Mr Leonard, the accused, had been taken unwell. Mr Leonard is appearing for himself at his trial.2 At the conclusion of yesterday’s proceedings I remanded him in custody. He was therefore in the custody of corrective service officers this morning at the time it was reported to me he had been taken ill. It now transpires that Mr Leonard has been taken away to hospital in an ambulance. Information I received suggested that Mr Leonard was not feigning any illness but, on the assessment of the ambulance officers, appeared to be genuinely and significantly unwell. I do know from earlier proceedings in which Mr Leonard has appeared in front of me that he has, in the past, suffered a heart attack. He is seventy-four years of age. One of the matters he was going to rely on when I was to sentence him for matters (not the subject of the jury trial, of course) was his poor health.3 It has now been some time since the jury announced that they had reached a verdict. A very simple issue has come up. Do I take the verdict or not? Mr Leonard is not present, cannot be present, and has not voluntarily absented himself. In those circumstances am I allowed to take the verdict from the jury? 4 Of course as I think I mentioned, a complicating factor is that Mr Leonard appears unrepresented. There has been no-one here to protect his interests during the course of the submissions as to what I should do in the present circumstances. Nor, if I were to take the verdict, would there be anyone here to protect his interests to ensure there was no irregularity in the way the verdict was taken. Balanced against that circumstance is that these proceedings are recorded on sound and so there will be available a sound recording of what would occur if I took the verdict. 5 There are many cases discussing the situation where an accused voluntarily absents himself. Perhaps the best known in this case is R v McHardie and Danielson [1988] 2 NSWLR 733 the case of the Woolworth bombers. I have had occasion to look at that case and many of the cases therein cited including R v Cornwell [1972] 2 NSWLR 1, and R v Thomas Castro (1879) 5 Q.B. 490. I have also looked at cases where the McHardie and Danielson principles have been referred to, including R v Mokbel [2006] VSC 520. The cases establish quite clearly that a judge has a discretion as to whether to continue a trial where an accused has voluntarily absented himself or herself by escaping. They do not, however, say anything about the position which faces me, namely, can I take a verdict when an accused person has not voluntarily absented himself but has been taken ill during the course of jury deliberations, indeed it at the very moment that the jury announced that they had reached a verdict?6 There are many authorities which say that the accused is entitled to be present throughout his trial. Clearly those authorities are directed to the proposition that an accused person is entitled to see and participate in his or her trial. An accused person is entitled to cross-examine witnesses, address the jury, take objections to evidence and so on. Of course it could be said that at this stage the accused has no role at all to play. The time for cross-examination, address and objection is past and all that remains is for the verdict to be delivered. 7 It may be that those authorities which state the general rule that an accused person is entitled to be present at his or her trial, are addressing the circumstance that an accused person is entitled to participate in his or her trial in the ways which I have mentioned above. Neither the Crown Prosecutor nor I can find any case addressing the situation where an accused is absent at a time his active involvement in the trial has come to end and all that remains is for the accused to hear the verdict. 8 In the 2005 edition of Archbold this appears: “the presence of the defendant is not essential at the return of the verdict … but in practice he usually is present”. The authors refer to two old, and rare, text books in support of that proposition. In the time I have had available I have been able to look at one of those but do not find it to be of much assistance. I note that the statement in Archbold which I have just quoted appears in a much earlier edition as well (see Archbold 32nd edition 1949 at 196) so the principle seems to have been accepted as a correct statement of law for some time. 9 The statement I have quoted is unqualified but it would be consistent with my understanding of the authorities referred to in McHardie and Danielson  such that the statement in Archbold should be interpreted as expressing the idea that a verdict may be taken from a jury when a defendant has voluntarily absented himself from his or her trial. I do not regard the statement in Archbold to be saying anything, one way or the other , about the situation with which I am presently faced. 10 Counsel referred me to s 54 of the Jury Act. That is the section that allows me to permit the jury to separate. S 54 says that I can allow the jury to separate at any time before they retire to consider their verdict, and after they retire to consider their verdict. The Crown Prosecutor makes the point that they are no longer considering their verdict. The jury has reached their verdict and indeed the time for consideration of the verdict has passed, and passed some time ago. The Crown argues that, in those circumstances, I am not allowed to permit the jury to separate. What would the result be if that was correct? The result would be that the jury would be locked up until Mr Leonard recovered sufficiently to the point where he was able to return to court. That would be, as I understand it on the information available to me, some time away and certainly not today. It would mean that the jury would have to be locked up overnight. 11 The old rule of course was that juries were locked up, without ‘food, water or candle’ even, until they reached a verdict. S 54 and its predecessors modified that position. But the Crown says that s 54 does not allow me to permit the jury to separate in the present circumstances before delivering their verdict. 12 The matter is not an easy one to resolve. It seems to be a novel one and there are difficult competing interests involved. Perhaps the most important consideration is the integrity of the verdict the jury has currently reached. It is the usual course that, as soon as a jury has reached a verdict it should be announced. Not only is this done as a matter of having regard to the personal needs of jurors to return to non-jury life, but is also designed to ensure that a verdict, once reached, is not changed. I am satisfied that the appropriate course in the present case is to take the verdict.13 I have reached this conclusion because of s 54 of the Jury Act, and, more importantly, the need to protect the integrity of the jury verdict. There is a possibility that jurors, having deliberated and reached a verdict, will commence inquiring into the background of Mr Leonard, which might mean that the jurors will attempt to resile from the verdict they have reached. If we assume for a moment that the verdict already reached by the jury is one of “not guilty” then there is a real possibility that one or more jurors will change their minds before the verdict is returned because the nature of the material they are likely to find about Mr Leonard if they make enquiries (he has an extensive, and unflattering, internet presence including many appearances on the youtube web site).14 I take into account that ordinarily an accused person is present throughout his or her trial but that is not essential. One circumstance is where the accused voluntarily absents himself or herself, and I am satisfied that another circumstance is where the accused has no effective part to play in the trial because a jury has actually reached a verdict. Such is the present situation, where the accused’s only role is to hear the verdict announced. 15 I confess to being very uncomfortable about the decision I have made. It seems to me the best of two quite bad alternatives. It is however one I have made consistent with my understanding of the law and I therefore propose to bring the jury in and ask them to deliver their verdict.

   JUDGMENTIntroduction1 Daniel William Deacon, the appellant, appeals from convictions suffered in the Local Court, Goulburn on 30 April 2008 in respect of charges in the following terms: 
     
      
      ‘First Charge: (alleging an offence contrary to s 35(1)(b) of the

        did, [sic] without reasonable excuse, neglect to provide adequate and proper medical aid for DD, a child in the said Daniel Deacon’s care.’ 
        
       
      
    2 A fourth charge of ‘Assault Occasioning Actual Bodily Harm’ contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act in the alternative to the first offence was not determined, the court having found the first charge to have been proved.3 The alleged victim is a child, born on 5 May 2000, and now 8 years of age. At the time of the alleged offences he’d recently had his 7th birthday. The appellant is his father. The parents have been separated for some time, and at the time of the alleged offences the appellant had another partner.4 The case presented by the prosecution was that the appellant became angry when he discovered the child in the lounge room of his home attempting to hide a cigarette lighter beneath a coffee table. The appellant is said to have recovered the lighter, and to punish the child held his right hand against a heater for long enough to cause a severe burn to his right index finger and knuckle. This is the conduct upon which the first charge was brought.5 The child is said to have repeatedly apologised for his misbehaviour, and went to his room followed by the appellant. It is alleged that the appellant there punched the child’s body and kicked his leg, threw a lighter which struck the bridge of his nose, and threw a television remote control which struck his stomach. This is the conduct upon which the second charge was brought.6 Thereafter the appellant sought to console his son, and applied ice to the burn throughout the night.7 The third charge was brought upon the allegation that appellant did not seek appropriate medical intervention for the burn.8 When interviewed by police, the appellant denied having caused the burn injury. He said that he was preparing dinner, leaving his son to take his bath and dress in his pyjamas, when he heard him crying. He found the child in the lounge room with his hand burned. He applied cold water and an ice pack. He had his son eat his dinner and then sent him to bed. He applied further ice packs throughout the night. The appellant kept the child home from school for two days, but said that he spoke to an employee at a chemist shop about the injury, without showing it to her. He sought no other medical assistance.9 An employee of a chemist confirmed such an enquiry from a man with a child, and that she gave advice that help from a medical practitioner should be sought. She recalled seeing the child’s hand with dressing over what was said to be a burn but did not see the burn itself.The Proceedings in the Local Court10 The hearing in the Local Court took place on 17 January 2008.11 The transcript of the proceedings before the magistrate shows the matter to have been conducted with a large measure of informality, no doubt with the best of intentions in light of the unfortunate fact that the prosecution of the appellant was brought upon the critical evidence of his small son.12 It was announced at the outset by the prosecutor that concessions were made in the interests of the appellant and the child witness. At page 1 line 26, the following appears, 
     
      
      ‘PROSECUTOR: It includes the child, only on a very narrow compass, the number of questions. We will be making certain concessions that matters would have been put pursuant to Brown v Dunne, that things on my friend’s instructions didn’t happen, but I certainly don’t require my friend to go through that exercise with the child, if that could be noted.’ 
      
    13 At page 4 line 27 the following appears (the name Walsh is a reference to Ms Walsh who appeared for the appellant at first instance and on the appeal), 
     
      
      ‘WALSH: Before DD’s – we can confirm I don’t need to put any Browne v Dunn material. 
      
     
     
      
      PROSECUTOR: Well I’ll place that on the record your Honour. DD has made a record of interview, which is exhibit 2 in these proceedings your Honour. DD makes a number of allegations and assertions against the defendant in these proceedings. 
      
     
     
      
      I do not require my friend to put matters pursuant to Browne v Dunn on her instructions that certain matters did not occur.’ 
      
    14 Exhibit 2 is the record of interview of the complainant child, DD, with two drawings attached.15 The child gave evidence from a remote room. His cross examination extended over 5 pages of transcript only, and at no point was any proposition put that the appellant did not hold the child’s hand against the heater as alleged, or that he did not kick and strike the child in the bedroom as was alleged.16 The child’s mother gave evidence of having seen the wound when she picked the child up from his father, and of a version offered by the appellant that was inconsistent with what her son told her, that his hand was held against the heater. She attributed to his father the representation that the child was playing and had fallen against the heater. She was cross-examined extensively.17 The appellant’s partner gave evidence in the prosecution case. Her statement described how she was in the kitchen eating when the appellant came running in with the child. He said that the child burned his hand on the heater, and applied cold water. She described the care provided during the night. She was cross-examined on behalf of the appellant. Her responses were largely consistent with her statement, and she denied seeing any abuse of the child at the hands of the appellant.18 The proceedings were adjourned to 6 February 2008 so that the parties could present submissions. On that day the prosecutor addressed the court, and correctly submitted that the outcome depended upon whether the court accepted the evidence of the child as credible and reliable beyond reasonable doubt. Ms Walsh had already provided comprehensive written submissions.19 On 5 March 2008 the magistrate convicted the appellant of the three offences. Her Honour correctly identified at page 5 line 35 of the transcript that the key issue in the matter was the reliability of the child. I accept that implicit in her Honour’s remarks is the need to find as credible the evidence of the complainant child before the appellant could be found to have committed any of these offences, subject to the qualification that in the case of the third offence the failure to obtain appropriate medical attention for the burn wound would not be so dependant upon the veracity of what the child had to say about these events. 20 There was strong support for the evidence of the child from the complaint made to his mother, the appellant’s failure to take the child for proper care, the nature and extent of the injury suffered, and the child’s detention at home away from school immediately after the injury was sustained. However, it remained that the determination of the guilt of the appellant in respect of the first two offences turned upon the reliability and credibility of the child.Deficiencies in the Procedures Permitted 21 The desire to minimise the distress of the child witness is commendable, but there were provisions in place designed to achieve this and at the same time allow the accused the opportunity to have his case properly presented, including appropriate cross examination of the witness upon which the prosecution case depended.22 The provisions were at the time contained in the Evidence (Children) Act 1997.23 Section 6 provided that the Act applied to evidence from a child under the age of 16 years at the time the evidence is given. Section 7 provided that interviews with children were to be recorded where the investigating official interviewing the child considered that the child’s representations may be adduced as evidence in court. The term ‘recording’ was defined in s 3 of the Evidence (Children) Act, to mean, 
     
      
      ‘(a) an audio recording, or 
       
      (b) a video recording, or 
       
      (c) a video recording accompanied by a separately but contemporaneously recorded audio recording.’ 
      
    24 This does not include a transcript prepared from any of those items.25 Section 8 provided that Part 3, providing for the presentation of evidence of children’s out of court representations applied to evidence of a previous representation of a child made in the course of an interview during which the child is questioned by an investigating official in connection with the investigation of the commission or possible commission of an offence.26 Section 9 provided that a child may give evidence of their previous representation in the form of the recording, or orally. Section 10 provided for the wishes of the child to be taken into account, and section 11 provided that the child was entitled to give evidence in chief in the form of the recording, but subject to limitations there specified to prevent the child being seen by the court whilst the interview was played.27 Section 12 provided that the evidence of a child who is not the accused person in a proceeding is not to be admitted in the form of the recording made by an investigating official unless it is proved that the accused and his lawyer were given a reasonable opportunity to listen to the audio recording and view the video recording.28 The Evidence (Children) Act applied to these proceedings. Although repealed by s 5 of the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Vulnerable Persons) Act 2007, effective from 12 October 2007, the amendments removing these provisions to the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 did not effect proceedings commenced before that date. These proceedings were to be dealt with as if the Evidence (Children) Act had not been repealed: Criminal Procedure Act, Schedule 2, Part 14, Clause 56.29 There is no indication that these provisions were given any consideration by the prosecutor or the court, which appears to have embraced the pre-trial agreements reached between the parties, thereby limiting the opportunity it had to assess the credibility and reliability of the child witness upon critical points. The matter was resolved upon the written text of the transcript of the interview between the investigating official and the child, without any assessment of the presentation of the child that might have informed the assessment of the reliability of the evidence. Moreover, such cross-examination as there was, did no more than confirm the essence of what the text of the transcript of the complainant’s interview.30 If the Local Court was to be so limited in the material available for it to perform its task, how might this court be expected to determine the appeal confined to the transcript of the evidence so presented. The challenge for this court is to form its own view of the facts upon the transcript of the proceedings before the magistrate, taking into account the advantage enjoyed by the magistrate who saw and heard the witnesses called before her court: Charara v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 39. The magistrate in this instance did not have any such advantage, beyond the very limited opportunity presented by the brief and largely ineffective cross examination of the complainant, in which the instructions of the appellant were not adequately presented to the witness upon whose evidence the outcome of these proceedings turned.The Conduct of the Appeal31 These sittings of the District Court in Goulburn began on Monday 4 August 2008 and were expected to continue over the following 3 weeks. As matters evolved, the second trial conducted during the sittings extended to the end of the fourth week.32 The appeal was mentioned on the first day, and the hearing began the following Friday, 8 August 2008. The Crown tendered its bundle of documents, along with the transcript of the evidence led before the magistrate. The documents tendered included the transcript of the electronically recorded interview between the police and the child on 25 July 2007 but not the electronic recording of that interview.33 My immediate response to the material tendered was that the proceedings in the Local Court were not conducted properly, for reasons that I have already endeavoured to explain. I pause to note that after having the opportunity to reflect further upon this matter I am reinforced in my initial view of the matter.34 I stood the appeal down until later in the sittings to allow the Crown to obtain a copy of the disc upon which the interview of the child was recorded. I proposed to allow the Crown the opportunity to call fresh evidence in the form of the electronic recording. I was and remain satisfied that the interests of justice require that the disc be admitted as fresh evidence.35 This prompted an application by Ms Walsh on behalf of the appellant for the child to be required for cross-examination. I indicated that I was sympathetic to that application in the circumstances. There was no notice of the application served on the Crown in accordance with section 19 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, however the Crown was made aware by this announcement that the application would be pursued when the appeal was to be heard, which could not be until the Crown had available the recording of the interview.36 The appeal was mentioned again on 13 August 2008 and 21 August 2008. In the interim, in the absence of Ms Walsh, the Crown informed the court that she had been advised that counsel now briefed to appear for the appellant was engaged elsewhere and could not be present at the sittings. It was anticipated that an application would be made to stand the appeal over to the next sittings. I indicated my view that the matter ought not be adjourned simply to meet counsel’s convenience, however, as matters evolved the second trial in the sittings exceeded its estimate and there was no time for the appeal to be heard and determined. Accordingly, orders were made for the appeal to stand over to the next sittings of the Court at Goulburn.The Decision 37 These are appeals pursuant to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, and accordingly are be heard and determined upon the certified transcript of the evidence before the magistrate, subject to the opportunity to call fresh evidence or require witnesses for cross examination.38 Section 18 of the Act provides, 
     
      
      ‘(1) An appeal against conviction is to be by way of rehearing on the basis of certified transcripts of evidence given in the original Local Court proceedings, except as provided by section 19. 
       
      (2) Fresh evidence may be given, but only by leave of the District Court which may be granted only if the Court is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the fresh evidence be given. 
       
      (3) The parties to an appeal are each entitled to be provided with one free copy of the certified transcripts of evidence relevant to the appeal and, if fresh evidence is given, one free copy of the transcript of the fresh evidence.’ 
      
    39 Section 19 of the Act provides, 
     
      
      ‘(1) The District Court may direct a person to attend and give evidence in proceedings on an appeal against conviction if it is satisfied:  
       
        
        (a) in the case of an appeal that relates to an offence involving violence against that person, that there are special reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence, or 
         
        (b) in any other case, that there are substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, the person should attend and give evidence. 
        
       
      (2) An application for such a direction may be made by a party to the proceedings in relation to a particular person only if notice of the party’s intention to make such an application has been served on each other party to the proceedings within such period as the District Court may direct. 
       
      (3) If an application for such a direction is refused, the District Court must give reasons for the refusal. 
       
      (4) A direction may be withdrawn only on the application, or with the consent, of the appellant. 
       
      (5) The regulations may make provision for or with respect to the determination of special or substantial reasons for the purposes of subsection (1). 
       
      (6) Without limiting subsection (5), in determining whether special or substantial reasons exist, the District Court must have regard to whether or not the appellant was legally represented for the whole or any part of the original Local Court proceedings.’ 
      
    40 As I have said, I am satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that the recording of the interview between the investigator and the complainant be admitted as fresh evidence. I am of this opinion for three reasons.41 Firstly, the transcript of the interview of the child should not have been admitted to prove the existence of the facts that the complainant intended to assert by the representations made in the interview. It was no more than an attempt by some one to provide a transcript of what they heard from the electronic recording. The definition of recording contained in s 3 of the Evidence (Children) Act does not include the transcript of that recording. The admissible evidence is the recording of the interview, not the transcript, which could not be any more than a document in aid of the tribunal of fact when assessing the evidence in its admissible form. The transcript could never be admissible in that form, when the appellant denies the allegations made by his son.42 Secondly, the court could not have properly assessed the reliability and credibility of the representations of the critical witness in the prosecution case without hearing that witness describe the events of which he complained. He would have been required to do this in court, in the absence of the legislation that allowed for his evidence to be presented by way of the recording, and in either case, the court would have been given the opportunity to assess the child’s evidence, and weigh the impact of appropriate cross examination conducted within proper bounds in light of the age of the child.43 Thirdly, the appellant was entitled to have the evidence properly assessed, and his case properly presented, including by way of appropriate cross-examination. This he was denied at the Local Court by the measures taken to put before the court the description of events earlier given by the child, upon which the prosecution case depended.44 I am also of the view that these provide special reasons why the complainant should be required to attend court to give evidence in the appeal. In addition, if the court is to be presented with the electronic recording of the interview, which I believe it must be for the reasons given, there would be grave injustice to the appellant in this appeal should he not be allowed the opportunity to cross examine the complainant about the misconduct alleged, and which would otherwise be tendered to the court without there ever having been any proper test of the assertions made.45 When reaching this decision I have not overlooked that a solicitor represented the appellant the Local Court. I have also noted the use of the term ‘special reasons’ used s 19(1)(a), applicable to these proceedings because of the nature of the offences involving violence against the complainant. I have reviewed authority dealing with the term ‘substantial reasons’ used in s 19(1)(b), the breadth of which is emphasised in the cases. The meaning of these terms is to be construed in their context which, in the present matter, will be the consideration of the evidence and decisions by a judge whether the guilt of the appellant is proved beyond reasonable doubt: Director of Public Prosecutions v Losurdo (1998) 44 NSWLR 618. I do not believe it possible for a judge hearing these appeals to discharge this function upon the material that was before the magistrate.46 I am convinced that for the court to be able to determine these appeals it must have the benefit of the recording of the interview, and appropriate cross examination of the complainant. The cross examination ought not however be permitted to exceed proper bounds, in light of the age of the child. It will be a matter for the judge hearing the appeals to consider that question when the matter is underway in their court. It also should not be overlooked that the complainant will be entitled to ask that he be permitted to give evidence from the remote witness room.47 I indicated to the parties that I would prepare my judgement and provide it prior to the end of the sittings. Regrettably the work before the court during those weeks was such that I could not keep to this undertaking. On the final day of the sittings, 29 August 2008, I informed the parties that I would attend to the judgement in the days following and publish it in court on 4 September 2008.Orders48 For the reasons given, I make the following orders:1) The Crown is permitted to tender as fresh evidence the electronic recording of the interview between the investigating official and the complainant on 25 July 2007, the transcript of which was Exhibit 2 in the Local Court, included in Exhibit A on appeal; and2) The Complainant is to attend and give evidence on the hearing of the appeal.49 I publish my reasons.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: James Bolus was convicted of conspiring to import into Australia a commercial quantity of cocaine (120 kilograms) an offence against s 233B(1)(cb) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth). He was convicted following a trial in the District Court in conjunction with three others, Richard Bruce Cornwell, David Norris, Vincent Francis and David Dicecco. The jury were not able to agree in relation to Norris, Francis and Dicecco but Bolus and Cornwell were convicted.  
     
      
    2 Both Bolus and Cornwell appealed to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The appeal by Bolus was dismissed. Cornwell’s appeal was upheld but that decision has since been reversed by the High Court.  
     
      
    3 The conspiracy alleged by the prosecution concerned the prospective importation of drugs brought to Australia by boat. A small boat was to be purchased and used to retrieve the drugs which would be left at sea. Bolus assisted in the purchase of the boat. His defence was that he did not know that the boat was to be used in connection with the drug importation. He submitted in his appeal that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable as there was no evidence to support a finding that he knew that the boat would be used to import the cocaine. 
     
      
    4 The Court of Criminal Appeal rejected this submission. I presided in that court and found that there was evidence upon which the jury could find that Bolus was aware of the true nature of the enterprise. 
     
      
    5 Bolus has made an application pursuant to s 78 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. He seeks an inquiry. However, in Application of Pearson [1999] NSWSC 143; (1999) 46 NSWLR 148; (1999) 104 A Crim R 282 it was determined that in relation to a Federal matter relief under s 474E, the predecessor of s 79(1) of the Act, is confined to a referral of the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal to be heard as an appeal. An inquiry is not available. This position has since been confirmed in relation to s 79(1): see El Hani [2007] NSWSC 330 at [23]; Toro-Martinez [2008] NSWSC 34 at [8]. 
     
      
    6 The trial at which Bolus and Cornwell were convicted was a re-trial. The jury was unable to agree at the first trial. At that first trial Cornwell gave evidence of domestic drug dealing and sought to explain telephone intercept material as being related to domestic matters. He gave evidence that he had not been involved in the alleged importation offence.  
     
      
    7 At the second trial the evidence of Cornwell given at his first trial was read to the jury. Cornwell did not give evidence at the second trial.  
     
      
    8 Bolus now submits that because Cornwell admitted to domestic drug dealing the jury would have assumed he was of that character. He is concerned that because the jury were aware of Bolus’ association with Cornwell the jury may have formed an adverse view of him leading to his conviction.  
     
      
    9 The application has no substance. The issue at the trial in relation to Bolus was whether or not the jury could be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he knew of the nature of the enterprise. It is apparent that the jury was so satisfied and accordingly returned a guilty verdict. The Crown brought evidence, which included Cornwell’s transcript of evidence given at his previous trial, in which he said that although he had been involved in domestic drugs he was not involved in the importation of prohibited drugs. The jury was satisfied that Cornwell was involved in importation. Irrespective of the fact that Cornwell had confessed to domestic drug dealing the jury was also required to consider whether Bolus was party to a conspiracy to import drugs. 
     
      
    10 The decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal gave careful consideration to the evidence at the trial. It was submitted that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable. This submission was considered and rejected. There was no suggestion that evidence of the domestic drug distribution activities of Mr Cornwell influenced the jury when determining Bolus’ guilt. I am satisfied that all matters relevant to his conviction were addressed by counsel and resolved by the court. 
     
      
    11 I am satisfied that the evidence as a whole adequately supported the jury’s verdict. There is no substance in the submission which Bolus now makes. In my opinion there is no doubt or question as to Bolus’ guilt or to any part of the evidence in the case which would justify referring the matter to the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
     
      
    12 Accordingly, the application is refused.

      2008/2836 R v ADAM NEWBOLD 
       
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 25 August 2008 the Crown presented an indictment against Michael Kutschera and Adam Newbold. The indictment charged one count of murder contrary to s 18(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, the particulars of which being that on 21 July 2007 at Muswellbrook in the State of New South Wales they murdered Lucas Gleeson.  
     
      
    2 Michael Kutschera applied for a separate trial on the basis that in a joint trial highly prejudicial and inadmissible material would be productive of a real risk that the Crown case against him would be made immeasurably stronger and that an unfair trial would result. That evidence comprised a record of interview where Mr Newbold identified him as the driver of the vehicle which was deliberately driven at and over the deceased and which resulted in his death.  
     
      
    3 For the purposes of considering that application I viewed the record of interview in its entirety. Over the course of the interview which commenced at 11.23am and concluded at 1.35pm on 21 July 2007, Mr Newbold gave a detailed account of the order and sequence of his movements from the evening of the 20 July 2007 and into the early morning hours of the 21 July 2007 leading up to his arrest shortly after 3.30am that morning.  
     
      
    4 In considering whether to grant the application for separate trials it was neither necessary nor appropriate for me to express any view as to whether or not the exculpatory account he gave to police in so far as his involvement in the death of the deceased was concerned was true, accurate or reliable. Suffice to say that in my published judgment (R v Kutschera; R v Newbold, Supreme Court of New South Wales, 26 August 2008) I expressed the view that were his account to be viewed by the jury as true, or even possibly true, there was a certain risk that they would import into their consideration of the guilt of Kutschera wholly inadmissible and prejudicial evidence which even the most carefully crafted and emphatically delivered directions to the jury could not guard against. It was for those reasons that I granted Kutschera a separate trial.  
     
      
    5 I also directed that Mr Newbold’s trial follow immediately upon the resolution of Kutschera’s trial and, in order to preserve the integrity of the proceedings generally, I directed that there be no publication of the pre-trial proceedings or their outcome. 
     
      
    6 The only evidence in the Crown case contradicting Mr Newbold’s account to police to the effect that rather than being jointly responsible for the death of the deceased he was an unwilling witness to the killing, came from Tony Matthews who claims to have identified Mr Newbold as a passenger in the car as it drove over the deceased in the course of two discrete driving manoeuvres. Even in advance of being called as a witness in Kutschera’s trial, in my assessment the various accounts Tony Matthews gave to police were less than compelling. Having heard him give evidence I regard his reliability generally as undermined by his level of intoxication and his evidence identifying Mr Newbold as the passenger undermined by the compromised circumstances in which the identification was made.  
     
      
    7 In circumstances where Mr Newbold’s opportunity to have joined with Kutschera in obtaining access to the car and driving it at the deceased was on the Crown case scant to say the least, my own independently held view at the time at separating the trials (although not at the time expressed) was that the case against Mr Newbold was weak and that the very high probability favoured his account being in fact truthful, accurate and reliable such that were to have been I invited by defence counsel to give a Prasad direction at the end of the Crown case in his trial I would in all likelihood have done so.  
     
      
    8 After publishing my judgment on the application for separate trials, and without opposition from the Crown, I released Mr Newbold to bail being satisfied in accordance with s 9C of the Bail Act 1978 that the circumstances were sufficiently exceptional to justify a grant of bail on the most relaxed of conditions. 9 Despite the Crown opening Kutschera’s trial on the basis that he and Mr Newbold were engaged in a joint criminal enterprise to murder the deceased (a position which I fully accept the Crown Prosecutor quite properly opened having regard to the evidence and the inferences available to be drawn from the evidence as he saw them) during the course of the trial I was informed that the Director of Public Prosecutions had been invited by defence counsel to review his decision to present an indictment against Mr Newbold for murder by actually viewing the ERISP. It was counsel’s view that, together with the detailed account given by Mr Newbold, his demeanour during the course of the record of interview, and the animation with which he persistently denied various propositions put to him by interrogating police, were matters properly to be taken into account by the Director in considering whether or not to proceed against him for murder.  
     
      
    10 I am not aware as to whether or not the record of interview was viewed for this purpose and I am not aware of any particular view that may have been reached by the Director as to the weight of evidence in the Crown case to justify proceeding with the murder charge. Suffice to say that I was notified on 8 September 2008, that the Director had resolved to accept pleas of guilty to comparatively minor charges in full discharge of an indictment charging Mr Newbold with murder and to call Mr Newbold as a witness in Kutschera’s trial.  
     
      
    11 Since the presentation of Kutschera’s case to that point had been cast on the express basis that the Crown would not call Mr Newbold, I discharged the jury. This was not met with any resistance from the Crown. Kutschera’s trial is listed to recommence before me today. I anticipate the fresh indictment will contain one count of murder with Kutschera named as the only offender.  
     
      
    12 Mr Newbold was re-arraigned before me yesterday. He entered a plea of not guilty to murder and not guilty to a charge of affray pursuant to s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act. He pleaded guilty to a charge that on 21 July 2007, knowing or believing that Kutschera had murdered Lucas Gleeson, he failed, without reasonable excuse, to bring information which may have been of material assistance in securing the apprehension and prosecution of Kutschera to the attention of a member of the police force, that information being that Kutschera was the driver of a vehicle that had run over and caused the death of the deceased. That charge is laid pursuant to s 316(1) of the Crimes Act and, on indictment, carries a maximum penalty of 2 years. It is a matter that was susceptible to summary disposition under Table 1 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    13 He also pleaded guilty to a charge of assaulting Lucas Gleeson and thereby occasioning him actual bodily harm contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act, a charge which on indictment carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. It is also an offence susceptible to summary disposition under Table 2 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
     
      
    14 The facts upon which it is agreed that sentence is to be passed in respect of the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        About 2.30 am on 21 July 2007 Mr Newbold left the Railway Hotel at Muswellbrook in the company of numerous patrons and headed in the direction of Sydney Street. At that time he was in the company of Michael Kutschera who resided at 98 Sydney Street.  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        After walking for some minutes he arrived at the intersection of Maitland and Sydney Streets which is an intersection controlled by traffic control signals. He waited for a green “walk” signal and was soon thereafter approached by a group of people including Tony Matthews Brogan Barnes Orre Davison and the deceased.  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        A verbal dispute broke out between the two groups of men. Newbold was assaulted by one of the men and Mr Kutschera was assaulted by Mr Matthews and others. Mr Newbold ran away from the area chased by Davison and Brogan. He hid on a veranda of a nearby house for several minutes waking the occupants of that house.  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        He left his hiding place walked back in the direction he had come from at which time he saw the deceased standing on the footpath of Sydney Street near a tire dealership. Mr Newbold argued with the deceased and they physically struggled with each other in the course of which Mr Newbold punched the deceased and pushed him forcefully to the ground causing him to connect heavily with the concrete. As a result the deceased was lying on a concrete in a barely conscious state.  
        
       
      
    15 It is this latter course of conduct that constitutes the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. It is agreed that the actual bodily harm is constituted by a head injury of some unspecified kind which was occasioned when the deceased’s head impacted with the concrete of the footpath causing a lapse of consciousness. The evidence is unclear as to the duration of any loss of consciousness. On any view it could not have been for longer than a minute or two before which a vehicle driven by Kutschera drove up onto the footpath and over the body of the deceased resulting his almost immediate death.  
     
      
       
        
        Mr Newbold left the scene in the front passenger side of the vehicle and was driven away from the scene. He was driven to Mr Kutschera’s home a relatively short distance away where he got out of the car and remained. According to Mr Newbold Mr Kutschera then left the scene for a brief period and upon his return informed Mr Newbold he had driven over the deceased a second time. The offender then ran from Mr Kutschera’s place to his own home where he was met shortly thereafter by Mr Kutschera.  
        
       
      
    16 It is of fundamental importance to the sentence proceeding, no less than for Mr Newbold as the person to be sentenced, to emphasise that he bears no criminal responsibility of any kind for the death of the deceased, it being no part of the Crown case on sentence that he had prior knowledge of Kutschera’s intention to obtain and use his motor vehicle for the purpose of driving it at the deceased, much less that he agreed with him that that should occur. In fact I accept, without reservation, that Mr Newbold was nothing other than an unwilling witness to the killing of the deceased by Kutschera and, moreover, that it was a matter of sheer happenstance that he was in the company of the deceased at that time at all.  
     
      
    17 I also accept that his horror at witnessing the incident was genuine in the moment and that it was expressed with spontaneous emotion on repeated occasions throughout the record of interview when he gave the police a graphic description of what he had seen. I also accept that the horror of the night is the product of nightmares that are persistent and continuing.  
     
      
    18 The facts relating to the second count of conceal serious offence are, in summary, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Newbold and Kutschera returned to where the deceased had been run over where uniformed police arrived at the scene at about 3.30am by which time the deceased had been confirmed dead by attending ambulance officers. The police spoke with Mr Matthews at the scene who informed them of the fight he had witnessed between the deceased and Mr Newbold before the deceased was run over by the vehicle. 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        A shirt time later Constable Smith saw Mr Newbold and Mr Kutschera walking in the middle of Sydney Street toward the crime scene. Constable Lea informed Newbold that he was under arrest “for further questioning about a hit and run incident that had occurred this morning”. Mr Newbold responded “What do you mean, I don’t know what you’re talking about.” 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        At the time of this exchange Mr Newbold was standing in the presence and hearing of Kutschera. He was thereafter removed to a caged police truck where he became emotional and distressed. He said to Constable Smith “I will tell you what happened”. They then recorded what Mr Newbold said to them in the following terms: 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        “There was this Lucas guy, he is a friend of my girlfriend. This Lucas guy, he had a go at me. Five black fellows come up and one of them hit me. I ran to a house up there. They tackled me to the ground. I ran back, I tried to run back there. I jumped the fence and the house ad a white lattice and I knocked on the door and I hid. I can show you if you want.” 
         
         
        
       
       
        
        He then pointed in the direction of Sydney Street where the house was located. He then noticed that the deceased was on the footpath and said “that Lucas?” he began then to sob uncontrollably and said, “we had a fight”. He was then asked by Constable Smith about a car involved in the incident and replied, “please don’t tell him I told you, he knows the bikies and they will hurt my family. The car is a silver Nissan Patrol four-wheel drive. There’s a sticker on the rear. His name is Mick, everyone calls him Osama because he looks like Osama Bin Laden.”  
         
         
        
       
       
        
        He then started to cry uncontrollably. Constable Lea then asked him who the driver of the car was at the time he replied that the driver was Kutschera and he offered to show the police where the car was. He said he was not in the car at the time and that he only got into the car afterwards. Kutschera was arrested by police at his home without incident at about 9 am that morning.  
        
       
      
    19 I accepted the plea of guilty to the charge of conceal serious offence despite Mr Newbold’s expressed fears to police that Kutschera would hurt him or his family, which it might be inferred was also operating on his mind were he to have contacted police and informed them of what he had seen. It is the Crown case that he could have and should have either gone to the police station directly from Kutschera’s house before Kutschera drove back to the scene for the second driving manoeuvre, or after he ran from Kutschera’s house and before Kutschera came to his house presumably with the intention of preventing him from alerting police. That said, on any view the act of concealment was of short duration, in my estimation no longer than half an hour given that he volunteered the very information he is charged with concealing when he was arrested. The gravamen of the criminality in his conduct, in my view, is his return to the scene with Kutschera and his initial denial when told he was under arrest for questioning about a hit and run incident.  
     
      
    20 In all the circumstances (and without recourse to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999) I consider that the offending constituted by both offences is of the lowest order of objective criminality comprehended by the sections under which the charges are laid. 21 I am compelled to add that I have persisting doubts as to whether the charge of conceal serious offence, or a charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, would ever have been preferred against Mr Newbold were police to have taken the view that he was in fact telling them the truth and were they to have offered him the opportunity to sign a witness statement against Kutschera. While I accept that this was not a view that commended itself to police either on the 21 July 2007 or as the investigation proceeded, the simple fact is that Mr Newbold spent 400 days in custody as a remand prisoner facing a murder charge - a charge which he denied on the night of his arrest, that he has persistently denied throughout successive arraignments and a denial that the Crown ultimately accepts as true.  
     
      
    22 I acknowledge, of course, that our system of criminal justice has as its pinnacle the jury system as the established mechanism by which the guilt of those charged with serious indictable offences is determined. Nonetheless, the responsibility for ensuring that only those against whom a positive case of guilt can be mounted ought to be put to their trial rests first with the investigating police and then with prosecuting authorities in the independent exercise of their statutory powers. In my view, the need for judgments made at the point of arrest and charge to be reviewed on an ongoing basis and well in advance of trial is essential, especially where the person arrested and charged voluntarily participates in a recorded interview and gives an exculpatory account that is neither inherently improbable nor, in the context of other evidence, plainly untenable. In my view this case falls squarely into that category.  
     
      
    23 Mr Newbold is a man who has no relevant criminal record. He is currently 24 years of age and, until he was bail refused in respect of the charge of murder, he had not spent any time in prison.  
     
      
    24 At the time of his arrest he was working full-time in the motor trade installing mufflers for a small business in Muswellbrook. He was hopeful of commencing an apprenticeship after having left school at year 10 and having worked in various semi-skilled jobs since that time. He was also the father of a young son with whom I understand he enjoyed a very close relationship. He was also in a stable relationship with the child’s mother who was due to deliver their second child within weeks of his arrest. At the time of his arrest I accept that he was genuinely committed to supporting his partner and his children by honest and hard work.  
     
      
    25 As a result of his incarceration his relationship with his former partner has been severed (it would seem at her initiation) and he has lost contact with her and his children. His suffering and loss over the last year is of untold measure. In addition, as an inevitable consequence of his arrest and incarceration he lost his job, his tools of trade and the immediate prospect for his future advancement.  
     
      
    26 Since his release to bail he is in receipt of Centrelink benefits although he has been unable to apply for full-time work with the present proceedings pending and has, in any event, been reluctant to do so having regard to the fact that it was only on Monday of this week that he learnt that the Director of Public Prosecutions was no longer intending to prosecute him for murder. The stress and uncertainty to which he has been subjected is also of untold measure.  
     
      
    27 Mr Newbold gave evidence before me that he told the truth to police in his record of interview, that he has told the truth in an induced statement he gave to police a week ago and that he is willing to give evidence in accordance with what he has told police as a witness in Kutschera’s trial. That is a matter which I propose to take into account on the question of sentence in accordance with s 23 of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act. In compliance with s 23(2) of the Act I regard the significance and utility of his assistance as considerable, that his account is in fact truthful, complete and reliable and, notwithstanding the fact that the offer to give assistance was made more than 12 months after the deceased’s death, it is nevertheless timely given that he was at all times, until very recently, being treated as a co-accused at trial and not as a person whose assistance might be sought.  
     
      
    28 Since I do not propose to impose any period of imprisonment in respect of either charge I do not have to take into account whether or not Mr Newbold will suffer harsher custodial conditions as a consequence of his assistance. I need only note that he has served over 12 months as a remand prisoner which in all the circumstances is a punishment he has suffered and a punishment which was wholly unwarranted. 
     
      
    29 Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act requires me to take into account both aggravating and mitigating and other factors material to the sentencing exercise. I am also mindful of the purposes of sentencing to which s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act refers.  
     
      
    30 I am satisfied that none of the 21 individual aggravating features under s 21A(2) of the Act are made out in the present case. By contrast, I am satisfied that there are matters mitigating the offending constituted by each of the counts to which pleas of guilty have been entered. I am satisfied that the offending was not part of a plan or organised criminal activity and, so far as the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to the deceased is concerned, I am satisfied that while the offence was committed in circumstances that do not amount to provocation at law the offending has to be seen in the context of the fact that Mr Newbold was himself was the victim of an assault at the deceased’s hands in the immediately preceding incident. I also accept that although Mr Newbold’s pleas of guilty were not early in a strictly temporal sense, the offence of conceal serious offence was at all times the subject of inclusion on a section 166 Certificate under the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 31 I am satisfied that at the time of the offending not only that Mr Newbold had no significant record but that he was in all respects a person of good character. I am satisfied that he is unlikely to re-offend and that he has by his plea of guilty, by his conduct on the morning he was arrested and by his attitude and demeanour throughout the course of the proceedings before me, accepted full responsibility for his actions and that he deeply and lastingly regrets placing himself in a situation where, by association with Kutschera, he has himself committed criminal offences and being witness to the criminal conduct of another that has resulted in the loss of life.32 In respect of the charge of conceal serious offence I propose to utilise the provisions s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Accordingly, without proceeding to conviction, I find Mr Newbold guilty of that offence and direct that the charge be dismissed. In reaching that conclusion I have had regard to his character, antecedents, age and the extenuating circumstances in which the offence was a committed, in particular, that he was a witness to a horrifying event for which he bore no criminal responsibility, that he was, in a notional sense at least, subject to Kutschera’s influence in the aftermath of the killing and that the offence was of very short duration.  
     
      
    33 In respect of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm I convict Mr Newbold but dispose of the sentence proceeding without imposing any penalty in accordance with the provisions of s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I have utilised the power under this section having reached the positive conclusion that even were the matter to have proceeded by way of a plea of guilty, the alternatives to full-time imprisonment would have been utilised since s 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that a court must not sentence an offender to imprisonment unless it is satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. Since Mr Newbold has served over 12 months on remand in respect of an offence he did not commit, I do not propose to utilise other sentencing alternatives. In particular, I am not satisfied that the imposition of a good behaviour bond or a community services order is warranted.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court at Penrith on 17 July 2007. He had pleaded guilty to an offence of robbery in company on 21 September 2006 at Mount Druitt contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for such an offence is 20 years imprisonment. A plea of guilty had also been entered to an offence of robbery on 23 September 2006 at Blacktown contrary to s 94 of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. Five matters on a Form 1 were taken into account on sentence for the s 94 offence, namely an offence of intimidation contrary to s 562AB of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for which is 5 years imprisonment and four offences of goods in custody contrary to s 527(1)(a) of the Crimes Act, the maximum penalty for which is 6 months imprisonment.  
     
      
    4 The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 7 years 6 months to date from 23 September 2006 and to expire on 22 March 2014 with a non-parole period of 3 years 6 months to date from 23 September 2006 and to expire on 22 March 2010 for the s 94 offence. For the robbery in company, a fixed term of imprisonment of one year commencing on 23 March 2010 and expiring on 22 March 2011 was imposed. The overall effective sentence was 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. 
     
      
    5 The Judge had found that the applicant was entitled to a utilitarian discount of 25 per cent for the pleas of guilty.  
     
      
    6 The applicant relies upon the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentencing Judge erred in determining the term of the  
         
          
          sentence consequent upon finding that special circumstances existed for the purposes of s 44(2) of the  
          Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
           1999.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentencing Judge erred in finding to be present certain aggravating factors for the purposes of s 21A(2) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
         1999. 
        
       
      
     3. The sentences are manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    7 There is a cross-appeal by the Crown pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 in relation to the sentence imposed for the robbery in company. The Crown claims that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. The Crown has appealed in order to preserve its position having regard to the differences of opinion expressed in this Court concerning the conjunction of s 6(3) and s 7(1A) of the Criminal Appeal Act: see R v Bottin [2005] NSWCCA 254 at [37] and R v Smith [2005] NSWCCA 339 at [32]-[40]. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Facts 
       
       
      The offence of robbery in company on 21 September 2006 (the s 97(1) offence).  
       
      
    8 At about 7pm on 21 September 2006, the victim, a 23 year old man, was waiting for a bus at a terminal in Mt Druitt. The applicant approached him. Two unknown males stood nearby. The applicant asked him for spare change and the victim gave him some. The applicant asked for more and the victim opened his passport to demonstrate that he had no more but a $5 note fell out. The applicant took the note and refused to give it back. One of the unknown males asked the victim about the passport. The applicant spoke with an unknown male. He asked the victim for his mobile phone which the victim refused. The applicant said “Don’t make things hard for yourself ‘cause you know what will happen.” The victim believed he would be assaulted so he gave the applicant his mobile phone.  
     
      
    9 The applicant told the victim to give him his watch which he refused to do. The applicant raised his voice, stood over the victim and again demanded it. The victim feared he would be assaulted and so he gave the applicant his watch. He was told by the applicant to put the watch on the applicant’s wrist and he did so. The victim walked to a bus stand and the applicant followed. He told the victim to empty his pockets which he did producing $190. The applicant took the money, told the victim he could leave but not to tell the police, and left. The victim informed police and provided a description of the offender. The description of a particular tattoo led to the applicant’s identification. When he was arrested on 23 September 2006, the applicant was found to be in possession of the victim’s mobile phone and watch.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
      Intimidation (Form 1)  
       
      
    10 On the morning of Saturday 23 September 2006 the applicant walked into a H & R Block taxation agency office in the Blacktown shopping centre. Stating that he had a gun, he demanded of Mr Tan, who was standing at the front desk, money and his mobile phone. Mr Tan did not believe he had a gun and explained his business completed tax returns, there was no money, no safe and told the applicant he could take the work telephone if he wanted it. The applicant then left.  
     
      
       
       
       
      Robbery on 23 September 2006 at Blacktown (the s 94 offence) 
      
    11 After leaving the taxation agency, the applicant walked along the shopping centre concourse and into a clothing hire shop. The shop assistant, a 46 year- old woman, was behind the counter. He ordered her to open the till stating that he had a pistol under his jumper. He held his jumper up over his face to just below his eyes and also held his right arm underneath his jumper. When the shop assistant protested that it was her first day and did not know how to open the till, the applicant became animated and aggressive and the shop assistant feared she would be shot or assaulted. He came around to her side of the counter and removed the entire float of $400 from the till and then left the store. The shop assistant chased after him yelling, “Stop him, he just robbed me.” Security guards then apprehended the applicant as he was getting into a taxi. He was holding in his hand money which he had stolen from the store. The money was returned by the security guards to the shop assistant. The applicant then started to run away but the shop assistant gave chase and tackled him. He escaped again but was subsequently arrested at a nearby train station.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Goods in custody of four mobile phones (Form 1) 
       
      
    12 When the applicant was searched he was found to be in possession of four mobile phones that did not belong to him. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances  
       
      
    13 The applicant was born on 3 December 1981 of Samoan parents and was 24 years-old at the time of the offences. He left school in year 10. He has an extensive criminal history which includes offences of assault with intent to rob while in company, aggravated robbery, robbery and aggravated assault with intent to rob. On 8 March 2002 on a robbery offence, he was sentenced in the District Court to 12 months imprisonment commencing on 31 March 2001 and expiring on 30 March 2002 and for an aggravated robbery he was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months commencing on 30 March 2002 with a non-parole period of 12 months.  
     
      
    14 On 6 April 2004, he was sentenced in the District Court for an offence of assault with intent to rob in circumstances of aggravation to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 22 June 2003 and expiring on 21 June 2006. The balance of the sentence was to expire on 21 June 2008. At the Penrith Local Court he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 months commencing on 21 June 2006 being in breach of a bond for a larceny offence. 
     
      
    15 The applicant was released to parole on 20 September 2006 – the day before the offence of robbery in company.  
     
      
    16 During the proceedings on sentence, a report of Dr Barbara Sinclair, a psychiatrist, was tendered. Dr Sinclair noted that the applicant had a history of mental illness and that multiple assessments and diagnoses had been made. She opined that the applicant was suffering from a major mental illness – schizoaffective disorder or bipolar disorder. In addition the symptoms he was exhibiting demonstrated paranoid ideation. Substance abuse disorder, anti-social personality traits and repeated head trauma due to boxing were noted. The psychiatrist wrote: 
     
      
       
        
        “I believe that at the time of the alleged offence, Mr Antonio was suffering from a mental illness; was unmedicated for 24 to 48 hours. 
         
        He had not received his daily dose of methadone and therefore would be becoming increasingly agitated likely as a result of methadone withdrawal. It is also possible that at the time of the alleged offences that he was under the effect of illicit substances, either intoxication or withdrawal.” 
        
       
      
    17 A Probation and Parole pre-sentence report was also before the Judge. The author of the report wrote that the offender appeared to have a history of mental health issues that may have been drug induced. The applicant had said that he was prescribed medication for these issues when he was released but did not have medication for two days which appeared to have been an underlying factor in his re-offending. His narcotic use had commenced at age 18 years to which he became addicted. He was currently on a methadone maintenance program.  
     
      
    18 The applicant did not give evidence during the sentencing proceedings.  
     
      
       
      Dealing with the appeal  
       
       
      Ground one –  
      The sentencing Judge erred in determining the term of the sentence consequent upon finding that special circumstances existed for the purposes of s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
       
      
    19 Counsel for the applicant submitted that the term of the sentence was extended, rather than the non-parole period reduced by the Judge in order to provide a longer period of parole than that mandated by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and his Honour erred. This Court’s attention was directed to the following passage in his Honour’s sentencing remarks: 
     
      
    20 The Judge said (ROS at 3): 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that having regard to all of the circumstances of both these offences, and I shall deal with those circumstances briefly in a minute, that it would be necessary to pass a not insignificant sentence, at least, to partly create a substantial parole period because in relation to the sentence I propose to find special circumstances, indeed, I have no difficulty in finding special circumstances because it is perfectly plain that these offences were committed whilst the prisoner was suffering from mental illness.” 
        
       
      
    21 Immediately after the submissions on sentence were completed, the Judge proceeded to sentence the applicant. What was said by the Judge in the passage quoted at [20] is to be considered in the context of the whole of his ex tempore remarks. At a later stage the Judge said (ROS at 9): 
     
      
       
        
        “I think I did say during the course of this hearing that absent the elements of mental illness one would have to consider a very substantial non parole period here because this man had just completed a sentence of five years, non parole three years and he has committed a number of offences that are not dissimilar to the offence that he had just completed a sentence for… And I stated here during the course of the hearing, and I do not resile from it, that absent the elements of mental illness and having regard to both the question of totality but also having regard to the fact that both of these sets of events were entirely separate then one would be looking at a non parole period of somewhere around seven, possibly as high as eight years, when one accumulates some of the sentence.” 
        
       
       
       
      
     And (ROS at 12): 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the second event historically, but the first one with which I will deal in terms of sentence, that is the robbery on 23 September 2006, I would originally propose to pass a sentence of ten years imprisonment. But I would reduce that by twenty five per cent by reason of the prisoner’s plea of guilty which would reduce that sentence to seven years and six months. I sentence the prisoner in relation to that particular offence to a period of imprisonment of seven years and six months to date from 23 September 2006 the date of his arrest to 22 March 2014. I find special circumstances, indeed the special circumstances here are clearly apparent. 
        
       
       
        
        Having found special circumstances, I fix a non parole period of three and a half years…” 
        
       
      
    22 Various exchanges between the Judge and the applicant’s counsel were extracted in written submissions by the parties to this Court . I do not think that they provide additional assistance from what might be discerned from the sentencing remarks.  
     
      
    23 It would have been an error for the Judge to extend the head sentence to enlarge the period of eligibility to release to parole: R v Huynh [2005] NSWCCA 220 at [39]; R v Tobar (2004) 150 A Crim R 104. When all of what was said by his Honour is considered, I am not persuaded that he extended the term of the sentence to allow for a longer period of parole. It seems to me that his Honour having found special circumstances reduced the non-parole period. 
     
      
    24 The first ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground two –  
      the sentencing judge erred in finding to be present certain aggravating factors for the purposes of s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
       
      
    25 It was submitted for the applicant that the Judge erred in having regard to the threatened use of force as a factor aggravating the offence of robbery committed on 23 September 2006. The threatened or actual use of force to compel the victim to part with the property, the Court was reminded, was an element in the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    26 When considering aggravating factors to be found in s 21A(2), the Judge said:  
     
      
       
        
        “There was in this particular instance a threatened use of violence and a threatened use of a weapon, although I concede of course that he did not actually have a weapon that he could have used. But there was certainly a threatened use of violence and a threatened use of a weapon.”  
        
       
      
    27 It appears that the Judge did take into account the threatened use of violence as an aggravating factor and was in error in doing so. A threat of the use of violence is an element of the offence of robbery and could not be taken into account as an aggravating factor: R v Way (2002) 60 NSWLR 168 at [106]; Hamze v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 36 at [28] and double counting is prohibited: R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193 at [22]-[24]. It was open to the Judge, however, to consider the nature of the threatened use of violence. As was explained in Hamze by Giles JA at [29]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…while the bare fact of threatened use of violence could not be taken into account, that did not preclude regard to the nature of the threatened use of violence in considering the seriousness of the offence.”  
        
       
      
    28 In the present case, the applicant ordered the shop assistant to open the till stating that he had a pistol under his jumper. He held his right arm underneath his jumper. The manner in which the applicant threatened the shop assistant increased the seriousness of the offence. I might add that a threat of the use of a weapon is not an element of a s 94 offence.  
     
      
    29 Although the Judge erred, it seems to me, that his error would not have materially affected the sentence imposed.  
     
      
    Ground three – the sentences are manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    30 Although the ground of appeal is expressed in this way, the applicant did not contend that the sentence for the robbery in company was excessive. The complaint was confined to the sentence for the s 94 offence.  
     
      
    31 The applicant referred to the undiscounted starting point of 10 years imprisonment and submitted that in light of the maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment, the starting point did not correspond with the Judge’s assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence when he said that each of the offences fell “significantly short of the worst in their category” (ROS at 2). 
     
      
    32 It was submitted that the additional criminality involved in the offences on the Form 1 was not such that required a substantial increment to the sentence. Whilst acknowledging that the commission of the offences in breach of conditional liberty was an aggravating factor, a countervailing consideration was the applicant’s mental illness. General deterrence was of less relevance. Although the sentence for the robbery in company was not excessive, the imposition of an excessive sentence for the robbery resulted in an aggregate sentence which was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    33 The Crown submitted that the sentence for the s 94 offence, although stern, was within the Judge’s sentencing discretion. The sentence imposed for the robbery in company was, it was argued, manifestly lenient. The total aggregate sentence, the Crown contended, was an appropriate reflection of the applicant’s total criminality.  
     
      
    34 As the Judge was sentencing the applicant for two offences, he was obliged to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as questions of totality: Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610. 
     
      
    35 The offence of robbery was objectively a serious one. The threatened use of the pistol and the applicant’s aggression understandably caused the shop assistant to fear being assaulted or shot. This offence was committed three days after his release to parole for an offence of robbery in company which was an aggravating factor. The offence of intimidation being one of the offences on the Form 1 was a serious offence in its own right and called for an increased sentence. The applicant had walked into the H & R Block office stating that he had a gun and had demanded money and property. His prior history of like offences entitled the Judge to give more weight to considerations of retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community. 
     
      
    36 The Judge accepted that the applicant was suffering a mental illness and found that he was “not fully appreciative of the activity that he was then engaged upon”. He expressly considered what has been said by this Court in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 as to the four ways in which mental illness may be relevant to his sentencing task. His Honour recognised that the applicant’s mental illness reduced his moral culpability for the offence and moderated the consideration to be given to general deterrence. The maximum sentence for this offence is 14 years imprisonment. In view of the Judge’s findings concerning the applicant’s mental illness, the indicated undiscounted starting point of 10 years imprisonment was in all the circumstances, to my mind, manifestly excessive. The undiscounted starting point should not have been more than 8 years.  
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal  
      
    37 The principles relevant to Crown appeals against sentence are well established and are summarised in Regina v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 per Wood CJ at CL at [70].  
     
      
    38 The offence of robbery in company was objectively serious. The applicant in company of two others robbed a person who was waiting at a bus terminal at night. The offence was committed the day after he had been released to parole. His mental illness did not diminish the weight to be given to personal deterrence and the protection of the community. The applicant should be made aware by the sentence imposed upon him that he cannot continue to commit offences of robbery. The maximum sentence for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. Notwithstanding the Judge’s findings on the applicant’s mental illness a fixed term of imprisonment of one year was manifestly inadequate. A fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years is, in my view, a sentence at the bottom of the available range.  
     
      
    39 The sentence for the robbery has been found to be manifestly excessive and the sentence for the robbery in company manifestly inadequate. When the total criminality of the applicant’s offending is considered, the total overall effective sentence of 7 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months was, in my opinion, appropriate and no lesser punishment was warranted. The affidavit of the applicant sworn on 5 August 2008 does not alter that opinion. 
     
      
    40 In view of the competing appeals, it seems to me to be necessary to re-structure the sentences notwithstanding that the same result will be achieved. 
     
      
    41 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Grant leave to the applicant to appeal. 
        
       
      
     2. Applicant’s appeal allowed.  3. Crown appeal allowed.  
     
      
       
        
        4. Quash the sentences imposed in the District Court on 17 July 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        5. In respect of the offence of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the  
        Crimes Act 
         sentence the applicant to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years to commence on 23 September 2006 and to expire on 22 September 2008.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        6. In respect of the offence of robbery contrary to s 94 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years to commence on 23 March 2008 and to expire on 22 March 2011 and a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 23 March 2011 and expiring on 22 March 2014.  
        
       
        
       
        
         
          
          The overall effective sentence will be a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months commencing on 23 September 2006 and expiring on 22 March 2011 and a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 23 March 2011 and expiring on 22 March 2014. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The Court finds special circumstances being the accumulation of the second sentence upon the fixed term imposed for the offence of robbery in company.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 22 March 2011.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    2 BARR J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant Peter Douglas Bell seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence imposed upon him in the District Court of New South Wales on 24 August 2007. 
     
      
    4 On 7 May 2007 the applicant pleaded guilty to an indictment containing one count under s 135.4(1) of the Criminal Code(Cth) which alleged that he and Mark John Williams (Williams):  
     
      
       
        
        Between about 18 November 2002 and 5 October 2004 at Sydney, New South Wales and elsewhere did conspire with each other with the intention of dishonestly obtaining a gain from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, a Commonwealth entity. 
        
       
      
    5 The maximum penalty for the offence is 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years 6 months commencing on 27 July 2007 and expiring on 26 January 2014 with a non-parole period of 3 years 10 months commencing on 27 July 2007 and expiring on 26 May 2011. 
     
      
    7 The Judge had reduced the sentence by 15 per cent for the applicant’s willingness to facilitate the course of justice by his plea of guilty.  
     
      
    8 The notice of appeal identifies three grounds:  
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned sentencing Judge erred in determining that the criminal culpability of the applicant was comparable to that of Williams. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon him and that imposed upon Williams. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentence is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive.  
        
       
      
     Facts 
     
      
    9 The Crown tendered a statement of facts which the Judge summarised as follows (ROS 2-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Between May 2002 to about October 2004 the offender Williams was employed by the ABC as a production manager for news and current affairs programs made for the ABC Asia Pacific Service and the program “Business Breakfast”. His duties and responsibilities in that position included the budget accounting process and the approval of certain expenditure. 
        
       
       
        
        The ABC conducted an audit in around October 2004 following report made by an ABC reporter concerning suspect transactions on his ABC American Express Corporate card.  
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        The internal audit and investigation revealed a series of frauds perpetrated by Williams. The offences commenced approximately one month after Williams started full time employment with the ABC and coincided with the time that he was declared insolvent by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia. 
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        Notwithstanding the fact that Williams’ wife worked at the ABC, in an ABC employee details form completed or adopted by Williams in late 2001, he listed Bell as his next of kin who should be contacted in case of an emergency.  
        
       
       
        
        At all material times during the period 2002 to 2004, Bell was the sole director of CFX Pty Limited (CFX) to the extent that CFX conducted any business during that period. The business provided sales and marketing services in respect of computer equipment and software sold by CFX. These products were utilised in the post- production stage of film and television. CFX was not in the business of supplying cameramen, sound recordists, or any other pre-production equipment or services. CFX had no offices, employees or agents other than Bell.  
        
       
       
        
        Between about November 2002 and October 2004 the offenders agreed to dishonestly obtain money from the ABC by submitting invoices to the ABC in the name of CFX in respect of services purportedly provided to the ABC by CFX, but which services had not been provided. The agreement between the offenders also envisaged that Williams was to authorise the payment of the invoices by the ABC in his capacity as production manager; that the funds obtained from the ABC in payment of the invoices were to be paid, in the first instance, into a bank account or bank accounts operated by Bell, and that Bell was to subsequently pay or transfer a portion of the funds received from the ABC to Williams or a bank account or bank accounts operated by him. Bell was to retain a portion of the funds received from the ABC.  
        
       
      
    ` During the period November 2002 to October 2004 72 invoices in the name of CFX were submitted to the ABC. Each of the CFX invoices was created by Williams. Bell knew that Williams was preparing invoices in the name of CFX and authorised him to do so by providing an electronic copy of a legitimate CFX invoice. Bell also assisted Williams by providing some of the details to be included in the invoices, including the ABN, address and telephone and facsimile numbers of CFX and the details of the bank account into which the ABC was to deposit funds in payment of the invoices.  
     
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        All of the invoices were for a sum of in the order of $10,000 or less than $10,000, this being the ordinary approval limit for production managers of Williams’ seniority at the ABC. None of the money referred to in the CFX invoices was properly payable by the ABC to CFX. Both of the offenders knew that CFX had not performed the work or provided the services referred to in the invoices. Both offenders knew that no moneys were due to CFX from the ABC in respect of any work performed or services rendered during the period November 2002 to October 2004. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender Bell opened and operated a number of bank accounts on dates specified in the facts. A Bell account No. 2 was opened and operated by Bell specifically to receive funds from the ABC in payment of the CFX invoices and to pay a portion of those funds to Williams. 
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        The offender Williams opened and operated a number of bank accounts and those accounts and the dates they were opened are referred to in the facts. An account opened by the offender Williams being his account No 2 was opened and operated by him specifically to receive funds from Bell that related to the ABC payments.  
        
       
       
        
        Seventy one of the 72 invoices specified in the schedule to the statement of facts were engrossed by Williams in his capacity as production manager as having been approved for payment by the ABC. Once the invoices were engrossed by Williams as having been approved for payment, Williams caused the invoices to be forwarded to the ABC Accounts Payable Section for payment. Funds in payment of the invoices were subsequently paid by the ABC to the bank account nominated on the invoices or by cheque payable to CFX. A total of $556,039 was paid by ABC to CFX. 
        
       
       
        
        Following payment the ABC sent remittance advices by mail to CFX at addresses nominated on the invoices. Each of the bank accounts into which funds were received from the ABC in payment of the invoices was operated by Bell. Following receipt of a payment for an invoice, Bell arranged to transfer funds representing a portion of the ABC payment or payments to a bank account nominated by Williams either by cheque or electronic funds transfer by the internet.  
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        The payments made by Bell to Williams represented 55.38% of the total payments made by the ABC to the bank accounts operated by Bell, a total of $307,951. The remaining funds were retained by Bell being a total of $248,088 (44.62%).” 
        
       
      
    10 Neither the applicant nor Williams has repaid any of the proceeds of the crime.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Circumstances  
       
      
    11 Evidence of the applicant’s subjective circumstances was put before the Judge by way of a report of Mr Tim Watson-Munro, a forensic psychiatrist, and a pre-sentence report. Mr Watson-Munro gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence as did Stephen Patterson and Jonica Jesser who gave character evidence. Written character testimonials were also tendered as was a report from Dr Richard Peppard which concerned the applicant’s wife. The applicant did not give evidence. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was born in March 1951 and was 56 years of age at the time of sentence. He has no prior criminal history and had been employed in the IT industry for some 36 years including 21 years as the managing director of his own business which was involved in the production of computer graphics. He owned and managed that business until 2002. From that time, he was employed in various management positions until he established CFX Pty Ltd, a marketing consultancy.  
     
      
    13 The applicant had been married for 25 years. Mrs Bell was diagnosed with cervical dystonia about 11 years ago. Her symptoms include severe involuntary neck turning and extension movements and severe neck tremor. She had handwriting dystonia which creates an on-going difficulty with regard to her employment. Dr Peppard opined that it was very likely that the stress of having her husband incarcerated interstate would significantly contribute to the risk of her neck dystonia and worsening of the on going dystonia in her arm. 
     
      
       
      
    14 The Judge referred in his remarks on sentence at page 19 to the evidence of Mr Watson-Munro as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Tendered on behalf of the offender is the report of Consultant Forensic Psychologist, Tim Watson-Munro, dated 20 June 2007. Mr Watson-Munro was also called to give evidence. He is of the opinion that the offender is clearly suffering substantial symptoms of depression, anxiety and other indicia of an adjustment disorder. He states that it is apparent that his depression and anxiety, in part, relate to his current circumstances, although he says he suspects in addition, in the context of his general history, the offender has been significantly depressed and anxious for many years. Mr Watson-Munro does not state, however, that those conditions have prevented the offender from maintaining employment in the past. He states that the offender has been exposed to a number of stresses for more than 10 years and that they include his wife’s serious neurological illness, coupled to continuing financial problems as a consequence of a decline in his business turnover in the IT industry. Mr Watson-Munro said that he visited the offender and his wife at their home and he notes that he was informed that the home is currently mortgaged to an amount of $300,000 and that there is a very real prospect that they will lose the home on the offender’s imprisonment. Mr Watson-Munro states that the offender will require close supervision and ongoing treatment upon sentence. He says the offender has expressed considerable regret for his behaviour.” 
        
       
      
     Dealing with the appeal  
     
      
    15 There are three grounds of appeal. The first asserts that the Judge erred in determining that the applicant’s criminal culpability was comparable to that of the co-offender Williams. The Court’s attention was directed to the following passages in his Honour’s sentencing remarks (at 9): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In relation to Bell, although there was no direct breach of trust on his part, it is still highly relevant in assessing his criminality that he well knew that it was essential to the conspiracy’s success that Williams would consistently, repeatedly and systematically deceive his employer, in breach of the very high trust which had been placed in him.” 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour said (ROS at 28): 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, with respect to the conspiracy offence, the criminal culpability of both offenders is comparable, although there was no direct breach of trust by Mr Bell. As I have said he knew very well that the conspiracy involved a gross breach of trust on the part of Williams and he knew the total amount of the fraud that was perpetrated. He knew that the breach of trust by Williams was crucial to the success of their criminal venture.” 
        
       
      
    17 It was conceded that the Judge differentiated between the applicant and the co-offender when he went on to say (ROS at 28): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        However, I have taken into account that Mr Williams did derive a greater financial benefit directly from the scheme and I have determined that the sentence to be imposed upon him should be somewhat longer than the sentence imposed upon Mr Bell for the conspiracy offence.” 
        
       
      
    18 Mr Dhanji for the applicant submitted that the distinction which was made should not have been confined to the greater proportion of the proceeds of the crime that the co-offender received. Counsel contended that Williams had been employed by the ABC and had breached the trust placed in him as a result of that employment whereas the applicant was not in the same position. He had not breached any trust. Whilst the applicant was necessarily aware that Williams was abusing his position, this was not the same as abusing an employer’s trust directly. The breach of trust by Williams was a factor of aggravation, which was not present in the circumstances of the applicant’s offending. The Court’s attention was drawn to what has been said in cases such a R v Pont (2000) 121 A Crim R 302 at 311-312 that sentences imposed for offences of serious breaches of trust will necessarily involve general deterrence. It was next submitted that Williams was the prime mover in the enterprise whereas the applicant’s role was essentially limited to remitting to Williams a portion of the funds that Williams had fraudulently obtained.  
     
      
    19 Criminal conduct by an employee involving a serious breach of trust will necessarily attract a deterrent sentence because of the obligation to uphold the trust of an employer and the difficulty often experienced in the detection of such a crime. It is, to my mind, difficult to distinguish the criminal culpability of an employee who persistently and seriously breaches his employer’s trust from the criminal culpability of an offender who participates in the crime with the knowledge that the breach of trust by the co-offender is fundamental to its success. Any basis for such a distinction is further diminished when the participation by the offender is essential to the employee’s breach of trust not being detected.  
     
      
    20 In the present case, the Judge acknowledged that there had not been a “direct” breach of trust by the applicant. His Honour found that he knew that it was essential to the success of the conspiracy that Williams would “consistently, repeatedly and systematically” deceive his employer in breach of his employer’s trust.  
     
      
    21 The applicant’s participation in the criminal enterprise was fundamental to its lack of detection and success over almost two years. His activity included the provision of an electronic copy of a legitimate CFX invoice to Williams and some of the details to be included in the invoices. Seventy two false CFX invoices were engrossed by Williams as having been approved for payment and were forwarded to the ABC accounts section for payment. The applicant opened a bank account to receive the payments from the ABC which amounted to a total of $556,039. The monies that he retained totalled $248,088. His role was not confined to remitting the funds to Williams.  
     
      
    22 No error has been established in his Honour’s determination that the applicant’s culpability was comparable to that of Williams. Ground one of the appeal fails.  
     
      
    23 The second ground of appeal is that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentence imposed on him and that imposed on Williams.  
     
      
    24 Williams was sentenced at the same time as the applicant for the offence of conspiracy contrary to s 135.4(1) of the Criminal Code(Cth) and for five additional offences, namely three counts of dishonestly obtaining a gain under s 135.1 of the Criminal Code(Cth) and two offences of obtaining property by deception contrary to s 134.1 of the Criminal Code (Cth). An offence contrary to s 134.1 is punishable by 10 years imprisonment whereas an offence contrary to s 135.1 is punishable by 5 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    25 The offences contrary to s 135.1 involved the dishonest use by Williams of an ABC Visa card, an ABC American Express card and Cabcharge vouchers. The total amount that Williams gained from the ABC by the use of these cards was $35,473. For these offences, his Honour imposed concurrent sentences of 18 months imprisonment to commence on 27 July 2007 and to expire on 26 January 2009. 
     
      
    26 The offences contrary to s134.1 involved false staff reimbursement claims and petty cash claims by Williams totalling $18,860. For these offences concurrent sentences of 2 years imprisonment were imposed to be served at the same time as the sentences for the s 135.1 offences. 
     
      
    27 For the offence of conspiracy, the Judge sentenced Williams to 7 years imprisonment to commence on 27 July 2008 and to expire on 26 July 2015. A single non-parole period of 4 years 9 months expiring on 26 April 2012 was set. The total effective sentence was 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months. The sentence had been reduced by the Judge by 15 per cent for Williams’ willingness to facilitate the course of justice by his plea of guilty.  
     
      
    28 It was contended by Mr Dhanji that there were, apart from the argument advanced in respect of Ground 1, other factors which distinguished the applicant from his co-offender and called for a significantly lower sentence to be imposed than that on Williams. Matters identified were the applicant’s mental state at the time of, and subsequent to the commission of the offence, that the circumstances of his incarceration were likely to be more onerous than would ordinarily be the case and that this was his first criminal conduct. Mr Dhanji submitted that the impact of the applicant’s mental condition to some extent explained how he became involved in this, his first, criminal offence at such a late stage in his life.  
     
      
    29 In his report Mr Watson-Munro expressed the opinion that the applicant had suffered a significant adjustment disorder according to DSM-IV criteria for many years. His symptoms had included variable and at times intense depression, debilitating anxiety and substantial loss of his self-esteem. The Court was referred by Mr Dhanji to the following passage in the report:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that he is extremely well bonded with his wife and in this context her medical condition no doubt has had a profound impact upon this man’s capacity to cope over the years. This is of some relevance to the current matters before the Court, in the setting of the impact that his mood state has had upon his judgment at the material time and from that time onwards.” 
        
       
      
    30 During the proceedings on sentence, Mr Watson-Munro was questioned by the Crown (POS at 37): 
     
      
       
        
        [Crown] Q. Up the top, the first three lines, you tell us that in your view, has told you a complex clinical history which has been compounded by his wife’s longstanding neurological illness which clearly has had a dramatic impact upon his judgment. In what way, in terms of his judgment? 
        
       
       
        
        [Mr Watson-Munro] A. In the context of anxiety and depression tending to interfere with objectivity. I wouldn’t put it any higher than that.  
        
       
       
        
        [Crown] Q.  
        You weren’t seeking to suggest that it was in some way responsible for the dishonest conduct at the heart of the offence to which he’s pleaded guilty? 
          
        
       
      
     [Mr Watson-Munro] A. No.” (italics added) 
     
      
       
      
    31 It is evident from what was said by Mr Watson-Munro that he was of the opinion that the applicant’s mental condition did not impact on his culpability for the crime. The Judge was entitled to give little weight to the applicant’s mental condition as a factor which distinguished him from Williams.  
     
      
    32 The Judge, in my opinion, correctly found that “with respect to both offenders that the principal motivating factor in the commission of these offences was sheer, unadulterated greed.” 33 His Honour carefully considered the applicant’s submission during the proceedings on sentence that there should be some reduction in his sentence because of his wife’s physical condition which the Judge rejected. So far as the difficulties which might be experienced from his incarceration in New South Wales, the Judge noted that there was provision for his possible transfer from this State to Victoria under the Transfer of Prisoners Act 1983 (Cth). I do not detect any error in his Honour’s approach.  
     
      
    34 The principal circumstances of difference between the applicant and his co-offender were the amounts of money each had retained from the conspiracy and the five additional offences with which Williams was charged. These additional charges added to the difficulty of the Judge’s sentencing task. His Honour was obliged to have regard to the totality of the sentence to be imposed on Williams as well as to the question of parity between the co-offenders on the offence of conspiracy. In sentencing Williams, the Judge expressly referred to the principles of totality in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and determined an appropriate sentence for each offence, then considered questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as totality. The sentence for the offence of conspiracy was fixed so as to commence one year after the commencement of the sentences for the s 134.1 and s 135.1 offences. The sentences for the s 134.1 offences were concurrent fixed terms of 2 years. A single non-parole period was set as was required by s 19AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
    35 Mr Dhanji submitted that as a consequence of the manner in which the sentences were structured, Williams’ sentence for the conspiracy was in effect 6 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months whereas the applicant’s sentence for the same offence was 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 10 months. 36 The Crown submitted that this approach overlooked the fact that in sentencing Williams, his Honour was required to observe the principles of totality and accumulation and that s 19AB of the Crimes Act(Cth) required the Judge to fix a single non-parole period in respect of all sentences. When those matters are taken into account, the Crown argued, the applicant’s analysis loses its force.  
     
      
    37 The application of the principle of totality does not render considerations of parity redundant. 
     
      
    38 In Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 Dawson and Gaudron JJ said (at 301-2, 303): 
     
      
       
        
        “Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality…” 
        
       
       
        
        “The approach adopted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in this case treats or has the effect of treating the total period to be served in custody and, more particularly, the actual period to be served in consequence of the offences committed as irrelevant to the proportion which the sentences imposed on Postiglione and Savvas should bear to each other. In the circumstances of this case, the real punishment for both Savvas and Postiglione is the extra period which they must spend in prison. Due proportion cannot be determined without taking it into account.” 
        
       
      
    39 Kirby J said (343): 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle between co-offenders continues to operate as a consideration in sentencing notwithstanding the application of the totality principle to one offender.”  
        
       
      
    40 The benefit that Williams received by the application of the totality principle was for the offence of conspiracy an effective non-parole period of 2 years 9 months and an effective head sentence of 6 years. This arises from the partial accumulation of the sentence for the conspiracy upon the fixed terms of imprisonment of 2 years which were imposed for the s 134.1 offences. The non-parole period for the applicant for the conspiracy is 3 years 10 months and the head sentence is 6 years 6 months. The different circumstances of the applicant, namely the smaller financial gain and lack of additional offending in the normal course requires that he receive a lesser sentence than that imposed upon Williams for the same offence. The additional non-parole period of 1 year 1 month and additional head sentence of 6 months gives rise, in my view, to a marked disproportion between the applicant’s sentence and the sentence imposed on his co-offender. This conclusion has not been reached by merely adopting a mathematical approach to the sentencing exercise. Equal justice requires that the applicant for the offence of conspiracy should spend less time in prison than Williams.  
     
      
    41 It seems to me that a reasonable person looking at the circumstances of this case would regard the applicant’s grievance as justified: R v Ilbay [2000] NSWCCA 251. This Court should intervene and reduce the applicant’s sentence notwithstanding that the sentence imposed upon him by the Judge was otherwise appropriate and within the permissible sentencing range, a topic which will be considered under the next ground of appeal.  
     
      
    42 Ground 2 of the appeal is established. 
     
      
    43 The third ground of appeal asserts that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The undiscounted starting point of the sentence was 7 years 8 months which was said to be a very heavy sentence when the maximum penalty of 10 years was considered.  
     
      
    44 This was a very serious offence. His Honour accurately summarised the applicant’s criminality when he said (ROS at 27): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        He, like Mr Williams, was deeply entrenched in this fraudulent enterprise over a period of almost two years, an enterprise which he knew was defrauding tax payers of some $550,000 and a scheme from which he personally fraudulently benefited to the sum of almost $250,000.” 
        
       
      
    45 A number of sentences imposed in other cases have been referred to by the parties. None of the cases referred to persuade me that the sentence in this case was manifestly excessive. The undiscounted starting point of the sentence does not manifest error and the sentence was within the upper end of an appropriate range.  
     
      
    46 Ground 3 of the appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    47 Error having been identified, I am of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should be passed.  
     
      
    48 In an affidavit sworn 13 August 2008 the applicant states that on or about 30 March 2008 he lodged an application for interstate transfer from New South Wales to Victoria on welfare grounds under the Transfer of Prisoners Act (Cth). At the time of the swearing of the affidavit, the applicant had not received a reply to his transfer request. It appears that the application will be considered when this appeal is finalised.  
     
      
    49 It is important to recognise that this Court will not intervene to produce a sentence which is totally inappropriate to the criminality involved. I consider that the unjustifiable disproportion between the sentences may be removed by a reduction of 1 year in the applicant’s head sentence and 7 months in the non-parole period. Any greater reduction would produce a result which is inappropriate to the objective and subjective criminality involved in the offence.  
     
      
    50 The orders I propose are:  
     
      
       
        
        (i) Leave to appeal be granted.  
        
       
      
     (ii) Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court. 
     
      
       
        
        (iii) Sentence the applicant to imprisonment for 5 years 6 months to commence on 27 July 2007 and to expire on 26 January 2013 with a non-parole period of 3 years 3 months to commence on 27 July 2007 and to expire on 26 October 2010.  
        
       
       
        
        The earliest date on which the applicant will be eligible for release to parole is 26 October 2010. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            **********

    JUDGMENT 
     
      
    The proceedings 
     
      
    1 The underlying proceedings involve a $700,000 loan claimed to have been advanced by the plaintiff to the first defendant [Mr Praveen Doolub] on 8 December 2006. The loan was apparently to be repaid by 8 February 2007. The plaintiff claims that the monies were not repaid. The plaintiff commenced proceedings against, inter alia, the first and second defendant [Mr Niteen Doolub] in March 2007. The defendants are brothers. 
     
      
    The asset preservation orders 
     
      
    2 Mareva asset preservation orders were made against the first and second defendants on 9 and 15 March 2007.  
     
      
    3 The orders made on 15 March 2007 inter alia restrained the first and second defendants from removing moneys from various bank accounts or from dealing with any money held in a solicitor's trust account. 
     
      
    4 Paragraph 1.4(b) of the 15 March 2007 orders was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Until further order the first and second defendant be restrained from removing or causing or permitting to be removed from the State of New South Wales or any place whatsoever or sell, charge, mortgage or otherwise deal with or dispose of, or causing or permitting to be sold, charged, mortgaged or otherwise dealt with or disposed of, all or any of their assets, whether solely or jointly owned, or any interest in those assets whether legal or beneficial including, but without affect the generality of the foregoing: 
         
         
          
          (b) any moneys held in any solicitor’s trust account; 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 Paragraph 1.6 of those orders read: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Provided that nothing in sub-paragraphs 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5 shall operate to prevent the first and second defendants from carrying out the following activities: 
         
         
          
          (a) paying reasonable legal expenses on any legal matter and legal expenses of defending this matter up to $50,000.00. 
          
         
        
       
      
    6 On 10 September 2007 following ancillary orders for disclosure affidavits, each of Niteen and Praveen Doolub swore affidavits in respect of their assets in which they each deposed to having less than $5000 in assets. They swore further affidavits on 19 February 2008 which did not alter the sum of the evidence as to their assets. 
     
      
    7 Judgment for $2,139,660 was entered against Praveen Doolub on 29 February 2008. No part of the Judgment has been satisfied. On 26 June 2008 Praveen Doolub was made bankrupt on his own petition. 
     
      
    The notices of motion 
     
      
    8 By the plaintiff’s amended notice of motion it seeks a number of orders including a declaration that the defendants are guilty of contempt of court. The particular orders sought include the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. A declaration that the first and second defendants are guilty of contempt of Court in that they failed to comply with paragraphs 1.4 & 1.6 of the order made on 15 March 2007 … in that the first and second defendants: 
         
          
           
          (a) knowingly authorised more than $50 000.00 in payments out of solicitors trust accounts; or 
           
           
          (b) knowingly allowed more than $50 000.00 in payments out of solicitors trust accounts.  
          
         
         
        ii. An order that the first and second defendants be punished or otherwise dealt with for such contempt of Court. 
        
       
      
    9 The statement of charge was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Statement of Charge 
         
         
        It is alleged that from 30 May 2007 the first and second defendants are guilty of contempt of this Court in that from that date they  
         
         
          
          knowingly authorised payments out of Middletons’ Trust Account held in the name of the first and second defendant. 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 The particulars: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. recited the 15 March orders;  
         
         
        ii. alleged that between 14 March 2007 and 8 July 2008, $167,305.29 was deposited into Middletons’ Trust Account Ledger opened in the name of the first and second defendants; 
         
         
        iii. recited correspondence passing between the first and second defendants and their solicitors across the period from 30 April 2007 up to 30 May 2008 [generally enclosing invoices for the solicitors fees][""the subject invoices""]; 
         
          
         
        iv. identified the particular dates when, following its having forwarded such invoices, Middletons had withdrawn sums from the trust account held in the name of the first and second defendants. 
        
       
      
    The second defendant's notice of motion 
     
      
    11 On 10 July 2008 the plaintiff was served with a motion seeking an order nunc pro tunc that the amount of $50,000 be altered to $300,000, or in the alternative, authorising the payment of legal expenses to Middletons from funds supplied by Mr Jonathan Chow, Mr Neil Cato and Mr Song Young. Together with the motion were affidavits sworn that day by Mr Brendan Wyhoon a partner of Middletons and Mr Niteen Doolub. The notice of motion was amended on 11 August 2008 to seek inter alia following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. An Order  
        nunc pro tunc 
         that Order 1.6(a) entered on 15 March 2007 be varied by deleting the words “up to $50,000”. 
         
         
        ii. In the alternative to paragraph 4, an order  
        nunc pro tunc 
        , that Order 1.6(a) entered on 15 March 2007 be varied by deleting the words “up to $50,000” and inserting the words “up to $300,000”.  
         
         
        iii. In the alternative to paragraphs 4 and 5, Orders: 
         
         
          
          (a) authorising the payment of legal expenses from time to time owing to Middletons lawyers in the period 15 March 2007 to 10 July 2008 in this matter from funds supplied by Jonathon Chow, and Neil Cato and Song Young paid into the trust account of Middletons lawyers in the name of Niteen Meckraj Doolub; and 
           
           
          (b) an order varying 1.6(a) entered on 15 March 2007 by deleting the words “up to $50,000” and in the alternative, and adding the words ‘up to $300,000”.  
          
         
         
        iv. Alternatively, an order that the second defendant’s solicitors pay such amount as the court may order into the trust account from which the funds were transferred, to thereafter be held and applied as the court may direct by further order. 
        
       
      
    12 At the commencement of the hearing the court determined that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. the plaintiff’s notice of motion should first be heard in relation to liability [tranche 1]; 
         
         
        ii. that if liability was established a further hearing to determine what, if any, penalty should be imposed would take place [tranche 2]; 
         
         
        iii. to defer the hearing of the defendant's notice of motion pending determination of the plaintiff’s motion [tranche 3]. 
        
       
      
    13 Thereafter the parties agreed that tranches 1 and 2 should be collapsed and addressed accordingly. As I understood their further agreement, the defendants were not seeking to have argued their motion presently: transcript 228.15. 
     
      
    The issues 
     
      
    14 The principal issues at least included the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. Questions concerning the defendants’ contention that the statement of charge was defective; 
         
         
        ii. Whether the evidence established beyond a reasonable doubt that: 
         
         
          
          (a) each of Praveen Doolub and Niteen Doolub were aware of the asset preservation order made on 15 March 2007;  
           
           
          (b) Niteen Doolub knew and intended that each of the subject invoices would be paid from funds held in the Middletons trust account in the name of N&P Doolub  
          
         
         
          
           
            
            [a sub-issue involving whether the monies transferred from the Middletons Trust Account to the office account were transferred with the client’s approval as per the  
            Legal Profession Act 
             2004]; 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          (c) Praveen Doolub knew and intended that each of the subject invoices (issued prior to 30 April 2008) would be paid from the funds in the Middletons trust account in the name of N&P Doolub; 
           
           
          (d) each of the subject invoices were in fact paid from funds held in Middletons trust accounts in the name of N&P Doolub; and 
           
           
          (e) the cap on reasonable legal costs was exceeded when Middletons withdrew $8,381.45 from a trust account in the name of P and N Doolub on 28 June 2007.  
          
         
        
       
      
    15 It is fair to observe that both parties appear to have identified as a central issue, the question of identifying whether the moneys paid into the trust account were the property of the defendants. 
     
      
    The principles 
     
      
    16 The theoretical basis for maintaining the distinction between civil and criminal contempt has not gone unchallenged in recent years. The High Court in Witham v Holloway (1995) 183 CLR 525 [per Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ] found that “(t)he differences upon which the distinction between civil and criminal contempt are based are, in significant respects, illusory. They certainly do not justify the allocation of different standards of proof for civil and criminal contempt."" The Court went on to find that all proceedings for contempt “must realistically be seen as criminal in nature”, and must be subject to the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    17 At the same time, the Court made clear that not all features of criminal proceedings will necessarily apply in proceedings for contempt. Brennan, Deane, Toohey and Gaudron JJ held that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (T)o say that proceedings for contempt are essentially criminal in nature is not to equate them with the trial of a criminal charge. There are clear procedural differences, the most obvious being that criminal charges ordinarily involve trial by jury, whereas charges of contempt do not. 
        
       
      
    18 McHugh J, while expressing the opinion that “(t)he case for abolishing the distinction between civil and criminal contempts is a strong one”, similarly noted that “many differences in procedure still exist between civil and criminal contempt proceedings.” Thus McHugh J held that “although the principal, if not sole, object of the present proceedings was to punish the appellant, the proceedings were and remain civil and not criminal proceedings for contempt”. As civil proceedings, they were therefore subject to civil rules with respect to the right of appeal.19 Subsequent to that case, the NSW parliament enacted legislation which restricted the right to appeal from a finding of the Court that an accused person was not guilty of a charge of criminal contempt [Supreme Court Act 1970 s101]. In explaining those amendments, the then Attorney-General noted that “(t)his provision will apply to criminal contempt matters only and it will not affect or limit the existing rights of the parties in civil contempt proceedings to an appeal” (as quoted by Kirby J, Hearne v Street [2008] HCA 36 at [14]).20 In Hearne v Street the High Court, construing the above legislation, made clear that the distinction between civil and criminal contempt has not been abolished for all purposes. Gleeson CJ observed [at 2]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The distinction between civil and criminal contempt is in some respects unsatisfactory, but the Supreme Court Act adopts the distinction for jurisdictional purposes, and therefore it must be applied. 
        
       
      
    21 In Aztech Science Pty Ltd v Atlanta Aerospace (Woy Woy) Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 908 Hamilton J observed that in Hearne v Street the High Court on appeal from the New South Wales Court of Appeal: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. declined to proceed on the basis that all contempt proceedings are criminal for all purposes; 
         
         
        ii. declined to pass upon whether or not two propositions [(c ) and (d)] for which Ipp J had contended in the Court of Appeal were correct. 
        
       
      
    22 In those circumstances Hamilton J determined to take the propositions for which Ipp J had contended as correctly stating the law for the purpose of determining the proceedings before his Honour. To my mind the same approach should be taken in the present proceedings. 
     
      
    23 In endeavouring to discern the distinction between the two ways in which contempt proceedings may be characterised, Ipp J had contended as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
        In my opinion, the  
        Microsoft 
         test is apt. Nevertheless, I would, with respect, add a qualification. In applying that test in a case where the punishment is for wilful disobedience unaccompanied by defiance, due regard must be had to the fact that (as the majority in  
        Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union v Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd 
         (1986) 65 ALR 683 observed at 108) classification of the contempt proceedings is a more complex and artificial undertaking. In the latter category of case, when attempting to determine the ‘substance’ of the proceedings, due account must be taken of the following considerations: 
         
         
        (a) Notwithstanding that proceedings are brought by an individual to secure the benefit of an order or undertaking, the contempt that arises may be criminal. 
         
         
        (b) A breach of an injunctive order or an undertaking that is contumacious in the broad sense involves deliberate defiance, and a breach that is contumacious in the broad sense will be regarded as criminal. 
         
         
        (c) Generally, however (and I understand this to mean prima facie), a breach of an injunctive order or an undertaking that is wilful but not contumacious in the broad sense — and is not merely casual, accidental or unintentional — is regarded as a civil contempt (this being the traditional distinction between civil and criminal contempt which still has significance). 
         
         
        (d) The fact that the application for an order that contempt has been committed is made within the main action, and not by a stranger to the suit, would tend to show that the contempt is civil in nature. 
         
         
        (e) A finding of contempt that is likely to be coercive in regard to the defendant’s future conduct would tend to show that the contempt is civil in nature. 
         
         
        (f) A breach of an order in civil proceedings may not be a civil contempt where the circumstances are such that the breach cannot be remedied. 
         
         
        (g) The competency of the appeal be decided by classifying the contempt proceedings at the time they were instructed [sic]. 
        
       
      
    24 To my mind whilst it is true that there may be cases in which the distinction between criminal proceedings for content and civil proceedings for contempt may overlap, the proceedings before this Court unquestionably involve an action for civil contempt. This conclusion is based on proposition (c) of Ipp J, set out above, as well as the following considerations:25  
     
      
       
        
         
         i. A finding of contempt in the present proceedings is likely to be coercive in relation to the defendant's future conduct and hence would tend to show that the content is civil in nature.  
         
          
         
        ii. The action is brought by a party to the primary proceedings who seeks to compel the defendants to comply with an injunction of the Court which was made in those primary proceedings.  
         
         
        iii. The remedy sought is curative rather than punitive, as the plaintiff seeks essentially that the money the subject of the breach be repaid. 
        
       
      
    26 I proceed accordingly to treat these proceedings as concerning allegations of civil contempt. Thus, while the standard of proof to be applied is the criminal standard, procedural issues which arise, such as those concerning the admissibility of evidence, are treated as issues arising in civil, rather than criminal, proceedings. 
     
      
    The requirements of a finding of contempt 
     
      
    27 In order for the Court to find the defendants guilty of the current charge of contempt, the plaintiff bears the onus of proving a number of elements beyond a reasonable doubt including the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The existence of orders made by the Court, in sufficiently clear and unambiguous terms; 
         
         
        2. The fact that the defendants had notice of these orders; and 
         
         
        3. That the orders were knowingly breached by the defendants’ authorisation of the subject payments out of Middletons’ Trust Account Ledger opened in the defendants’ names. 
        
       
      
    The ambiguity in the Court's orders 
     
      
    28 By the end of the hearing both senior counsel had accepted that there was an ambiguity in paragraph 1.6 of the Court’s orders which it will be recalled had been in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Provided that nothing in sub-paragraphs 1.3, 1.4 or 1.5 shall operate to prevent the first and second defendants from carrying out the following activities: 
         
         
          
          (a) paying reasonable legal expenses on any legal matter and legal expenses of defending this matter up to $50,000.00. 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 There are two possible ways in which this clause may be construed. On the one hand, it could be read as permitting the defendants to pay reasonable legal expenses on any legal matter and reasonable legal expenses of defending this matter, with the combined total of both types of expenses not to exceed an upper limit of $50,000. On the other hand, it could be interpreted as permitting the defendants to spend up to $50,000 in defending this matter, and in addition, to pay reasonable legal expenses on any other legal matter (without a specific upper limit). 
     
      
    30 The plaintiff fairly acknowledged that, in so far as an ambiguity exists, it should be interpreted in favour of the defendants. 
     
      
    31 The significance of clarity in the Courts orders is obvious. In terms of the current environment it is plain that the defendants were entitled to proceed upon the basis:  
     
      
       
        
         
        i. that they were permitted 
         to pay reasonable legal expenses on  
        any 
         legal matter in which they may be involved otherwise than in respect of these proceedings; and 
         
         
        ii. that they were restrained from paying any legal expenses of defending  
        these 
         proceedings up to the amount of $50,000. 
         
          
          [cf paragraph 1.4(b) which expressly referred to moneys in any solicitors trust account]. 
          
         
        
       
      
    Knowledge of the orders 
     
      
    32 Mr Wyhoon, the solicitor for the defendants, gave evidence that he explained to each of his clients the nature and effect of the undertakings given to the Court on 9 and 15 March 2008 [T131.46]. That evidence is accepted as reliable. 
     
      
    33 Mr Wyhoon’s evidence was that, at the time in question, he understood the defendants’ obligations pursuant to those orders to be in accordance with the second, less strict, construction set out above.The alleged breach 
     
      
    34 The evidence clearly established that the first and second defendants’ solicitors, Middletons, had over a period of time following the making of the orders been paid an amount of $88,921.79 in excess of the $50,000 permitted in relation to this current litigation. They had also received amounts by way of their fees in relation to other legal work for the first and second defendants, there being no challenge to the reasonableness of their charges for that other work. 
     
      
    35 The payments with regard to defending this matter, which exceeded the $50,000 limit permitted by clause 1.6(a), were made out of the solicitor’s trust account held in the name of the defendants. The plaintiff alleged that these payments were therefore in breach of the order which restrained the defendants from “deal(ing) with or dispos(ing) of… all or any of their assets… or any interest in those assets whether legal or beneficial including… any moneys held in any solicitor’s trust account” (cf: clause 1.4 above). 
     
      
    36 The defendants contended that the above payments were not in breach of the Court’s orders on the basis that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. The money in the trust account was the property of various third parties. As a result, the defendants claimed to have no interest, whether legal or beneficial, in the funds which were paid to the solicitors in excess of the $50,000 allowed.  
         
         
        ii. Alternatively, they did not knowingly authorise the payment of the funds out of the trust account. 
        
       
      
    The claim that the trust account funds were not the property of the defendants 
     
      
    37 As already stated the defendants claimed that a significant proportion of the funds deposited into the trust account in their own names after the Mareva orders came into effect was deposited by or on behalf of various third parties. These third parties [Mr Chow, Mr Cato and Mr Song Young], were said to be friends and business associates of the defendants, and apparently sought to contribute out of friendship, and without compensation, to the legal costs being incurred. The defendants maintained that the money deposited by these third parties did not at any stage become their property. Instead, they claimed that, once paid into the trust account, these funds were held by Middletons on trust for the purpose of the payment of the defendants’ legal costs. 
     
      
    38 The plaintiff responded to the defendants’ case in two ways. Firstly, the plaintiff denied that the defendants were telling the truth with regards to the source of the trust account funds. The plaintiff claimed that the process by which ‘friends’ of the defendants deposited money into the trust account in the name of the defendants was an elaborate sham, in which the defendants had provided money to third parties in order to disguise the fact that they owned assets other than those disclosed to the Court. 
     
      
    39 Secondly, and in the alternative, the plaintiff asserted that, even if the funds were originally derived from third parties, those parties had given the money unconditionally as a gift to the defendants. The plaintiff denied that the deposit of money into the solicitor’s trust account had created a purpose trust. Rather, the plaintiff asserted that the money in the trust account was held by Middletons on trust for the defendants, and was therefore an asset to which the defendants were beneficially entitled. 
     
      
    The evidence 
     
      
    40 Following the plaintiff’s presentation of their case the defendants elected to go into evidence. In consequence a number of the defendants witnesses were cross-examined.  
     
      
    41 These witnesses included Mr Jonathon Chow and Mr Neil Cato, two of the three men alleged to have deposited money into the solicitor’s trust account on behalf of the defendants. The third man, Mr Song Young, failed to answer a subpoena, and was said from the bar table to be overseas. Mr Niteen Doolub and his solicitor Brendan Wyhoon, a partner at Middletons, were also cross-examined. 
     
      
    42 The cross-examination elicited what many might regard as an extraordinarily unusual state of affairs, if the lay witnesses are to be believed. Mr Chow and Mr Cato gave evidence that, having been approached by one or both of the defendants, they decided to provide considerable amounts of money to pay the defendants’ legal fees. Mr Cato, on the defendants’ evidence, had provided around $85,000 over the course of under a year, while Mr Chow had provided some $60,000 over 6 months. 
     
      
    43 Mr Chow is the director of a company, Berita Pty Ltd, of which the defendants’ mother is said to be the sole shareholder. Mr Cato’s relationship with the defendants was never specified.  
     
      
    44 Neither witness gave entirely satisfactory answers when questioned as to the original source of the funds which they had deposited into the trust account. Mr Cato’s evidence was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Where did you get the money that you gave them from? 
         
         
        A. I've been collecting all areas of cash. So I have cash come to me on a regular basis. It's not an uncommon thing. I have cash payments from customers. I play poker. I enjoy the horses. I do a number of sales of company things. I did my time with regard to fixing bits and pieces of - a number of different areas. I couldn't precisely tell you any particular area as to where it has actually come from. 
         
        … 
         
        Q. And is this the position, that you're telling his Honour that there is really no records that record where this money came from because it comes in bits and pieces from various cash transactions with which you are involved? 
         
        A. Well, I deal with cash on a daily basis, as my position as a mortgage broker and that's what I do. So I have a number of investments and things that I actually deal with. Clients give me cash. I deal with cash. 
         
         
        Q. Where do you keep it? 
         
        A. Various places. I have got a safety deposit box. I've got cash reserves just here and there. Again, it's never a large sum at any one time as such. So it comes in, it goes out. 
        
       
      
    45 Mr Chow’s evidence was that he could not recall exactly where the money came from, but that he believed it was a gift from various members of his family. He was asked: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Which particular family members are we talking about? 
         
        A. I couldn't tell you at this point. 
         
         
        Q. No idea? 
         
        A. It would most likely be my father. 
         
         
        Q. But you can't remember? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
      
    46 Mr Chow also admitted under cross-examination that, with respect to two of the deposits which he made into the solicitor’s trust account, an identical amount was paid into his account on either the day the payment was made, or the day before. He was unable to say exactly who had provided the funds deposited into his account on those days, except to speculate again that it may have been a family member. 
     
      
    47 Both witnesses firmly denied, however, having received any part of the money which they contributed from the Doolubs [T164.34, T175.7]. 
     
      
    48 The evidence is replete with an extraordinary amount of care being taken by these witnesses to place on record what they were doing. In this regard it is only necessary to extract one of the letters to indicate the genre of the correspondence passing from these witnesses to Middletons. In a letter dated 13 September 2007 from Mr Jonathan Chow addressed to Mr Brendan Wyhoon, the partner dealing with the matter, Mr Chow had written: 
     
      
       
        
         
        RE: Doolub 
         
         
        I wish to confirm the following matters: 
         
         
        1. I have placed the following amounts into Middletons’ trust account in connection with various matters being undertaken by Middletons for Niteen and/or Praveen Doolub: 
         
         
          
          (a) $20,000 on or about 14 March 2007; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) $10,000 on or about 23 August 2007; 
          
         
         
        2. I have provided the above trust funds from my wholly owned assets gratuitously to Niteen and Praveen. The funds are not the repayment of any debt that I owe to Niteen or Praveen (or any entities associated with them). Nor do I owe such a debt. Further, the funds are not a loan to Niteen or Praveen. I have no intention of seeking repayment of the funds from Niteen or Praveen. 
        
       
      
    49 Mr Wyhoon gave evidence that he, or someone under his supervision at Middletons, drafted this letter. His purpose was to ensure, through having Mr Chow approve such correspondence, that there was no risk that the Mareva injunction would be breached. This arrangement was, to use Mr Wyhoon’s own words, ‘engineered’ by him some time shortly after he became aware that the amount of fees paid out of the solicitor’s trust account was approaching the limit of $50,000. 
     
      
    50 Similarly worded letters were received from Mr Cato [BWW10]. 
     
      
    The second defendant's evidence 
     
      
    51 The second defendant's evidence under cross-examination included the following:  
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Do you have a job? 
         
        A. Not at the moment. 
         
         
        Q. Do you pay rent to live where you live? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Do you own that property? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Do you know who owns the property you live in? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Who is that? 
         
        A. A friend of mine…. 
         
         
        Q. And do you pay that person any money to live on the property? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Is there any written agreement between you and your friend? 
         
        A. No… 
         
         
        Q. Do you have any other investment properties or other investments that earn you any money? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. How do you live from day-to-day? 
         
        A. Friends' supports… 
         
         
        Q. So when you need money to buy the groceries, what do you do? 
         
        A. No, I normally just eat at my friends' place. 
         
         
        Q. So you go around to your friends when you are hungry, do you? 
         
        A. No, I'm staying at a friend's place at the moment, so whatever is available there… 
         
         
        Q. What do you do when you go out? 
         
        A. I don't really go out. 
         
         
        Q. You don't really go out? 
         
        A. I don't really go out to be honest. 
         
        .. 
         
         
        Q. If you leave the house in which you live and you wander and the community and you want to buy something, where do you get the money to do that? 
         
        A. Buying what? 
         
         
        Q. An ice-cream? 
         
        A. Friends. I'm with friends most of the time at the moment. 
         
         
        Q. A newspaper? 
         
        A. No, I don't buy newspapers… 
         
         
        I am supported by my friend 
        
       
      
    Finding 
     
      
    52 Whilst I retain considerable doubt about the veracity of the evidence given by Mr Chow, Mr Cato and the second defendant, the plaintiff has not been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was any arrangement between the first two defendants and those who paid money into the subject trust account to the effect of either: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. the defendants having provided the moneys to those who paid the moneys into the trust account; or 
         
         
        ii. the moneys having been in truth loan funds provided to the defendants from those who paid the moneys into the trust account. 
        
       
      
    The allegation that the funds became the property of the defendants on deposit into the solicitor’s trust account 
     
      
    53 There is no question but that a third party may deposit money into a solicitor’s trust account held on behalf of a particular individual. The Legal Profession Regulation 2005 requires that a receipt for money paid into a solicitor’s trust account must include both “the name of the client in respect of whom the money was received” and “the name of the person from whom the money was received”, making it clear that the client and the payee need not be the same person. 
     
      
    54 Prima facie where funds are paid into a solicitor’s trust account in the name of a particular client they become funds held on trust by the firm for that client.  
     
      
    55 So much was confirmed by Mr Wyhoon under cross-examination: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Q. Could I just ask you a couple of basic questions about trust accounts? A trust account between a solicitor and a client recognises that in fact the money that is in that account is being held on trust, correct?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. The trustee is the solicitor, yes?  
         
        A. Yes.  
         
         
        Q. And the beneficiary is the client?  
         
        A. Ordinarily, yes.  
        
       
      
    56 The defendants allege that the money paid into the solicitor’s trust account in the name of the defendants was not, in fact, held on trust for any particular person [whether the defendants or the third party who had deposited the money]. Rather, the defendants claim that the money was held on trust for a particular purpose, that being the payment of the defendants’ legal fees.The evidence relating to the purpose for which the money was given to the solicitors 
     
      
    57 The evidence in this regard included: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Mr Cato: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. You were giving them money to pay legal fees? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Did you understand it was for a litigation matter? 
         
        A. I was informed of that, yes. 
         
         
        Q. Was it for any other matters or just the litigation matter? 
         
        A. There was a matter that he was in the Supreme Court. He didn't have money at the time or he had an order against him - I can't remember the name of it, manoeuvring or something-- 
         
         
        Q. Mareva. 
        
        
        A. Mareva, thank you, which prevented him from having access to money, could I assist. I said, ""Yes, well, I can at this particular time. How much do you need?"" 
         
         
        Mr Chow: 
         
         
        Q. Do you remember what you were asked to provide that money for, was it for a particular piece of legal work or for various pieces of legal work? 
         
        A. I don't know the specifics on that one. 
         
         
        Q. You don't know, just whatever legal work was being done for the Doolubs? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Did you ask the Doolubs what they were paying lawyers for? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        The second defendant 
        : 
         
         
        Q. And so in paragraphs 6, 7 and 8 of your affidavit-- 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. --when you said that you did not any interest, either legal or beneficial, in the moneys that were put into the Middletons' trust account by Mr Song Young, Mr Jonathon Chow and Mr Neil Cato, are you intending to convey that you did not consider that you had any interest whatsoever in that money? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. ..All right, well, who did you think had a legal and beneficial ownership of that money while it was in your trust account? 
         
        A. The lawyers. 
         
         
        Q. Well, the lawyers were paid the money when they sent a bill to you and your brother and the bill was paid, correct? 
         
        A. Yes, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But before the lawyers were paid for their bills the money was in the trust account? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Who did you understand had legal or beneficial ownership of that money at that time? 
         
        A. Middletons. 
         
         
        Q. It was Middletons' money, is that what you understood the position to be? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And how did Middletons get that money? 
         
        A. It was put in their trust account, so whatever the process takes from there. 
         
         
        Q. By Mr Chow, Mr Young and Mr Cato? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And why would those people insofar as you may have an understanding, why did they pay money to Middletons' trust account? 
         
        A. I've asked them for some help. 
         
         
        Q. You asked them to give you some money, did you not? 
         
        A. I've asked them to help me with the legal fees. 
         
         
        Q. You asked them to give you some money so you could pay your legal fees? 
         
        A. They paid the legal fees. I didn't ask them for the money. They paid the legal fees.  
         
         
        Q. You knew the money was going to a trust account in you and your brother's names, didn't you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. And you knew that that was pursuant to the arrangements which whereby the solicitors had said that they would only do legal work if there was money in the trust account? 
         
        A. From a third party. 
        
       
      
    58 Also significant are the terms of the correspondence received [and drafted] by Middletons from each of Mr Chow and Mr Cato, stating that particular deposits had been provided “gratuitously to Niteen and Praveen”. The correspondence further notes that the funds are not a loan, and that the donor does not have any intention of seeking repayment from the Doolubs [see the letter from Jonathon Chow extracted above]. 
     
      
    Finding 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    59 The question of whether or not the moneys paid into Middletons’ Trust account for the purpose of meeting the first and second defendants legal expenses are to be characterised as gifts to those defendants requires a close eye being given to the facts. The finding is that the beneficial interest in those funds passed to the first and second defendants. The finding is grounded upon: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. the circumstances surrounding the payments into the trust account; 
         
         
        ii. the evidence given by Mr Chow, Mr Cato and Mr Wyhoon; 
         
         
        iii. the correspondence between Mr Chow, Mr Cato and Middletons. 
        
       
      
    60 There is no substance in the proposition that a Quistclose trust is shown to have been established: cf Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd [1970] AC 567. The correspondence to Middletons negatives any such proposition. That correspondence made clear that the funds were provided gratuitously to the defendants. The funds were not paid into any ‘special’ trust account for a defined purpose. The correspondence does not identify any and, if so what intention those who provided the funds may have had to constitute a trust for a limited purpose. 
     
      
    The mental element involved in a finding of contempt of court 
     
      
    61 In Markisic v Commonwealth of Australia and Anor [2007] NSWCA 92, Campbell JA observed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [62]  
        Further, there is a mental element involved in contempt of court.  
        Mudginberri 
         concerned a contempt arising from disobedience to a court order. While the focus of the decision in that case was whether a court had power to impose a fine in consequence of a breach of a court order, reaching a conclusion on that topic involved giving consideration to what was involved in contempt of court consisting of breach of a court order. 
         
         
        [63]  
        In a lengthy paragraph at 111–112, Gibbs CJ, Mason, Wilson and Deane JJ, as I read it, approved the distinction made by the English Court of Appeal in  
        Fairclough v Manchester Ship Canal Co 
         [1897] WN 7; 41 SJ 225 between “casual, or accidental and unintentional disobedience” and “what was required in a case where ‘it were sought to commit a private individual to prison for contempt’ or ‘to sequestrate the property’ ‘of a company’ upon the ground of disobedience”. Their Honours held that conduct that is deliberate, and in fact breaches a court order, and  
        is not a casual or accidental or unintentional breach 
        , counts as wilful conduct. Their Honours conclude, at 113: 
         
         
          
          … a deliberate commission or omission which is in breach of an injunctive order or an undertaking will constitute such wilful disobedience unless it be casual, accidental or unintentional. 
          
         
         
        [64]  
        As I read their Honours, their view is that the imposition of punishment is justified for a breach of a court order only if there is wilful disobedience 
        , in the sense of deliberate action or inaction that is not casual, accidental, or unintentional 
        . That conclusion applies regardless of whether the contempt involved in the disobedience to the order is classified as a civil or a criminal contempt. Thus, proof that a contempt has been committed by breaching a court order involves  
        proving enough 
         to conclude that the action or inaction said to constitute the breach was deliberate, and not casual, accidental or unintentional. Consistently with  
        Witham 
        , that needs to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
      
    62 The defendants contend that the material breach of the freezing orders presently in focus should be characterised as casual, accidental or unintentional. That submission is rejected. It is not justified by the evidence. 
     
      
    63 The defendants argued that there was no ‘wilful’ breach of the court orders by the defendants because, once legal costs had been incurred in excess of $50,000, the first and second defendants had no effective capacity to prevent the money from being withdrawn from the Middletons Trust Account. It was argued that the withdrawal of funds from the account, which constituted the breach of the injunction, was not based on any specific authority from the defendants which could have been countermanded, but rather upon the authority provided by Clause 88(4) of the Legal Profession Regulation 2005.  
     
      
    64 This submission is rejected. However the transaction between the defendants and their solicitors is characterised, it inevitably involves the defendants taking steps to authorise the withdrawal from the solicitors trust account of amounts in breach of the court order. Looking at the whole transaction between the parties, it can be seen that the defendants authorised Middletons to withdraw funds from the account through the following steps: 
     
      
       
        
         
        i. The defendants accepted the terms of the retainer offered by Middletons on 12 March 2007, authorising and directing Middletons to “draw on [the trust account] to pay any amount due from you to us”. 
         
         
        ii. After the date of the Mareva injunction, the defendants continued to incur legal costs, and did not seek to end or limit the terms of the retainer. 
         
         
        iii. As a direct result, invoices for the work performed were sent to the defendants, and when no objection to those invoices was received, funds were deducted from the trust account. 
        
       
      
    65 The finding is that from the time at which they entered into the retainer, the defendants were aware that once they received the invoices, if they did not challenge the invoices in any way, then the monies would be removed from the trust account. A number of the invoices sent to the defendants reinforced this knowledge by including the following notification: 
     
      
       
        
         
        We give you notice that, unless you object to any of the invoices within 7 days from the date of this letter, we will draw on the trust funds held on Praveen’s behalf to pay the invoices. 
        
       
      
    66 There was no argument put that the whole of the legal fees the subject of the breach been incurred prior to the order of the Mareva injunction [nor could such an argument possibly have been made on the evidence]. In such circumstances it is misconceived to suggest that there was no authority from the defendants to withdraw the funds the subject of the breach, nor any power in the defendants to countermand such an authority. 
     
      
    Challenges to the Statement of Charge 
     
      
    67 There is no substance in the defendant's contentions that the statement of charge is defective in any respect: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [the alleged deficiencies were that the statement of charge: 
         
        
       
      
    · did does not allege any breach of any orders at all;· did does not allege that the first and second defendants were aware of the orders; and· did not allege that there were any assets of the First and Second defendants that were relevantly dealt with or disposed of.] 
     
      
    68 In any event, Mr Street SC expressly acknowledged that, save in one respect, any suggested deficiencies would not prejudice his client and each could be cured by the Court. 
     
      
    69 The contention was, however, that in some way the framing of the statement of charge [when read in the light of the particulars] was deficient where it alleged that the first and second defendants knowingly authorised payments out of Middletons’ Trust Account held in their name. There is no substance in this contention. 
     
      
    Decision 
     
      
    70 The plaintiff has established that the first and second defendants are guilty of contempt of Court as charged.  
     
      
    71 The declaration sought in paragraph 1 of the motion is to be made at a time when short minutes of order are brought in dealing with all of the orders which the Court determines are appropriate to be made 
     
      
    Other orders 
     
      
    72 The matter is to be relisted for the purpose of the Court taking in submissions by the parties as to the other orders which are appropriate to be made in the circumstances. 
     
      
    Reserved ruling on evidence 
     
      
    73 During the hearing the plaintiffs sought to tender the materials behind the exhibit BWW7 to the affidavit of Mr Wyhoon made on 10 July 2008. That evidence is disallowed. There was no evidence to establish that Mr Young's signature appeared upon this material nor that the document came from Mr Young. Indeed the cover page of the facsimile appears to record that the communication was from the first defendant to Mr Wyhoon. Exhibit BWW2, being the trust account statement, refers on the fourth line of the text to ""Future costs and disbursements, Praveen Doolub D/Dep 15/3/07"". The document includes a reference to 16 March 2003 which is the date that the moneys were cleared in the sum of $30,000. As Ms Horvath, junior counsel for the plaintiff, contended: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [T]he reference being Praveen Doolub, .. [is assumed to be D for direct, deposit] 15 March 2007. Whereas the letter in BWW 7 that [the defendants seek] to tender, dated September 2007, refers to a placement by Song Young in the Middletons trust account on 16 March 2007, not 15 March 2007, and does not identify that it may have been money that Praveen Doolub put into the account. 
        
       
      
    74 The evidence was inadmissible. The evidence was further rejected pursuant to section 135 of the Evidence Act on the ground that the probative value of the evidence was substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence may be prejudicial to the plaintiff.

      14302/08 STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES v WILDE, John Alan 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff seeks orders pursuant to the Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 2006 (“the Act”) in relation to Mr Wilde. Mr Wilde is presently in custody pursuant to a continuing detention order made under the Act by Price J on 24 January 2008. The order which his Honour made was for a period of eight months, expiring 23 September 2008. 
     
      
    2 The summons seeks orders pursuant to s 15(4) of the Act, or in the alternative, pursuant to s 7(4), which provide for the appointment of relevant medical practitioners. The plaintiff seeks the appointment of two qualified psychiatrists. 
     
      
    3 By way of ultimate relief, the plaintiff seeks an order pursuant to s 17(1)(b) of the Act that Mr Wilde be detained in a correctional centre for seven months from the date of the order, but in the alternative, seeks orders for extended supervision for a period of five years. 
     
      
    4 By reason of the making of the application, the jurisdiction provided in the Court pursuant to s 16(1) has been initiated. Section 16(1) provides a power in the Court to make an order for the interim detention of an offender.  
     
      
    5 By initiating proceedings for a continuing detention order, the Court is provided with power to make an interim detention order if two matters are satisfied: firstly, s 16(1)(a) provides that it must be apparent that the offender's current custody would expire before the proceedings, being the proceedings for final relief, can be determined; secondly, the Court must be satisfied that the matters alleged in the supporting documentation justify the making of a continuing detention order or extended supervision order. Section 16(1)(b) Mr Wilde through his counsel concedes that the evidence before me would if proved justify the making of an extended supervision order. It is also apparent that Mr Wilde's present custody will expire before the proceedings for final relief can be determined. In that event, it is conceded that I have power to make an order for interim detention of Mr Wilde. 
     
      
    6 That power has been considered by a number of judges and by the Court of Appeal. I considered the position in Attorney General for the State of New South Wales v Gallagher [2006] NSWSC 340. It was considered by the Court of Appeal in Attorney General for New South Wales v Tillman [2007] NSWCA 119. 
     
      
    7 In Tillman, it was said that the approach which the trial judge had taken to the exercise of the discretion in s 16 was erroneous. The court said at [44]-[46]:  
     
      
       
        
        “There is a strong presumption against construing a statute so that it trenches upon a fundamental right such as the liberty of the subject. However, that presumption is weakened in the present context and would not prevail over the clear and explicit language of the statute with its clearly stated protective and rehabilitating objects. Thus s 16 applies where the offender is already in custody and where the claim for final relief is for a continuing detention order. In the instant case, the 'supporting documentation' demonstrated that, if proved, the making of a continuing detention order would be justified. Moreover s 16(2) and (3) sets the outer limits for the period of any interim detention order and any renewals, namely twenty-eight days maximum for any individual order and no more than three months in total with any renewed orders. 
        
       
       
        
        The statutory objects in this extraordinary legislation are directed at 'ensuring' the safety and protection of the community and 'facilitating' rehabilitation of serious sex offenders. They also weigh against any strong presumption in favour of liberty prevailing, at least at the interim stage. A final hearing can be brought on with expedition. 
        
       
       
        
        We see no basis for discounting unchallenged evidence in a particular case that points strongly in the direction of risk-avoidance at the interim stage. However, we do not suggest that there is a general presumption in favour of maintaining the custodial status quo when interim relief is in question."" 
        
       
      
    8 The Court then went on to consider the facts of that particular case, and made plain that the conduct of the matter by the plaintiff, in particular, a delay in making an application to the Court, was not a significant reason for declining to make an interim detention order.  
     
      
    9 The Court said if the protection of the public called for one or both types of interim order, then the Attorney General's delay, even if unjustifiable, was not a factor that should have carried any weight in the exercise of the discretion.  
     
      
    10 At [99] the Court said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Since s 16(1)(b) is satisfied if either category of final order would be justified if the matters alleged in the documentation are proved, the Court is not required, at the stage of considering whether the discretionary power to make an interim detention order is engaged, to assess which category of final order is likely to be made at the end of the day. Because the word 'may' in the closing portion of s 16(1) imports a true discretion, it is open for the Court to refuse to make an interim detention order even if conditions (a) and (b) are satisfied. But it would not be a proper exercise of that discretion, in our opinion, for the Court to make an interim supervision order instead of interim detention order simply because the probabilities suggested that an extended supervision order was the more likely (final) candidate. That would involve reading words into the subsection that are not there. If (unlike the present case) there was only a claim for a continuing detention order, then the only options available to the Court under s16(1) would be to make an interim detention order or to dismiss the claim for interim relief."" 
        
       
      
    11 The history of Mr Wilde's offending includes three convictions for sexual assault matters together with a number of other convictions of a lesser order of seriousness. 
     
      
    12 His record also reveals that he has, on a previous occasion, breached recognisance orders. He was convicted of rape in 1981 and sentenced for that offence. In 1982 the record indicates a conviction for a breach of recognisance and in July of that year, a conviction for escaping from lawful custody. He was convicted of indecent assault and threatening actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse in March 1985. In June 1993 he was convicted of an aggravated sexual assault and other related offences. It is unnecessary for me to detail the facts of each of those offences beyond indicating that they were serious and involved not only an assault upon the victim but seriously degrading acts. 
     
      
    13 Mr Wilde acknowledges his guilt in relation to the first sexual assault matter but denies his guilt in relation to the latter two. In relation to the offence for which he was convicted in June 1993 his total sentence expired on 5 November 2007, although provision was made in his sentence, if appropriate, for him to be released at an earlier date on parole. He did not obtain parole and as a consequence of the potential expiry of his sentence, application was made to this Court for a continuing detention order. That was the application which was considered by Price J and to which I have previously referred. 
     
      
    14 The fact that Mr Wilde does not concede or admit his guilt in relation to the latter two offences has been the cause of some difficulty. He has also given evidence before me of his inability to respond in a non-aggressive fashion to people known to be paedophiles. The source of that difficulty is apparently the death of his child at the hands of such a person. Because of his inability to respond in an appropriate manner to such persons, Mr Wilde has not been able to complete the conventional treatment program within the prison system. That problem was confronted in the proceedings before Price J and arrangements were made for a special treatment program to be implemented which would ensure that he would not confront paedophiles in the course of group therapy. The evidence before me indicates that that special program has not been completed by reason of the fact that Mr Wilde continues to deny the latter two offences. 
     
      
    15 The evidence upon which the plaintiff relies comes essentially from three witnesses. Mr Craig Baird has provided a psychological risk assessment. His present position may be appropriately described as equivocal. He says in his report: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am unsure what to recommend in order to continue to address Mr Wilde's dynamic risk factor deficits should he remain in custody. I am however currently of the opinion that the lack of opportunities for normal social and interpersonal contact in the present custodial environment will greatly limit the rate of development in the areas in which Mr Wilde needs development to better manage his risk of re-offending sexually and violently.” 
        
       
      
    16 Mr Baird also gave oral evidence. As I understand his position he believes that it is unlikely that further benefit will be gained from continuing treatment if Mr Wilde continues to be incarcerated and that his rehabilitation will only be progressed by him being able, in a controlled way, to re-enter the community. 
     
      
    17 Mr Baird's report was agreed to by Mr Ware, who at the time was the Statewide Clinical Coordinator for Sex Offender Programs. His role has since changed a little and he is now the Acting Director, Sex and Violent Offenders. He also provided a written report. In that report he concludes that Mr Wilde is assessed as being a high risk category for sexual offending relative to other adult male sexual offenders: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has been assessed as high risk on the Static 99 [An accepted method of assessing risk of re-offending amongst sexual offenders] and moderate high risk on the SVR-20 Risk Assessment Instruments.” 
        
       
      
    18 Again I interpolate another accepted method of assessment: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Wilde was also assessed by the PCL-R as having a high level of psychopathic personality traits. Further, in considering a number of dynamic risk factors that are predicted of sexual recidivism, it was clear that these are likely to be present for Mr Wilde, although it is unclear as to what extent of severity. I note this conclusion is consistent with all other psychiatric and psychological reports.” 
        
       
      
    19 Mr Ware continues: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Wilde's sex offences committed to date were similar. It is therefore, reasonable to assume that if he were to commit a further sexual offence it would follow a similar pattern. This sort of offence is, as I understand it, serious sexual offences defined by the  
        Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act 
          
        2006. I further note that if Mr Wilde is to commit a further sexual offence that it is reasonable to assume that the degree of physical and psychological harm incurred would be high and that a weapon and or force would be used. Further, it is also in my view reasonable to assume that should he re-offend, then it will occur quickly upon release as is happened previously whilst under supervision conditions.” 
        
       
      
    20 Mr Ware expresses the view that further treatment is necessary in order to reduce Mr Wilde's risk of sexual recidivism. He believes treatment should be of higher intensity and within a custodial context. Furthermore, he expresses a concern that it will be necessary to take steps to manage Mr Wilde's risks towards police officers, paedophiles, female parole offences and psychologists. 
     
      
    21 Mr Ware's opinion is shared by Ms Booby who is the Acting Executive Director, Offender Services and Programs. The effect of the evidence of Mr Ware and Ms Booby is that in their opinion further treatment within the prison system is necessary before Mr Wilde could be released under supervision with an appropriate level of assurance for the safety of the community. 
     
      
    22 When Price J considered the position earlier this year he was assisted by evidence from three psychiatrists: Doctors Allnut, O'Dea and Nielsen. In general, their evidence does not give the same conservative picture of Mr Wilde's prospect of successful re-entry into the community. However, Dr O'Dea did say: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although Mr Wilde's risk of engaging in further sex offending behaviours would be considered significantly high, I do not consider that the current evidence regarding his assessment of risk is sufficiently advanced to predict with sufficient accuracy Mr Wilde's precise likelihood of engaging in further sex offending behaviours on release into the community.” 
        
       
      
    23 Later he said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst his denial of sexual offences is of note, it may not in and of itself predict further sex offending behaviours and would not necessarily preclude Mr Wilde from engaging in and benefitting from a comprehensive risk management program. That being said, Mr Wilde's state of refusal to participate in a community based treatment management program may limit the impact of such a program, at least in the first instance. However, further extended periods in custody to complete specific psychological programs are unlikely to significantly reduce Mr Wilde's risk of sexual re-offending in the long-term.” 
        
       
      
    24 Dr Nielsen concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “After reviewing Mr Wilde's history of offending and the recent observations by experienced psychologists, it is clear that Mr Wilde will need considerable assistance in adjusting to life in the community and there are good grounds to continue supervision of Mr Wilde for several years after his eventual release. However, the only scientific grounds for recommending counselling would be to assist in his adjustment to life in the community and as part of a monitoring program. That would also be very much in Mr Wilde's interests.” 
        
       
      
      
    25 Dr Nielsen expressed this conclusion: 
     
      
       
        
        “From a review of the material it did not appear to the doctor that Mr Wilde's sexual behaviours is due to a treatable psychiatric disorder and there is no scientific basis for the opinion, he says that his long-term risk of offending will be reduced by any form of counselling.” 
        
       
      
    26 Dr Allnut, in his comprehensive report, ultimately expressed the conclusion that it was a matter for the Court as to whether Mr Wilde, at least in November 2007, should be subject to an extended supervision order for a continuing detention. Dr Allnut noted that Mr Wilde has a: 
     
      
       
        
        “[H]istory of poor adherence to legal as well as correctional supervision orders, sexually offending in the context of supervision orders.” 
        
       
      
    27 Price J considered all of that material and determined that a continuing detention order should be made with the expectation that a treatment program specific to Mr Wilde should be provided for him. As I understand the position that program has been made available, but the evidence of Mr Ware and Ms Booby is that, for the reason I have previously indicated, further treatment is necessary before they would be satisfied that it was appropriate to release Mr Wilde under supervision. 
     
      
    28 Section 16 of the Act is engaged when an application has been made for an interim detention order. Section 15 relates to applications for continuing detention orders. Subs (4) contemplates a preliminary hearing following which, if the matters alleged in supporting documentation are proved, the Court must make orders appointing qualified persons to conduct examinations and furnish the reports to the Court. The scheme of the legislation is apparent. The Parliament contemplates that the Court will be assisted in its ultimate decision as to whether or not orders should be made as requested by the State by obtaining evidence from persons who the Court has appointed to assist it in resolving the matter. The plaintiff asks the Court to appoint Doctors Allnut and O'Dea to fulfill that task in the present case. 
     
      
    29 Mr Wilde has given evidence before me; in giving that evidence he has indicated a disposition to comply with the terms of any supervision order. He has indicated a preparedness to accept further treatment if it is determined that it be necessary. However he has also made plain to me that he maintains serious difficulties in dealing with paedophiles which may be a significant issue, a resolution of which is not immediately apparent. I draw attention to that matter only because it seems to me from the evidence presently available that I could not be satisfied that it is appropriate, even on an interim basis, to provide for Mr Wilde's supervised release. That may be the appropriate position but the uncertainties in the evidence, the conflicts between the evidence of Mr Ware and Ms Booby and Mr Baird and the difficulties expressed in the psychiatric reports, persuade me that I should, in the exercise of the discretion available to me, provide for the continuing interim detention of Mr Wilde. I do so mindful, as I have said, of the fact that when the contemplated reports have been obtained, the up-to-date position in relation to Mr Wilde's psychiatric situation will be available. It will also be possible to have the psychiatrists speak to their reports and an opportunity provided for Mr Baird and Mr Ware and Ms Booby to join in a discussion with the psychiatrists in an endeavour to resolve the disagreements between them and identify whether there is common ground or whether the Court otherwise could confidently conclude that it would be appropriate to provide for Mr Wilde's release under supervision. 
     
      
    30 It is necessary of course, as the Court of Appeal stressed, that when exercising the discretion, to be mindful of the objects of the Act. Those objects were amended in December 2007. The amendment has the effect of making the primary object of the Act to provide for the extended supervision and continuing detention of serious sex offenders so as to ensure the safety and protection of the community. 
     
      
    31 A subsidiary object is to encourage serious sex offenders to undertake rehabilitation. The emphasis on safety and protection of the community which the amended objects provides was not the situation when the Court of Appeal considered the matter of Tillman.  
     
      
    32 For those reasons I am persuaded that I should make the interim detention order. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
      1. That John Alan Wilde pursuant to s 16(1) of the

      Crimes (Serious Sex Offenders) Act  
      2006 that a warrant issue for the committal of John Alan Wilde to a Correctional Centre for the period specific in Order 1. 
       
      3. That two qualified psychiatrists, Dr Stephen Allnutt and Dr Samson Roberts, conduct separate examinations of John Alan Wilde. 
       
      4. That the two psychiatrists referred to in the preceding order furnish reports to the Supreme Court on the results of those examinations.

     Belinda Mary Campbell v Regina 
      
     
     
      
      The appellant was convicted after trial by jury of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled precursor contrary to s 307.11 of the  
      Criminal Code Act  
      1995 (Cth). She had imported a container of furniture in which there were also goods containing the prohibited substance. At trial, the appellant accepted that she became aware of those goods after the container was opened. The Crown submitted at trial that the appellant could be convicted of importing as that act extended to a point in time after this occurred. The trial judge refused to withdraw this submission from the jury. It was left open to the jury to convict the appellant on the basis that, even if they were not satisfied that she had the intention to import the material prior to the container being opened, they could convict her on the basis that she formed the intention at that time. 
       
       
      The appellant appeals her conviction. The Crown appeals the sentence.

      1 The physical and fault elements of an offence under the

      2 In construing statutory language, context must be considered in the first instance and not merely after some kind of ambiguity may be thought to arise.

      3 The context of s 307.11 of the  
      Criminal Code Act  
      1995 (Cth), in contrast with earlier provisions in the  
      Customs Act 
       1901 (Cth), suggests a precise, rather than expansive, sense of the word “imports”. [126], [136], [139], [183]. 
       
       
      4 “Imports”, under Div 307 of the  
      Criminal Code Act  
      1995 (Cth), requires the controlled drugs and precursors to arrive in Australia from abroad and to be delivered to a point which would result in the goods remaining in Australia. [128], [136], [139], [183]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The appellant was convicted upon an indictment containing one count that she: 
     
      
       
        
        “… between about 12 May 2006 and 18 June 2006 at Sydney, in the State of New South Wales did import a substance, intending to use or believing that another person intended to use, any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug, the substance being a border controlled precursor, namely pseudoephedrine, and the quantity imported being a commercial quantity.” 
        
       
      
    2 The substance, pseudoephedrine, had been discovered by the Australian Customs Service in the form of cold tablets contained in 36 boxes secreted in a shipping container of furniture imported from Indonesia. The furniture was destined for the appellant’s furniture business. 
     
      
    3 The offence charged is created by s 307.11 of the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) (“the Code”) which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “307.11(1) A person commits an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person imports or exports a substance; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) either or both of the following apply: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) the person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the person believes that another person intends to use any of the substance to manufacture a controlled drug; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the substance is a border controlled precursor; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) the quantity imported or exported is a commercial quantity. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Penalty: Imprisonment for 25 years or 5,000 penalty units, or both. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The fault element for paragraph (1)(c) is recklessness. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Absolute liability applies to paragraph (1)(d).” 
        
       
      
    4 By s 3.1 of the Code an offence consists of physical elements and fault elements. Section 3.2 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “3.2 In order for a person to be found guilty of committing an offence the following must be proved: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the existence of such physical elements as are, under the law creating the offence, relevant to establishing guilt; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in respect of each such physical element for which a fault element is required, one of the fault elements for the physical element.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    5 By s 4.1(1)(a) “conduct” is identified as a physical element. “Conduct” is in turn defined by s 4.1(2) to mean “an act”. For present purposes the relevant act is expressed in s 307.11 by the word “imports”. 
     
      
    6 There being no specification of a fault element in s 307.11, the default provision for the physical element of conduct in s 5.6(1) applies. Accordingly, the applicable fault element is “intention”.  
     
      
    7 Section 5.2(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person has intention with respect to conduct if he or she means to engage in that conduct.” 
        
       
      
    8 The appellant pleaded not guilty and was convicted after trial by jury. His Honour Judge Berman SC imposed a sentence of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months but directed, pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), that Mrs Campbell be released after serving 18 months upon entry into a recognizance to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months. 
     
      
    9 The appellant appeals from her conviction. The Crown appeals from the sentence imposed as manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      Background Facts 
       
      
    10 Mrs Campbell, formerly a pharmacist, conducted a furniture business from which she sold furniture manufactured in Indonesia. The appellant has always accepted that she imported, and intended to import, a container of furniture. She denies, and has always denied, that she intended to import the “substance” contained in packages which were within the container with her furniture. 
     
      
    11 Over a period of about five years she had received 25 shipments of furniture, which had been arranged by her Indonesian business associate, Mr Samuel Rantesalu. Mrs Campbell became aware of the fact that Mr Rantesalu had included packages in seven of those 25 shipments to her, which packages were not part of any order she had placed. The packages were not declared for customs purposes. Mr Rantesalu had arranged for these packages to be picked up from her business premises after each container had arrived at those premises. That is what happened on the occasion of the shipment the subject of the charge. 
     
      
    12 On Mrs Campbell’s evidence, she had made numerous efforts to stop Mr Rantesalu engaging in this practice but to no avail. She also admitted that she had opened some of these packages and became aware that they contained cigarettes. Furthermore, on at least one occasion (perhaps three occasions) there had been a shipment, like the shipment the subject of the charge, which contained a quantity of cold tablets containing the same precursor substance. As noted above, Mrs Campbell was a pharmacy graduate and had conducted a pharmacy business before the furniture business. 
     
      
    13 In summary the relevant chronology is as follows: 
     
      
    · 5 June 2006 – The appellant is advised of the imminent arrival of a consignment of furniture and of a directive from the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Services (“AQIS”) referring to random searches of the container. 
     
      
    · 11 June 2006 – A ship with the container arrived in Australia. 
     
      
    · 13 June 2006 – The container was cleared through Customs and the appellant’s customs agent was advised of clearance, subject to AQIS inspection. 
     
      
    · 13 June 2006 – A Customs officer conducting an x-ray analysis of the container identified an anomaly. Later that day a physical examination and unpacking of the container identified 36 boxes which contained a number of smaller yellow boxes. 
     
      
    · 15 and 16 June 2006 – The examination of the 36 boxes by the Australian Federal Police involved unwrapping 24 of those boxes, which contained a total of 96 smaller boxes. 
     
      
    · The inspection revealed the presence of a large number of packets of Sudafed and Actifed, commercially available medications which contain pseudoephedrine. The expert evidence indicated that the drugs would yield somewhere between 50.1 and 70.6 kilograms of methylamphetamine hydrochloride (commonly known as ice). Depending upon the extraction process undertaken, the street value of this quantity was somewhere between $20 and $56 million. 
     
      
    · 16 June 2006 – The container was repacked with 24 of the 36 boxes for purposes of a controlled delivery. 
     
      
    · 16 June 2006 – The appellant was advised that the AQIS inspection had been cancelled. 
     
      
    · 17 June 2006 – The container was picked up by a transport company on the instructions of the appellant’s customs agent. 
     
      
    · 17 June 2006 – The container was delivered to the back of the appellant’s shop at Leichhardt and the furniture, but not the 24 boxes, unpacked. 
     
      
    · 18 June 2006 – The appellant indicated to her Indonesian associate that he should arrange to have the additional boxes picked up. 
     
      
    · 18 June 2006 – Two men arrived at the container located at the rear of the premises and took away the 24 boxes which contained the drugs, as arranged between the appellant and Mr Rantesalu some two hours earlier. The two men were subsequently arrested. The appellant and her husband were also arrested on that day. 
     
      
    14 Between 16 June and 18 June 2006, intercepts of telephone services used by the appellant occurred pursuant to warrants. The content of conversations and text messages intercepted was an important part of the Crown case against the appellant. Subsequently, she agreed to a record of interview and her answers to questions during the interview were also relied upon. 
     
      
    15 A range of facts were relied upon in the proceedings on the issue of the appellant’s intention. On her behalf, particular reliance was placed on her own evidence, and that of her husband, to the effect that she and/or her husband objected when they became aware that Mr Rantesalu had included additional packages in earlier consignments. On their evidence they had asked him to desist from this practice and, on some occasions, had received assurances that he would do so. 
     
      
    16 The Crown relied, on the issue of intent, on the fact that the appellant knew that Mr Rantesalu was intending to come to Australia shortly after the arrival of the shipment that led to the charges. She had acknowledged in her record of interview that he came to Australia from Indonesia when there had been additional packages in her earlier shipments. This was the basis of an inference that she, at the least, expected the shipment in issue to contain additional packages. 
     
      
    17 A number of intercepted telephone calls and SMS messages were also relied upon by the Crown on the issue of intention, including the following: 
     
      
    · At 1.14pm on 16 June the appellant learned from her shipping agent that the container was not going to be inspected by AQIS, contrary to earlier advice. She immediately called her husband and said “There is a God”. She said that she had had nightmares and added “I just feel like going running around the street screaming hooray”. She also said “I feel like crying, you don’t know how emotional I am its just been killing me”. She also said that she did not intend to tell others, no doubt relevantly Mr Rantesalu, and she would “let them … suffer … the way I did”. 
     
      
    · She did not inform Mr Rantesalu of this turn of events in SMS messages she sent to him that night and during the next day, ie Saturday 17 June 2006. 
     
      
    · At 11.09am on 18 June Mr Rantesalu telephoned the appellant and, on the Crown case, the two persons expressed elation at the information that there would be no inspection of the container. She said words such as “there must be a God” and, with reference to Mr Rantesalu’s “prayers”, she said “well it worked”. She also said “we’re very, very lucky and um we have to sort something else to do”. Mr Rantesalu indicated that he would ask “my friend to come in quickly” and a time later that day was arranged. 
     
      
    · At 2.10pm on 18 June the appellant sent a text message to Mr Rantesalu. She said “Thank God our prayers were heard”. 
     
      
       
      The Direction as to the Elements 
       
      
    18 At trial the submissions of counsel, and his Honour’s directions to the jury, were structured in large measure in accordance with a document handed to the jury identifying six elements of which they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in order to convict the appellant. Although on appeal issues arise only with respect to some of these elements, it is pertinent to set out the whole of the document which identifies the issues at trial and places the facts in the context of those issues.  
     
      
    19 The document read: 
     
      
       
       “The Elements of the Offences 
       
       
        
        1st Element 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Campbell imported a substance (whether or not she knew about the presence of the substance), namely the contents of the extra packages that were in shipping container DLCU 2141810, by arranging for that container to be imported. 
        
       
       
        
        Comment 
        
       
       
        
        It is accepted by the accused that this happened. She agrees that she imported the substance because she imported the shipping container and the extra packages (with the substance inside them) were in that shipping container. 
        
       
       
        
        2nd Element 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Campbell intended to import the substance that was in the extra packages. That is, the Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Campbell intended to import those extra packages. 
        
       
       
        
        She would have intended to import the extra packages if she meant that to happen. 
        
       
       
        
        Comment 
        
       
       
        
        This element is disputed by the accused. 
        
       
       
        
        This element does not require that the Crown prove that Mrs Campbell knew or was even aware of what was in those packages, but it does require the Crown to prove that she intended to import them, whatever they contained. 
        
       
       
        
        3rd Element 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that there was pseudoephedrine in the substance. 
        
       
       
        
        Comment 
        
       
       
        
        It is accepted by the accused that this happened. She agrees that the substance in the extra packages was tablets containing pseudoephedrine. 
        
       
       
        
        4th Element 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the quantity of pseudoephedrine imported exceeded 1.2 kg. 
        
       
       
        
        Comment 
        
       
       
        
        It is accepted by the accused that this was the case. She agrees that the quantity of pseudoephedrine imported exceeded 1.2 kg. 
        
       
       
        
        5th Element 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has to prove beyond reasonable doubt either that: 
        
       
      
    · Mrs Campbell knew that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810, or 
     
      
    · Mrs Campbell was aware of a substantial risk that that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810 and, in the circumstances known to her, it was unjustifiable for her to take that risk by importing the container. 
     
      
       
        
        Comment 
        
       
       
        
        This element is disputed by the accused. She denies that she knew that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810 and she denies that she was aware of a substantial risk that that was the case. 
        
       
       
        
        If you find beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Campbell knew that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810 then the Crown has proved this element. Mrs Campbell denies that she knew that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown has also proved this element if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Campbell was aware of a substantial risk that that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810 and, in the circumstances known to her, it was unjustifiable for her to take that risk by importing the container. Mrs Campbell’s case is that she denies that she was aware of a substantial risk that that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810, but if you were to find that she was aware of that risk, she does not suggest that it was justifiable for her to take that risk. 
        
       
       
        
        The result is that you would find this element satisfied if the Crown proves beyond reasonable doubt that either that: 
        
       
      
    · Mrs Campbell knew that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810, or 
     
      
    · Mrs Campbell was aware of a substantial risk that that there were tablets with pseudoephedrine in them inside container DLCU 2141810. 
     
      
       
        
        6th Element 
        
       
       
        
        You have to find that Mrs Campbell believed that another person intended to use some or all of the pseudoephedrine to manufacture a controlled drug (methylamphetamine hydrochloride, amphetamine and methyl amphetamine are all controlled drugs). 
        
       
       
        
        You should find this element satisfied unless Mrs Campbell proves to you, on the balance of probabilities, that she did not have that belief. 
        
       
       
        
        Comment 
        
       
       
        
        Mrs Campbell has not attempted to prove that she did not believe that another person intended to use some or all of the pseudoephedrine to manufacture a controlled drug, because her case is that she had no knowledge of, or any awareness of, a substantial risk that there were tablets containing pseudoephedrine in the shipping container. 
        
       
       
        
        So, if the Crown has proved elements 1 to 5 beyond reasonable doubt then because Mrs Campbell has not attempted to prove that element 6 is not satisfied, the result would be that Mrs Campbell should be found guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        If, on the other hand the Crown has not satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt of elements 1 to 5, then Mrs Campbell should be found not guilty.” 
        
       
       
      The Crown Case 
       
      
    20 It is common ground that the Crown relied at trial on the proposition that the physical element, being the act ‘imports’ within the meaning of s 307.11, could occur after the act of landing the goods in Australia or their clearance through Customs. 
     
      
    21 In the course of his summing-up to the jury his Honour made reference, more than once, to the way the Crown relied on the importation as an act continuing up to at least the point at which the packages were removed from the appellant’s premises. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… when I talk to you about this concept of importation either in this first element or any other part of the elements, it is important that you understand we are not only talking about the exact moment that the container arrived in Australia, or the exact moment it cleared customs, or even the exact moment that the container was delivered to Chic Teak. Importation begins before the goods leave their point of origin overseas and continues after their arrival in Australia to the point of delivery to their final destination. Now in this case, the point of delivery of their final destination goes beyond the delivery to the Chic Teak premises. In fact, in this case, the importation of the substance was still in progress when Mr Zhang and Mr Baka were arrested, and in fact, it was those arrests which brought the importation in this case to an end.” (SU 25-26) 
        
       
      
    22 The appeal focused on the Crown’s reliance on the entire period of the process of importation and its relationship to the fault element of the offence. His Honour related this concept of importation to the issue of intent in his summing-up: 
     
      
       
        
        “You might want to remember here that the concept of importing continues past the actual arrival into Australia of the container. So the crown says that by doing things like arranging for the delivery to Chic Teak, realising that there must have been extra packages in it, or organising the collection of the packages after Mrs Campbell definitely knew that there were extra packages, that Mrs Campbell must have been intending to import those packages. On the other hand, the accused says, ‘I didn’t intend to import them.’ More accurately, the submission put to you on behalf of the accused by Mr Bromwich, is that the crown has not proved beyond reasonable doubt that she did intend to import those extra packages.” (SU 31) 
        
       
      
    23 In the course of submissions to the jury, the Crown referred to the sequence of events when the boxes were removed from the appellant’s Leichhardt premises by two men in a truck, which was eventually stopped and the men arrested. The Crown Prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is at that point that the importation ended. This is an important point to which I’ll go to later ladies and gentlemen. But the importation of those boxes, those packages was a continuing event on the ship, through the container examination facility, on the truck, off the truck, stored on the concrete apron for about twenty-four hours, twenty-five hours and then transported onto Campbell Street.” (T 1221) 
        
       
      
    24 The Crown Prosecutor then addressed the jury on the Crown case with respect to the six elements, set out above, which were the subject of agreement between legal representatives of the parties and placed before the jury by his Honour.  
     
      
    25 On the issue of intent, the Crown Prosecutor outlined the evidence said to be relevant to this issue, including the appellant’s conduct at the time that the container was opened at her premises and the packages were removed. Particular reliance was placed on the telephone intercepts in this regard.  
     
      
    26 After setting out certain intercepts the Crown Prosecutor said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “In summary, if you look at the evidence of the number of prior containers that have been loaded up. The failure of the requests, so called, to have any effect, the telephone intercepts and the tone within them. The common suffering, and the failure to admonish Sam after all that had gone on before, and according to Mr and Mrs Campbell, this was the largest importation too. By far the largest they say, and then the assistance providing in arranging for the packages to be collected. You can infer intent. 
        
       
       
        
        Even if that is not enough to convince you, remember that Mrs Campbell says that she did not know until the container was half unpacked and Simon said something. If you accept that, of course at that point, the importation was ongoing. So if you accept that there was less than an intent, up until 2 o’clock no [sic] the Sunday, in my submission, that is not open to you after 2 o’clock on the Sunday, because Mrs Campbell knows about the extra boxes then.” (T 1236) 
        
       
      
    27 It is the second of these two paragraphs upon which the appellant relies as setting out, for the first time, this alternative basis for liability. (It appears likely that the references to “Sunday” were an error for Saturday, but nothing was said to turn on this). 
     
      
    28 The Crown Prosecutor immediately reinforced the proposition and added, giving the correct day: 
     
      
       
        
        “The importation is still ongoing at 2 o’clock on the Saturday. The truck was not going to arrive until the next day as we know. The importation was continuing when the truck to [sic] the boxes into Campbell Street, and from the very latest about 2 o’clock on the Saturday, Mrs Campbell knows about the boxes. She said she knew about them, because she saw them. She then, with Mr Campbell secures the packages over night [sic], she talks to Sam personally, and arranges the pick up for the boxes. She arranges for Simon to be there, and in fact raises that fact that Simon will be there with Sam on the telephone, and then Mr Campbell does turn up at her request and then assists. At the very least, this part of the importation is intended in the crown’s submission, and is sufficient to prove the second element.” (T 1237) 
        
       
      
    29 Furthermore, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So either Mrs Campbell knew the boxes were coming, she assumed they were coming, she wasn’t surprised to see them there or as the importation was ongoing, she became 100% aware, had a 100% knowledge of the existence of the boxes. She knew and she persisted in the importation, and that is what we point to in relation to the second element ladies and gentlemen.” (T 1237) 
        
       
      
    30 The appellant submits that this was the first time the prosecutor had submitted that the requisite intention could have been formed for the first time on 17 June 2006, when Mrs Campbell saw the additional packages. This submission was not contested on the appeal. 
     
      
    31 In the absence of the jury, counsel for the respondent expressed concern with the proposition that an intention could come into existence for the first time at 2 o’clock on the Saturday. 
     
      
    32 His Honour’s first reaction was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well if the importation is continuing, and Mrs Campbell does something, after 2 o’clock Saturday, in furtherance of that importation, knowing that the packages are there, why isn’t that – what’s wrong with that?” (T 1238) 
        
       
      
    33 The prosecutor returned to the proposition, when addressing the jury about the identified second element. He reiterated his earlier summary of the evidence in this regard in the following passage, in which he also addressed the alternative case: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second element. The crown has to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Campbell intended to import the substance that was in the extra packages, and you will recall that this is a disputed element. That is we have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Mrs Campbell intended to import those extra packages. I point to six things in summary, ladies and gentlemen. The number of prior containers, the failure of any requests to have any effect, the telephone intercepts and their tone, the common suffering of withholding information from Sam and the failure to admonish Sam at all after the last and according to the Campbells, the largest importation. And six, the assistance provided in arranging for the packages to be collected. These all go to an intent in relation to the importation in relation to those packages. And remember of no relevance to this element is what was actually in the packages. It’s just in relation to the intent to import those packages and remember the importation starts back in Indonesia and continues until Campbell Street when Mr Baka and Mr Zhang, as we found out they are, were arrested. 
        
       
       
        
        So bearing in mind  
        at the very least we say this part of the importation is intended. That is when Mrs Campbell knows about the boxes, 
         even though we say she knew about them before  
        she knows about them from Saturday afternoon and yet persists 
         in her participation.” (T 1258-1259) (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    34 In submissions to this Court, the appellant noted that of the six matters relied upon in this passage on the issue of intent, four occurred five to seven days after the container had landed. 
     
      
    35 During the course of the summing-up, in the absence of the jury, counsel for the appellant at trial made the following submission: 
     
      
       
        
        “… during the crown address, he raised this issue of acquiring, if you like, intention on the Saturday afternoon of 17 June 2006 upon seeing the boxes and your Honour may recall I raised a doubt about it and your Honour asked me to articulate it and at that time, I couldn’t and didn’t. I’ve given it quite a deal of thought and I’d be asking your Honour to, in effect, withdraw that line of reasoning from the jury for this reason. When one looks at these cases that deal with importation as a process, all of them, I think all of them, Sukkar(?), and Lam, and Leff(?), and all the rest, are all knowingly concern cases and they concern persons who have become involved at a point in the process including a point in the process after the landing of the goods in Australia. And when you look at all those process of importation cases, they involve someone becoming an accessory to a process. In my submission, that line of reasoning really isn’t available for a principle because in my submission when you are the importer, you can’t acquire the state of mind in that fashion after the goods have been cleared.” (T 22/8/07 19) 
        
       
      
    36 His Honour said that he did not intend to withdraw the Crown submission. 
     
      
    37 Furthermore, during the course of his summing-up his Honour reiterated the Crown case to the jury without any adverse comment. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The crown then said, look even if Mrs Campbell did not intend to import the extra packages before they were revealed, you have got to remember, says the crown, that importation continues and that this importation was continuing up until the time of the arrest of Mr Baka and Mr Zhang in Campbell Street. So the crown says, bear this in mind: From about 2 o’clock on the Saturday until the arrest in Campbell Street the following day Mrs Campbell knows 100 per cent of the presence of the extra packages and she continues to arrange for their collection by people working on behalf of Sam after that time, 2pm Saturday, when the presence of the extra packages is revealed. 
        
       
       
        
        The crown says that is enough to prove the second element because  
        at the very least by 2pm on the Saturday Mrs Campbell knew  
        about the boxes and persisted in the importation. He said that,  
        looking at the case even on this basis, Mrs Campbell 
          
        must have done what she did intending to import  
        those extra packages. The crown reminds you that this concept of importation goes beyond the delivery of the container to Chic Teak and continues up until the time Mr Zhang and Mr Baka are arrested. 
        
       
       
        
        The crown says that because Mrs Campbell organises with Sam the time for people who are acting on behalf of Sam to collect the packages you could conclude from that that Mrs Campbell intended to import the extra packages.” (SU 50-51) (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    38 It is apparent that the case was left to the jury to the effect that the jury could convict the appellant on the basis that the requisite fault element of intention to import had been formed for the first time at or about 2.00pm on Saturday 17 June 2006, when the appellant saw the additional packages. The factual basis for the appellant’s contention has been established. 
     
      
       
      Issues on the Appeal 
       
      
    39 This appeal focuses on the fault element which is an essential element of the offence. Did the appellant intend to import the substance? In the circumstances, this issue is equivalent to asking whether the appellant intended – in the sense of “meaning to engage” in the act – to import the additional 36 boxes.  
     
      
    40 The Crown, in its opening and in submissions at trial, identified the relevant physical element of the offence, being the act of importation, as extending after the arrival of the container in Australia through, at least, to the point at which the packages were picked up at the appellant’s Leichhardt premises, indeed to the point where the two men who picked the boxes up were arrested. The Crown linked the fault element, being the intention of the appellant to engage in conduct so identified. The Crown case on fault was that the appellant intended to import the substance in the sense that she intended the conduct commencing with the opening of the container at her premises and concluding with the pickup. 
     
      
    41 In a submission, which the appellant contends constituted an alternative case (a characterisation which it is convenient to adopt), the Crown indicated to the jury that it could find the requisite intent by reason only of the conduct of the appellant commencing on 17 June, when she became aware of the additional boxes and continuing on 18 June when she permitted the representatives of Mr Rantesalu to pick up the packages at her premises, which occurred some two hours later. Counsel for the appellant asked the trial judge to withdraw that submission from the jury. His Honour refused to do so. 
     
      
    42 The issue to be determined on appeal is whether the conviction is contrary to law because the alternative case was left to the jury. The appellant contends, alternatively: 
     
      
       
      (i) The physical element of importing was complete before the opening of the container on 17 June and, accordingly, the physical element and fault element did not coincide. 
       
       
      (ii) Even if the physical element of importing was not complete, the appellant could not be guilty of importing based only on conduct occurring on or after 17 June. 
       
       
      (iii) Even if (ii) is wrong, the trial judge failed to appropriately direct the jury as to the evidence by which the appellant’s conduct constituted the physical and fault elements of this alternative case. 
       
       
      (iv) The Crown impermissibly changed its case after the close of the evidence. 
       
       
      The “Imports” Offence 
       
      
    43 The appellant’s first submission turns on the meaning of the word “imports” in s 307.11(1)(a) of the Code. The appellant contends that the physical and fault elements of an offence under the Code must coincide in time. Mr T Game SC, who appeared for the appellant on the appeal, submits that the act of importation was complete before 17 June 2006 when, on the Crown’s alternative case, the fault element of intention was said to first arise. 
     
      
    44 I agree with the first step in the submission. Pursuant to s 3.2(b) of the Code, “in respect of each … physical element” the specified fault element “for” each physical element must be proved. As Mr Game submitted, the fault element must exist at the time of the commission of, or existence of, the physical element to which it attaches. 
     
      
    45 This submission distinguishes between the act of importing, with which the appellant was charged, and the process of importation which remains significant for accessorial offences, with which she was not charged. The appellant contends that the word “imports” in s 307.11(1)(a) refers to a precise point in time, limited to the act of landing goods in Australia or, alternatively, to clearance through Customs. A further alternative is the point of time, which may be after “clearance”, when the goods become physically available to the person who can remove them from the point at which they were “cleared”. 
     
      
    46 Mr J Agius SC, who appeared for the respondent Crown, contends for a broad concept of the word “import”, not limited in such a manner. The Crown contends that the point at which ‘importing’ can be said to have ceased is not susceptible to a simple formulation, although it can be identified in a particular case. A possible general formulation as to when ‘importing’ is complete is that goods have arrived at their final destination prior to distribution within Australia. An appropriate metaphor for the endpoint is that the goods have been delivered to the Australian wholesaler. 
     
      
    47 The appellant’s submissions in this respect commenced with reliance on the judgment of Barwick CJ in The Queen v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203 at 212.2 and 215.7 where his Honour identified the “natural meaning” of the word “importation” as “landing” the goods or “entry into the port with the intention of being landed”. 
     
      
    48 The idea that words have a “natural and ordinary meaning” is not a proposition that is applied without regard to context. As Lord Hoffmann said in Charter Reinsurance Co Ltd v Fagan [1997] AC 313 at 391: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think that in some cases the notion of words having a natural meaning is not a very helpful one. Because the meaning of words is so sensitive to syntax and context, the natural meaning of words in one sentence may be quite unnatural in another. Thus a statement that words have a particular natural meaning may mean no more than that in many contexts they will have that meaning. In other contexts their meaning will be different but no less natural.” 
        
       
      
    49 The contemporary approach to statutory interpretation is not as rigid as it once was. The courts no longer approach a statute with scissors in one hand and a dictionary in the other. 
     
      
    50 Context must be considered in the first instance and not merely after some kind of ambiguity has been thought to arise. Furthermore, “context” is used in a wide sense to encompass the purpose of the legislation (see K & S Lake City Freighters Pty Ltd v Gordon & Gotch Ltd (1985) 157 CLR 309 at 315; CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408; Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [69]; Network Ten Pty Ltd v TCN Channel Nine Ltd [2004] HCA 14; (2004) 218 CLR 273 at [11]–[13]). 
     
      
    51 In The Queen v Bull the accused were bringing cannabis by boat to Australia when they detected surveillance and dumped the drugs overboard. This occurred after the boat had crossed the then three mile limit for Australian territorial waters. The issue was whether this was an act of ‘importation’ or whether landing in Australia or something else was required in order to constitute an offence under s 233B(1)(b) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth).  
     
      
    52 That section relevantly stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “233B(1) Any person who– 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) imports … into Australia any prohibited imports to which this section applies …  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        shall be guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
      
    53 In his judgment, Barwick CJ made it clear that the issue was “when goods are imported into Australia within the meaning of the Act” (at 211.9). In the passage primarily relied upon by the appellant, his Honour said (at 212): 
     
      
       
        
        “The question is not what constitutes importation in an abstract or universal sense: the question is when, according to the provisions of the Act, are goods imported into Australia. However, in general, importation of goods, in my opinion, according to the natural meaning of the word, involves landing them, or bringing them within a port for the purpose of landing them in the country or place in relation to which importation is regulated.” 
        
       
      
    54 His Honour then proceeded at 213-215 to consider the overall scheme of the Act and did so “in order to discover what meaning is required by the statute to be given to the expressions ‘import into Australia’ or ‘importation into Australia’” (at 213). 
     
      
    55 Numerous features of the particular statutory scheme were emphasised by his Honour including: 
     
      
    · The fact that goods are subject to the control of Customs from the time of importation (at 213.9). 
     
      
    · The control of Customs extends to goods on a ship within the limits of a port but not intended to be landed (at 213-214). 
     
      
    · Entries may be made for goods subject to Customs for one of the four identified purposes (at 214.2). 
     
      
    · Ports are proclaimed as ports for purposes of the Act and the limits of such ports precisely fixed (at 214.7). 
     
      
    · Requirements are made for the arrival of a ship which means entry of the ship within the limits of the port (at 214-215). 
     
      
    56 On the basis of this analysis his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The scheme of the Act thus seems to be to control the due importation of goods by channelling shipping through proclaimed ports having defined limits and through boarding stations within the port to appropriate wharfage. … 
        
       
       
        
        All of the provisions to which I have so far referred operate on the footing that importation takes place on entry into port of the goods intended to be discharged from the ship at that port. The requirement of entry of imported goods unshipped necessarily denies the proposition that importation only takes place in any case when goods are landed. It seems to me that the conclusion that entry into the port with the intention of being landed constitutes importation, is implicit throughout the reasons for decision in  
        Wilson v Chambers & Co Pty Ltd  
        [(1926) 38 CLR 131] …” (at 215). 
        
       
      
    57 His Honour proceeded to consider the Crown submission that importation occurred upon the entry of the ships within the three mile limit. His Honour referred to various statutory requirements of the Customs Act with respect to the operation of ships and the responsibilities of masters with respect to movement of ships, together with the powers of Customs officers to board and search ships. His Honour noted that the obligation on a master by s 59 of the Act to bring the ship to for boarding would be otiose “if the goods in the ship are imported so soon as the ship arrives within territorial waters” (218.7).  
     
      
    58 His Honour went on to hold (at 218): 
     
      
       
        
        “… it would not be reasonable or practicable to impose on the owner of goods in a ship which has entered such marginal waters as from the moment of such entry the obligations which the Act places on an importer. Such a person would be unaware of the time of such entry. He could scarce be required immediately thereafter to enter the goods, even by a sight entry.” 
        
       
      
    59 Finally his Honour concluded (at 219-220): 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, in the phrase ‘import into Australia’ the reference is to the unsubmerged land mass of the continent and of Tasmania which does not include the marginal waters or, for that matter, any part of the continental shelf. The question is what is involved according to the Act in importation into Australia. On that I have expressed my firm conclusion. Accordingly, I am of opinion that, in order to commit the offence of importing created by s 233B(1)(b), the goods in question must have been brought within the limits of a port with the intention of landing them or must have been landed in Australia.” 
        
       
      
    60 It is quite clear from this detailed analysis that the natural or ordinary meaning of word “import”, to which his Honour first referred, was not applied without detailed attention to the statutory context. It was that context, rather than a dictionary definition, that led to his Honour’s conclusion as to the meaning of the concept of ‘importation’. Accordingly, his Honour’s conclusion is not determinative of this appeal. The statutory context of s 307.11 of the Code contains none of the elements upon which Barwick CJ relied.  
     
      
    61 Menzies J came to the same conclusion “upon a survey of the Act as a whole” (at 248.8).  
     
      
    62 Gibbs J (at 254) noted that the ordinary meaning of the word “import” was to “bring in … from a foreign country” and that could not be said of goods that had merely entered the three nautical mile limit and were not discharged. Nor could it be applied to goods which arrived at an Australian port for purposes of transit to another country. His Honour also referred to provisions of the Act which suggested that mere entry into port was not necessarily an importation (at 254-255).  
     
      
    63 Gibbs J referred to Wilson v Chambers & Co Pty Ltd (1926) 38 CLR 131 as authority for the proposition that goods are “imported” if they are “brought into port with the intention of being discharged there” (at 254.9) and noted (at 255.3) that it was not necessary for goods to be brought into a port but “they may be landed in some other way”. His Honour adopted the remarks of Isaacs J in Wilson v Chambers. 
     
      
    64 Stephen J (at 265) referred to the ordinary meaning of the word “import”, which his Honour said, does not extend to crossing a notional line separating the high seas from the territorial sea (at 265.8), and agreed with Gibbs J’s analysis of the authorities and the statutory context. 
     
      
    65 Mason J agreed with Gibbs J (at 273). 
     
      
    66 The appellant’s reliance on the judgment of Barwick CJ was somewhat misplaced. It is clear that the principal judgment in The Queen v Bull is that of Gibbs J. 
     
      
    67 The reasoning in that case is not directly applicable to the present case. The case was concerned with when the act of ‘importation’ commences, rather than when it concludes. Nevertheless, the reasoning does purport to define the concept for purposes of the specific statutory regime under consideration. 
     
      
    68 In Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Granite Arms Pty Ltd [2005] HCA 51; (2005) 222 CLR 149 the High Court was concerned with reg 4F of the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations 1956 (Cth) which prohibited the importation of a firearm unless certain requirements were met, relevantly that the “importer” held a particular licence or authorisation. A company agreed to act as the consignee of the shipment even though, after arrival, property in the firearms passed to another person who did not hold such a licence or authorisation. 
     
      
    69 The issue turned on the meaning of the term “the importer”. Reliance was placed in submissions on the judgments of the High Court in The Queen v Bull and Wilson v Chambers. However, in a joint judgment the Court indicated that the words “imported” and “import” considered in those cases occurred in a context which differed from the regulation that fell to be construed. Their Honours added: 
     
      
       
        
        “[29] … The subject, scope and purpose of the Regulations is the performance by the Commonwealth of its part in the creation of a national scheme of firearms control. In this context the notion of importation, and the term ‘the importer’, look to the possession of the firearms after release for home consumption.” 
        
       
      
    70 Their Honours upheld the dissenting judgment of Kiefel J in the Full Federal Court (Chief Executive Officer of Customs v Granite Arms Pty Ltd [2004] FCAFC 81; (2004) 136 FCR 515). There her Honour set out the statutory history, context and purpose at greater length in a manner which was implicitly adopted by the High Court on appeal (at [31]-[38] and [51]). Her Honour’s conclusion was upheld by the High Court on the basis of what was “[t]he substance of what was arranged and carried out”, being that the unlicensed or unauthorised person controlled the disposition of the goods in Australia (at [33]). 
     
      
    71 Although this authority is not directly pertinent to the present case it underlines the significance of considering, as the primary focus of attention, the entire context of the legislative scheme, rather than focussing on a dictionary definition of the word “import”. 
     
      
    72 Of particular significance for present purposes is the express adoption by Gibbs J (with whom Stephen and Mason JJ agreed) in The Queen v Bull of the approach of Isaacs J in Wilson v Chambers. That case was concerned with when importation concluded. 
     
      
    73 In Wilson v Chambers goods had arrived in an Australian port for the purpose of delivery. While the ship was in port an arrangement was made by which the goods were taken over for the use of the ship. No customs entry was made with respect to those goods. Section 68 of the Customs Act required such entry for “imported goods”. The context was a fiscal context rather than a context of prohibited imports.  
     
      
    74 The reasons of Isaacs J, by reason of their adoption in The Queen v Bull, are of particular significance. The relevant passage is: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, having regard to the various sections of the Act – and needless to say the question must be solved by reference to that Act and not to other Acts – the expression  
        ‘imported goods’, in sec 68, means goods which in fact are brought from abroad into Australian territory, and in respect of which the carriage is ended or its continuity in some way in fact broken.  
        The underlying concept appears to me to be as follows: Where, within our territory, some  
        act  
        takes place with regard to goods arriving from abroad, whether in fact they are or are not dutiable or prohibited, which in the absence of some new or further arrangement for carrying them away would make the place of arrival their destination and would therefore result in the goods remaining in Australia, then they are ‘imported goods’ and it is the duty of the ‘owner’ to comply with the provisions of sec 68.” (at 139) 
        
       
      
    75 Isaacs J went on to note that the contract of carriage was completed when the ship arrived in an Australian port. The arrangement between the parties, under which the shipowner would acquire the goods for the purposes of the ship, meant that it was an “unnecessary formalit[y]” to require actual delivery by shipowner to consignee and redelivery by consignee to shipowner. However, his Honour held that, for Customs purposes, such “formal processes” must be taken “as having in substance taken place” (at 140). The goods were, accordingly, “imported” within s 68 of the Customs Act. 
     
      
    76 To apply this reasoning to the appellant’s submissions in the present case, subject of course to consideration of the overall statutory regime, once the container containing the packages was landed in Australia for the purpose of clearance through Customs, or alternatively after clearance, “the carriage is ended or its continuity … broken” and the landing is an “act” which “takes place with regard to goods arriving from abroad … which … would make the place of arrival their destination and would therefore result in the goods remaining in Australia”. This analysis, as adopted by the majority in The Queen v Bull, is not the same as other statements in Wilson v Chambers which were not adopted (see at 136 per Knox CJ and at 150 per Starke J). 
     
      
    77 The issue for present purposes is to identify the point at which, to use the terminology of Isaacs J in Wilson v Chambers, “the carriage is ended or its continuity … broken” and to identify “the place of arrival” which constitutes “their destination and would therefore result in the goods remaining in Australia”. 
     
      
    78 The factual analysis in which Isaacs J engaged in Wilson v Chambers was based on the proposition that, as a matter of substance, there had been a delivery by the shipowner to the consignee and a redelivery by the consignee to the shipowner. The equivalent issue in the present case is what constituted delivery to the consignee, ie did it occur upon landing, clearance through Customs, release from the point of clearance or arrival at the first point in Australia which can answer the description of a “destination”, ie the premises at Leichhardt, or, as the Crown contends, when delivered to the wholesalers. 
     
      
    79 There is much to be said for the proposition that it is the release after clearance through Customs that would “result in the goods remaining in Australia” and that that was the relevant “act” taking place “with regard to goods arriving from abroad” that had that consequence. If so, this occurred before the opening of the container which is the point at which the Crown’s alternative case arises.  
     
      
    80 In a case where there was no clearance through Customs, but an act of smuggling to an isolated location, Kellam J applied the reasoning in The Queen v Bull to conclude that importation occurred when drugs were landed on the beach (see R v Lam (No 7) [2005] VSC 7; (2005) 191 FLR 254 at [13]). This result is consistent with the approach of Isaacs J in Wilson v Chambers. 
     
      
    81 This line of authority does support the appellant’s contention. However, s 233B of the Customs Act appeared in a radically different statutory context to that in which s 307.11 of the Code exists. Although helpful, these cases are not determinative.  
     
      
       
      The “Importation” Case Law 
       
      
    82 In support of the proposition that the meaning of “imports” in s 307.11 of the Code extends beyond the period of goods being landed in Australia the Crown relied on a series of cases for the offence of being “knowingly concerned in [an] importation”. The respondent Crown submitted that there is no difference between “imports” in s 233(1)(b) (and s 307.11 of the Code) and “importation” in s 233(1)(d).  
     
      
    83 The cases were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54 at [75]-[80] and [106]-[121] culminating in his Honour’s conclusion that the relevant offence provision adopted: 
     
      
       
        
        “[121] … the extended concept involved in the process of importation which includes recovery of the goods after landing and anything which is done having a direct proximity to the bringing of the goods into the country, and making them available including their clearance and transfer into storage, unpacking, and arranging for payment of those involved in the process …” 
        
       
      
    84 The offence was created by s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act, which provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “233B(1) Any person who: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or is in any way knowingly concerned in, the importation, or bringing, into Australia of any prohibited imports to which this section applies 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        shall be guilty of an offence.” 
        
       
      
    85 In this Court the Crown contended that the concept of “importation” in this section was identical to the concept of “imports” in both s 233B(1)(b) of that Act, set out above, and also, relevantly for present purposes, to the meaning of the word “imports” in s 307.11(1)(a) of the Code. 
     
      
    86 The line of authority on which the Crown relies emphasises that there is a “measure of flexibility” in the word “importation”. However, those cases, generally, focused primarily on the further flexibility involved in the words “concerned in” (see eg R v Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R 402 at 404-405). 
     
      
    87 Significantly, there are statements in this line of authority which suggest that the word “importation” in the statute must be understood as extending before and after the scope of the word “imports”. 
     
      
    88 The origin of this line of authority is Forbes v Traders Finance Corporation Ltd (1971) 126 CLR 429 which was concerned with the forfeiture of a vehicle pursuant to s 229(j) of the Customs Act that permitted forfeiture of “[a]ny carriage … used in … the unlawful importation … of any goods”. On the facts, the prohibited imports had been cleared through Customs and placed in a vehicle. The offenders were apprehended before driving away. One issue was whether or not the “unlawful importation” had concluded prior to the act of placing the goods in the vehicle.  
     
      
    89 Barwick CJ clearly distinguished between the word “import” and the word “importation”. He stated at 432: 
     
      
       
        
        “… ‘importation’ extends on both sides of  
        the actual act of importing goods  
        into the country. The importation does not cease  
        at the moment of an import 
        .” (emphasis added).  
        
       
      
    90 The judgment of Windeyer J contained a similar distinction. His Honour referred to Wilson v Chambers supra but distinguished it: 
     
      
       
        
        “Here the question is not when goods lawfully brought in are imported so as to be dutiable. It is what amounts to the use of a thing in an unlawful importation,  
        a very different matter 
        .” (at 444; emphasis added).  
        
       
      
    91 His Honour went on to say that the reference to “use in the unlawful importation” must: 
     
      
       
        
        “… refer to some use of it that is incidental and proximate to, or involved in the course of the illegal process … [a]n unlawful importation is, as I see it as a process, not at an end immediately the illicit goods are put on land. It can begin before they are put aboard the craft by which they are landed, and continue after it has made a landfall”. (at 445) 
        
       
      
    92 Although his Honour referred to the phrase “made a landfall” rather than the word “import” in this passage, in my opinion, his Honour’s reasoning would apply to the word “import”. 
     
      
    93 In Forbes Owen J agreed with the result, but expressed no opinion on when an “importation” is completed (see at 447). His Honour determined the case on an alternative basis. 
     
      
    94 Both Menzies J (at 435-436) and Gibbs J (at 447-448) were in dissent in the result and both gave reasons for concluding that the importation had been completed prior to the prohibited goods being placed in the vehicle. Menzies J identified the point of importation to be complete “at the latest”, when the goods were picked up and taken from the customs hall (at 435.9). 
     
      
    95 In The Queen v Bull at 223 Barwick CJ said, with reference to Forbes: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The process of importation as distinct from the act of importation 
         is not confined to what occurs at the actual time or place when or where the goods are imported.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    96 In R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49, this Court, in a joint judgment, rejected the contention that “importation” for the purposes of s 233B(1)(d) terminates upon the landing of goods. In the course of the Court’s reasons a distinction was drawn between “imported” and “importation”. The Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a section addressed simply to the act of landing would … fail to achieve the plain objective of preventing importation by attacking those within Australia who become concerned in arranging the act of importation and in moving the goods,  
        once imported 
        , 
          
        into the community where they do their mischief.” (at 63; emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    97 The Court then quoted the passage from Barwick CJ in Forbes. The Court subsequently said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the language of the  
        Customs Act  
        will [not] follow the goods  
        once they are imported 
        , without limitation as to time and place. A time will be reached when involvement with them in their passage through the Australian community cannot properly be characterised as knowing concern in their ‘importation’.” (at 64; emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    98 It is clear from the whole of the judgment in Courtney-Smith that the Court regarded the word “importation” as extending to a process, not to an act occurring at a point of time, whereas “import” is of the latter character.  
     
      
    99 This differentiation was also made express in the reasons of Gleeson CJ in R v Leff (1996) 86 A Crim R 212, when his Honour referred to the concept of “importation” and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… importation is a process, or a venture, not a physical act which occurs or ceases  
        at the moment of import 
        .” (at 214; emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      (See also at 222-223 per James J.) 
       
      
    100 The reasoning in Calderwood v R [2007] NSWCCA 180; (2007) 172 A Crim R 208 uses the terminology of “importing” as equivalent to “importation”, as explained in this line of authority (see eg at [12]). The case was, however, concerned with s 233(1)(b) of the Customs Act and not s 307.11 of the Code. The word “importing” is not used in s 307.11. 
     
      
    101 The authorities on the word “importation”, on which the respondent primarily relied in the present proceedings, are of little assistance for the purpose of interpreting the word “imports” in s 307.11(1)(a) of the Code. This is particularly so because the immediate context of s 233B(1)(d) incorporates the expansive concept of “knowingly concerned” (see Lam 46 A Crim R at 405; R v Cheung (1997) 97 A Crim R 283 esp at 288-292). 
     
      
    102 Indeed, although the judgments do contain references to the meaning of “importation” as something that occurs over a period before and after an act referred to by the word “import”, it appears to me that the word “importation” may have received that expansive interpretation because of its immediate textual context. The expansive intention of the formulation “aids, abets, counsels, or procures, or is in any way knowingly concerned in” gives the word “importation” a colour it may not receive in a different context. 
     
      
       
      The Context of s 307.11 
       
      
    103 In Courtney-Smith this Court referred to the scope and purpose of the legislative scheme, in order to give the word “importation” a broad rather than a narrow interpretation. The joint judgment said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The relevant provisions of the  
        Customs Act  
        were enacted to give effect to the  
        Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs  
        1961. Its clear purpose is to strike at the illicit traffic in narcotic drugs and their penetration of the Australian society. Because Australia is an island, that penetration will normally occur through importation of such drugs. Therefore, a section addressed simply to the act of landing would … fail to achieve the plain objective of preventing importation by taking those within Australia who become concerned in arranging the act of importation and in moving the goods, once imported, into the community where they do their mischief.” (at 63) 
        
       
      
    104 Similar considerations apply to the interpretation of the word “imports” in s 307.11(1)(a) of the Code. Section 307.11 appears in Ch 9 of the Code which is entitled “Dangers to the community”, of which Pt 9.1 is entitled “Serious drug offences”. The division in which it appears is headed “Import-export offences”. 
     
      
    105 The first section in Ch 9 and Pt 9.1 states, in terms which invoke the passage in Courtney-Smithquoted above: 
     
      
       
        
        “300.1(1) The purpose of this Part is to create offences relating to drug trafficking and to give effect to the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, done at Vienna on 20 December 1988.” 
        
       
      
    106 This UN Convention emphasises the international dimensions of the drug trade and, in a recital, recognised the need to reinforce and supplement the measures provided in the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1961, being the convention referred to by this Court in Courtney-Smith. The scope and purpose of Pt 9.1 of the Code is clearly of the same character as that identified by this Court in Courtney-Smith as quoted above.  
     
      
    107 It is relevant to note that the Commonwealth Parliament in formulating s 233B invoked its constitutional authority over external trade and commerce. The entire focus of the section was on imports, and subsequently upon exports, both in terms of the statement of the relevant offence directly relating to the act of importing and also the creation of offences with respect to possession etc of “prohibited imports”.  
     
      
    108 Part 9.1 of the Code is not so restricted. Criminal offences are established by this Commonwealth statute for: 
     
      
    · Trafficking controlled drugs (Div 302). 
     
      
    · Commercial cultivation of controlled plants (Div 303). 
     
      
    · Selling controlled plants (Div 304). 
     
      
    · Commercial manufacture of controlled drugs (Div 305). 
     
      
    · Pre-trafficking controlled precursors (Div 306). 
     
      
    · Import-export offences (Div 307). 
     
      
    · Possession offences (Div 308). 
     
      
    · Drug offences involving children, including supplying drugs and procuring children to traffic in drugs (Div 309). 
     
      
    · Harm and danger to children from serious drug offences (Div 310). 
     
      
    · Combining quantities of drugs, plants or precursors (Div 311). 
     
      
    109 As can be seen the scope of the legislative scheme goes well beyond anything contained in former s 233B at the times when that section was interpreted in the case law upon which the parties rely. Significantly, the Customs context of s 233B, relied upon in The Queen v Bull, has been replaced by a criminal context, specifically with respect to serious drugs. 
     
      
    110 In this new context, there is no need to interpret the words “import” and “export” in a broad manner in order to serve the overall purpose, by reason of the scope and range of the different acts for which persons involved with drugs are made criminally liable under this Commonwealth legislation. 
     
      
    111 Part 9.1 finds its origin in the Report of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, Model Criminal Code: Chapter 6 – Serious Drug Offences, October 1998. This particular product of the Model Criminal Code Project was originally put forward as a Model Code for all States and Territories. The idea was that there would be a single Criminal Code for the whole of Australia and that serious drug offences would be covered comprehensively by interconnecting Commonwealth and State legislation. That objective is reflected in s 300.4 of the Code which expressly provides that Pt 9.1 is not intended to exclude or limit the concurrent operation of any law of a State or Territory. In constitutional terms the Commonwealth has expressly abjured any intention to cover the field. 
     
      
    112 The report of the Model Code Criminal Officers Committee proposed uniform legislation throughout Australia with respect to trafficking in controlled drugs, the commercial manufacture and cultivation of controlled drugs and plants and drug offences involving children. Nothing in the Report replicated the Commonwealth regulation of imports. Accordingly, although much of the content of what is now Pt 9.1 of the Code finds its origin in the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee Report, the Commonwealth Parliament has engrafted express provision for export and import offences onto the recommended national Model Code. 
     
      
    113 Chapter 9 was introduced into the Code by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Serious Drug Offences and Other Measures) Act 2005 (Cth). The Second Reading Speech for the Bill made it clear that one of the objectives of the legislation was the promotion of uniformity of drug laws throughout Australia, by implementing model drug offences (see Commonwealth, Parliamentary Debates, House of Representatives, 26 May 2005, at 6-7). 
     
      
    114 It is by no means clear what is the constitutional basis for the Commonwealth Parliament enacting some of the specific offences. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth’s long standing legislative regime with respect to imports was engrafted upon the proposed national model for drug offences.  
     
      
    115 The Explanatory Memorandum for the Bill stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The import and export offences in proposed Division 307 are based on the existing offences in the  
        Customs Act 
        . The other offences are based on Chapter 6 of the Model Criminal Code … developed in 1998 by the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General … after nation wide consultation.” (at 1) 
        
       
      
    116 The Explanatory Memorandum went on to state: 
     
      
       
        
        “Whilst there is significant overlap between the import-export offences in proposed Division 307 and other offences in proposed Part 9.1, there are also significant differences. The proposed Division 307 offences have been designed to accord as closely as possible to the offences they are replacing in the Customs Act. A guiding principle has been to ensure that the offences in proposed Division 307 are no more difficult to prove than the existing offences in the Customs Act. For that reason, commercial intention is not an element of any of the proposed Division 307 offences. Instead, absence of a commercial intention is available as a defence for some proposed Division 307 offences in a manner that reflects the current operation of the Customs Act offences.” (at 46) 
        
       
      
    117 Notwithstanding the reference to the new offences ‘according closely’ with offences within the Customs Act, the form of the offence established by the Code provision is expressed only in terms of the word “imports”. The use of the terminology of “importation”, formerly found in s 233B(1)(d), is absent. 
     
      
    118 Section 233B(1)(d) was repealed when the Commonwealth Parliament first applied the Commonwealth Criminal Code to drug offences by the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment (Application of Criminal Code) Act 2001 (Cth). That Act applied the then extant Criminal Code to a wide range of Commonwealth offences including, by Sch 21, all offences under the Customs Act. Clause 108 of that Schedule repealed s 233B(1)(d). 
     
      
    119 The 2001 Act also made substantial changes to the Crimes Act. Clause 4 of Sch 10 applied Ch 2 of the Code to all offences against the Crimes Act. Further cl 4 of Sch 51 repealed s 5 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    120 Section 11.2(1) of the Code, so applied, extends liability to a person who “aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence”. The element previously found in s 5 of the Crimes Act of imposing liability for a person “knowingly concerned in or party to the commission of any offence” was removed.  
     
      
    121 This change was based on the recommendation of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee in its report entitled Model Criminal Code: Chapter 2 – General Principles of Criminal Responsibility, December 1992, in which the Committee said at 87: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Code retains the traditional formula of ‘aid, abet, counsel and procure’ … The Committee preferred the traditional formula to the … formula of being ‘knowingly involved’ in the commission of an offence. The Committee concluded that such a formula would add little in substance. Moreover it is much more open ended than the traditional formula. This means that it is less certain than is appropriate for a general provision defining the ambit of criminal responsibility in any Code.” 
        
       
      
    122 It is clear from these observations that it was the intention of the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, in proposals adopted by the Parliament, to restrict the scope of the pre-existing accessorial liability provisions by making them less “open ended”. That was done in part by replacing s 5 of the Crimes Act by s 11.2 of the Code. Consistently with this objective it appears that the drafter of the Act decided to remove any other reference to ‘knowing involvement’ in the commission of an offence to which the Code would now be applied. Accordingly, pre-existing s 233B(1)(d), upon which Commonwealth prosecutions had relied to a substantial degree in the past, was removed. 
     
      
    123 The effect of this is that the Commonwealth offence now uses the word “imports” and there is no offence in which the word “importation”, which has been given a broader connotation, appears. This is why the case law on which the Crown relies, and which Berman DCJ applied, is of little assistance.  
     
      
    124 There is one aspect of the immediate textual context which is of some assistance. The respective provisions of Div 307 of Pt 9.1 of the Code, including relevantly s 307.11, each use the formula that a person commits an offence if “the person imports or exports a substance”. This formulation appears to equate the concept of “imports” with “exports”. It focuses attention on crossing the national border, rather than upon arrival at a destination. The concept of exporting is clearly not concerned with arrival at a foreign destination in any manner. This is a textual indicator which tends to support the appellant’s case that what the legislature has rendered criminal is the act of arrival in Australia, without regard to subsequent deployment.  
     
      
       
      The Meaning of “Imports” 
       
      
    125 I have found it difficult to balance these disparate considerations. Nevertheless, the reasoning in The Queen v Bull, albeit with respect to a different statutory context, is more closely applicable than any other case law. I refer particularly to the adoption of the reasoning of Isaacs J in Wilson v Chambers. 
     
      
    126 The new statutory context of a criminal code dealing with a wide range of drug offences suggests that a precise, rather than expansive, sense of the word “imports” has been adopted. 
     
      
    127 Generally, that is how one would approach the interpretation of any criminal statute. 
     
      
    128 In my opinion, the purpose of the Act requires the border controlled drugs and precursors “to arrive in Australia from abroad” and to be delivered at a point which, in the words of Isaacs J in Wilson v Chambers, would “result in the goods remaining in Australia”. That occurred when the goods were picked up by the appellant’s agent or, at the latest, when the container arrived at her premises and before it was unpacked. 
     
      
    129 The Crown’s alternative case permitted the jury to convict the appellant on the basis that she formed the intention, constituting the fault element, after the physical element had been completed. This was impermissible. 
     
      
    130 Since writing the above I have read the judgment of Weinberg AJA in draft. I agree with his Honour's reasons. 
     
      
    131 The appeal should be allowed. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    132 The appellant submitted that if she succeeded in the appeal, the Court should not order a retrial but rather direct a verdict of acquittal. The appellant submitted that the Crown case on the issue of intention to export the extra boxes, once stripped of the impermissible reasoning left to the jury, was insufficient to justify a conviction. I do not agree with that submission. 
     
      
    133 There was evidence before the jury that could justify a conclusion that the appellant was a participant in a joint enterprise to import the goods, when the word “imports” is understood in the sense I have identified. There was clear evidence that before the container landed she expected this particular shipment to contain additional packages. The jury was not obliged to accept the appellant’s evidence that she took steps to stop the addition of packages to her shipments of furniture. Further, it was open to the jury to infer, particularly from the telephone intercepts in which she expressed relief that there would be no interception, and her subsequent communications with Mr Rantesalu, that she had the requisite degree of involvement in the joint enterprise to import the substances. 
     
      
    134 The Court indicated that it did not wish to call on the appellant as respondent to the Crown appeal. She has served a substantial proportion of her sentence, however, I would not exercise the Court’s discretion to refrain from ordering a new trial. Many of the subjective considerations which Berman DCJ took into account in imposing a very light sentence for such an offence indicate that, in such a case, particularly from the perspective of general deterrence and denunciation, the conviction itself, rather than the length of term, is a significant consideration.  
     
      
    135 In my opinion, this Court should allow the conviction appeal, but remit the matter for a new trial. 
     
      
    136 WEINBERG AJA: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft, the reasons for judgment prepared by Spigelman CJ. I agree with those reasons and with the orders proposed. I wish, however, to add some observations of my own. 
     
      
    137 It was common ground between the parties to this appeal that the physical and fault elements of an offence under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) must coincide in time. That view accords with the common law. See generally Thabo Meli v R [1954] 1 All ER 373 and R v Church [1966] 1 QB 59. The question is whether, in the circumstances of this case, that requirement has, in fact, been met.  
     
      
    138 In determining the meaning to be accorded to the term ‘imports’ in s 307.11(1)(a) of the Code, the starting point must, of course, be the text itself. However, the text is not confined to individual words, phrases or sentences considered in isolation from their context: CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1997) 187 CLR 384 at 408. The text must also be read, in accordance with s 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (Cth), with a purposive construction in mind.  
     
      
    139 In ordinary parlance, to ‘import’ is to bring in something from a foreign country or some other outside source. Section 300.2 of the Code provides that ‘import’ includes ‘bring into Australia’. The word has a protean quality and is capable of being given either a broad or narrow interpretation. The Chief Justice has reviewed the authorities which bear upon the matter, and I cannot usefully add to his Honour’s analysis of the case law. I agree that the decisions which carry the greatest weight are those of the High Court in Wilson v Chambers & Co Pty Ltd (1926) 38 CLR 131 and The Queen v Bull (1974) 131 CLR 203. I also agree, however, that neither of these cases is determinative of this appeal.  
     
      
    140 The former Chief Justice of Australia, the Honourable Murray Gleeson, in his Victoria Law Foundation Oration entitled ‘The Meaning of Legislation: Context, Purpose and Respect for Fundamental Rights’ (31 July 2008), commented recently that the immediate context of a statutory provision may include the provisions which surround it and perhaps the entire Act as a whole. The wider context may also include the circumstances that prevailed at the time of its enactment, as well as the background provided by other legislation. That, with respect, is the approach that I consider should be taken to the resolution of this appeal. 
     
      
        
      
    141 In searching for the meaning to be imputed to the term ‘imports’ in s 307.11 of the Code, it may be useful to have regard to the provisions which governed the importation of narcotic drugs before that section came into effect. In doing so, however, it must be remembered that what is being interpreted is a code and not an Act of Parliament. This means that special rules of interpretation are applicable. The language of the Code should be construed according to its natural meaning and without any presumption that it was intended to do no more than restate the existing law. See Bank of England v Vagliano Brothers [1891] AC 107; Brennan v The King (1936) 55 CLR 253 at 263 per Dixon and Evatt JJ; and Vallance v The Queen (1961) 108 CLR 56 at 74-6 per Windeyer J.  
     
      
    142 As a matter of ordinary usage of language, the term ‘imports’ seems to have implicit within it the idea of both a beginning and an end. The same is true of the term ‘exports’, which appears immediately adjacent to ‘imports’ in s 307.11(1)(a). The High Court in Bull determined the point at which the act of importing commences. A person does not import goods until they are either landed in this country or brought within a port for the purpose of being so landed. The case was silent, however, as to when the act of importing ends.  
     
      
    143 In Wilson v Chambers, Isaacs J addressed that very issue. His Honour postulated that imported goods meant goods that were in fact brought from abroad into Australian territory and, in respect of which, the carriage was ended or its continuity had in some way in fact been broken. See also R v Hancox [1989] 3 NZLR 60 at 62.  
     
      
    144 In the context of this appeal, if the Crown’s contention that an importation continues until the goods reach their ‘final destination’ (an expression of some indeterminacy) were to be accepted, a person could be guilty of importing prohibited drugs by doing an act far removed from the actual landing of the drugs in this country. That act could take place weeks, months or even years after the drugs had been brought into Australia. Such a wide notion of the word would not accord with ordinary usage of language and would be foreign to most people’s understanding of that term. In addition, an interpretation of such breadth would not sit well with the approach normally taken to the construction of penal statutes: Beckwith v The Queen (1976) 135 CLR 569 at 576.  
     
      
    145 It is true that there are a number of cases which have held that the process of importation extends well beyond the period of the goods being landed in this country. These include the cases to which the Chief Justice has referred in his reasons for judgment: R v Lam (1990) 46 A Crim R 402; R v Courtney-Smith (No 2) (1990) 48 A Crim R 49; R v Cheung (1997) 97 A Crim R 283; R v Sukkar [2005] NSWCCA 54; and Calderwood v R (2007) 172 A Crim R 208. There are others as well. 
     
      
    146 One such example is Doney v The Queen (1990) 171 CLR 207. There the High Court upheld a conviction of being knowingly concerned in the importation of cannabis resin. The case concerned a note said to be in the handwriting of the applicant, which had been given to a taxi driver some four weeks after a shipping container containing cannabis resin arrived in Australia. The note required the taxi driver to collect some boxes from an address at which the container was located, take them to a panel van in Balmain, and leave them there. It was accepted as being corroborative evidence of an accomplice as to the applicant’s involvement in the importation.  
     
      
        
      
    147 In a joint judgment, the Court observed at 210: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was argued that the handwritten note could not corroborate the evidence of Freeman because, although it linked the applicant to the contents of the container, it did so only at a time when the importation was complete. The note, it was said, was consistent with his involvement in the distribution of the cannabis resin but it did not implicate him in the offence charged, namely importation.”  
        
       
      
    148 In the course of rejecting that submission, the Court said at 212: 
     
      
       
        
        “The note given to the taxi driver, if accepted by the jury as having been written by the applicant, connected him with the cannabis resin imported into the country some few weeks earlier. The note and its employment in the transaction with the taxi driver might be capable of explanation on some basis other than its author was knowingly concerned in the importation of the cannabis resin. But, given that it was only a matter of some few weeks since the container had been landed in Sydney, it was open to the jury to reason that it was likely, although not inevitable, that the person who wrote the note, thus exercising dominion over the boxes from the container by directing the removal of some of them to some other place, was a person who had been knowingly concerned in the importation of its contents.” 
        
       
      
    149 Doney is instructive because the evidence against the accused, taken at its highest, did not disclose any involvement on his part in the importation until long after the container had been landed in Sydney. The accomplice gave evidence that Doney had asked him to arrange customs clearance. However, that was well after the goods had been released to shipping agents. It was hardly surprising, in those circumstances, that Doney was charged not with having imported the drugs but rather with having been knowingly concerned in their importation. 
     
      
    150 There are other examples of an extended meaning being accorded to the notion of importation in the context of the offence of being knowingly concerned. In R v Shin Nan Yong (1975) 7 ALR 271, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal held that a conviction for the offence of being knowingly concerned did not depend upon a conviction for the principal offence of importing, although the act of importation had to be proved as an element of the offence. The Court said that it was not essential that the concern in the importation be made ‘manifest in a physical sense’ whilst the importation was in progress. It was sufficient if the concern was manifested in ‘the venture which centres upon the importation’. 
     
      
    151 In D Sweeney and N Williams, Commonwealth Criminal Law (1990), the authors observe at 210: 
     
      
       
        
        “Concern in an importation may be manifested by a person travelling with the actual importer, by actions before the importation directed to arranging the importation, such as arranging travel of the courier, or meeting the importer in Australia when the narcotic goods have been landed with an intent to deal with them in some way. Although the Court in  
        Shin Nan Yong 
        ’s case used the term ‘the venture which centres upon the importation’ it is likely that the concern, or involvement, cannot be too remote from the importation; however, it would be false to say that conduct showing concern in the importation cannot occur once the importation is complete.” 
        
       
      
    152 This brings me to the significance of the fact that the offence of being knowingly concerned in the importation of prohibited imports no longer exists under the Code. 
     
      
    153 The Chief Justice, in his reasons for judgment, has summarised the history behind the decision to omit ‘knowingly concerned’ from the provisions dealing with the importation of narcotic substances. As his Honour notes, s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) was repealed in 2001 when the Code was first applied to drug offences.  
     
      
    154 Section 11.2(1) of the Code, so applied, extends liability to a person who ‘aids, abets, counsels or procures the commission of an offence by another person’. An aider or abettor, or counsellor or procurer, is taken to have committed the primary offence and is punished accordingly. However, liability as an accomplice is derivative in the sense that it depends on proof that another person or persons combined with the defendant to commit the offence. Unlike other ancillary offences such as attempt, incitement and conspiracy, complicity as an aider or abettor is not an independent offence.  
     
      
    155 Although s 11.2(1) is part of a code, the language employed is technical and essentially the same as that used at common law. The words are plainly intended to bear the same meaning as they do at common law.  
     
      
    156 The further extended form of accessorial liability that derived from ‘knowingly concerned’ was deliberately omitted from the Code because those who drafted the relevant provisions believed that this form of derivative liability was unnecessary. They considered that ‘knowingly concerned’ added nothing to complicity and common purpose as defined in s 11.2.  
     
      
    157 In that regard, the drafters of the Code differed from the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law, a committee chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs, which in July 1990 presented its third interim report entitled ‘Principles of Criminal Responsibility and Other Matters’. In that report, the committee gave careful consideration to the question whether the words ‘or by any act or omission is in any way directly or indirectly knowingly concerned in or party to’ should be deleted from s 5 of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).  
     
      
    158 The Gibbs Committee observed at 214 that the words ‘knowingly concerned’ had been judicially considered on a number of occasions. It referred to R v Goldie, ex parte Picklum (1937) 59 CLR 254; Mallan v Lee (1949) 80 CLR 198; Ashbury v Reid [1961] WAR 49; R v Hussain [1969] 2 QB 567; R v Kelly (1975) 12 SASR 388; Yorke v Lucas (1985) 158 CLR 661; and Trade Practices Commission v Australia Meat Holdings Pty Ltd (1988) 83 ALR 299. It regarded these decisions as having established that the act or omission of the accused had to implicate or involve him or her in the offence. It noted that in applying these cases to s 233B(1)(d) of the Customs Act 1901, the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal had held, in R v Tannous (1987) 32 A Crim R 301 and R v Haddad (1988) 33 A Crim R 400, that the trial judges’ directions to the jury in both those cases were incorrect to the extent that it was held that ‘knowingly concerned’ meant mere ‘concern, interest or anxiety’. 
     
      
    159 Haddad may unwittingly have been the source of some of the present difficulties. In that case (at 408), Roden J posed the question, perhaps rhetorically, ‘in what circumstances would a person be knowingly concerned in an importation, so as to be guilty of the offence, other than by aiding, abetting, counselling, or procuring it?’ Plainly, his Honour had doubts as to whether ‘knowingly concerned’ added anything to ordinary principles of complicity. 
     
      
    160 Taking his cue from his Honour’s remarks, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions (in fact, myself) raised with the Gibbs Committee the question whether it was necessary to retain the words ’knowingly concerned’ in any future codification of the general principles of criminal responsibility.  
     
      
    161 The Gibbs Committee had the acuity and foresight to observe that these words had the merit of ensuring that circumstances amounting to knowing involvement in an offence, which did not amount to participation as a principal and to which the expressions ‘aid, abet, counsel or procure’ (or whatever equivalents were used) were not obviously apt, would nevertheless fall within the reach of the provision. The Committee did, however, accept (at 215) the submission that the words ‘by act or omission’, ‘in any way directly or indirectly’ and ‘or party to’ appeared to be superfluous. It also favoured replacing the word ‘concerned’ with ‘involved’ as a more apt expression.  
     
      
        
      
    162 With the benefit of hindsight, it is perhaps regrettable that the Gibbs Committee recommendations were not accepted when, in December 1992, the Criminal Law Officers Committee of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General produced its Report, ‘Chapters 1 and 2 - General Principles Of Criminal Responsibility’. That Report regarded the term ‘knowingly involved’ as adding nothing of substance to ordinary principles of complicity. It may be that those responsible for the Report were influenced, in that regard, by the views expressed in Howard’s Criminal Law (5th ed, 1990) at 318-9. The learned author of that text commented that ‘knowingly concerned’ did not seem to add anything to the scope of accessorial liability.  
     
      
    163 The drafters of the Model Criminal Code had an additional reason for rejecting the notion of ‘knowingly concerned’ as a basis for criminal liability. They regarded that expression as being too vague to be appropriate for a general provision defining the ambit of criminal responsibility in a new code. The Gibbs Committee did not share that sentiment.  
     
      
    164 In considering whether the Criminal Law Officers Committee was correct in its conclusion that it was unnecessary to retain ‘knowingly concerned’, it may be useful to go back to the origins of that expression from the time of its introduction into the Customs Act.  
     
      
    165 As enacted in 1901, s 233 of the Customs Act made it an offence to smuggle or unlawfully import any goods. Section 233B did not exist at that stage. The Customs Act was amended in 1910 by repealing s 233 in its entirety and substituting a new s 233, as well as introducing ss 233A and 233B. It was s 233B(1)(d) which, for the first time, made it an offence to be ‘in any way knowingly concerned in’ the importation into Australia of prohibited imports.  
     
      
    166 References to these new provisions in the Commonwealth Hansard of 1910 are sparse. The debates made it plain that they were intended to combat opium smuggling. However, they did not indicate whether the new offences were drawn from the criminal law of some other jurisdiction.  
     
      
    167 In fact, United Kingdom law contains a number of offences where a person will be liable for being ‘knowingly concerned’ or ‘knowingly involved’ in the commission of some other offence. See for example, the Foreign Enlistment Act 1870 (c 90) (UK). It is perhaps speculative, but the phrase ‘knowingly concerned’, as introduced in the Customs Act in 1910, may derive from that statute.  
     
      
    168 The phrase appears regularly in current United Kingdom statutes dealing with matters involving customs. See, for example, Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (c 2) (UK), ss 68, 68A, 170, and 170B.  
     
      
    169 A number of other United Kingdom statutes also contain offences where phrases such as ‘knowingly concerned’ or ‘knowingly involved’ are employed. These include the Immigration Act 1971 (c 77); Fair Trading Act 1973 (c 41); Alcoholic Liquor Duties Act 1979 (c 4); Value Added Tax Act 1994 (c 23); Financial Services and Market Act 2000 (c 8); and Tax Credits Act 2002 (c 21).  
     
      
    170 New Zealand has also adopted the phrase ‘knowingly concerned’ or ‘knowingly involved’ as the basis for accessorial liability in relation to customs offences. See, for example, the Customs and Excise Act 1996, ss 209 and 210 and the Imports and Exports (Restrictions) Act 1988, s 4. In addition, s 9 of the Secret Commissions Act 1910 uses the ‘knowingly concerned’ formula.  
     
      
    171 The expression ‘knowingly concerned’ has a lengthy pedigree in relation to trade practices law. Section 75B of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) provides that an individual may be party to a contravention by a corporation of a provision of the Act if that person is knowingly concerned in that contravention. Once again, there is a significant body of jurisprudence dealing with the expression ‘knowingly concerned’ in that context. See for example Yorke v Lucas (1985) 158 CLR 661 at 670.  
     
      
    172 In Trade Practices Commission v Australia Meat Holdings Pty Ltd, Wilcox J cited Ashbury v Reid at 51, where the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Western Australia said, in a different context: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question which a court should ask itself … is whether on the facts it can reasonably be said that the act … shown to have been done … by the defendant does in truth implicate or involve him in the offence, whether it does show a practical connection between him and the offence.” 
        
       
      
    173 The decision to omit the phrase ‘knowingly concerned’ from the various forms of complicity available under federal criminal law, and the extension of that decision to the offences now contained in the Code dealing with drugs, appears to me to have left a lacuna in the law that was certainly never intended.  
     
      
    174 As previously indicated, the Gibbs Committee foresaw the need to retain this variant of accessorial liability. In its report, it noted that Commonwealth prosecutors had frequently found the phrase a more apposite and convenient description of the offence to be charged than the remaining words of s 5 of the Crimes Act 1914. The convenience lay in the fact that charging ‘knowingly concerned’ avoided any possible question whether the offender was a principal in the second degree or an accessory before the fact, a matter that assumed importance in common law jurisdictions, though never really at the Commonwealth level. That was because s 5 had, from the time of its first enactment, applied to all Commonwealth offences, the distinction between felonies and misdemeanours never having been recognised under the Crimes Act itself.  
     
      
    175 All this goes some way towards explaining why the phrase ‘knowingly concerned’ no longer applies to offences involving the importation of drugs. It also puts the issues raised in this appeal into context.  
     
      
    176 The authorities upon which the Crown relied, in support of its submission that the word ‘import’ has the extended meaning for which it contended, are all cases that were decided under the rubric of ‘knowingly concerned’. That phrase was always attached to the term ‘importation’.  
     
      
    177 The Code now shifts from the noun ‘importation’ to the verb ‘imports’. A change of that kind can have consequences. They may be unintended. To be ‘knowingly concerned’ in an importation is to be involved in an activity that is necessarily ambulatory. To import, or to aid and abet an importer, is to engage in a more finite activity, which is part of a broader process properly characterised as the process of importation.  
     
      
    178 A person can still be ‘concerned in’ an activity which, as a matter of strictness, has concluded while not, at the same time, being ‘engaged in’ that activity. Sweeney and Williams illustrate that proposition (at 210) in their discussion of ‘knowingly concerned’, to which I have previously referred. They cite Shin Nan Yong, in which Street CJ, delivering the judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal, observed that it was by no means an essential part of the crime of being ‘knowingly concerned’ in the importation of prohibited imports that the ‘concern’ be made manifest in a physical sense whilst the importation was actually in progress. It was sufficient if that concern was manifested ‘in the venture’ which centres upon the importation. 
     
      
    179 Section 6 of the Crimes Act 1914 creates a specific offence of being an accessory after the fact. Any person who assists another who is, to his or her knowledge, guilty of any offence against a law of the Commonwealth, in order to enable him or her to escape punishment or to dispose of the proceeds of the offence, is guilty of an offence carrying a maximum of two years’ imprisonment. There will, no doubt, be cases, of which the present might on one view be an example, in which the conduct of the offender falls outside the ambit of s 307.11 but gives rise to liability as an accessory after the fact.  
     
      
    180 In the instant case, there was ample evidence upon which the jury could have convicted the appellant of importing these precursor drugs or, at the very least, aiding and abetting their importation. The jury could only have done so, however, if satisfied that the Crown had established the relevant fault element on her part prior to the act of importing having been concluded. As previously indicated, the physical and fault elements had to coincide in time.  
     
      
    181 The difficulty lies in knowing whether the jury convicted on the basis of the evidence that pointed to the appellant’s involvement in the importation while it was still ongoing, or whether they relied solely upon the Crown’s alternative case, first put forward in the prosecutor’s closing address, that she was guilty even if she only learned about the drugs when she first saw the boxes in the van. Whatever flexibility there may be built in to the verb ‘imports’ in s 307.11, having regard to the test laid down in Wilson v Chambers, the act of importing (as distinct from the broader venture which centred upon the importation) had, in my view, well and truly concluded by the Saturday when the appellant actually saw those boxes. To use the language of Isaacs J, by that stage, the carriage had ended or, at the very least, its continuity had been broken. That makes it impossible to allow this conviction to stand. There should be a new trial.  
     
      
    182 It is unnecessary in these circumstances to consider the appellant’s second ground of appeal, which complains of the introduction by the prosecutor in his closing address of the alternative basis upon which the appellant might be convicted. See generally King v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 423. Even if that ground were established, it would still be appropriate, in my view, to order that a new trial be had. There is no proper basis for entering a verdict of acquittal.  
     
      
    183 SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by the Chief Justice and with his reasons therefor. I also agree with the additional observations of Weinberg AJA.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: By Amended Summons filed 21 July 2008, the Plaintiff, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), seeks relief arising from the dismissal at Ryde Local Court on 23 January 2008 by the Second Defendant, Magistrate O’Shane, of a charge of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm against the First Defendant, Kim Soon Yeo. 
     
      
    2 The Plaintiff appeals under s.56(1)(c) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 alleging error of law on the part of the Second Defendant and, in the alternative, seeks prerogative relief upon the basis that the Second Defendant fell into jurisdictional error and denied the prosecutor procedural fairness. 
     
      
       
      Hearing in the Local Court 
       
      
    3 On 23 January 2008, the First Defendant appeared, represented by a solicitor, in response to a Court Attendance Notice first returnable on that day which alleged the offence of negligent driving occasioning grievous bodily harm contrary to s.42 (1)(b) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. The maximum penalty for that offence is a fine of 20 penalty units or imprisonment for nine months or both (in the case of a first offence). 
     
      
    4 The First Defendant’s solicitor, Mr Nixon, entered a plea of guilty and, in accordance with usual practice, a Statement of Facts was handed to the Second Defendant. 
     
      
    5 The Statement of Facts revealed that, at approximately 6.15 pm on Saturday, 4 August 2007, the First Defendant was driving his vehicle west on Terry Road, Eastwood. At the same time, Graham Lade was riding his bicycle east on Terry Road. At the intersection of Terry Road and Valley Road, a T-intersection, the First Defendant slowed to make a right turn into Valley Road. He proceeded into the eastbound lane of Terry Road at a speed of about 10-20 kph and collided with the front wheel of Mr Lade’s bicycle, causing Mr Lade to be propelled from his seat into the air and thrown about five to eight metres forward in an easterly direction, where he landed heavily on the grassed nature strip on the north-eastern corner of the intersection. The bicycle was propelled a further five metres east landing about 10-15 metres east of the point of impact. The First Defendant immediately stopped his vehicle in Valley Road and attended to Mr Lade. Damage to the First Defendant’s vehicle was minor, with dents in the front bonnet and bumper/registration plate area.  
     
      
    6 Police attended and the First Defendant was subjected to a roadside breath test which was negative. In response to questions by police, the First Defendant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I came to the intersection of Valley Road and slowed down ready to make my right turn. I did not see any cars or anything else and so I started to turn. All of a sudden I see something fly up into the air. I turned into Valley Road and stopped straight away and ran over to see a male lying on the corner on the nature strip.” 
        
       
      
    7 He told police that he was driving at a “slow speed, about 10-20 kph” when he was turning right. He told police that he did not see any safety lights or reflective indicators coming towards him prior to the collision.  
     
      
    8 At the time of the collision, the road surface was dry-sealed bitumen and traffic was light. The weather was overcast, it was night time and the street lighting was illuminated.  
     
      
    9 The First Defendant was 51 years old at the time of the collision and had been driving in New South Wales since 1988. 
     
      
    10 Following the collision, Mr Lade was treated at the scene and then conveyed to Westmead Hospital for treatment. Injuries sustained by him in the collision included a right proximal humeral fracture, intra-articular head split type (right shoulder fracture), a segmental fracture of the clavicle (broken collar bone), right rib fractures, cup and ball joint fracture, left knee lacerations requiring stitches and grazes to his buttocks and right hand. He underwent surgery on 8 August 2007 to intra-operatively stabilise the fracture with three screws. Following this treatment, Mr Lade required extensive physiotherapy and ongoing rehabilitation.  
     
      
    11 All that I have said in [5]-[10] above has been drawn from the Statement of Facts handed to her Honour following the entry of the plea of guilty on 23 January 2008. It was common ground before me, as is obvious, that Mr Lade had the right of way so that the First Defendant was required to give way to him. 
     
      
    12 After being handed the Statement of Facts, the following exchange took place between her Honour and the prosecutor (T1-2, 23 January 2008): 
     
      
       
        
        “HER HONOUR: I will just take a short time to read these documents. I have a difficulty with these facts, Sergeant. The fact that the present accused collided with the - was it a motor cycle or a bicycle? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Bicycle. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Is not of itself evidence of negligence. Where was the - there is nothing in these facts to say what direction the bicycle was travelling in, where it was in the roadway, there’s just nothing here. I’m looking for it and I can’t see it, unless I’ve missed something altogether. 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, perhaps the matter might be put over so I can have the facts amended again to include that information. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Do you have the information. If the information isn’t contained in the facts then that’s it. After all, when did this - this happened - it is alleged the incident occurred on 4 August which is, let’s face it, five months ago. Actually, it is almost six months ago.  
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: The police referred the matter to the Serious Motor Vehicle Collision protocol and were waiting for a response. They only..  
        [not transcribable]  
        .. and they are still waiting for medical reports.  
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Well that’s not good enough, is it. If this is the return date and the Defendant has an option of pleading guilty then the matter has to be ready to proceed on a full account of what occurred. There is nothing in these facts to suggest negligence. With a matter of negligence it is not a situation of res ipsa loquitur, the facts speak for itself, it isn’t. On the facts, this information should simply be dismissed out of hand, that’s it.  
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I can only ask for an adjournment to enable the Prosecution to amend the facts.  
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Is the prosecution going to be capable of amending the facts? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: I believe so your Honour, I have a brief of evidence here but . 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: You have a brief of evidence there? You are entitled to hand up statements on a plea of guilty but I just don’t know why a plea of guilty is being entered, I have to say, Mr Nixon. The facts simply do not disclose an offence of negligence. As I said, the fact that there was a collision is not, of itself, evidence of negligent driving. I have read the statement made by the driver at the time. The weather was overcast but the road surface was dry, traffic was light, it was night-time, street lighting was illuminated, which doesn’t really tell us anything very much at all. 
        
       
       
        
        NIXON: As I understand, there was a light fitted to the bike which wasn’t on. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: It wasn’t on, on your instructions? 
        
       
       
        
        NIXON: On my instructions. My client tells me that the first he knew that he had hit anything … 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: I’ve read the facts do you have something further to hand up to me, Sergeant? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: Your Honour, I can hand up the cyclist’s statement.  
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Do you have anything further from the informant than what’s contained in the facts? 
        
       
       
        
        PROSECUTOR: The statement from the cyclist certainly indicates further information other than what’s contained in the facts. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: That doesn’t actually tell me anything either, does it? His account is from his point of view and is, essentially, the same account as the driver tells from his point of view. No. If that’s as high as it goes then it’s not good enough. 
        
       
       
        
        THE INFORMATION IS DISMISSED. 
        
       
       
        
        He is free to go.” 
        
       
      
    13 What appears in the preceding paragraph represents the entirety of what took place following the entry of the plea of guilty before the Second Defendant. The bench sheet which is in evidence (Annexure A, affidavit of RV Paul, 7 April 2008) records that a plea of guilty was entered and that the matter was “dismissed”. No other order is noted whereby the plea of guilty was rejected or withdrawn. 
     
      
       
      Submissions of the Parties 
       
      
    14 Mr Bourke, counsel for the Plaintiff, submitted that a number of errors of law had been demonstrated in this case: 
     
      
       
      (a) there was no basis in law for the Second Defendant to have found, effectively, that there was no prima facie case of negligence - such a finding was contrary to the plea of guilty which constituted an admission of the elements of the offence and the matters contained in the Statement of Facts; 
       
       
      (b) if the Second Defendant did not accept the plea of guilty, such a finding ought to have been recorded, a plea of not guilty entered and the proceedings adjourned for hearing at a later date: ss.190, 193(2), 194, 195, 202  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
      ; 
       
       
      (c) in proceeding as she did, the Second Defendant had acted contrary to the statutory scheme contained in Division 3, Part 4 of Chapter 4  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986  
      (ss.190-210), which contained the appropriate steps required by law with respect to a summary hearing in the Local Court; 
       
       
      (d) if her Honour intended to entertain an application by the First Defendant for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty, it was necessary for the Court to proceed in accordance with the principles laid down in  
      Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions  
      (2005) 155 A Crim R 37 - her Honour did not comply with the law in this respect; 
       
       
      (e) in refusing the prosecution application for adjournment, the Second Defendant failed to comply with the requirements of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
      , including s.202, thereby denying the prosecutor procedural fairness:  
      Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald  
      [2004] NSWSC 182; 
       
       
      (f) finally, in purporting to dismiss the charge, the Second Defendant failed to give reasons as required by law for this determination: s.202  
      Criminal Procedure Act 1986 
      ;  
      Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited  
      (2006) 67 NSWLR 402 at 408 [19]. 
       
      
    15 Mr Bourke submitted that it appeared that the Second Defendant had either misread or misunderstood the evidence tendered by consent on the plea of guilty, given her initial queries concerning the absence of certain facts. It is apparent from [5]-[10] above, that a clear summary of the facts had been provided to her Honour following the plea of guilty, and this was supplemented by the statement of Mr Lade which did not contradict anything contained in the Statement of Facts but supported it.  
     
      
    16 Mr Bourke submitted that an order should be made under s.59(2)(a) Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 setting aside the order of dismissal and remitting the matter to the Local Court for hearing before a Magistrate other than the Second Defendant. He submitted that such an order was appropriate in this case given the course taken by the Second Defendant at the hearing on 23 January 2008: Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Neamati [2007] NSWSC 746 at [31].  
     
      
    17 Ms Orman-Hales, counsel for the First Defendant, submitted that the Plaintiff had not demonstrated error with respect to the course of proceedings in the Local Court and that, even if some error had been demonstrated, that relief ought be refused on discretionary grounds. 
     
      
    18 She submitted that, on the material before the Local Court, the Second Defendant was correct in concluding, effectively, that there was no prima facie case of negligence. Reference was made to Clout v Hutchinson (1950) 51 SR(NSW) 32 where Street CJ observed at 35 that negligent driving (under then s.4 Motor Traffic Act 1909) was “something less serious than reckless or furious driving” and involved a “different and lesser degree of negligence” than that which was necessary to prove an offence of negligent act causing grievous bodily harm under s.54 Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    19 Ms Orman-Hales submitted that it was open to the Second Defendant not to accept the First Defendant’s plea of guilty. Although it was nowhere noted, Ms Orman-Hales submitted, in effect, that her Honour did not accept the plea of guilty and proceeded thereafter to consider the material which had been tendered by the prosecutor. Having done so, Ms Orman-Hales submitted that the Second Defendant concluded, correctly, that there was no prima facie case to support the element of negligence. Although no application was made for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty, Ms Orman-Hales submitted that the appropriate conclusion is that her Honour did not accept the plea of guilty. 
     
      
    20 Ms Orman-Hales submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the refusal to adjourn the proceedings. This was a discretionary matter and it was open to the Second Defendant to conclude that the prosecutor had placed the necessary material before the Court in the form of the Statement of Facts and Mr Lade’s statement, and that no purpose would be served by adjourning the proceedings. She also submitted that the prosecutor ought to have had all available documentary material at the Court on the first return date, so that it might be provided to the Court if needed.  
     
      
    21 If a basis for relief was demonstrated, Ms Orman-Hales submitted that the matter ought not be remitted to the Local Court or, if it was to be remitted, that this Court should make an order allowing the plea of guilty to be withdrawn. Ms Orman-Hales accepted that it was open to the Court to remit the matter to the Local Court to be heard before a Magistrate other than the Second Defendant, but submitted that such an order ought not be made in this case.  
     
      
       
      The Statutory Offence of Negligent Driving 
       
      
    22 Before moving to resolve the issues raised in these proceedings, it is appropriate to make some observations concerning the offence of negligent driving. 
     
      
    23 A person must not drive a motor vehicle negligently on a road or road-related area: s.42(1) Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999. If the negligent driving occasions grievous bodily harm, the maximum penalty (in the case of a first offence) is a fine of 20 penalty units or imprisonment for nine months or both: s.42(1)(b).  
     
      
    24 Section 42(3) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) In considering whether an offence has been committed under this section, the court is to have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including the following: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the nature, condition and use of the road or road related area on which the offence is alleged to have been committed, 
           
           
          (b) the amount of traffic that actually is at the time, or which might reasonably be expected to be, on the road or road related area.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    25 The offences of negligent driving occasioning death or grievous bodily harm were introduced by amendment to s.4 of the Traffic Act 1909 by the Traffic (Driving Offences) Amendment Bill 1994. 
     
      
    26 The statutory offence of negligent driving in s.42(1) is the successor to the offence of negligent driving originally enacted in s.4 Motor Traffic Act 1909. The history of this offence, and its relationship with culpable driving under s.52A Crimes Act 1900 and manslaughter, was considered by O’Brien CJ of CrD (Street CJ and Nagle CJ at CL agreeing) in R v Buttsworth (1983) 1 NSWLR 658 at 664ff.  
     
      
    27 Negligent driving is established where it is proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused person drove a motor vehicle in a manner involving a departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances. The distinction which may be drawn between driving negligently, driving in a manner dangerous to the public and driving of a kind which justifies a conviction for manslaughter is essentially a distinction in the degree of negligence appropriate to the offence, being a distinction in the degree of departure from the standard of care for other users of the road to be expected of the ordinary prudent driver in the circumstances: R v Buttsworth at 672.  
     
      
    28 The provision now contained in s.42(3) demonstrates that the statutory offence of negligent driving may be committed although there may be no other traffic on the road, if other traffic might reasonably be expected to be there: R v Buttsworth at 667-668. 
     
      
    29 The question is essentially whether the driver was exercising that degree of care which the ordinary prudent driver would exercise in all the circumstances, including the circumstances as set out in s.42(3): Simpson v Peat [1952] 2 QB 24. 
     
      
    30 To prove the offence of negligent driving under s.42(1), it is not necessary that there be any injury to a person or damage to property: R v Buttsworth at 667-668. Of course, if the negligent driving occasions death or grievous bodily harm, the driver will be liable to a higher maximum penalty: s.42(1)(a) and (b).  
     
      
    31 In R v Buttsworth at 682, O’Brien CJ of CrD said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If, therefore, it were necessary to deal with the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence and the offence of culpable driving, it would, I should think, obviously be necessary to indicate to the jury the differing standards of neglect for the safety of the public as other road users liable to be affected by the three standards in ascending order if the jury were to have any realistic appreciation of what the law was talking about in offences of manslaughter and of culpable driving and how they stood in relation to the well-known summary offence of negligent driving and the standard of negligence it involves.” 
        
       
      
    32 It is clear that negligent driving is to be regarded as something less serious than reckless or furious driving or driving at a speed or in a manner dangerous to the public (all offences contained in s.42(2) of the Act): Clout v Hutchinson at 35. In Ex parte Graham; re Dowling (1968) 88 WN(Pt1)(NSW) 270, Asprey JA observed at 282: 
     
      
       
        
        “Like the tort of negligence, ‘negligent driving’ is difficult to reduce to a set of rules. It covers a multitude of sins. It relates to the circumstances of the occasion. What would constitute the offence in one instance would pass without censure in another.” 
        
       
      
    33 Given an observation made by the Second Defendant in this case concerning res ipsa loquitur, it is appropriate to refer to other authority. In Ex parte Musgrove; re Howard (1961) 78 WN(NSW) 88, Collins J at 89 observed that the “so called doctrine or principle of res ipsa loquitur can find no place in criminal law”. It is important to place this comment in context. Collins J made this statement in the course of determining an appeal from a magistrate who approached the determination of a summary charge of negligent driving by applying the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur, and then proceeded to hold that the defendant had not discharged the onus of proving his innocence.  
     
      
    34 In R v Cains (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 April 1971) 2 Petty Sessions Review 796, O’Brien J (as his Honour then was) (in delivering the judgment of the Court) referred to Ex parte Musgrove; re Howard and said (at 804-805): 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour  
        [Collins J in  
        Ex parte Musgrove; re Howard 
        ] 
         agreed with submissions that if the phrase  
        [res ipsa loquitur]  
        has any place in the language of the criminal law, it can only be used to describe a factual situation where the prosecution’s case is based on circumstantial evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Turning to the Magistrate’s judgment, his Honour said it was clear that ‘having first introduced a statement of the phrase res ipsa loquitur, he then proceeds to hold that the onus of proving his innocence was on the accused person, and convicted him because he had not discharged this onus’. 
        
       
       
        
        This, of course, was clearly wrong, even if the maxim be used in civil law, and the Magistrate, so far as the charge before him was concerned, was bound to consider whether, on the whole of the evidence, the offence had been established by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt. He ordered the rule to be made absolute because, as he said, ‘the Magistrate was in error in holding that the applicant was guilty of the said offence, not because there was no evidence that the applicant was guilty, but because the reasons that he gave for finding him guilty completely vitiate his decision’. 
        
       
       
        
        From this decision it can be seen in the first instance that his Honour did not hold that in a circumstance where a car leaves the road for no established reason it is not open to a Magistrate to infer, in the circumstances of the case before him, that the prosecution has not established the offence of negligent driving beyond reasonable doubt. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case, the submissions of counsel at the trial, did not correctly represent the grounds of the decision of the case he cited. 
        
       
       
        
        More importantly, it can be seen that in this judgment nothing can be found which requires, as a matter of law or as a desirable practice, that in an offence arising out of a collision on a road, the jury should be directed that they could not draw any inference of criminal conduct from a so-called unexplained accident.  
        
       
       
        
        Of course, the decision could be used for the proposition, if authority were really needed, that the jury should not be told to follow some such process as the Magistrate there followed. It was not suggested, of course, before me that the learned Chairman had made any such suggestion.” 
        
       
      
    35 A negligent driving case, like any other case, may depend largely or entirely on circumstantial evidence. In the absence of an admission by the driver charged, the case may fall to be determined by application of principles relevant to a circumstantial case, including the drawing of inferences from proved facts.  
     
      
    36 To establish a prima facie case in a prosecution based upon circumstantial evidence, it is necessary for the prosecution to show, at the close of its case, that an inference consistent with guilt reasonably arose on the evidence. It does not have to prove that this was the only inference that arose or that there was no inference arising from the evidence inconsistent with guilt: R v JMR (1991) 57 A Crim R 39 at 43-44; R v Serratore (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 at 130; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Neamati at [14].  
     
      
    37 Putting aside, for the moment, the First Defendant’s plea of guilty, the Statement of Facts and Mr Lade’s statement provided the foundation for a very clear inference that the First Defendant was not keeping a proper lookout, and was not driving with due care and attention (and had thus departed from the standard of care for other road users to be expected of an ordinary prudent driver) when he made the right-hand turn from Terry Road into Valley Road, Eastwood, on the evening in question, driving straight into Mr Lade’s bicycle which had the right of way.  
     
      
    38 It might be thought that this very clear inference serves to explain the plea of guilty entered on the First Defendant’s behalf by his solicitor. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    39 The Plaintiff has demonstrated error of law in a number of respects in these proceedings. I regret to say that the course taken by the Second Defendant at Ryde Local Court on 23 January 2008 bore little resemblance to what was required by law under applicable statutory and common law principles. 
     
      
    40 The First Defendant appeared together with a solicitor and a plea of guilty was entered to the charge. A court should approach such a step upon the basis that the plea announced in open court, in the presence of the First Defendant, represented his instructions to his solicitor: R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 683-684. Thereafter, no application was made by the First Defendant for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty.  
     
      
    41 A person charged with an offence is at liberty to plead guilty or not guilty to the charge, whether or not that person is in truth guilty or nor guilty, and a Court will act on a plea of guilty when it is entered in open court by a person who is of full age and apparently of sound mind and understanding, provided the plea is entered in exercise of a free choice in the interest of the person entering the plea: Meissner v The Queen [1994-1995] 184 CLR 132 at 141.  
     
      
    42 A person may plead guilty upon grounds which extend beyond that person’s belief in his guilt, and the entry of a plea of guilty upon such grounds nevertheless constitutes an admission of all the elements of the offence, and a conviction entered upon the basis of such a plea will not be set aside on appeal unless it can be shown that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and this will normally only arise where the accused person did not understand the nature of the charge, or did not intend by his plea to admit his guilt of it: Meissner v The Queen at 157; Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 45-46.  
     
      
    43 Where an application is made for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty, evidence ought be adduced from the accused person as to the circumstances in which he or she came to plead guilty: Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions at 40 [14].44 In Maxwell v The Queen [1995-1996] 184 CLR 501, Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 510-511: 
     
      
       
        
        “An accused is entitled to plead guilty to an offence with which he is charged and, if he does so, the plea will constitute an admission of all the essential elements of the offence. Of course, if the trial judge forms the view that the evidence does not support the charge or that for any other reason the charge is not supportable, he should advise the accused to withdraw his plea and plead not guilty. But he cannot compel an accused to do so and if the accused refuses, the plea must be considered final, subject only to the discretion of the judge to grant leave to change the plea to one of not guilty at any time before the matter is disposed of by sentence or otherwise.  
         
         
        The plea of guilty must however be unequivocal and not made in circumstances suggesting that it is not a true admission of guilt. Those circumstances include ignorance, fear, duress, mistake or even the desire to gain a technical advantage. The plea may be accompanied by a qualification indicating that the accused is unaware of its significance. If it appears to the trial judge, for whatever reason, that a plea of guilty is not genuine, he or she must (and it is not a matter of discretion) obtain an unequivocal plea of guilty or direct that a plea of not guilty be entered 
        . 
         But otherwise an accused may insist upon pleading guilty.” 
        
       
      
    45 These principles surrounding acceptance or rejection of a plea of guilty, apply in the Local Court under s.193(2) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It has been said that, where the accused person’s version of the facts is inconsistent with the plea of guilty, the court should give the defence an opportunity to withdraw the plea and, if that does not occur and the accused person insists upon pleading guilty, the court should ignore the accused person’s version: R v Martin (1904) 4 SR(NSW) 720; Marlow v R [1990] 1 Tas SR 1; Blazevski v Judges of the District Court (NSW Court of Appeal, 10 November 1992, BC9101492) (1992) 62 ALD 197 at 208-209, 212-213.  
     
      
    46 Where a Magistrate determines under s.193(2) not to accept the accused person’s guilty plea on the first return date, a plea of not guilty ought be entered and the court must set the date, time and place for the hearing and determination of the matter: s.190(1) Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    47 It will be apparent that none of these statutory or common law principles were applied by the Second Defendant in the present case. Both the transcript of the proceedings and the record of the Local Court disclose a plea of guilty being entered which, although criticised by her Honour, was not rejected or withdrawn by leave. By that plea, the First Defendant admitted the essential elements of the offence, including negligence. Yet the Second Defendant dismissed the charge. Clear error of law is revealed in these circumstances.  
     
      
    48 If the view is taken that her Honour, without recording such an order, rejected the plea of guilty, a further question arises. Her Honour took the view that the Statement of Facts and the statement of Mr Lade did not disclose negligence. Reference was made to the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur having no application.  
     
      
    49 Her Honour’s earlier exchange with the prosecutor concerning the suggested lack of factual information in the material is difficult to understand given the contents of the Statement of Facts which I have summarised earlier in this judgment. If her Honour was to reach the point of considering the sufficiency of the evidence by reference to the element of negligence, then the question involved consideration of inferences available from the undisputed facts. There was a very clear inference available that the First Defendant had not acted in accordance with the standards of the ordinary prudent driver in that he failed to keep a proper lookout and failed to pay proper attention so that he did not see the oncoming bicycle (which had the right of way) with which he collided whilst doing a right-hand turn.  
     
      
    50 If the matter had proceeded to a defended hearing, arguments may have been advanced concerning the visibility of the bicycle, although I note that Mr Lade’s statement recorded that he had reflective shoes, a front light mounted on his bike and a red flashing light on the rear and that the lights were working at the time of the collision. However, the Second Defendant had before her the admission of negligence conveyed by the plea of guilty, together with a very strong inference of negligence arising from the Statement of Facts.  
     
      
    51 In this Court, both counsel submitted that the Second Defendant concluded (although this was not stated expressly) that there was no prima facie case of negligence. In doing so, I am satisfied that a clear error of law was committed both by disregarding the plea of guilty, and failing to apply the appropriate legal test to reach the necessary conclusion by reference to inferences arising from the evidence placed before the Local Court. 
     
      
    52 Further, I am satisfied that the Second Defendant has failed to comply with statutory procedures in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 and denied the prosecutor procedural fairness by declining to adjourn the proceedings. 
     
      
    53 In Nitiva v Director of Public Prosecutions [1999] NSWCA 332, the Court of Appeal (Sheller and Beazley JJA, Cole AJA) observed at [64], in the context of a claim of denial of procedural fairness by a refusal to adjourn criminal proceedings: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principles upon which an adjournment ought to be granted are well established. The court has a discretion to grant or refuse an adjournment. However, a refusal to grant an adjournment can, in certain circumstances, constitute a denial of procedural fairness: see  
        Sullivan v Department of Transport 
         (1978) 20 ALR 323. As Deane J said in that case at ALR 343 ‘it is important to remember that the relevant duty of [the court] is to ensure that a party is given a reasonable opportunity to present his case’. In our opinion, the claimant was not given that reasonable opportunity.” 
        
       
      
    54 In Blazevski v Judges of the District Court, Kirby P (as his Honour then was) said at 200: 
     
      
       
        
        “Courts providing judicial review to rectify departures from the requirements of procedural fairness will likewise give relief for departures from such requirements which will have been taken by the trial court outside the proper exercise of its jurisdiction. In criminal cases, they will do so where the injustice has been done to the prosecution as well as to the accused.” 
        
       
      
    55 If the Second Defendant rejected the plea of guilty, the Court ought to have proceeded to set the date, time and place for the hearing and determination of the matter: s.190(1). Thereafter, a Magistrate would determine the matter after hearing the accused person, prosecutor, witnesses and evidence in accordance with s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. That did not occur in this case. It is no answer to this conclusion to assert that the prosecutor had an opportunity to place before the Second Defendant on 23 January 2008 the Statement of Facts and the statement of Mr Lade.  
     
      
    56 Leaving aside, for the moment, the fact that a plea of guilty had been entered and that the evidence before the Local Court was supportive of the guilt of the First Defendant, if the matter was not to proceed to finality pursuant to the plea of guilty that day, the prosecutor was entitled to have the proceedings adjourned so that the witnesses could be called, and submissions made, in light of the evidence adduced at the hearing. In accordance with the principle referred to in Nitiva v Director of Public Prosecutions, the duty of the Court was to ensure that the prosecutor be given a reasonable opportunity to present the prosecution case. In my view, the Second Defendant deprived the prosecutor of such a reasonable opportunity in this case. To force the prosecutor to proceed on the first return date, in the circumstances of this case, gave rise to an injustice and denial of procedural fairness: Underhill v Murden (2007) 173 A Crim R 336 at 339 [11], 342 [25]. 
     
      
    57 The course adopted by the Second Defendant did not afford a hearing according to law to the prosecutor in accordance with s.202 Criminal Procedure Act 1986. In Director of Public Prosecutions v Wunderwald, error of law was found where the presiding Magistrate (the same Magistrate as in this case) part way through the prosecution case, in effect determined that no further witnesses would assist the prosecution case and the hearing was brought to a peremptory conclusion. In the course of granting relief, Sully J said at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Having regard to the sequence of events as I have described it, it is, I think, relevant to observe at once, and with all proper respect to her Worship, that it was not for her Worship, in effect, to take over herself the conduct of the prosecution case, and, in effect, peremptorily to close off the calling by the prosecutor of any evidence that the prosecutor considered to be potentially relevant to the making out of the charge. Her Worship’s duty was to hear fairly, and to judge according to law, such evidence as either party to the proceedings before her Worship might wish to adduce.” 
        
       
      
    58 Criminal proceedings are conducted as adversarial litigation: Nudd v The Queen (2006) 80 ALJR 614 at 618-619 [9]. The role of the presiding Judge is to hold the balance between the contending parties without himself or herself taking part in their disputation. The Judge does not exercise an inquisitorial role in which he or she seeks to remedy the deficiencies in the case of either side, nor is part of the function of a Judge to don the mantle of prosecution or defence counsel: Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657 at 682. The fundamental task of a Judge is to ensure a fair trial: R v Meher [2004] NSWCCA 355 at [76]; Robinson v R (2006) 162 A Crim R 88 at [138]-[140]. Although these observations were made concerning the role of the Judge in a jury criminal trial, I consider that they are equally applicable to Magistrates hearing and determining criminal proceedings in the Local Court, whether defended hearings or sentence proceedings following a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    59 Finally, I accept that error of law has been demonstrated by the failure of the Second Defendant to give reasons as required by law for dismissing the charge. In Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Illawarra Cashmart Pty Limited, it was observed, at 408 [19], that one of the conventional functions of the requirement to give reasons relates to the appellate process. It is not satisfactory that an appeal court is left to undertake an analysis of exchanges between the Bench and counsel during submissions to ascertain a Magistrate’s reasons for determination.  
     
      
    60 It might be said that it is clear enough that the Second Defendant reached an immovable view that, despite the plea of guilty and the contents of the Statement of Facts and Mr Lade’s statement, there was no evidence of negligence revealed. If, however, her Honour had determined to dismiss the charge, the law required the expression of reasons. Although this error is not decisive, it constitutes the final step in a series of errors which I am satisfied occurred in this case. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    61 Clear errors of law have been demonstrated in this case. The matter ought be remitted to the Local Court. The appropriate course is to set aside the order of dismissal of the charge.  
     
      
    62 The First Defendant pleaded guilty to the charge in the Local Court. The appropriate course is for the proceedings to be remitted in that state. It will be a matter for the First Defendant to decide whether he wishes to make application for leave to withdraw his plea of guilty. In that event, it will be necessary for a Magistrate to determine, in accordance with the principles in Wong v Director of Public Prosecutions, whether leave to withdraw the plea of guilty ought be granted. 
     
      
    63 I propose to make orders under s.59(2)(a) Criminal (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. It is not necessary to address the alternative claim for prerogative and declaratory relief beyond observing that clear jurisdictional error has been demonstrated. Had there been an impediment to the grant of statutory appellate relief, I would have granted the Plaintiff prerogative and declaratory relief. 
     
      
    64 In circumstances where I am well satisfied that the Second Defendant peremptorily dismissed the charge, in the face of a plea of guilty, and without proper regard to applicable law and practice, it is appropriate that the matter be remitted to the Local Court to be determined by a Magistrate other than the Second Defendant: Director of Public Prosecutions v Lee [2006] NSWSC 270 at [68]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Neamati at [42]; Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Fabri [2008] NSWSC 655 at [14]-[15]. 
     
      
    65 I make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) the appeal is allowed; 
       
       
      (b) I set aside the order of the Second Defendant made on 23 January 2008 dismissing the charge against the First Defendant under s.42(1)  
      Road Transport (Safety Transport and Management) Act 1999 
      ; 
       
       
      (c) the matter is remitted to the Local Court to be heard before a different Magistrate conformably with this judgment; 
       
       
      (d) the First Defendant is to pay the Plaintiff’s costs; 
       
       
      (e) the First Defendant is granted a certificate under s.6  
      Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 
      .

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: At the commencement of the trial of Mr Ali I made an order prohibiting publication of any evidence which may identify or tend to identify the alleged victim in this case, Ms Loiterton. The trial has now concluded with findings of guilt in relation to the three sexual assault matters alleged against the accused. That would ordinarily be the end of my involvement in the matter until sentence proceedings but the matter has been brought back before me because an application was made on behalf of the Daily Telegraph that I revoke the order I earlier made under s 292 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  Tendered before me was a photocopy of a document. It is agreed that it was signed by Ms Loiterton. She says “I give my permission for the Daily Telegraph to identify me in reports and photographs”. It is dated today. 2 Let me begin by looking at s 578A of the Crimes Act. That section prohibits publication of any matter which identifies the complainant in prescribed sexual offence proceedings unless one of a number of circumstances apply. The section does not apply to a publication made with consent of a complainant, being a complainant who was of or over the age of fourteen years at the time of publication. Ms Loiterton is nineteen. Thus the Daily Telegraph is entitled to publish Ms Loiterton’s name if I revoke the order I made under s 292 and thus that is the application that has been made on its behalf. 3 It is no light matter to identify someone as a victim of sexual assault. Nor is it a light matter to be identified as the victim of sexual assault. Once publication is made in these days of ready internet access Pandora’s box has been opened. Ms Loiterton will, if I grant the application, be forever more easily identifiable as the victim of a sexual assault. She is nineteen now and it would be entirely within my understanding of human nature that she may, in years to come, regret that she gave permission to her identity being published. 4 When this application was made she had left court and, as I understand it, was almost at home. She was prepared to come back in if necessary. I did not find it necessary to ask her to come back in. I will, however, proceed on the basis that there is a significant risk that Ms Loiterton may come to regret what will probably turn out to be the case later on in life, that is that a simple Google search of her name will reveal that she was raped by a taxi driver when she was eighteen years of age. 5 One of the things that I need to consider when making an order under s 292 of the Criminal Procedure Act, and necessarily therefore when considering whether to revoke such an order, is the public interest in the publication of Ms Loiterton’s name. Indeed I am not to make an order unless I am satisfied that publication is not in the public interest. The way that that is phrased in the negative is important. The default position is publication. Only when I have considered the views of the complainant and also when publication is not in the public interest do I make an order under s 292. To continue an order under s 292 by failing to revoke it I must also be satisfied that publication is not in the public interest. 6 There is a public interest in overcoming what seems to have been the community attitude for many years that victims of sexual assault should be ashamed. That is not the case at all. Although I have not heard submissions on sentence yet I anticipate that when I do sentence the offender I will be making some comment concerning the complete lack of blame which should be attributed to Ms Loiterton and her friends. Victims of robberies are not ashamed, victims of frauds may be embarrassed that they have been duped but their names are still published. Why should a person in Ms Loiterton’s position, entirely blameless who has been preyed upon by a taxi driver, feel embarrassed at what happened to her. 7 There is a public interest in overcoming what remains of community attitudes which suggest that people in Ms Loiterton’s position should be ashamed. I am satisfied that far from this being a case where publication is not in the public interest I make a positive finding that it is in the public interest for a victim of sexual assault who consents to her name being published having her name being published. Ms Loiterton should not, by implication, be forced to hide away, embarrassed about what has happened to her. She is entitled to hold her head up high and identify herself as a blameless victim of sexual assault. The order I made prohibiting publication of any evidence which may identify Ms Loiterton or tend to identify her is revoked.
