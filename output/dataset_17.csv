Cur Adv Vult
 
Before the High Court the respondent, Victor Rajoo (the accused), faced five charges, namely: (i) a charge of abduction of a lady, whom we shall call `AB`, with intent that she might be forced to illicit sexual intercourse, an offence punishable under s 366 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) (the Code); (ii) a charge of having carnal intercourse with AB against the order of nature, an offence punishable under s 377 of the Code; (iii) a charge of rape of AB and putting her in fear of hurt to herself, an offence punishable under s 376(2)(b) of the Code; (iv) a charge of robbery of $6000 from AB, an offence punishable under s 392 of the Code; and (v) a charge of theft of other items belonging to AB under s 379 of the Code. The accused claimed trial to the first four charges but pleaded guilty to the fifth charge, namely, that of theft. At the conclusion of the trial, the learned trial judge acquitted him of the first and third charges, but convicted him of the second charge and sentenced him to imprisonment for a term of six months and a fine of two thousand dollars. In respect of the fourth charge, the accused was acquitted of the charge of robbery but was convicted on an amended charge of theft under s 379 of the Code and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years which was to run consecutively to the term of six months. In respect of the theft charge to which the accused pleaded guilty, he was convicted and was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of two years which was to run concurrently with the term of imprisonment passed on the amended fourth charge.
The Public Prosecutor now appeals against the decision of the learned trial judge in acquitting the accused of the first and third charges and in amending the fourth charge to one of theft and convicting the accused of that charge. It is necessary in this appeal to set out in some detail the evidence adduced by the prosecution and the defence respectively and to deal with it at some length.
 The prosecution case
We turn first to the evidence of AB, the complainant. She is an Indian national, aged 44 years, and was at the material time in Singapore on a social visit pass. She is married with two children and does trading business for a living. She came to Singapore to purchase goods for her business sometime in January 1995, but that was not her first visit. During that visit, she stayed at a lodging house at No 28, Veerasamy Road. She bought some hair clips and sunglasses to sell them in Sri Lanka.
On 22 January 1995 at about 11am, AB was walking along Hampshire Road carrying two plastic bags which contained her various personal effects and other items. A motor van driven by the accused, who was dressed in a long sleeved sports shirt and bermuda shorts, came and stopped next to her. The accused asked AB whether she was from India and also where she had just come from, and she replied that she had gone to see someone to collect some money. The accused asked whether she had a visa, to which she replied in the affirmative. He then asked to see her visa and also demanded her passport. In response she asked who he was, and he replied that he was a police officer. When she said that he did not look like a police officer, he claimed that he was from the Criminal Investigation Department (CID). She did not believe him and asked him to show his identification card. He flashed a card to identify himself but quickly put it back into his pocket. She then believed the accused`s claim that he was a police officer and handed over her passport as demanded, and told him that she would be returning to India the following day. He examined the passport and claimed that he had checked her at the airport police station two weeks ago, and that she had come to Singapore on a different passport. The accused then asked her to board his van so that he could bring her to the airport police station for an investigation. He said that after the investigation he would release her. When she refused to board the van, the accused threatened to handcuff her. On hearing this, she was frightened and boarded the van.
The accused drove the van along Serangoon Road, passed Sim Lim Towers and drove all the way towards the Changi Airport. After having travelled for about half an hour, the accused stopped the van. He then pointed to a building and told AB that that was where the police station was located. The accused told AB to go and sit in the rear compartment of the van, and explained that when police officers were bringing in someone for questioning, they were not supposed to have the person seated in the front cabin. AB left her two plastic bags in front and went into the rear compartment.
After AB had gone into the rear compartment, the van travelled for a short distance and went over a very bumpy road. At this point AB was concerned and she asked the accused in sign language after tapping at the window separating the two compartments where he was heading. The accused pointed his index finger at her and she assumed that he was going to answer a call of nature. When the van stopped, she noticed that there were a lot of trees around. It was `like a jungle area`.
The accused then went into the rear compartment, sat near the side door, removed his shoes and told AB that he had to check her. She told him to bring her to the police station and have a female officer to check her. The accused refused. AB became frightened. The accused then pulled at her saree, and as a result the saree came off. She pleaded with the accused. The accused abused her and instead pulled off her petticoat. He then ordered her to remove her blouse and brassiere. When she refused, the accused placed his hands on her neck and told her that he would kill her and throw her into the bushes. AB became frightened and therefore complied. The accused then undressed himself and went towards AB. She sat on the floorboard to avoid him and at this stage, the accused stepped on her ankle and repeated that he would kill her if she resisted. The accused then forced AB to submit to performing an act of fellatio on him (the subject of the second charge). AB accordingly did what she was told. Following that the accused raped her.
Thereafter, the accused handed AB her clothes and as she was dressing he noticed a knot at one end of her saree. He took the saree, untied the knot and found S$6,000 in it and took the money. AB tried to snatch it back but he pushed her away, and as a result she fell. After they had dressed, he went back to the driver`s seat and she followed him. He asked her to shut the rear compartment door. She went into the rear compartment. She then saw a card and delivery order attached to a flower basket in the van. She took the card and delivery order. When she alighted from the van, she went to the rear of the van and noted the vehicle number, `YG 1496M`. She then went to the front of the vehicle to confirm the number. By this time the accused had started to drive off with AB`s two bags still in the van at the front. She then went out to the main road and flagged for help from passing vehicles. Eventually, a car driven by one Simon Tay Seong Chee, a lecturer with the Law Faculty of the National University of Singapore, came along. With Simon Tay in the car were his wife, Siow Jin Hua, and a friend. They found AB in distress and brought her to the nearest police station, the airport police station. Inside the car, she borrowed a pen and scribbled `YG 1496M` on a piece of paper.
Simon Tay and his wife both gave evidence. Simon Tay testified that at the material time he was driving his motor car SBA 2180X from Changi Village with his wife seated next to him and a friend on the rear seat. Whilst travelling along Changi Coast Road, a short distance from the SIA hangars and somewhere near the entrance leading to a construction site, he saw a female Indian standing on the road `waving her arms in the air, using her hands to beat her chest` and trying to flag the passing vehicles. At first Simon Tay drove past her but immediately slowed down and observed from the rear mirror that she was in distress. After a brief consultation with his wife and his friend he turned around, drove up to her and stopped beside her. He noticed that AB was distressed and emotional, and uttered some words in broken English to the effect that someone had taken her passport, money and air ticket. She said that she was from India and needed help. She kept repeating `police` as she could hardly speak English. Realizing that she needed help Simon Tay asked her to board the car. She boarded the car and sat on the rear seat. She asked for a piece of paper and pen. Siow Jin Hua gave her a pen and she wrote down several numbers on a portion of a newspaper which was in the car. Throughout the journey she kept on talking in broken English and Simon Tay came to understand that the culprit had taken her things and had identified himself as a policeman. On reaching the police station, Simon Tay referred her to some police officers. She became more distressed and started crying.
Siow Jin Hua confirmed in substance what her husband said. She also said that AB was very upset, spoke very incoherently and cried and gestured a great deal.
At the Airport Police Division Headquarters on that day the police officer, Abdul Karim bin Senin, was on duty when AB was brought in by Simon Tay. According to Abdul Karim, AB upon entering the report room started to cry, and `due to her emotional state`, he was unable to gather sufficient facts from her. He therefore sought the assistance of Staff Sergeant AR Rajagopal and contacted the latter, who was then on duty at Changi Airport Terminal 2. S/Sgt Rajagopal spoke to AB over the telephone and interviewed her. After that, S/Sgt Rajagopal briefed Abdul Karim on the facts of the case and the latter transcribed in the station diary what S/Sgt Rajagopal had told him. The information as recorded was as follows: 
 
... She was raped and robbed by a male Indian, aged 28 to 30 years old. Dark complexion, hair touching collar and wearing white T-shirt with bermuda shorts, black sandals and left ear with two studs. She was picked up by him at Sim Lim Tower and brought her to Changi Coast Road, raped and robbed. Cash $6,000, luggage and a passport. The subject was in a white van No YG1496M ...
 
 
 
Abdul Karim then referred AB to ASP Teo Chor Leng of Bedok Police Station Headquarters.
S/Sgt Rajagopal testified that when he interviewed AB on the telephone in Tamil she was emotional and was crying. AB actually mentioned the robbery first. He asked her to be forthcoming and not to hide anything. She was very emotional and was crying and hysterical. He managed to gather from her that an unknown male Indian in a van YG 1496M had raped her and then robbed her of $6000, her passport and luggage. After the interview he briefed Abdul Karim of the facts. Later on the same day, S/Sgt Rajagopal went to Airport Police Division Headquarters to act as an interpreter to ASP Teo Chor Leng, when the latter interviewed AB. At that time, she handed to ASP Teo the delivery order and congratulatory card from Noel Gift International Ltd, which she took from the rear compartment of the van.
ASP Teo confirmed that on that day he interviewed AB with the assistance of S/Sgt Rajagopal, and gathered from her that she had been raped and robbed at Changi Coast Road and that the culprit was a male Indian and had escaped in a motor van YG 1496M. AB handed to him a Noel Gift International Ltd delivery order and a congratulatory card. ASP Teo said that AB was very emotional and was sobbing during the interview.
The investigating officer was Inspector Deep Singh, attached to the organized crime branch of the CID. He took over the investigation from ASP Teo. On 24 January 1995 he recorded two statements from the accused under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (s 122(6) statements) in answer to the charges of rape and robbery respectively. These statements were admitted in evidence after a voir dire held to determine that the accused had made them without any inducement, threat or promise. The s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of rape was as follows: 
 
I admit that I brought her. We went in a vehicle. I do not frighten her but I told her that I was a policeman. When she heard this she became frightened. I asked her for her passport. I then told her to go behind the vehicle. When I told her this, she told me that she knew why I told her this. I do not know why she said this. It may be because I told her that I am a policeman. I did not force her or persuade to do this. I wanted to have sex with her that is why I told her to go behind the vehicle. The reason she agreed to follow because I told her I am a policeman. I did not beat or threatened her.
 
 
 
The s 122(6) statement in answer to the charge for robbery was a short one, which was as follows: 
 
I admit committing the offence of robbery. I plead for leniency.
 
 
 
For the purpose of this appeal only the following parts of the evidence of Inspector Deep Singh are relevant. He testified, inter alia, that on 31 January 1995 the accused led him to the scene of the crime, off Changi Coast Road. The accused also led him to a spot at the side of the road which is about 70m from Changi Ferry Road. There, he told Inspector Deep Singh that that was where he stopped his van and asked his victim to alight from the front cabin and board the rear compartment of the van. He also told the inspector that that was where he (the accused) pointed the SIA Engineering Building to the victim as the building where Changi Airport Police Station was located, which was their destination.
Inspector Deep Singh also made an investigation concerning AB. He went to No 28 Veerasamy Road and ascertained that AB at that time was staying in a room there. He found an assortment of hair clips and sunglasses in her room. He also ascertained that goods had indeed been bought by AB from several shops in Singapore. At two of the shops, the staff recognized her and confirmed she had made purchases from them regularly. In fact, he also managed to obtain copies of two receipts of those purchases from one of the shops. One of the receipts bore her name.
One, Terrence Tan Choon How, the manager of a company or firm Pacific Polythene, testified that the accused was one of the company`s employees at the material time. The accused`s job was to deliver goods of the company and had been entrusted the company`s van No YG 1496M. He confirmed that on 22 January 1995 the van was in the accused`s custody, and that besides the accused Tan himself was the only person holding a key to the van.
Lim Phay Inn Suzanne, the transport supervisor of Noel Gift International Ltd, gave evidence on the delivery order and the congratulatory card which AB took from the rear compartment of the van. Lim said that her company employed Guan Delivery Services for delivery of company`s gifts and the accused was a part time staff of Guan Delivery Services. She said that on 22 January 1995 at about 10.40am the accused left her office with a gift item for delivery to one Susan Hoong of No 6 Sin Min Plaza #04-09. She also confirmed that the delivery order and gift card produced to her subsequently by Inspector Deep Singh on 16 May 1995 were the delivery order and gift card used by her company and were attached to the gift item which the accused was supposed to deliver to Susan Hoong.
 The defence case
The accused gave evidence in his defence, and his evidence was this. On 22 January 1995, as he was driving the van along Hampshire Road approaching the junction of Rutland Road, he saw AB on the other side of the road. He called out to her and signalled to her to go over to him. In response she gestured to him to go to her instead. He thereupon turned his van around and drove up to her and stopped by her side. He asked her where she was going and in reply she said that she was going to her room. He then asked whether they could go to the room. She said that her room was at Veerasamy Road. He asked her to board his van and she did so. Neither of them indicated at that point where they would be heading, but the accused drove past Veerasamy Road along Race Course Road, Serangoon Road and Kitchener Road. When the van passed Veerasamy Road, AB gave no indication that she wished to be let off. During the journey they continued chatting and the subject turned on the bags that AB was carrying with her and her selling of sarees. The accused continued driving and eventually took his van to East Coast Parkway. They were chatting casually. He asked whether she was afraid as she was selling things such as gold and sarees. She said she was not afraid and asked whether he was a policeman. He replied that he was not. Later in the course of the conversation pertaining to her trips to and from India she produced her passport and gave it to him to have a look. The accused looked at it and then placed it on the dashboard. Finally, they reached Changi Coast Road where the accused stopped the van. There he asked AB to alight and get into the rear compartment of the van and informed her that he would take her to the place where they would have sexual intercourse. He then drove a short distance to a vacant land where he parked the van. He got down and joined her in the rear compartment.
The accused said that when he entered the rear compartment, AB was seated, and she asked him: `Why come all the way here? If you have said we could have gone to a room`. To that he replied: `We are already here, we have already arrived here, we will be here`. He said that they would `sleep` there - by that he meant having sexual intercourse - to which she agreed. He then asked her to undress. AB was initially bashful, as it was bright but she was quickly persuaded by him that no one would see them. After she had undressed herself, she asked the accused why he had not similarly done so; so he too undressed himself. He asked if she would `suck`. Without saying a word, she picked up a cloth beside them, wiped his penis and performed oral sex. They then had sexual intercourse. Thereafter, while she was dressing, he noticed a knot at one end of her saree and asked to see it, and on untying it he found some Singapore currency. He took the money without counting and put it into his right pocket. She tried to snatch it back from him but failed. In the process, she ripped off part of his pocket, lost her balance, and fell into a sitting position on the floorboard of the van. He then got out and told her to go to the front passenger seat and that he would then return her the money. She indicated that she wanted to stay in the rear compartment. He then reversed his van to get out of the vacant land. While doing so he saw through the side mirror AB jumping out of the van and running to the main road. He tried to call her but when he saw her waving to passing vehicles he got frightened and drove off.
With regard to his s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of rape, the accused said that he did not tell AB that he was a policeman. What he said was: `What if I were a policeman` and that was said in the context of asking AB if she was afraid when she said that she brought in gold and sarees to sell in Singapore. In respect of the s 122(6) statement made in answer to the charge of robbery he said that he was guilty of theft.
 Decision below
The learned trial judge accepted the evidence of the accused as being closer to the truth. He found that the accused came across as an honest witness, and he did not believe AB when she said that she thought that the silver panelled van was a police vehicle. He was also not convinced that her business of selling mangoes for a profit of $75 justified her trip to Singapore. The learned trial judge noted, however, that on this particular trip, she brought nothing to sell, but purchased hair clips and sunglasses for sale in Colombo. He was, therefore, sceptical about the profits she could make there. He could not say with certainty if the latter was the real purpose of her visit to Singapore. AB conveyed an impression that she was not entirely forthright.
The learned trial judge also noted that no weapon was used in any way. There was not a single scratch on either the accused or AB. The only damage was to the accused`s pocket when AB tried to snatch back her money. The learned trial judge expressed surprise that AB who did not put up any resistance when she was raped as alleged, would find the courage or strength to resist when her money was being taken. Her distress when Simon Tay found her appeared to be over the loss of her money. She herself testified that she repeated `Help! Police! Cheating!` to Simon Tay and his wife. She did not take the opportunity to escape when the van stopped two or three times on the way to East Coast Parkway. No attempt was made to flee from the accused until after her money had been taken from her. Her disposition and character before and up to the rape was in marked contrast to that displayed the moment the accused took her $6,000. The evidence as a whole, had not only created a doubt in the learned trial judge`s mind t hat AB did not consent to travel in the accused`s van or to the sexual acts, but also convinced him that in all probability she did consent. He said: 
 
The evidence as a whole, has not only created a doubt in my mind that AB did not consent to travel in the accused`s van or to the sexual acts, but I am convinced that in all probability she did consent.
 
 
 
The prosecution has therefore, not proved that AB was abducted for illicit sexual intercourse or that the accused had sexual intercourse with AB without her consent. Accordingly, I acquitted the accused of the first and third charges.
Turning to the fourth charge of robbery of the sum of $6,000, the learned trial judge held thus: 
 
In respect of the fourth charge of robbery of the $6,000, it was clear in the evidence that the threat of death or hurt or the wrongful restraint if at all (which I found otherwise) related only to the sexual acts. The taking of the money was an off-chance. It came about, even from the evidence of AB, when she was dressing up, the accused found the money and took it. This cannot fall within the definition of `Robbery` under s 390. In this regard, I accept the evidence of the accused that he did not push AB when she tried to snatch the money from him. It is a case of theft simpliciter under s 378. I, therefore, convicted the accused accordingly, and sentenced him to a term of imprisonment for two years.
 
 
 
 
 The appeal
 
The appeal is essentially against the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge. Basically there are three main issues: first, whether AB was induced by deception on the part of the accused to travel in the accused`s van; second, whether AB consented to having sexual intercourse with the accused; and third, whether the accused put AB in any fear of hurt to herself when the accused took the sum of $6000 from her by force. The first is relevant to the charge of abduction; the second to the charge of rape; and the third to the charge of robbery.
In a case such as this, there was obviously a conflict between the evidence of the complainant and that of the accused. The learned trial judge, who had had the benefit of seeing and hearing the complainant and the accused giving evidence made findings of fact based on the veracity and credibility of their respective evidence. Due regard must be given to the learned trial judge`s findings, and such findings should not be disturbed unless we are satisfied that he has clearly reached a wrong decision. In at pp 333-334, Lai Kew Chai J delivering the judgment of this court said: 
 
... In a case such as the instant case, where there were two directly contradictory versions the acceptance or rejection of which significantly depended on the oral testimony of the protagonists, the role of the appellate court is clear. We have to accord to the findings of facts of the learned trial judge the greatest respect and ought not disturb them unless we are satisfied that the learned trial judge had reached a wrong decision and that in the context of this case `any advantage enjoyed by the trial judge by reason of having seen and heard the witnesses could not be sufficient to explain or justify the trial judge`s conclusion`: see the speech of Lord Thankerton in 
[1947] AC 484
, at p 488, reported under the name of or .
 
 
 
Pronouncements to similar effect were made by this court in , at p 42 and , at p 5. Having said this, nonetheless, it is incumbent on us to examine the basis of the findings of fact made by the learned trial judge and his reasons therefor and consider whether the findings were against the weight of evidence and insupportable.
We turn first to the primary facts which have been established and which are not in dispute. The accused, prior to the morning of 22 January 1995, was not acquainted with AB at all. On that day, while driving along Hampshire Road he saw AB on the opposite side. He accosted her and drove up to her side. A conversation then took place, and he requested her to board the van which she did. He then drove the van all the way to Changi Coast Road. Somewhere along that road, he stopped the van and asked her to alight and go to the rear compartment, and she complied. He then drove the van further and stopped at an isolated spot and parked the van there. After that he went to the rear compartment, and there, three important events took place. First, at his request AB performed the fellatio on him; second, they had sexual intercourse; and third, as she was dressing up, he found some money of hers tied in a knot in her saree and he took the money against her will. After she had dressed up and the accused had left the rear compartment, she picked up a delivery order and a card attached to a flower basket and kept them. She came down from the van and noted the number of the van. She then went to the main road and flagged down passing vehicles for help. She was picked up by Simon Tay driving his car who had with him his wife and a friend. They took her to a police station, where she made a report.
It is now necessary to consider and test the evidence of AB and the accused respectively against the undisputed facts and other evidence before us. AB`s evidence, in substance, was that she was going about her business on the morning of 22 January 1995, and along Hampshire Road she was accosted by the accused who drove a van and stopped by her side. The accused told her that he was a police officer and asked for her visa and passport. She produced her passport and gave it to him; he inspected it and then placed it on the front dashboard and asked her to board the van as he was going to bring her in for further investigation. She believed him and under the threat of being handcuffed by him she boarded the van. On the other hand, the accused`s evidence was that he accosted her, asked her where she was going and on hearing that she was going to her room in Veerasamy Road suggested that they should go to her room. He then asked her to board the van and she did so willingly.
Considering purely the respective evidence of AB and the accused, we have difficulty in accepting what the accused said. If his evidence is tested against the primary facts which are uncontroverted, and other evidence it is even more incredible. The accused was a total stranger to AB; he accosted her by the road side. She was not at the material time standing by the road side accosting or trying to accost any man coming along, or for that matter any passer-by, male or female. She was going about in her business and was going to her destination, whether it be her room in Veerasamy Road or elsewhere. AB`s evidence, on the other hand, was more consistent with the primary facts.
Next, there was the s 122(6) statement of the accused made in answer to the charge of rape. It was not in dispute that the accused made this statement voluntarily. What he disputed was the content of the statement. He said he did not tell AB that he was a policeman and that what he said was: `What if I were a policeman` and that was said in the context of asking AB if she was afraid when she said that she had brought gold and sarees to sell in Singapore. Both Inspector Deep Singh, the investigating officer, and B Jeyaletchumi, the interpreter, were called and were cross-examined on what the accused had said. The learned trial judge reached the following conclusion: 
 
The interpreter, Jeyaletchumi, was cross-examined and she said she could not remember if the accused`s version in court was what he told her on 24 January 1995. I have noted that the statement was translated by her `sentence by sentence`. However, she appeared to me to be unsure and was not prepared to say categorically that the accused`s version was not true or wrong. The accused impressed me as an honest witness and I am, therefore, giving him the benefit of the doubt. Furthermore, he did say explicitly, that he did not `force her or persuade` AB to have sex nor did he `beat or threaten` her. It is to be remembered that the charge (in P53) to which this statement relates alleges that he `put the said [AB] in fear of hurt to herself`.
 
 
 
With respect, we have difficulty in accepting this conclusion. First, Jeyaletchumi`s role was only that of a translator: translating what the accused said in Tamil into English, and vice versa. That statement was recorded on 24 January 1995. It is not possible to expect her to remember and testify in court some five months later whether the accused`s version in court was what he said to her in January 1995. Nor could she testify whether `categorically` or otherwise `that the accused`s version was not true or wrong`. All she could say, and did say, was that she translated what the accused said in Tamil into English. She said that the statement was recorded sentence by sentence and she translated sentence by sentence. She further testified that the statement was read back and translated to the accused and he did not indicate that he wished to make any correction. It is obvious to us that she relied on that statement to refresh her memory. We can find no basis for saying that the s 122(6) statement did not correctly record what the accused had said. Secondly, with regard to that part of the s 122(6) statement, which said: `I did not beat or threatened (sic) her`, it is an exculpatory statement, and the learned trial judge appeared to have accepted it presumably on the basis that the accused impressed him as an honest witness. Again, such evidence must be tested against the primary facts and other evidence before the court.
There is one aspect of the evidence of Inspector Deep Singh which corroborates the fact that the accused had misrepresented to AB that he was a policeman. After his arrest, the accused led Inspector Deep Singh to the spot at Changi Coast Road, where he said he pointed to AB the SIA Engineering Building as the building in which the Changi Airport Police Station was located and to which they would be going. The truth of this evidence had never been denied by the accused at any stage of the trial. If the accused had not misrepresented to AB that he was a policeman, it is irrelevant whether that building is where the police station is located and there is no purpose of their going there.
We now turn to another aspect of the evidence of AB and the accused. It was not disputed that AB had handed to the accused her passport and that the accused placed or kept it on the front dashboard on his side. The material question is when did this take place and the circumstances in which the passport was handed to the accused. AB`s evidence was that at the first encounter the accused said he was a police officer and demanded the passport and she handed it to him. The accused`s evidence, on the other hand, was that during the journey while they were travelling along East Coast Parkway, in the course of their conversation pertaining to AB making trips to and from India, AB on her own volition produced the passport and showed it to him; he looked at it and then placed it in front of the dashboard. If those were the circumstances in which the passport was produced the natural thing for him to do would be to return the passport to AB. There is no reason why AB in the midst of that conversation should on her own volition show him her passport and there is equally no reason why he should keep her passport. We again find the accused`s evidence difficult to accept and that AB`s evidence was more consistent with the uncontroverted facts and the other material evidence.
With great respect to the learned trial judge, on the whole we find AB`s evidence much closer to the truth. Our conclusion is that the accused at the first encounter must have told her that he was a policeman or an officer authorized to inspect her passport and must have demanded the production of her passport and that was the time when she handed her passport to him. Secondly, he must have ordered her to board the van on the pretext that he was a police officer and that he was bringing her in for further investigation, and in consequence she was compelled to do so by reason of the apparent authority held out by him.
We find that the accused had practised deception on her and had thereby induced her to board the van and travel with him which she otherwise would not have done so. That clearly was an act of abduction falling within the meaning of s 362 of the Penal Code, which defines abduction as follows: 
 
Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces any person to go from any place, is said to abduct that person.
 
 
 
The accused had by deceitful means induced AB to board the van and brought her all the way to a spot off Changi Coast Road, to which she otherwise would not have gone.
The facts here pertaining to abduction are somewhat similar to those in . There, a young woman who had been kidnapped managed to escape and was on her way to the police station when she met the accused. The latter enquired who she was and where she was going and on hearing that she had been kidnapped and had escaped, persuaded her to go home with him saying that he was a policeman and would escort her to the 
 thana 
. He took her to his house and locked her there. He then took an earring from her and with that he went to see her mother and promised to return the girl on payment of a sum of money. It was held that the accused was guilty of abduction under s 365 of the Indian Penal Code. Broadway J said at p 160: 
 
Now when the appellant met the girl she had ceased to be a kidnapped woman in the strict sense. She was then a free agent but she would not have gone with the appellant but for his false representations to her as to his being a police constable and the inducement held out by him that he would take her to the police station. His action therefore amounted to abduction as defined in s 362 IPC.
 
 
 
Next, the accused said in his evidence that he wanted to have sexual intercourse with her. He abducted her with the intent that she might be compelled or be forced to having illicit intercourse with him. In our opinion, on the evidence adduced the necessary ingredients of the offence under s 366 of the Penal Code have been established beyond any reasonable doubt. We find him guilty of the first charge.
We now turn to the second main issue: whether AB consented to having sexual intercourse with the accused. We revert once again to the evidence of the accused. His testimony was that he asked AB where she was going to which she replied that she was going to her room, and he then asked whether both of them could go to the room. She said her room was at Veerasamy Road. He thereupon asked her to board the van and she did so willingly. If that was true he would have driven her to her place of abode at Veerasamy Road and would have gone to the room to have sexual intercourse with her. That was what he wanted. That, however, was not what he did. He drove the van past Veerasamy Road and brought AB to a deserted vacant land off Changi Coast Road. Next, it was his evidence that after parking the van, he went and joined her in the rear compartment of the van. He then told AB that that was where they were going to have sexual intercourse and he asked her to undress. AB willingly undressed herself and to all intents and purposes was ready and willing to have sexual intercourse with him. Indeed, AB even went further: at his mere request she willingly performed the fellatio before they had sexual intercourse. Such evidence struck us as inherently incredible. It is inconceivable that AB, a mature woman of 44 years old - that was what the learned trial judge has found - would willingly participate in such sexual activities with a man such as the accused, a total stranger, in those circumstances. Even if AB was a prostitute or a woman of loose morals, there was no reason why she would do what she did without some prior discussion or negotiation as to her reward for such services. On that aspect there was not a shred of evidence coming from him. Nor was it his evidence that during the half an hour journey from Hampshire Road to Changi Coast Road he had succeeded in charming AB, so much so that when they arrived at Changi Coast Road she had become so close and warm towards him that she was prepared at his request or on his persuasion first to perform the fellatio and thereafter to have the sexual intercourse with him. To our mind, on the evidence before us, there was no reason why she would be so willing to engage in such sexual activities with him in the rear compartment of a van, which was stuffy, warm and uncomfortable, on an isolated spot off Changi Coast Road, in broad daylight at about 12 noon. The irresistible inference is that AB was forced to submit to these outrageous indignities at his hands out of fear. True it is that there was not a single scratch on either the accused or AB, and there was no weapon used. True also that there was no struggle or physical resistance on the part of AB. However, we need hardly say that the absence of injury on the victim of a rape, though a relevant consideration, is not fatal to the charge of rape. Authorities are in abundance on this point. We need to quote only two. In at p 2169 the High Court of Orissa said, at p 2169: 
 
10 In a case of rape, consent, if any, given by the victim must be voluntary. A mere act of helpless resignation in the face of inevitable compulsion, quiescence, non-resistance, or passive giving in, when volitional faculty is either clouded by fear or vitiated by duress, cannot be deemed to be `consent`. ... But as has been observed in the case of (1980) 4 SCC 262 [1980 Cri LJ 1344], the absence of injuries on the person of the victim girl may not be fatal to the prosecution and corroborative evidence may not be an imperative component of judicial credence in rape cases.
 
 
 
In at p 162, Coomaraswamy J said: 
 
It was argued that the absence of injury tended to show consent. That is true where an accused used physical force to get the victim to submit to sexual intercourse. There was no such allegation here. [The victim] was overawed into submission by the conduct of Teo, Sim and Ng, by the whereabouts of the events, a deserted quarry on a dark night and by the presence of three men outside the cabin when the fourth was alone with her. ...
 
 
 
On the evidence before us, it is not difficult to come to the conclusion that AB was overawed into submission by the conduct of the accused and the whereabouts of the crime. AB was brought to an isolated spot and was alone with the accused inside the rear compartment of the van. She was completely in his hands and was helpless. She could not possibly engage in an unarmed combat with the accused. She must have participated in all those sexual acts out of fear of the accused. The learned trial judge found AB a mature woman of 44 years old and that she is tall and heavy - a physique which the accused said appealed to him. That may be so. But the accused is no midget either. On the contrary, he too is tall and heavy (if not taller and heavier than AB), and from what we observe he is a burly young man of 27 years old with a very strong physique.
Evidence of AB`s conduct subsequent to the event was wholly consistent with and supported her evidence that she had been raped. Simon Tay`s evidence was that when he stopped his car to answer her call for help he found her to be `distressed and emotional` and that she kept uttering `police`. His wife, Siow Jin Hua, confirmed in substance what he said. Abdul Karim bin Senin, the first police officer AB saw, found her crying and he was unable to gather sufficient facts from her due to her emotional state. S/Sgt A R Rajagopal, who interviewed her over the telephone soon after she was brought to the police station, found her emotional and crying and managed to find out from her that she had been raped and robbed of a sum of $6000. ASP Teo, who interviewed her later, gathered that she had been raped and robbed and that she was very emotional and was sobbing during the interview.
Then there was the evidence of Dr Lai Sing Foo who examined AB some seven hours later and found her still crying during the questioning when she informed him that she had been raped and robbed. AB was apparently still in the state of anguish and distress.
If the evidence of AB is tested against all this evidence and the evidence of deception practised on her by the accused that he was a police officer and also against the incredible evidence of the accused, the conclusion is irresistible that she had been raped by the accused and had been put in fear of the accused.
The learned trial judge found it somewhat inexplicable that AB did not take the opportunity to escape when the van stopped at two or three times on the way to East Coast Parkway. With respect, we do not share that view. The explanation clearly is that until she was brought to the deserted vacant land, she was still under the impression that the accused was a police officer who had detained her passport and was bringing her in for questioning. There was therefore no reason for her to run away from a law enforcer. Indeed, on the basis of that belief to do so would be most inadvisable.
The learned trial judge`s acceptance of the accused`s evidence was based mainly on his impression of AB and the accused and the manner in which AB and the accused gave evidence. These factors are of course important and play a vital role in the determination of the veracity and credibility of their evidence. However, it is equally important to test their evidence against some objective facts and independent evidence. In at p 878 Yong Pung How CJ delivering the judgment of this court said: 
 
As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J in 
 
 
[1949] MLJ 88
  at p 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence.
 
 
 
It is also helpful to remind ourselves of what Ong Hock Thye FJ said in , at p 223: 
 
To avoid undue emphasis on demeanour, it may be well to remember what was said by Lord Wright, and often quoted, from his judgment in 
[1935] AC 243
, at p 267 of the possibility of judges being deceived by adroit or plausible knaves or by apparent innocence.
 
 
 
We now turn to the third main issue which relates to the charge of robbery. Here, we need only to revert to the evidence of the accused on how he took the money. He said that after the sexual intercourse with AB, while the latter was dressing, he noticed there was a knot tied to the saree. He had a look at it and found money in it. He took the money and put it in his pocket. AB attempted to snatch it back and in that attempt she ripped off part of his pocket and fell in a sitting position on the floorboard of the van. On that evidence, what he did was more than theft simpliciter; it was robbery. Robbery as defined in s 390(2) is as follows: 
 
Theft is `robbery` if, in order to commit theft, or in committing the theft, or in carrying away or attempting to carry away property obtained by the theft, the offender, for that end, voluntarily causes or attempts to cause to any person death, or hurt, or wrongful restraint, or fear of instant death, or of instant hurt, or of instant wrongful restraint. ...
 
 
 
Purely on his evidence the ingredients of the offence of robbery have been established. Certain degree of force must have been used by him on her to restrain her from getting back her money, which accounted for the ripping off of his pocket and her fall onto the floorboard. She did not persist in making a further attempt to get back her money and the reason was obviously that she was in fear of him. Bearing in mind that first he had forced her to submit to the sexual indignities and secondly he took her money by force the irresistible inference is that he must have caused her fear of further hurt to herself when he took her money. In our judgment, what the accused did in the circumstances amounted to robbery. We find him guilty of the charge.
In the result, we allow the appeal and set aside the order made by the learned trial judge on the charges of abduction, rape and robbery. We convict the accused of the first charge of abduction under s 366, the third charge of rape under s 376(2)(b) and the fourth charge of robbery under s 392.
